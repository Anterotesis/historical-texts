         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

matter</hi> of my preſent pains,
I have, I think, ſpoke enough
in the inſuing <hi>Preface.</hi> Concerning the
choice of my Patron, I ſhall ſay no more,
then that the ſole inducement thereto, was
his ſingular Learning and Piety. The
former of which, is ſo conſpicuous to the
world, that it is univerſally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all; and for the latter, there is none
that can be ignorant thereof, who has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the happineſs, though but in a
ſmaller meaſure, of his more free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<pb facs="tcp:115236:3"/>
converſe. As for my own part,
I cannot but publickly profeſs, I never
met with any yet ſo truly and becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
religious, where the right knowledge
of God and Chriſt bears the inlightned
minde ſo even, that it is as far removed
from <hi>Superſtition</hi> as <hi>Irreligion</hi> it ſelf. And
my preſent Labours cannot finde better
welcome or more judicious acceptance
with any, then with ſuch as theſe. For
ſuch free and unprejudiced ſpirits will
neither antiquate Truth for the oldneſſe
of the Notion, nor ſlight her for looking
young, or bearing the face of Novelty.
Beſides, there are none that can be better
aſſured of the ſincerity and efficacy of my
preſent Deſigne. For as many as are
born of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and are not meer ſons
of the <hi>Letter,</hi> know very well how much
the more inward and myſterious mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Text makes for the reverence
of the holy Scripture, and advantage of
Godlineſſe, when as the urging of the
bare <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, has either made or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb facs="tcp:115236:3"/>
many an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> And aſſuredly
thoſe men ſee very little in the affairs of
Religion, that do not plainly diſcover,
that it is the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> higheſt <hi>intereſt,</hi> to have
it taken for granted, that there is no <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
meaning, either in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that extends further then the meer
Grammatical ſenſe in the one, or the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
groſſe, external performance in the
other. As for example, That to be <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,</hi>
and become a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real Chriſtian,</hi>
is nothing elſe, but to receive the <hi>outward
Baptiſme</hi> of viſible water: And, that the
<hi>Moſaical Philoſophy</hi> concerning God, and
the nature of things, is none other, then
that which moſt obviouſly offers it ſelf
in the meer <hi>letter</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Which if the
<hi>Atheiſt</hi> could have fully granted to him on
all ſides, and get but this in alſo to the
bargain, That there is no knowledge of
God, but what <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text ſet on foot
in the world, or what is <hi>Traditional,</hi> he
cannot but think, that Religion in this
dreſſe, is ſo empty, exceptionable, and
<pb facs="tcp:115236:4"/>
contemptible, that it is but juſt with as
many as are not meer fools, to look upon
it as ſome <hi>melancholick conceit,</hi> or <hi>cunning
fiction</hi> brought into the world, to awe
the ſimpler ſort, but behinde the <hi>hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
to be freely <hi>laughed</hi> at, and derided by
thoſe that are more wiſe; And that it
were an eaſie thing in a ſhort time to
raze the memory of it out of the mindes
of men, it having ſo little root in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
faculties. Which for my own
part I think as hopeful, as that poſterity
will be born without eyes and ears, and
loſe the uſe of ſpeech. For I think the
knowledge of God, and a ſenſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is as natural and eſſential to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
as any other property in them
whatſoever: And that the generations
of men ſhall as ſoon become utterly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
as plainly irreligious. Which,
I think, my late <hi>Treatiſe againſt Atheiſme</hi> wil
make good to any one, that with care
and judgement will peruſe it.</p>
                  <p>Nor does it at all follow, becauſe a
<pb facs="tcp:115236:4"/>
truth is delivered by way of <hi>Tradition,</hi> that
it is unconcludable by <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For I do
not know any one <hi>Theorem</hi> in all <hi>Natural
Philoſophy,</hi> that has more ſufficient reaſons
for it, then the <hi>motion of the Earth,</hi> which
notwithſtanding is part of the <hi>Philoſophick
Cabbala</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as I ſhall
plainly ſhew in its due <hi>place.</hi> So likewiſe
for the <hi>prae-exiſtency of the Soul,</hi> which
ſeems to have been part of the ſame <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
it is abundantly conſentaneous to
Reaſon: And as we can give a genuine
account of all thoſe ſeeming irregularities
of motion in the Planets, ſuppoſing, they
&amp; the Earth move round about the Sun:
ſo we may open the cauſes of all thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing
<hi>Paradoxes</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> from
this other <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and ſhow that there
is nothing here unſutable to the precious
<hi>Attributes of God,</hi> if we could place the eye
of our underſtanding in that Center of
all free motions, that <hi>ſteady eternal Good,</hi> &amp;
were not our ſelves carried aloof off from
him, amongſt other wandring Planets,
<pb facs="tcp:115236:5"/>
(as S. <hi>Jude</hi> calls them) that at ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
play about him, &amp; yet all of them
in ſome meaſure or other, not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to him, but whether they pretend
or not, really receiving ſomething from
him. For of this <hi>Firſt,</hi> is all, both <hi>Wiſdome,
Pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> But it is enough to
have but hinted theſe things briefly and
enigmatically, the wrath and ignorance
of all Ages receiving the moſt generous
Truths, with the greateſt offence.</p>
                  <p>But for my own part, I know no reaſon
but that all wel-willers to Truth &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
ſhould heartily thank me for my
preſent <hi>Cabbaliſtical Enterpriſe,</hi> I having ſo
plainly therein vindicated the holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> from being (as a very
bold Sect would have it) a meer <hi>Pagan</hi>
invention. For it is plainly ſhown here,
that it is from <hi>Moſes</hi> originally, not from
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi> And ſeeing that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is nothing but <hi>Moſes</hi> unveiled, I think it
was a ſpecial act of Providence that this
hidden <hi>Cabbala</hi> came ſo ſeaſonably to the
<pb facs="tcp:115236:5"/>
knowledge of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that it might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
fit them for the eaſier entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Myſtery of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
when in the fulneſs of time it ſhould
be more clearly revealed unto the world.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, we have alſo ſhown, That
according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> the ſoul
is ſecure both from <hi>death,</hi> and from <hi>ſleep</hi>
after <hi>death,</hi> which thoſe drowſie <hi>Nodders</hi>
over the letter of the Scripture have very
oſcitantly collected, and yet as boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
maintained, pretending that
the contrary, is more <hi>Platonical,</hi> then <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi>
or <hi>Scriptural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore my deſigne being ſo pious
as it proves, I could do nothing more fit
then to make choice of ſo true a lover of
Piety as your ſelf for a Patron of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Labours. Eſpecially you being ſo
well able to do the moſt proper office of
a Patron; to defend the truth that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to you in them, &amp; to make up out
of your rich Treaſury of Learning, what
our Penury could not reach to, or Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
<pb facs="tcp:115236:6"/>
may have omitted. And truly, if
I may not hope this from you, I know
not whence to expect it. For I do not
know where to meet with any ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
and fully accompliſhed in all
parts of Learning as your ſelf, as well in
the <hi>Oriental</hi> Tongues and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as in
all the choiceſt kindes of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> Any
one of which <hi>Acquiſitions</hi> is enough to fill,
if not ſwell, an ordinary man with great
conceit and pride, when as it is your ſole
privilege, to have them all, and yet not
to take upon you, nor to be any thing
more imperious, or cenſorious of others,
then they ought to be that know the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the true conſiderations

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Preſent thee here with a triple Interpretation
of the three firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which in
my Title Page I have tearmed a threefold <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala;</hi>
concerning which, for thy better direction
and ſatisfaction, I hold it not amiſſe to ſpeak ſome
few things by way of Preface, ſuch as thou thy ſelf in
all likelihood wouldſt be forward to ask of me. As;
why, for example, I call this Interpretation of mine
<pb facs="tcp:115236:7"/>
a <hi>Cabbala,</hi> and from whom I received it; what
may be the prohabilities of the truth of it; and what
my purpoſe is in publiſhing of it.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt I anſwer; That the Jewiſh <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
is conceived to be a Traditional Doctrine or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Pentateuch which <hi>Moſes</hi> received from
the mouth of God, while he was on the Mount with
him. And this ſenſe or interpretation of the Law or
Pentateuch, as it is a doctrine received by <hi>Moſes</hi>
firſt, and then from him by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and from <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>
by the ſeventy <hi>Elders,</hi> and ſo on, it was called
<hi>Cabbala</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>kibbel</hi> to receive: But as it
was delivered as well as received, it was alſo called
<hi>Maſſora,</hi> which ſignifies a Tradition; though this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more properly reſpects that Critical and Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
skill of the Learned among the Jews, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was profitable for the explaining the literal ſenſe
as well as that more myſterious meaning of the Text
where it was intended. Whence without any bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or abuſe of the word I may call the <hi>Literal</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
which I have light upon <hi>Cabbala,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Philoſophical</hi> or <hi>Moral;</hi> the literal ſenſe it
ſelf being not ſo plain and determinate, but that it
may ſeem to require ſome Traditional Doctrine or
Expoſition to ſettle it, as well as thoſe other ſenſes that
are more myſtical.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I thought fit to call this threefold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
that I have hit upon, <hi>Cabbala's,</hi> as if
I had indeed light upon the true <hi>Cabbala</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>
in all the three ſenſes of the Text, ſuch as might have
become his own mouth to have uttered for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:115236:7"/>
of a willing and well prepared Diſciple. And
therefore for the greater comelineſſe and ſolemnity
of the matter, I bring in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking his own
minde in all the three ſeveral Expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>And yet I call the whole Interpretation but a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,</hi>
having no deſire to ſeem more definitively
wiſe then others can bear or approve of. For though
in ſuch things as are neceſſary and eſſential to the
happineſſe of a man, as the belief that there is a God,
and the like; it is not ſufficient for a man only to bring
undeniable reaſons for what he would prove, but alſo
to profeſſe plainly and dogmatically, that himſelf
gives full aſſent to the concluſion he hath demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
So that thoſe that do not ſo well underſtand the
power of reaſon, may notwithſtanding thereby be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to be of the ſame faith with them that do, it
being of ſo great conſequence to them to believe the
thing propounded: Yet I conceive that Speculative
and Diſpenſable Truths a man not onely may, but
ought rather to propound them Sceptically to the
world, there being more prudence and modeſty in
offering the ſtrongeſt arguments he can without dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing
at all, or ſeeming to dote upon the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or more earneſtly to affect the winning of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes
to his own opinion. For where the force of
the arguments is perceived, aſſent will naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
according to the proportion of the diſcovery of the
force of the arguments. And an aſſent to opinions
meerly ſpeculative, without the reaſons of them, is
neither any pleaſure nor accompliſhment of a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115236:8"/>
To your ſecond demand, I anſwer; That though I
call this Interpretation of mine <hi>Cabbala,</hi> yet I
muſt confeſſe I received it neither from Man nor
Angel. Nor came it to me by divine Inſpiration,
unleſſe you will be ſo wiſe as to call the ſeaſonable
ſuggeſtions of that divine Life and Senſe that vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
reſides in the Rational Spirit of free and well
meaning Chriſtians, by the name of Inſpiration. But
ſuch Inſpiration as this is no diſtracter from, but an
accompliſher and an enlarger of humane faculties.
And I may adde, that this is the great myſtery of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
that we are called to partake of, <hi>viz.</hi> The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the humane nature by participation of the
divine. Which cannot be underſtood ſo properly of
this groſſe fleſh and external ſenſes, as of the inward
humanity, <hi>viz.</hi> our Intellect, Reaſon, and Fancie. But
to exclude the uſe of Reaſon in the ſearch of divine
truth, is no dictate of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of headſtrong
<hi>Melancholy</hi> and blinde <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
frenſie men run into, by lying paſsive for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of ſuch impreſſes as have no proportion with
their faculties. Which miſtake and irregularity, if
they can once away with, they put themſelves in a
poſture of promiſcuouſly admitting any thing, and ſo
in due time of growing either moped or mad, and
under pretence of being highly Chriſtians, (the right
myſtery whereof they underſtand not) of working
themſelves lower then the loweſt of men.</p>
                  <p>But for mine own part, Reaſon ſeems to me to be
ſo far from being any contemptible Principle in man,
that it muſt be acknowledged in ſome ſort to be in God
<pb facs="tcp:115236:8"/>
himſelf. For what is the divine wiſdome, but that
ſteady comprehenſion of the <hi>Ideas</hi> of all things, with
their mutual reſpects one to another, congruities and
incongruities, dependences and independences; which
reſpects do neceſſarily ariſe from the natures of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi>
themſelves, both which the divine Intellect looks
through at once, diſcerning thus the order and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of all things. And what is this but <hi>Ratio ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis,</hi>
a kinde of ſteady and immovable reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the connexion of all things at once? But
that in us is <hi>Ratio mobilis,</hi> or reaſon in evolution,
we being able to apprehend things onely in a ſucceſsive
manner one after another. But ſo many as we can
comprehend at a time, while we plainly perceive and
carefully view their <hi>Ideas,</hi> we know how well they fit,
or how much they diſagree one with another, and ſo
prove or diſprove one thing by another; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a participation of that divine reaſon in God, and
is a true and faithful principle in man, when it is
perfected and poliſhed by the holy Spirit. But before,
very earthly and obſcure, eſpecially in ſpiritual things.</p>
                  <p>But now ſeeing the <hi>Logos</hi> or ſteady comprehenſive
wiſdom of God, in which all <hi>Ideas</hi> and their reſpects
are contained, is but <hi>univerſal ſtable reaſon,</hi> how can
there be any pretence of being ſo highly inſpired as
to be blown above reaſon it ſelf, unleſſe men will fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
themſelves wiſer then God, or their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
above the natures and reaſons of things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to frame a brief anſwer to your ſecond
demand; I ſay, this <hi>threefold Cabbala</hi> you enquire
<pb facs="tcp:115236:9"/>
after, is the dictate of the free reaſon of my minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
heedfully conſidering the written Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
carefully canvaſing the Expoſitions of ſuch Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as are ordinarily to be had upon him. And I
know nothing to the contrary, but that I have been ſo
ſucceſſeful as to have light upon the old true <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
indeed.</p>
                  <p>Of which in the third place I will ſet down ſome
general probabilities, referring you for the reſt to the
Defence of the <hi>Cabbala's</hi> themſelves, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction</hi>
thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And firſt that the Literal <hi>Cabbala</hi> is true, it is
no contemptible argument, in that it is carried on ſo
evenly and conſiſtently one part with another, every
thing alſo being repreſented ſo accommodately to the
capacity of the people, and ſo advantageouſly for
the keeping of their mindes in the fear of God, and
obedience to his law, as ſhall be particularly ſhown
in the Defence of that <hi>Cabbala.</hi> So that according
to the ſenſe of this Literal <hi>Cabbala, Moſes</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to be a man of the higheſt Political accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
and true and warrantable prudence that
may be.</p>
                  <p>Nor is he to fall ſhort in Philoſophy; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Philoſophical <hi>Cabbala</hi> contains the nobleſt
Truths, as well Theological as Natural, that the
minde of man can entertain her ſelf with; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to have been aforehand, and
prevented the ſubtileſt and abſtruſeſt inventions of
the choiceſt Philoſophers that ever appeared after him
to this very day. And further preſumption of the
<pb facs="tcp:115236:9"/>
truth of this Philoſophical <hi>Cabbala</hi> is; that the
grand myſteries therein contained are moſt-what
the ſame that thoſe two eximious Philoſophers <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
and <hi>Plato</hi> brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
the parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe.</hi> And it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
acknowledged by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they both
had their Philoſophy from <hi>Moſes.</hi> And <hi>Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> ſpeaks out plainly concerning
his Maſter; What is <hi>Plato</hi> but <hi>Moſes Atticus?</hi>
And for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> it is a thing incredible that
he and his followers ſhould make ſuch a deal of doe
with the myſtery of Numbers, had he not been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with a ſight of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Creation of the
world in ſix days, and had the Philoſophick <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
thereof communicated to him, which mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in Numbers, as I ſhall in the Defence of this
<hi>Cabbala</hi> more particularly declare.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> oath ſwearing by him
that taught them the myſtery of the <hi>Tetractys,</hi> or
the number Four, what a ridiculous thing had it
been if it had been in reference meerly to dry Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
But it is exceeding probable that under
that myſtery of Four, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was firſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
taught the meaning of the fourth days work in
the Creation, and after delivered it to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
In which <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the fourth day <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
was inſtructed, amongſt other things, that
the Earth was a Planet, and moved about the Sun;
and it is notoriouſly well known, that this was ever
the opinion of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and ſo in all
<pb facs="tcp:115236:10"/>
likelihood a part of the Philoſophick <hi>Cabbala</hi> of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> Which you will more fully underſtand
in my <hi>Defence</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>In brief, all thoſe concluſions that are compriſed
in the Philoſophick <hi>Cabbala,</hi> they being ſuch as
may beſt become that ſublime and comprehenſive
underſtanding of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and being alſo ſo plainly
anſwerable to the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, as wel as continuedly agreeable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any force or diſtortion to the Hiſtorical Text;
this I conceive is no ſmall probability that this
<hi>Cabbala</hi> is true: For what can be the properties
of the true Philoſophick <hi>Cabbala</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if
theſe be not which I have named?</p>
                  <p>Now for the Moral <hi>Cabbala</hi> it bears its own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
with it all the way, repreſenting <hi>Moſes</hi>
as well experienced in all <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> and <hi>Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi>
as he was skilful in <hi>Politicks</hi> and <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the edifying uſefulneſſe of this Myſtical or
Moral <hi>Cabbala,</hi> to anſwer to your laſt demand,
was no ſmall invitation amongſt the reſt to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
this preſent Expoſition. For Moral and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Truth that ſo neerly concerns us being ſo
ſtrangely and unexpectedly, and yet ſo fitly and
appoſitely repreſented in this Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it
will in all likelihood make the more forcible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
upon the minde, and more powerfully carry
away our affections toward what is good and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,
pre-inſtructing us with delight concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:115236:10"/>
the true way to Virtue and Godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the Philoſophick nor Literal <hi>Cabbala's</hi>
deſtitute of their honeſt uſes. For in the former to
the amazement of the meer <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> (who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
conceits that pious men and Patrons of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
have no ornaments of minde but ſcrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about virtue, and melancholy fancies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Deity) <hi>Moſes</hi> is found to have been Maſter
of the moſt ſublime and generous ſpeculations that
are in all Natural Philoſophy: beſides that he
places the ſoul of man many degrees out of the reach
of fate and mortality. And by the latter there is
a very charitable proviſion made for them that are
ſo prone to expect rigid precepts of Philoſophy in
<hi>Moſes</hi> his outward Text. For this Literal <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala</hi>
will ſteer them off from that toil of endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make the bare letter ſpeak conſonantly to the
true frame of nature: Which while they attempt
with more zeal then knowledge, they both diſgrace
themſelves and wrong <hi>Moſes.</hi> For there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
and indeleble <hi>Idea's</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> in the
minde of man, into which when we are awakened
and apply to the known courſe and order of nature,
we can no more forſake the uſe of them then we can
the uſe of our own eyes, nor misbelieve their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
no more, nor ſo much, as we may thoſe of our
outward ſenſes. Wherefore to men recovered into
a due command of their reaſon, and well-skill'd
in the contemplation and experience of the nature
of things, to propound to them ſuch kinde of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115236:11"/>
Philoſophy, as the boldneſſe and ſuperſtition
of ſome has adventured to do for want of a right
Literal <hi>Cabbala</hi> to guide them, is as much as in
them lies, to hazard the making not only of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
but of <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf contemptible and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
                  <p>Whence it is apparent enough, I think, to what
good purpoſe it is thus carefully to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Literal and Philoſophick <hi>Cabbala,</hi> and
ſo plainly and fully to ſet out the ſenſe of either, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
by themſelves, that there may hereafter be
no confuſion or miſtake. For beſide that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of theſe weighty Truths, and high, but ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refutable
Paradoxes, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text, does aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
Religion, and vindicate her from that vile
imputation of ignorance in Philoſophy and the
knowledge of things, ſo does it alſo juſtifie thoſe
more noble reſults of free Reaſon and Philoſophy
from that vulgar ſuſpicion of Impiety and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>1 WEE are to recount to you in
this Book the Generations and
Genealogies of the Patriarchs
from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and to continue the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115236:12"/>
Hiſtory to our own times. But it will not be
amiſſe firſt to inform you concerning the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the world, and the original and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of things; How God made Heaven
and Earth, and all the garniſhings of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made Man.</p>
                     <p>2 But the Earth at firſt was but a rude and
deſolate heap, devoid of herbs, flowers, and
trees, and all living creatures, being nothing
but a deep miry abyſſe, covered all over with
waters, and there was a very fierce and ſtrong
wind that blew upon the waters; and what
made it ſtill more horrid and comfortleſs, there
was as yet no light, but all was inveloped with
thick darkneſſe, and bore the face of a pitchy
black and wet tempeſtuous night.</p>
                     <p>3 But God let not his work lie long in this
ſad condition, but commanded Light to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and the morning brake out upon the face
of the abyſs, and wheel'd about from Eaſt to
Weſt, being cleareſt in the middle of its courſe
about noon, and then abating of its brightneſſe
towards the Weſt, at laſt quite diſ-appear'd,
after ſuch ſort as you may often obſerve the
day-light to break forth in the Eaſt, and ripen
to greater clearneſſe, but at laſt to leave the
skie in the Weſt, no Sun appearing all the
while.</p>
                     <p>4. And God ſaw the Light, (for it is a thing
very viſible) that it was good, and ſo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115236:12"/>
the darkneſſe from the light, that they
could not both of them be upon the face of the
earth together, but had their viciſſitudes, and
took their turns one after another.</p>
                     <p>5 And he called the return of the light Day,
and the return of darkneſs he called Night;
and the evening and the morning made up
the firſt natural day.</p>
                     <p>6. Now after God had made this <hi>Baſis</hi> or
floor of this greater edifice of the world,
the Earth, he ſets upon the higher parts of the
fabrick. He commands therefore that there
ſhould be a hollow <hi>expanſion,</hi> firm and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
which by its ſtrength ſhould bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the waters which are above, and keep
them from falling upon the earth in exceſs.</p>
                     <p>7. And ſo it became a partition betwixt the
upper &amp; the lower waters; ſo that by virtue of
this hollow <hi>Firmament,</hi> man might live ſafe
from the violence of ſuch deſtructive inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as one ſheltred in a well-pitch'd tent from
ſtorm of rain: For the danger of theſe waters
is apparent to the eye, this ceruleous or blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured
Sea, that over-ſpreads the diaphanous
<hi>Firmament,</hi> being eaſily diſcern'd through the
body thereof; and there are very frequent and
copious ſhowers of rain deſcend from above,
when as there is no water eſpyed aſcending up
thither; wherefore it muſt all come from that
upper Sea, if we do but appeal to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:115236:13"/>
8 Now therefore this diaphanous Canopy
or firmly ſtretched Tent over the whole pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the earth, though I cannot ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
that God ſaw it was good, it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of a nature inviſible, yet the uſe of it
ſhows it to be exceeding good and neceſſary.
And God called the whole capacity of this
hollow <hi>Firmament,</hi> Heaven. And the evening
and the morning made up the ſecond natural
day.</p>
                     <p>9 And now ſo ſure a Defence being made
againſt the inundation of the upper waters,
that they might not fall upon the earth, God
betook himſelf the next day to order the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
waters, that as yet were ſpread over the
whole face thereof; at his command therefore
the waters fled into one place, and the dry
land did appear.</p>
                     <p>10 And God called the dry land Earth; and
the gathering together of the waters he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Sea: and I may now properly ſay, that
God ſaw that it was good, for the Sea and the
Land are things viſible enough, and fit objects
of our ſight.</p>
                     <p>11 And forthwith before he made either
Sun, Moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Stars, did God command the
earth to bring forth graſſe, herbs and flowers,
in their full beauty, and fruit-trees, yeilding
delicious fruit, though there had as yet been
no viciſſitude of Spring, Summer, or Autumn,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115236:13"/>
nor any approach of the Sun to ripen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct
the fruit of thoſe trees. Whence you may
eaſily diſcern the fooliſhneſſe of the idolatrous
Nations, that dote ſo much on ſecond cauſes,
as that they forget the firſt, aſcribing that to
the Sun and Moon, that was caus'd at firſt by
the immediate command of God.</p>
                     <p>12 For at his command it was, before there
was either Sun or Moon in the Firmament,
that the earth brought forth graſſe, and herb
yeilding ſeed after his kind, and the tree yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fruit, whoſe ſeed was in it ſelf, after his
kinde; ſo that the ſeveral ſorts of plants might
by this means be conſerv'd upon the earth.
And God ſaw that it was good.</p>
                     <p>13 And the evening and the morning made
up the third natural day.</p>
                     <p>14 There have three days paſt without a
Sun, as well as three nights without either
Moon or Stars, as you your ſelves may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
have obſerv'd ſome number of Moonleſs
and Starleſſe nights, as well as of Sunleſſe days,
to have ſucceeded one another: and ſo it might
have been always, had not God ſaid, Let there
be Lights within the <hi>Firmament</hi> of heaven, to
make a difference betwixt day and night, and
to be peculiar garniſhings of either. Let
them be alſo for ſignes of weather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſeaſons
of the year, and alſo for periods of days,
months, and years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115236:14"/>
15 Moreover, let them be as lights hung
up within the hollow roof or <hi>Firmament</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to give light to men walking upon the
pavement of the earth: and it was ſo.</p>
                     <p>16 And God made two great lights; the
greater one, the moſt glorious &amp; Princely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
we can ſee by day, to be as it were the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
and Monarch of the day; the leſſer, the
moſt reſplendent and illuſtrious ſight we can
caſt our eyes on by night, to be Governeſſe
and Queen of the night. And he made, though
for their ſmalneſſe they be not ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Stars alſo.</p>
                     <p>17 And he placed them all in the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of heaven, to give light upon the earth.</p>
                     <p>18 And to ſhew their preheminence for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
luſtre, above what ever elſe appears by
either day or night, and to be peculiar garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
or ornaments to make a notable difference
betwixt the light and the darkneſſe, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addition
of the Sun to adorn the day, and to
invigorate the light thereof, the Moon and the
Stars to garniſh the night, and to mitigate
the dulneſſe and darkneſſe thereof. And God
ſaw that it was good.</p>
                     <p>19 And the evening and the morning was
the fourth natural day.</p>
                     <p>20 After this, God commanded the waters
to bring forth fiſh and fowl, which they did
in abundance, and the fowl flew above the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115236:14"/>
earth in the open <hi>Firmament</hi> of heaven.</p>
                     <p>21 And God created great whales alſo as
well as other fiſhes, that move in the waters;
and God ſaw that it was good.</p>
                     <p>22 And God bleſſed them, ſaying, Be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and multiply, and fill the waters in the ſeas,
and let the fowl multiply on the earth.</p>
                     <p>23 And the evening and the morning made
up the fifth natural day.</p>
                     <p>24 Then God commanded the earth to
bring forth all creeping things, and four foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beaſts, as before he commanded the waters
to ſend forth fiſh and fowl; and it was ſo.</p>
                     <p>25 And when God had made the beaſt of
the earth after his kinde, and cattel, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creeping thing after his kinde, he ſaw that
it was good.</p>
                     <p>26 And coming at laſt to his higheſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece,
Man, he encouraged himſelf, ſaying,
Go to, let us now make man, and I will make
him after the ſame image and ſhape that I bear
my ſelf; and he ſhall have dominion over the
fiſh of the Sea, and over the fowls of the Air,
and over the cattel, and over all the earth, and
over every creeping thing, that creepeth upon
the earth.</p>
                     <p>27 So God created man in his own ſhape
and figure, with an upright ſtature, with legs,
hands, arms, with a face and mouth, to ſpeak,
and command, as God himſelf hath: I ſay, in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115236:15"/>
the image of God did he thus create him. But
miſtake me not, whereas you conceive of God
as maſculine, and more perfect, yet you muſt
not underſtand me, as if God made mankinde
ſo exactly after his own image, that he made
none but males; for I tell you, he made fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
as well as males, as you ſhall hear more
particularly hereafter.</p>
                     <p>28 And having made them thus male and
female, he bad them make uſe of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſexes that he had given them; and
bleſſing them, God ſaid unto them, Be fruitful
and multiply, and fill the earth with your off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
and be lords thereof, and have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
alſo over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the
fowls of the air, as well as over beaſts and
cattel, and every creeping thing that moves
upon the earth.</p>
                     <p>29 And God ſaid, Behold, I give you eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
frugiferous herb which is upon the face of
the earth, ſuch as the Straw-berry, the ſeveral
ſorts of Corn, as Rye, Wheat, and Rice, as
alſo the delicious fruits of Trees, to you they
ſhall be for meat.</p>
                     <p>30 But for the beaſts of the earth, and the
fowls of the air, and for every living thing that
creepeth upon the earth, the worſer kind of
herbs, and ordinary graſſe, I have aſſign'd for
them: and ſo it came to paſſe that mankinde
are made lords and poſſeſſors of the choiceſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115236:15"/>
fruits of the earth, and the beaſts of the field
are to be contented with baſer herbage, and the
common graſſe.</p>
                     <p>31 And God viewed all the works that he
had made, and behold, they were exceeding
good; and the evening and the morning was
the ſixt natural day.</p>

3 And ſo made the ſeventh day an holy
day, a feſtival of reſt, becauſe himſelf then
firſt reſted from his works. Whence you
plainly ſee the reaſon and original of your Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths.</p>
                     <p>4 Theſe are the generations of the heavens
and of the earth, which I have ſo compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
recounted to you, as they were created
in the days that the Lord made heaven and
earth, and the ſeveral garniſhings of them.</p>
                     <p>5 But there are ſome things that I would a
little more fully touch upon, and give you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, to the praiſe of God, and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of his power unto you. As that the
herbs and plants of the field did not come up
of their own accords out of the earth, before
God made them, but that God created them
before there were any ſeeds of any ſuch thing
in the earth, and before there was any rain, or
men to uſe gardning or husbandry, for the
procuring their growth: So that hereafter
you may have the more firm faith in God, for
the bleſſings and fruits of the earth, when the
ordinary courſe of nature ſhall threaten dearth
and ſcarcity for want of rain and ſeaſonable
ſhowers.</p>
                     <p>6 For there had been no ſhowers when God
cauſed the plants, and herbs of the field to
ſpring up out of the earth; onely as I told you
at the firſt of all, there was a mighty torrent of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115236:16"/>
water, that roſe every where above the earth,
and cover'd the univerſal face of the ground,
which yet, God afterward by his almighty
power, commanded ſo into certain bounds,
that the reſidue of the earth was meer dry
land.</p>
                     <p>7 And that you farther may underſtand
how the power of God is exalted above the
courſe of natural cauſes, God taking of the
the duſt of his dry ground, wrought it with
his hands into ſuch a temper, that it was matter
fit to make the body of a Man: which when he
firſt had fram'd, was as yet but like a ſenſleſſe
ſtatue, till coming near unto it with his mouth,
he breath'd into the noſtrils thereof the breath
of life; as you may obſerve to this day, that
men breath through their noſtrils, though their
mouths be clos'd. And thus man became a
living creature, and his name was called <hi>Adam,</hi>
becauſe he was made of the earth.</p>
                     <p>8 But I ſhould have told you firſt more at
large, how the Lord God planted a Garden
Eaſtward of <hi>Judea</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Eden,</hi>
about <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where afterwards he put
the man <hi>Adam,</hi> whom he after this wiſe had
form'd.</p>
                     <p>9 And the deſcription of this Garden is
this: Out of the ground made the Lord God
to grow every Tree that is pleaſant to the
ſight, and good for food. But amongſt theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115236:17"/>
ſeveral ſorts of Trees, there were two of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
notice, that ſtood planted in the midſt
of the Garden; the one of which had fruit of
that wonderful virtue, as to continue youth
and ſtrength, and to make a man immortal
upon earth, wherefore it was call'd the <hi>Tree of
Life.</hi> There was alſo another Tree planted
there, of whoſe fruit if a man ate, it had this
ſtrange effect, that it would make a man know
the difference betwixt good and evil; for the
Lord God had ſo ordain'd, that if <hi>Adam</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the forbidden fruit thereof, he ſhould
by his diſobedience feel the ſenſe of evil as
well as good; wherefore by way of Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it was called the <hi>Tree of knowledge of good
and evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10 And there was a River went out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
to water the Garden, and from thence it
was parted, and became into four heads.</p>
                     <p>11 The name of the firſt was <hi>Phaſis,</hi> or
<hi>Phaſi-Tigris,</hi> which compaſſes the whole Land
of the <hi>Chaulateans,</hi> where there is Gold.</p>
                     <p>12 And the Gold of that Land is excellent;
there is alſo found <hi>Bdellium</hi> and the <hi>Onyx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>13 And the name of the ſecond River is <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi>
the ſame is it that compaſſeth the whole
Land of the <hi>Arabian-Aethiopia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14 And the name of the third River is <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris,</hi>
that is that which goeth towards the Eaſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115236:17"/>
of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and the fourth River is <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15 And the Lord God took the man <hi>Adam</hi>
by the hand, and led him into the Garden of
<hi>Eden,</hi> and laid commands upon him to dreſſe
it, and look to it, and to keep things handſome
and in order in it, and that it ſhould not be any
wiſe ſpoil'd or miſus'd by incurſions or careleſs
ramblings of the heedleſſe beaſts.</p>
                     <p>16 And the Lord God recommended unto
<hi>Adam</hi> all the Trees of the Garden for very
wholeſome and delightful food, bidding him
freely eat thereof.</p>
                     <p>17 Only he excepted the <hi>Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil,</hi> which he ſtrictly charg'd him
to forbear, for if he ever taſted thereof, he
ſhould aſſuredly die.</p>
                     <p>18 But to the high commendation of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
be it ſpoken, though God had placed
<hi>Adam</hi> in ſo delightful a Paradiſe, yet his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
was but maimed and imperfect, till he
had the ſociety of a woman: For the Lord
God ſaid, It is not good that man ſhould be
alone, I will make him an help meet for him.</p>
                     <p>19 Now out of the ground the Lord God
had form'd every beaſt of the field, and every
fowl of the air, and theſe brought he unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
to ſee what he would call them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<hi>Adam</hi> called every living creature, that
was the name thereof.</p>
                     <p>20 And <hi>Adam</hi> gave names to all cattel, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115236:18"/>
to the fowls of the air, and to every beaſt of
the field, but he could not ſo kindly take ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with any of theſe, or ſo fully
enjoy their ſociety, but there was ſtill ſome
conſiderable matter wanting to make up <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
full felicity, and there was a meet help to
be found out for him.</p>
                     <p>21 Wherefore the Lord God caus'd a deep
ſleep to fall upon <hi>Adam;</hi> &amp; lo, as he ſlept upon
the ground, he fell into a dream, how God had
put his hand into his ſide, and pulled out one
of his ribs, cloſing up the fleſh in ſtead thereof:</p>
                     <p>22 And how the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from him, was made into a woman,
and how God when he had thus made her, took
her by the hand, and brought her unto him.
And he had no ſooner awakened, but he found
his dream to be true, for God ſtood by him
with the woman in his hand which he had
brought.</p>
                     <p>23 Wherefore <hi>Adam</hi> being pre-advertiſed
by the viſion, was preſently able to pronounce,
This is now bone of my bone, and fleſh of my
fleſh: What are the reſt of the creatures to
this? And he beſtowed upon her alſo a fitting
name, calling her <hi>Woman,</hi> becauſe ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>24 And the Lord God ſaid, Thou haſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
well, <hi>Adam:</hi> And for this cauſe ſhall a
man leave his father and mother, and ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115236:18"/>
cleave unto his wife, and they two ſhall be one
fleſh: ſo ſtrict and ſacred a tie is the band of
wedlock.</p>
                     <p>25 And they were both naked, <hi>Adam</hi> and
his wife, and were not aſhamed; but how the

for you to conſider often with your

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115236:19"/>
came into the world, but the toil and drudgery
of Tillage and Husbandry; the grievous
pangs of Childe-bearing; and laſtly, what is
moſt terrible of all, Death it ſelf: Of all
which, as of ſome other things alſo, I ſhall give
you ſuch plain and intelligible reaſons, that
your own hearts could not wiſh more plain
and more intelligible. To what an happy
condition <hi>Adam</hi> was created, you have already
heard; How he was placed by God in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of delight, where all his ſenſes were grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the moſt pleaſing objects imaginable;
his eyes with the beautie of trees and flowers,
and various delightſome forms of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
his ears with the ſweet muſical accents
of the canorous birds, his ſmell with the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
odours of Aromatick herbs, his taſte
with variety of delicious fruit, and his touch
with the ſoft breathings of the air in the flowry
alleys of this ever-ſpringing Paradiſe. Adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all this, that pleaſure of pleaſures, the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
converſation of his beautiful Bride, the
enjoyments of whoſe love neither created care
to himſelf, nor pangs of childe-bearing to
her: for all the functions of life were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with eaſe and delight; and there had been
no need for man to ſweat for the proviſion of
his family, for in this Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> there
was a perpetual Spring, and the vigour of the
ſoil prevented mans induſtry; and youth and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115236:19"/>
jollity had never left the bodies of <hi>Adam</hi> and
his poſterity, becauſe old age and death were
perpetually to be kept off by that ſoveraign
virtue of the Tree of Life. And I know, as
you heartily could wiſh, this ſtate might have
ever continued to <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſeed, ſo you
eagerly expect to hear the reaſon why he was
depriv'd of it; and in ſhort it is this, <hi>His diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to a commandement which God had given
him;</hi> the circumſtances whereof I ſhall declare
unto you, as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt thoſe ſeveral living creatures
which were in Paradiſe, there was the Serpent
alſo, whom you know to this very day to be
full of ſubtilty, &amp; therefore you will leſſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if when he was in his perfection, he had
not onely the uſe of Reaſon, but the power of
Speech. It was therefore this Serpent that was
the firſt occaſion of all this miſchief to <hi>Adam</hi>
and his poſterity; for he cunningly came unto
the woman, and ſaid unto her, Is it ſo indeed,
that God has commanded you that you ſhall
not eat of any of the trees of the Garden?</p>
                     <p>2 And the woman anſwered unto the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
You are miſtaken, God hath not forbid
us to eat of all the fruit of the trees of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                     <p>3 But indeed of the fruit of the Tree in the
midſt of the Garden, God hath ſtrictly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us, Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye
touch it, leſt ye die.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115236:20"/>
4 But the Serpent ſaid unto the woman,
Tuſh, I warrant you, this is only but to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you, and abridge you of that liberty and
happineſſe you are capable of, you ſhall not
ſo certainly die.</p>
                     <p>5 But God knows the virtue of that tree full
well, that ſo ſoon as you eat thereof, your eyes
ſhall be opened, and you ſhall become as Gods,
knowing good and evil.</p>
                     <p>6 And when the woman ſaw, that the tree
was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to
the eye, and a tree to be deſired to make one
wiſe, ſhe took of the fruit and did eat, and
gave alſo to her husband with her, and he did
eat.</p>
                     <p>7 And the eyes of them both were opened,
and they knew they were naked, and were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and therefore they ſewed fig-leaves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and made themſelves aprons to cover
their parts of ſhame.</p>
                     <p>8 And the Lord God came into the Garden
toward the cool of the evening, and walking
in the Garden, call'd for <hi>Adam;</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi>
had no ſooner heard his voice, but he and his
wife ran away into the thickeſt of the trees of
the Garden, to hide themſelves from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>9 But the Lord God called unto <hi>Adam</hi> the
ſecond time, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Adam</hi> where
art thou?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:115236:20"/>
10 Then <hi>Adam</hi> was forc't to make anſwer,
and ſaid, I heard thy voice in the Garden, and
I was afraid, becauſe I was naked, and ſo I hid
my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>11 Then God ſaid unto him, Who hath
made thee ſo wiſe, that thou ſhouldſt know that
thou art naked, or wanteſt any covering? Haſt
thou eaten of the forbidden fruit?</p>
                     <p>12 And <hi>Adam</hi> excus'd himſelf, ſaying, The
woman whom thou recommendedſt to me for
a meet help, ſhe gave me of the fruit, and I did
eat.</p>
                     <p>13 And the Lord God ſaid unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
What is this that thou haſt done? And
the woman excus'd her ſelf, ſaying, The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>
                     <p>14 Then the Lord God gave ſentence upon
all three; and to the Serpent he ſaid, Becauſe
thou haſt done this, thou art curſed above all
cattel, and above every beaſt of the field; and
whereas hitherto thou haſt been able to bear thy
body aloft, and go upright, thou ſhalt hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
creep upon thy belly, like a worm, and
duſt ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</p>
                     <p>15 And there ſhall be a perpetual antipathy
betwixt not only the woman and thee, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her ſeed and thy ſeed: For univerſal
mankind ſhall abhorre thee, and hate all the
curſed generations that come of thee. They
indeed ſhall buſily lie in wait to ſting mens
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115236:21"/>
feet, which their skill in herbs however ſhall
be able to cure; but they ſhall knock all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
on the head, and kill them without pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or remorſe, deſervedly uſing thy ſeed as
their deadly enemy.</p>
                     <p>16 And the doom of the woman was, Her
ſorrow and pangs in childe-bearing, and her
ſubjection to her husband. Which law of
ſubjection is generally obſerved in the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the world unto this very day.</p>
                     <p>17 And the doom of <hi>Adam</hi> was, The toil
of Husbandry upon barren ground.</p>
                     <p>18 For the earth was curſed for his ſake,
which is the reaſon that it brings forth thorns,
and thiſtles, and other weeds, that Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
could wiſh would not cumber the ground,
upon which they beſtow their toilſome labor.</p>
                     <p>19 Thus in the ſweat of his face was <hi>Adam</hi>
to eat his bread, till he return to the duſt out of
which he was taken.</p>
                     <p>20 And <hi>Adam</hi> called his wife <hi>Eve,</hi> becauſe
ſhe was the mother of all men that ever were
born into the world, and lived upon the face
of the earth.</p>
                     <p>21 And the generations of men were clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
at firſt with the skins of wilde beaſts, the
uſe of which God taught <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in
Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>22 And when they were thus accoutred for
their journey, and armed for greater hardſhip,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115236:21"/>
God turns them both out: and the Lord
God ſaid concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> deriding him for
his diſobedience, Behold, <hi>Adam</hi> is become as
one of us, to know good and evil: Let us
look to him now, leſt he put his hand to the
Tree of Life, and ſo make himſelf immortal.</p>
                     <p>23 Therefore the Lord God ſent him forth
from the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> to till the ground,
from whence he was taken.</p>
                     <p>24 So he drove out <hi>Adam,</hi> and his wife was
forced to follow him: For there was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſtaying in Paradiſe, becauſe the place was
terribly haunted with ſpirits, and fearful appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
appeared at the entrance thereof, wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men with fiery flaming ſwords in their
hands, brandiſhed every way, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi>
durſt never adventure to go back to taſte of
the fruit of the Tree of Life: whence it is
that mankinde hath continued mortal to this
very day.</p>

                     <p>1 OUR deſigne being to ſet out the
more conſpicuous parts of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Creation, before we deſcend
to the Genealogies and Succeſſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115236:22"/>
there are two notable objects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
themſelves to our underſtanding, which
we muſt firſt take notice of, as having an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
influence upon all that follows: and theſe
I do Symbolically decypher, the one by the
name of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> for I mean the
ſame thing by both theſe tearms; the other by
the name of <hi>Earth.</hi> By <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Light,</hi> you
are to underſtand <hi>The whole comprehenſion of
intellectual Spirits,</hi> ſouls of men and beaſts, and
the ſeminal forms of all things which you may
call, if you pleaſe, <hi>The world of Life.</hi> By
<hi>Earth,</hi> you are to underſtand the <hi>Potentiality,</hi>
or <hi>Capability</hi> of the <hi>Exiſtence of the outward
Creation:</hi> This Poſſibility being exhibited to
our mindes as the reſult of the Omnipotence
of God, without whom nothing would be,
and is indeed the utmoſt ſhadow and darkeſt
projection thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tri-une</hi> God therefore by his eternall
Wiſdome firſt created this Symbolical <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 And this <hi>Earth</hi> was nothing but Solitude
and Emptineſſe, and it was a deep bottomleſs
capacity of being what ever God thought
good to make out of it, that implyed no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to be made. And there being a
poſſibility of creating things after ſundry and
manifold manners, nothing was yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but this vaſt Capability of things was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115236:23"/>
unſettled, fluid, and of it ſelf undetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as water: But the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who was
the <hi>Vehicle</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Wiſdome,</hi> and of
the <hi>Super-eſſential Goodneſſe,</hi> by a ſwift fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt
of Counſel and Diſcourſe of Reaſon
truly divine, ſuch as at once ſtrikes through
all things, and diſcerns what is beſt to be done,
having hover'd a while over all the capacities
of this fluid Poſſibilitie, forthwith ſettled upon
what was the moſt perfect and exact.</p>
                     <p>3 Wherefore the intire Deity by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Word,</hi> which is nothing but <hi>Wiſdome</hi>
and <hi>Power,</hi> edg'd with <hi>actual Will,</hi> with more
eaſe then we can preſent any <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
to our own mindes, exhibited really to
their own view the whole Creation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Subſtances, ſuch as Angels are in their
inward natures, the Souls of men, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals, and the Seminal Forms of
all things, ſo that all thoſe, as many as ever
were to be of them, did really and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exiſt without any dependency on corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
matter.</p>
                     <p>4 And God approved of, and pleaſed
himſelf in all this as good; but yet though in
deſigne there was a ſettlement of the <hi>fluid
darkneſſe</hi> or obſcure <hi>Poſsibility</hi> of the outward
Creation, yet it remained as yet but a dark
Poſſibility: And a notorious diſtinction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there was betwixt this <hi>Actual ſpiritual
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115236:23"/>
Creation,</hi> and the <hi>dimme poſsibility</hi> of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
or outward world.</p>
                     <p>5. Inſomuch that the one might very well
be called <hi>Day,</hi> and the other <hi>Night:</hi> becauſe
the night does deface and obliterate all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
figures and colours of things; but the
day exhibits them all orderly and clearly to
our ſight. Thus therefore was the immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Creature perfectly finiſht, being <hi>an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible
Treaſury of Light and Form,</hi> for the
garniſhing and conſummating the material
world, to afford a <hi>Morning</hi> or <hi>Active principle</hi>
to every <hi>Paſsive</hi> one, in the future parts of the
corporeal Creation. But in this firſt days
work, as we will call it, the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
are purely <hi>Metaphyſical;</hi> for the active
and paſſive principles here are not two diſtinct
ſubſtances, the one <hi>material,</hi> the other <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi>
But the paſſive principle is <hi>matter</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> and indeed no real or actual
entity; and, as hath been already ſaid, is
quite divided from the light or ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
not belonging to it, but to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
world, whoſe ſhadowy poſſibility it
is. But be they how they will, this paſſive
and active principle are the Firſt days work:
A <hi>Monad</hi> or <hi>Unite</hi> being ſo fit a Symbole of the
immaterial nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:115236:24"/>
6 And God thought again, and invigorating
his thought with his Will and Power, created
an immenſe deal of reall and corporeall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a ſubſtance which you muſt conceive to
lie betwixt the foreſaid <hi>fluid Poſsibility of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things,</hi> and the Region of <hi>Seminall Forms;</hi>
not that theſe things are diſtinguiſht Locally,
but according to a more intellectual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>7 And the thought of God arm'd with his
Omnipotent will took effect, and this immenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diffuſed matter was made. But he was not
very forward to ſay it was good, or to pleaſe
himſelf much in it, becauſe he foreſaw what
miſchief ſtraying ſouls, if they were not very
cautious, might bring to themſelves, by ſinking
themſelves too deep therein. Beſides it was
little worth, till greater poliſhings were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon it, and his Wiſdome had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it to fitting uſes, being nothing as yet, but
a boundleſſe Ocean of rude inviſible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>8 Wherefore this Matter was actuated and
agitated forthwith by ſome Univerſal Spirit,
yet part of the <hi>World of Life,</hi> whence it became
very ſubtile and <hi>Ethereal;</hi> ſo that this <hi>Matter</hi>
was rightly called <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Union of
the Paſſive and Active Principle in the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Material Heaven, is the ſecond days
work, and the <hi>Binarie</hi> denotes the nature
thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:115236:24"/>
9 I ſhall alſo declare unto you, how God
orders a reall materiall Earth, when once it is
made, to make it pleaſant and delightful for
both man and beaſt. But for the very making
of the Earth, it is to be referred to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
day. For the Stars and Planets belong to
that number; and as a primary Planet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of its reflexion of light is rightly called a
Planet, ſo in reſpect of its habitableneſſe, it is
as rightly tearmed an Earth. Theſe Earths
therefore God orders in ſuch ſort, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
want water to lie upon them, nor be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
over with water, though they be invironed
round with the fluid air.</p>
                     <p>10 But he makes it partly dry Land, and
partly Sea, Rivers, and Springs, whoſe conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
is obvious for every one to conceive.</p>
                     <p>11 He adorns the ground alſo with graſſe,
herbs, and flowers, and hath made a wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of ſeed, that they bring forth, for the
perpetuation of ſuch uſeful commodities upon
the face of the earth.</p>
                     <p>12 For indeed theſe things are very good and
neceſſary both for man and beaſt.</p>
                     <p>13 Therefore God prepared the matter of
the Earth ſo, as that there was a <hi>vital congruity</hi>
of the parts thereof, with ſundry ſorts of ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
forms of trees, herbs, and choiceſt kinds of
flowers; and ſo the Body of the Earth drew in
ſundry principles of <hi>Plantall Life,</hi> from the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115236:25"/>
                        <hi>World of Life,</hi> that is at hand every where; and
the Paſſive and Active Principle thus put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made up the Third Days work, and the
<hi>Ternary</hi> denotes the nature thereof.</p>
                     <p>14 The <hi>Ternary</hi> had allotted to it, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of an Earth with trees, flowers, and
herbs, after the diſtinction of Land and Sea:
as the <hi>Quinary</hi> hath allotted to it, the repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of an Earth with fiſh and fowl; the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
with man and beaſt. But this <hi>Fourth Day</hi>
comprehends the garniſhing of the body of the
whole world, <hi>viz.</hi> That vaſt and immenſe
<hi>Ethereal</hi> matter, which is called the <hi>fluid Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
with infinite numbers of ſundry ſorts of
lights, which Gods Wiſdome and Power, by
union of fit and active principles drawn from
the <hi>world of life,</hi> made of this <hi>Ethereal</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whoſe uſefulneſſe is plain in nature, that
they are for Prognoſtick ſignes, and ſeaſons,
and days, and years.</p>
                     <p>15 As alſo for adminiſtring of light to all
the inhabitants of the world; That the Planets
may receive light from their fountains of light,
and reflect light one to another.</p>
                     <p>16 And there are two ſorts of theſe Lights
that all the inhabitants of the world muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
great every where, conſulting
with the outward ſight, from their proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And the dominion of the greater of
theſe kinde of lights is conſpicuous by day; the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115236:25"/>
dominion of the leſſer by night: the former we
ordinarily call a <hi>Sun,</hi> the other a <hi>Moon;</hi> which
<hi>Moon</hi> is truly a Planet and opake, but reflecting
light very plentifully to the beholders ſight,
and yet is but a ſecondary or leſſer kind of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;
but he made the Primary and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Planets alſo, and ſuch an one is this
Earth we live upon.</p>
                     <p>17 And God placed all theſe ſorts of lights
in the thin and liquid Heaven, that they might
reflect their rayes one upon another, and ſhine
upon the inhabitants of the world.</p>
                     <p>18 And that their beauty and reſplendency
might be conſpicuous to the beholders of
them, whether by day or by night, which is
mainly to be underſtood of the Suns, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
alſo the place of Stars at a far diſtance, but
whoſe chiefe office it is to make viciſſitudes of
day and night: And the Univerſal dark <hi>Aether</hi>
being thus adorn'd with the goodly and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
furniture of thoſe ſeveral kindes of lights,
God approved of it as good.</p>
                     <p>19 And the union of the Paſſive and Active
principle was the Fourth days work, and the
number denotes the nature thereof.</p>
                     <p>20 And now you have heard of a verdant
Earth, and a bounded Sea, and Lights to ſhine
through the air and water, and to gratifie the
eyes of all living creatures, whereby they may
ſee one another, and be able to ſeek their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115236:26"/>
food, you may ſeaſonably expect the mention
of ſundry animals proper to their elements.
Wherefore God by his <hi>inward Word</hi> and
<hi>Power,</hi> prepared the matter in the waters, and
near the waters with ſeveral <hi>vital congruities,</hi>
ſo that it drew in ſundry ſouls from the world
of Life, which actuating the parts of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
caus'd great plenty of fiſh to ſwim in the
waters, and fowls to flye above the earth in
the open air.</p>
                     <p>21 And after this manner he created great
Whales alſo, as well as the leſſer kindes of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and he approved of them all as good.</p>
                     <p>22 And the bleſſing of his <hi>inward Word</hi> or
<hi>Wiſdome</hi> was upon them for their multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for according to the preparation of the
matter, the <hi>Plaſtical Power</hi> of the ſouls that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from the world of Life, did faithfully
and effectually work thoſe wiſe contrivances
of <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> they being once rightly
united with the matter, ſo that by this means
the fiſh filled the waters in the ſeas, and the
fowls multiplyed upon the earth.</p>
                     <p>23 And the union of the Paſſive and Active
principle was the Fift days work, and the <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>
denotes the nature thereof.</p>
                     <p>24 And God perſiſted farther in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of living creatures, and by eſpouſing new
ſouls from the <hi>world of Life</hi> to the more Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
parts of the matter, created land-ſerpents,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115236:26"/>
cattel, and the beaſts of the field.</p>
                     <p>25 And when he had thus made them, he
approved of them for good.</p>
                     <p>26 Then God reflecting upon his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and viewing himſelf, conſulting with the
<hi>Super-eſſential Goodneſſe,</hi> the <hi>Eternal Intellect,</hi>
and <hi>unextinguiſhable Love-flame of his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Spirit,</hi> concluded to make a far higher
kinde of living creature, then was as yet
brought into the world; He made therefore
Man in his own Image, after his own Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For after he had prepared the matter
fit for ſo noble a gueſt as an humane Soul, the
<hi>world of Life</hi> was forced to let go what the
rightly prepared matter ſo juſtly called for.
And Man appeared upon the ſtage of the earth,
Lord of all living creatures. For it was juſt
that he that bears the Image of the inviſible
God, ſhould be Supreme Monarch of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
world. And what can be more like God
then the ſoul of man, that is ſo free, ſo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and ſo intellectual as it is? And he is not the
leſſe like him now he is united to the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
body, his ſoul or ſpirit poſſeſſing and
ſtriking through a compendious collection of
all kinde of corporeal matter, and managing it,
with his underſtanding free to think of other
things, even as God vivificates and actuates the
whole world, being yet wholly free to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
himſelf. Wherefore God gave Man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115236:27"/>
dominion over the fowls of the air, the fiſh of
the ſea, and the beaſts of the earth: for it is
reaſonable the worſer ſhould be in ſubſerviency
to the better.</p>
                     <p>27 Thus God created Man in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
he conſiſting of an intellectual Soul,
&amp; a terreſtrial Body actuated thereby. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mankinde became male and female, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terreſtrial animals are.</p>
                     <p>28 And the benediction of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for the propagation of their kinde, was
manifeſt in the contrivance of the parts that
were framed for that purpoſe: And as they
grew in multitudes, they lorded it over the

from ever creating any thing more, either in
this outward Material world, or in the world of

                     <p>3 For this <hi>Seventh day</hi> God hath made an

                     <p>4 And now to open my minde more fully
and plainly unto you, I muſt tell you that
thoſe things which before I tearm'd the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhings
of the Heaven and of the Earth, they
are not only ſo, but the Generations of them:
I ſay, Plants and Animals were the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
effects, and productions of the Earth, the
<hi>Seminal Forms</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelves into the prepared matter
thereof, and <hi>Suns, Planets,</hi> or <hi>Earths</hi> were the
generations or productions of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and motion being imparted from the
<hi>world of Life</hi> to the immenſe body of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
ſo that what I before called meer Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhings,
are indeed the productions or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Heavens and of the Earth ſo
ſoon as they were made; Though I do not
take upon me to define the time wherein God
made the Heavens and the Earth: For he
might do it at once by his abſolute Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
or he might, when he had created all
Subſtance as well material as immaterial, let
them act one upon the other, ſo, and in ſuch
periods of time, as the nature of the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the things themſelves requir'd.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115236:29"/>
5 But it was for pious purpoſes that I caſt
the Creation into that order of Six dayes,
and for the more firmly rooting in the hearts
of the people this grand and uſeful Truth,
<hi>That the Omnipotency of God is ſuch, that he
can act above and contrary to natural cauſes,</hi> that
I mention'd herbs and plants of the field,
before I take notice of either rain or man to
exerciſe Gardning and Husbandry: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
according to my former narration there
had been no ſuch kinde of rain, as ordinarily
nowadays waters the labours of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                     <p>6 But yet there went up a moiſt vapour
from the earth, which being matur'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
by the Spirit of the world, which is
very active in the heavens or air, became a
precious <hi>balmy liquour,</hi> and fit <hi>vehicle of Life,</hi>
which deſcending down in ſome ſort like dewy
ſhowers upon the face of the earth, moiſtned
the ground, ſo that the warmth of the Sun
gently playing upon the ſurface thereof, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
matter variouſly for ſundry ſorts, not
only of Seminal forms of Plants, but Souls of
<hi>Animals</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>7 And Man himſelf roſe out of the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner; the duſt thereof being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepar'd and attemper'd by theſe unctuous
ſhowers and balmy droppings of Heaven. For
God had ſo contriv'd by his infinite Wiſdome,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115236:29"/>
that matter thus or thus prepar'd, ſhould by a
<hi>vital congruity</hi> attract proportional forms from
the <hi>world of Life,</hi> which is every where nigh at
hand, and does very throngly inequitate the
moiſt and unctuous air. Wherefore after this
manner was the <hi>Aereal</hi> or <hi>Ethereal Adam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
into an earthly body, having his moſt
conſpicuous reſidence in the head or brain:
And thus <hi>Adam</hi> became the Soul of a <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial
living Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8 But how it is with <hi>Adam</hi> before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
into this lower condition of life, I ſhall
declare unto you in the Aenigmatical narration
that follows, which is this; That the Lord God
planted a Garden Eaſtward in <hi>Eden,</hi> where he
had put the Man, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> afterward he formed into
a <hi>Terreſtrial Animal:</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Ethereal,</hi> and placed in Paradiſe, that is, in
an happy and joyful condition of the Spirit; for
he was placed under the invigorating beams of
the <hi>divine Intellect,</hi> and the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then ſhone fairly upon him.</p>
                     <p>9 And his Soul was as the ground which
God hath bleſt, &amp; ſo brought forth every plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Tree, and every goodly Plant of her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Fathers own planting; for the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Life had inriched the ſoil, that it brought
forth all manner of pleaſant and profitable
fruits: And the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> was in the midſt
of this Garden of mans ſoul, to wit, the <hi>Eſſential
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115236:30"/>
Will of God,</hi> which is the true root of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
but to ſo high a pitch <hi>Adam</hi> as yet
had not reacht unto, and the fruit of this Tree
in this <hi>Ethereal</hi> ſtate of the Soul, had been <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi>
or <hi>Life everlaſting:</hi> And the <hi>Tree
of the Knowledge of good and evil</hi> was there alſo,
viz. <hi>His own Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10 And there was a very pleaſant River
that water'd this Garden, diſtinguiſhable into
four ſtreams, which are the four Cardinal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which are in ſeveral degrees in the Soul,
according to the ſeveral degrees of the purity
of her <hi>Vehicle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11 And the name of the firſt is <hi>Piſon,</hi> which
is <hi>Prudence</hi> and Experience in things that are
comely to be done: For the ſoul of man is
never idle, neither in this world, nor in any
ſtate elſe, but hath ſome Province to make
good, and is to promote his intereſt whoſe ſhe
is: For what greater gratification can there
be of a good ſoul, then to be a diſpenſer of
ſome portion of that Univerſal good, that
God lets out upon the world? And there can
be no external converſation nor ſociety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
be they <hi>Terreſtrial, Aereab,</hi> or <hi>Ethereal,</hi>
but forthwith it implies an Uſe of Prudence:
Wherefore Prudence is an inſeparable Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of the ſoul: So that <hi>Piſon</hi> is rightly
deemed one of the Rivers even of that Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
Paradiſe. And this is that wiſdome which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115236:30"/>
God himſelf doth ſhew to the ſoul by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the divine Light; for it is ſaid to
compaſſe the Land of <hi>Havilah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Where alſo idle and uſeleſſe ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not regarded, as is plainly declared by
the pure and approved <hi>Gold, Bdellium,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyx,</hi>
the commodities thereof.</p>
                     <p>13 And the name of the ſecond River is
<hi>Gihon,</hi> which is <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as is intimated from
the fame of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> whoſe Land it is
ſaid to compaſſe, as alſo from the notation of
the name thereof.</p>
                     <p>14 And the name of the third River is <hi>Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekel,</hi>
which is <hi>Fortitude,</hi> that like a rapid ſtream
bears all down before it, and ſtoutly reſiſts all
the powers of darkneſſe, running forcibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which is ſituated Weſtward of
it. And the fourth River is <hi>Perath,</hi> which is
<hi>Temperance,</hi> the nouriſher and cheriſher of all
the plants of Paradiſe; whereas Intemperance,
or too much addicting the minde to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the <hi>Vehicle,</hi> or <hi>Life of the matter,</hi> be it
in what ſtate ſoever, drowns and choaks thoſe
ſacret Vegetables. As the earth you know,
was not at all fruitfull till the waters were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
into one place, and the dry land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
when as before it was drowned and
ſlocken with overmuch moiſture.</p>
                     <p>15 In this Paradiſe thus deſcribed, had the
Lord God placed Man to dreſſe it, and to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115236:31"/>
keep it in ſuch good order as he found it.</p>
                     <p>16 And the divine Word or Light in man
charged him, ſaying, Of every tree of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
thou mayeſt freely eat. For all things
here are wholeſome as well as pleaſant, if thou
haſt a right care of thy ſelf, and beeſt obedient
to my commands.</p>
                     <p>17 But of the luſcious and poiſonous fruit
of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil,
that is, of thine own will, thou ſhalt not by any
means eat: For at what time thou eateſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
thy ſoul ſhall contract that languor, debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and unſettledneſſe, that in proceſſe of time
thou ſhalt ſlide into the earth, and be buried in
humane fleſh, and become an inhabitant of the
<hi>Region of mortality and death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18 Hitherto I have not taken much notice
in the <hi>Ethereal Adam</hi> of any other Faculties, but
ſuch as carried him upwards towards virtue
and the <hi>holy Intellect;</hi> And indeed this is the
more <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>maſculine Adam,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in pure ſubtile intellectual Knowledge:
But we will now inform you of another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the ſoul of man, which though it
ſeem inferiour, yet is far from being contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
it being both good for himſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for the terreſtrial world; For this
makes him in a capacity of being the head of
all the living creatures in the earth, as that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
indeed is the mother of all mankinde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:115236:31"/>
19 Thoſe higher and more Intellectual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
I muſt confeſſe, made <hi>Adam</hi>
very wiſe, and of a quick perception. For he
knew very well the natures of the beaſts of
the field, and fowls of the air: I mean not
only of the viſible and terreſtrial creatures, but
alſo of the fallen and unfallen Angels, or good
and bad <hi>Genii,</hi> and was able to judge aright of
them, according to the principles they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of, and the properties they had.</p>
                     <p>20 And his Reaſon and Underſtanding was
not miſtaken, but he pronounced aright in all.
But however, he could take no ſuch pleaſure in
the external Creation of God, and his vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
works, without having ſome Principle of
life, congruouſly joyning with, and joyfully
actuating the like matter themſelves conſiſted
of: Wherefore God indued the ſoul of man
with a faculty of being united with vital joy
and complacency to the matter, as well as of
aſpiring to an union with God himſelf, whoſe
divine Eſſence is too highly diſproportioned
to our poor ſubſtances. But the divine Life
is communicable in ſome ſort to both ſoul and
body, whether it be <hi>Ethereal,</hi> or of groſſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence:
and thoſe wonderful grateful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that we feel, are nothing but the kindely
motions of the ſouls <hi>Vehicle;</hi> from whence
divine joys themſelves are by a kinde of refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion
ſtrengthned and advanced. Of ſo great
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115236:32"/>
conſequence is that vital principle that joyns
the ſoul to the matter of the Univerſe.</p>
                     <p>21 Wherefore God to gratifie <hi>Adam,</hi> made
him not indefatigable in his aſpirings towards
Intellectual things, but Laſſitude of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
&amp; of Affectation of Immateriality, (he
being not able to receive thoſe things as they
are, but according to his poor capacity, which
is very ſmall in reſpect of the object it is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
about) brought upon himſelf remiſneſſe
and drowſineſſe to ſuch like exerciſes, till by
degrees he fell into a more profound ſleep; At
what time divine Providence having laid the
plot aforehand, that lower vivificative princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of his ſoul did grow ſo ſtrong, and did ſo
vigorouſly and with ſuch exultant ſympathy
and joy actuate his <hi>Vehicle,</hi> that in virtue of his
integrity which he yet retain'd, this became
more dear to him, and of greater contentment,
then any thing he yet had experience of.</p>
                     <p>22 I ſay, when divine Providence had ſo
lively and warmly ſtirr'd up this new ſenſe of
his <hi>Vehicle</hi> in him,</p>
                     <p>23 He ſtraightway acknowledg'd that all
the ſenſe and knowledge of any thing he had
hitherto, was more lifeleſſe and evanid, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
leſſe congruous and grateful unto him,
and more eſtranged from his nature: but this
was ſo agreeable &amp; conſentaneous to his ſoul,
that he looked upon it as a neceſſary part of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115236:32"/>
himſelf, and called it after his own name.</p>
                     <p>24 And he thought thus within himſelf, For
this cauſe will any one leave his over-tedious
<hi>aſpires</hi> to unite with the <hi>Eternal Intellect, and
Univerſal Soul of the world,</hi> the immenſeneſſe
of whoſe excellencies are too highly rais'd for
us to continue long in their embracements, and
will cleave to the joyous and chearful <hi>life of
his Vehicle,</hi> and account this living <hi>Vehicle</hi> and
his Soul one Perſon.</p>
                     <p>25 Thus <hi>Adam</hi> with his <hi>new-wedded Joy</hi>
ſtood naked before God, but was not as yet at
all aſhamed, by reaſon of his Innocency and
Simplicity; for <hi>Adam</hi> neither in his reaſon nor
affection as yet had tranſgreſſed in any thing.</p>

                     <p>4 But the <hi>Serpent</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Adam,</hi> Tuſh,
this is but a <hi>Panick</hi> fear in you, <hi>Adam,</hi> you ſhall
not ſo ſurely die as you conceit.</p>
                     <p>5 The only matter is this; God indeed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ves to keep his creatures in awe, and to hold
them in from ranging too farre, and reaching
too high; but he knows very well, that if you
take but your liberty with us, and ſatiate your
ſelves freely with your own will, your eyes
will be wonderfully opened, and you will meet
with a world of variety of experiments in
things, ſo that you will grow abundantly wiſe,
and like Gods know all things whatſoever,
whether good or evil.</p>
                     <p>6 Now the <hi>Feminine</hi> part in <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo
tickled with this Doctrine of the <hi>old Deceiver,</hi>
that the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> began to be ſo immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as to reſolve to do any thing that may
promote pleaſure and experience in things,
&amp; ſnatcht away with it <hi>Adams</hi> Will and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by his heedleſneſſe and inadvertency. So
that <hi>Adam</hi> was wholly ſet upon doing things
at randome; according as the various toyings
and titillations of the laſcivient <hi>Life of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle</hi>
ſuggeſted to him, no longer conſulting
with the voice of God, or taking any farther
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115236:34"/>
aim by the Inlet of the divine Light.</p>
                     <p>7 And when he had tired himſelf with a
rabble of toyes, and unfruitful or unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
devices, riſing from the multifarious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of the <hi>Particles</hi> of his <hi>Vehicle,</hi> at laſt the
eyes of his faculties were opened, and they
perceived how naked they were; he having as
yet neither the covering of the Heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor the Terreſtrial Body. Only they
ſewed fig-leaves together, and made ſome
pretences of excuſe, from the vigour of the
<hi>Plantal Life</hi> that now in a thinner maner might
manifeſt it ſelf in <hi>Adam,</hi> and prediſpoſe him
for a more perfect exerciſe of his <hi>Plaſtick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
when the prepared matter of the Earth
ſhall drink him in.</p>
                     <p>8 In the mean time the voice of God, or
the divine Wiſdome ſpake to them in the cool
of the day, when the hurry of this mad Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer
had well ſlaked. But <hi>Adam</hi> now with his
wife was grown ſo out of order, and ſo much
eſtranged from the <hi>Life of God,</hi> that they hid
themſelves at the ſenſible approach thereof, as
wilde beaſts run away into the Wood at the
ſight of a man.</p>
                     <p>9 But the <hi>divine Light</hi> in the Conſcience of
<hi>Adam</hi> purſued him, and upbraided unto him
the caſe he was in.</p>
                     <p>10 And <hi>Adam</hi> acknowledged within himſelf
how naked he was, having no power, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115236:35"/>
nor abilities of his own, and yet that
he had left his obedience and dependence upon
God: Wherefore he was aſhamed, and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at the approach of the divine Light mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
it ſelf unto him to the reprehenſion and
rebuke of him.</p>
                     <p>11 And the divine Light charg'd all this
miſery and confuſion that had thus overtaken
him, upon the eating of the forbidden fruit,
<hi>the luſcious Dictates of his own Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12 But <hi>Adam</hi> again excus'd himſelf within
himſelf, that it was the vigour and impetuoſity
of that <hi>Life in the Vehicle</hi> which God himſelf
implanted in it, whereby he miſcarried: The
woman that God had given him.</p>
                     <p>13 And the <hi>divine Light</hi> ſpake in <hi>Adam</hi>
concerning the woman; What work hath ſhe
made here? But the woman in <hi>Adam</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
her ſelf; for ſhe was beguiled by that grand
Deceiver the <hi>Serpent.</hi> In this confuſion of
mind was <hi>Adam</hi> by forſaking the <hi>divine Light,</hi>
and letting his own will get head againſt it. For
it ſo changed the nature of his <hi>Vehicle,</hi> that
(whereas he might have continued in an <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
and <hi>Ethereal</hi> condition, and his <hi>feminine</hi>
part been brought into perfect obedience to
the <hi>divine Light,</hi> and had joyes multiplyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole man beyond all expreſſion and
imagination for ever) he now ſunk more and
more towards a mortal and terreſtrial eſtate,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115236:35"/>
himſelf not being unſenſible thereof, as you
ſhall hear, when I have told you the doom of
the Eternal God concerning the Serpent and
him.</p>
                     <p>14 Things therefore having been carried
on in this wiſe, the Eternal Lord God decreed
thus with himſelf concerning the <hi>Serpent</hi> and
<hi>Adam:</hi> That this <hi>old Serpent,</hi> the Prince of
the rebellious Angels, ſhould be more accurſed
then all the reſt; and, (whereas he lorded it
aloft in the higher parts of the Air, and could
glide in the very <hi>Ethereal</hi> Region, amongſt the
innocent and unflan ſouls of men, and the
good Angels before) that he ſhould now ſweep
the duſt with his belly, being caſt lower to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſurface of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>15 And that there ſhould be a general en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and abhorrency betwixt this <hi>old Serpent,</hi>
as alſo all of his fellow-rebels, and betwixt
<hi>Mankinde.</hi> And that in proceſſe of time the
ever faithful and obedient Soul of the <hi>Meſsias</hi>
ſhould take a Body, and ſhould trample over
the power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> very notoriouſly here
upon Earth, and after his death ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
Prince of all the Angelical Orders
whatever in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>16 And concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> the Eternal
Lord God decreed that he ſhould deſcend
down to be an Inhabitant of the Earth, and
that he ſhould not there indulge to himſelf the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115236:36"/>
pleaſures of the body, without the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of pain and ſorrow, and that his <hi>Feminine</hi>
part, his Affections ſhould be under the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and correction of his Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>17 That he ſhould have a weariſome and
toilſome travail in this world,</p>
                     <p>18 The Earth bringing forth thorns and
thiſtles, though he muſt ſubſiſt by the Corn
of the field.</p>
                     <p>19 Wherefore in the ſweat of his browes
he ſhould eat his bread, till he returned unto
the ground, of which his terreſtrial body is
made. This was the Counſel of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Serpent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20 Now, as I was a telling you, <hi>Adam</hi>
though he was ſinking apace into thoſe lower
functions of life, yet his minde was not as yet
grown ſo fully ſtupid, but he had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his own condition, and added to all
his former Apologies, that the <hi>Feminine</hi> part
in him, though it had ſeduced him, yet there
was ſome uſe of this miſ-carriage, for the Earth
would hence be inhabited by <hi>Intellectual Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals:</hi>
wherefore he call'd the <hi>Life of his Vehicle,
EVE,</hi> becauſe ſhe is indeed the Mother of all the
generations of men that live upon the Earth.</p>
                     <p>21 At laſt the <hi>Plaſtick Power</hi> being fully
awakened, <hi>Adams</hi> Soul deſcended into the
prepared matter of the Earth, and in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of time <hi>Adam</hi> appear'd cloth'd in the skin
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115236:36"/>
of beaſts; that is, he became a down-right <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
Animal,</hi> and a mortal creature upon
earth.</p>
                     <p>22 For the Eternal God had ſo decreed, and
his Wiſdome, Mercy, and Juſtice did but, if I
may ſo ſpeak, play and ſport together in the
buſineſſe. And the rather, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had
but precipitated himſelf into that condition,
which in due time might have faln to his ſhare
by courſe; for it is fitting there ſhould be ſome
ſuch head among the living creatures of the
earth, as a <hi>terreſtrial Adam,</hi> but to live always
here were his diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>23 Wherefore when God remov'd him
from that higher condition,</p>
                     <p>24 He made ſure he ſhould not be Immortal,
nor is he in any capacity of reaching unto the
<hi>Tree of Life,</hi> without paſſing through his <hi>fiery
Vehicle,</hi> and becoming a pure and defecate <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal</hi>
Spirit: Then he may be admitted to
taſte the fruit of the Tree of Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and ſo live for ever.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>1 WEE ſhall ſet before you in this
Hiſtory of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſeveral e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
examples of good and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115236:37"/>
perfect men, ſuch as <hi>Abel, Seth, Enoch, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and the like: Wherefore we thought
fit, though Aenigmatically, and in a dark Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
to ſhadow out in general the manner of
progreſſe to this divine Perfection; Looking
upon Man as a <hi>Microcoſm</hi> or a <hi>Little World,</hi> who
if he hold out the whole progreſſe of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Creation, the proceſſe thereof will be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively
underſtood as follows Wherefore
firſt of all, I ſay, that by the will of God every
man living on the face of the Earth hath theſe
two Principles in him, <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
and <hi>Animality, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2 But that which is <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates
firſt, the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>heavenly Life</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a while cloſed up at reſt in its own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
During which time, and indeed ſome
while afterwards too, the <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Fleſhly</hi> Life
domineers in darkneſſe and deformity; the
mighty tempeſtuous Paſſions of the fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
and ſtrugling over that <hi>Abyſſe of unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
Deſire</hi> which has no bottome, and which
in this caſe carries the minde to nothing but
emptineſſe and unprofitableneſſe.</p>
                     <p>3 But by the will of God it is, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Day-light appears, though not in ſo
vigorous meaſure, out of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4 And Conſcience being thus enlightned,
offers her ſelf a guide to a better condition;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115236:38"/>
and God has fram'd the nature of man ſo, that
he cannot but ſay, that this Light is good, and
diſtinguiſh betwixt the dark tumultuous moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Fleſh and it:</p>
                     <p>5 And ſay, that there is as true a difference,
as betwixt the natural Day and Night. And
thus <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Enquiry</hi> was the firſt days
progreſſe.</p>
                     <p>6 But though there be this principle of
Light ſet up in the Conſcience of Man, and
he cannot ſay any thing againſt it, but that it is
good and true, yet has he not preſently ſo
lively and ſavoury a reliſh in his diſtinction
betwixt the <hi>evil</hi> and the <hi>good:</hi> For the <hi>evil</hi>
as yet wholly holds his Affections, though his
Fancy and Reaſon be toucht a little with the
Theoretical apprehenſions of what is <hi>good;</hi>
wherefore by the will of God the <hi>heavenly
Principle</hi> in due time becomes a <hi>Spirit of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
and affectionate diſcernment betwixt the
evil and the good;</hi> betwixt the pure waters that
flow from the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and the muddy and
tumultuous ſuggeſtions of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7 And thus is Man enabled in a living man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
life.</p>
                     <p>8 For the heavenly Principle is now made
to him a <hi>Spirit of ſavoury diſcernment,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taught by God after this manner, he will
not fail to pronounce, that this Principle,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115236:38"/>
whereby he has ſo quick and lively a ſenſe of
what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> is <hi>heavenly</hi> indeed: And
thus <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Enquiry</hi> is made the ſecond
days progreſſe.</p>
                     <p>9 Now the ſweetneſſe of the <hi>upper waters</hi>
being ſo well reliſht by man, he has a great
nauſeating againſt the <hi>lower feculent waters</hi> of
the unbounded deſires of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> So that
God adding power to his will, the inordinate
deſires of the fleſh are driven within ſet limits,
and he has a command over himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more ſtayed and ſteady.</p>
                     <p>10 And this ſteadineſſe and command he
gets over himſelf, he is taught by the divine
Principle in him to compare to the <hi>Earth</hi> or
<hi>dry land</hi> for ſafeneſſe and ſtability; but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of the fleſh, he looks upon as a dangerous
and turbulent <hi>Sea:</hi> Wherefore the bounding
of them thus, and arriving to a ſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over a mans ſelf, and freedome from
ſuch colluctations and colliſions as are found
in the working Seas, the divine Nature in
him could not but approve as good.</p>
                     <p>11 For ſo it comes to paſſe by the will of
God, and according to the nature of things,
that this ſtate of ſobriety in man, (he being in
ſo good a meaſure rid of the boiſterouſneſſe of
evil Concupiſcence) gives him leiſure ſo to
cultivate his minde with principles of Virtue
and Honeſty, that he is as a fruitful field whom
the Lord hath bleſſed,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115236:39"/>
12 Sending forth out of himſelf ſundry
ſorts of fruit-bearing trees, herbs, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
that is, various kindes of good works, to
the praiſe of God, and the help of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and God and his own Conſcience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to him, that this is good.</p>
                     <p>13 And thus <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Inquiry</hi> is made
the third days progreſſe.</p>
                     <p>14 Now when God has proceeded ſo far
in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Creation, as to raiſe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Principle in man to that power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
that it takes hold on his affections, and
brings forth laudable works of Righteouſneſſe,
he thereupon adds a very eminent acceſſion of
Light and Strength, ſetting before his eyes
ſundry ſorts of Luminaries in the <hi>heavenly</hi> or
<hi>intellectual</hi> Nature, whereby he may be able
more notoriouſly to diſtinguiſh betwixt the
<hi>Day</hi> and the <hi>Night;</hi> that is, betwixt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a truly illuminated ſoul, and one that
is as yet much benighted in ignorance, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged
from the true knowledge of God.
For according to the difference of theſe Lights,
it is ſignified to a man in what condition him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
or others are in, whether it be indeed <hi>Day</hi>
or <hi>Night</hi> with them, <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Winter, Spring</hi>
time or <hi>Harveſt,</hi> or what period or progreſſe
they have made in the divine Life.</p>
                     <p>15 And though there be ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt theſe Lights, yet the meaneſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115236:39"/>
are better then meer darkneſſe, and ſerve in
ſome meaſure or other to give light to the
Earthly man.</p>
                     <p>16 But among theſe many Lights which
God makes to appear to man, there are two
more eminent by far then the reſt. The
greater of which two has his dominion by day,
and is a faithful guide to thoſe which walk in
the day; that is, that work the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
And this greater Light is but
one, but does being added, mightily invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the former day-light man walked by, and
it is a more full appearance of the <hi>Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>
which is an hearty and ſincere <hi>Love
of God,</hi> and a <hi>mans neighbour.</hi> The leſſer of
theſe two great Lights has dominion by night,
and is a rule to thoſe whoſe inward mindes are
held as yet too ſtrongly in the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and it is a Principle weak, and variable
as the Moon, and is called <hi>Inconſtancy of Life
and Knowledge.</hi> There are alſoan abundance
of other <hi>little Lights</hi> thickly diſperſed over the
whole Underſtanding of man, as the Stars in
the Firmament, which you may call <hi>Notiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or <hi>Multiplicity of ineffectual Opinions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17 But the worſt of all theſe are better then
down-right Senſuality and Brutiſhneſſe, and
therefore God may well be ſaid to ſet them up
in the <hi>heavenly</hi> part of man, his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to give what light they are able to his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115236:40"/>
                        <hi>earthly</hi> parts, his corrupt and inordinate Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>18 And as the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is,
the hearty and ſincere <hi>Love of God,</hi> and a <hi>mans
neighbour,</hi> by his ſingle light and warmth with
chearfulneſſe and ſafety guides them that are
in the day: ſo that more <hi>uneven</hi> and <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Principle,</hi> and the <hi>numerous Light of Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi>
may conduct them, as well as they are
able, that are benighted in darkneſſe: And
what is moſt of all conſiderable, a man by the
wide difference of theſe latter Lights from that
of the Day, may diſcern, when himſelf or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
is benighted in the ſtate of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.
For <hi>multifarious Notionality</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of life and knowledge,</hi> are certain ſigns
that a man is in the night: But the ſticking to
this one, ſingle, but vigorous and effectual
Light, of the hearty and ſincere <hi>Love of God,</hi>
and a <hi>mans neighbour,</hi> is a ſigne that a man
walks in the day. And he that is arrived to
this condition, plainly diſcerns in the Light of
God, that all this is very good.</p>
                     <p>19 And thus <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Inquiry</hi> is made
the fourth days progreſſe.</p>
                     <p>20 And now ſo noble, ſo warm, and ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
a Principle or Light as the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
being ſet up in the heavenly part
of the Soul of man, the unskilful may unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
expect that the next news will be, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115236:40"/>
the Seas themſelves are dried up with the
heat thereof, that is, that the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> in
man is quite deſtroyed: But God doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
far otherwiſe; for the waters bring forth
abundance of Fiſh as well as Fowl innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>21 Thoughts therefore of natural delights
do ſwim to and fro in the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> of man,
and the fervent love he bears to God cauſes
not a many faint ineffectual notions, but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of holy affectionate meditations, and
<hi>winged Ejaculations</hi> that fly up heaven-ward,
which returning back again, and falling upon
the numerous <hi>fry</hi> of natural <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> help
to leſſen their numbers, as thoſe fowls that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the waters devour the fiſh thereof. And
God and good men do ſee nothing but good
in all this.</p>
                     <p>22 Wherefore God multiplies the thoughts
of natural delight in the lower <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> as
well as he does thoſe heavenly thoughts and
holy meditations, that the entire Humanity
might be filled with all the degrees of good it
is capable of; and that the <hi>divine Life</hi> might
have ſomething to order and overcome.</p>
                     <p>23 And thus <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Inquiry</hi> made
the fift days progreſſe.</p>
                     <p>24 Nor does God only cauſe the Waters to
bring forth, but the dry Land alſo, ſeveral
living creatures after their kinde, and makes
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115236:41"/>
the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> fruitful, as well as the <hi>Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>25 For God ſaw that they were both good,
and that they were a fit ſubject for the <hi>heavenly</hi>
Man to exerciſe his Rule and Dominion over.</p>
                     <p>26 For God multiplies ſtrength as well as
occaſions to employ it upon. And the divine
Life that hath been under the ſeveral degrees of
the advancement thereof, ſo variouſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
in the five fore-going progreſſes, God
at laſt works up to the height, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
in all things, ſtyles it by the name of his
own Image; the divine Life arrived to this
pitch being the right Image of him indeed.
Thus it is therefore, that at laſt God in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fully manifeſts the <hi>true and perfect Man,</hi>
whereby we our ſelves become good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
who does not only ſee and affect what is
good, but has full power to effect it in all
things: For he has full dominion over the
fiſh of the ſea, can rule and guide the fowls of
the air, and with eaſe command the beaſts of
the field, and what ever moveth upon the
earth.</p>
                     <p>27 Thus God creates Man in his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
making him as powerful a Commander
in his little World, over all the thoughts and
motions of the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> and <hi>Iraſcible,</hi> as
himſelf is over the Natural frame of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
or greater World. And this Image is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115236:41"/>
                        <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> conſiſting of a <hi>clear and free
Underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>divine Affection,</hi> which are
now arrived to that height, that no lower Life
is able to rebel againſt them, and to bring them
under.</p>
                     <p>28 For God bleſſes them and makes them
fruitful, and multiplies their noble off-ſpring
in ſo great and wonderful a meaſure that they
repleniſh the cultivated nature of man with
ſuch an abundance of real <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi>
that there is no <hi>living Figure, Imagination,</hi> or
<hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> or <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
or ignorant <hi>irregularity</hi> in <hi>religious
meditations</hi> and <hi>devotions,</hi> but they are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moderated and rectified. For the whole
Territories of the Humane Nature is every
where ſo well peopled with the ſeveral beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
ſhapes or <hi>Idea's</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi>
the glorious off-ſpring of the <hi>heavenly Adam,
Chriſt,</hi> that no <hi>Animal figure</hi> can offer to move
or wagge amiſſe, but it meets with a proper
Corrector and Re-compoſer of its motions.</p>
                     <p>29 And the divine Life in man being thus
perfected, he is therewith inſtructed by God,
what is his food, as <hi>divine,</hi> and what is the food
of the <hi>Animal Life</hi> in him, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
moſt truly pious, and divine Actions he
has given to the <hi>heavenly Adam</hi> to feed upon,
fulfilling the Will of God in all things, which
is more pleaſant then the choiceſt ſallads, or
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115236:42"/>
moſt delicate fruit the taſte can reliſh.</p>
                     <p>30 Nor is the <hi>Animal Life</hi> quite to be ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and pin'd, but regulated and kept in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and therefore they are to have their
worſer ſort of herbs to feed on; that is, <hi>Natural
Actions</hi> conſentaneous to the Principle from
whence they flow; that that Principle may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
enjoy it ſelf in the liberty of proſecuting
what its nature prompts it unto. And thus the
ſundry Modifications of the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible,</hi>
as alſo the various <hi>Figurations</hi> of
<hi>Religious Melancholy,</hi> and <hi>Natural Devotions,</hi>
(which are the Fiſhes, Beaſts, and Fowls in the
<hi>Animal Nature</hi> of Man) are permitted to feed
and refreſh themſelves in thoſe lower kindes of
Operations they incline us to; provided all be
approved and rightly regulated by the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>31 For the Divine Wiſdome in Man ſees
and approves all things which God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in us, to be very good in their kinde. And
thus <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Inquiry</hi> was the Sixt days

                     </argument>
                     <p>1 THUS the Heavenly and Earthly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

with all the garniſhings belonging to
them.</p>
                     <p>2 So the Divine Wiſdome in the Humane

wrought through the toil of all the ſix days

4 Theſe were the Generations or Pullulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Heavenly and Earthly Nature, of
the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Animal Life</hi> in Man, when God
created them.</p>
                     <p>5 I mean thoſe fruitful Plants, and pleaſant
and uſeful Herbs which he himſelf planted:
For I have deſcrib'd unto you the condition of
a Man taught of God, and inſtructed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht
up by his inward Light, where there is no
external Doctrine to diſtil as the rain, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Gardener to intermeddle in Gods Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</p>
                     <p>6 Only there is a <hi>Fountain of Water,</hi> which
is <hi>Repentance</hi> from dead works, and bubbles up
in the <hi>earthly Adam,</hi> ſo as univerſally to waſh
all the ground.</p>
                     <p>7 And thus the nature of Man being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for further Accompliſhments, God
ſhapes him into his own <hi>Image,</hi> which is <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi>
and <hi>true Holineſſe,</hi> and breathes into
him the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Life:</hi> And this is that <hi>Adam</hi>
which is born of <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8 Hitherto I have ſhewed unto you how
mankinde is raiſed up from one degree of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Light and Righteouſneſſe unto another,
till we come at laſt to that full Command and
Perfection in the divine Life, that a man
may be ſaid in ſome ſort thus to have attain'd
to the Kingdome of Heaven, or found a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
upon Earth. The Narration that follows
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115236:43"/>
ſhall inſtruct you and forewarn you of thoſe
evil courſes, whereby man loſes that meaſure
of Paradiſiacal happineſſe God eſtates him in,
even while he is in this world. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Lord God planted a Garden
Eaſtward in <hi>Eden,</hi> and there he put the Man
whom he had made; that is, Man living under
the Intellectual rayes of the Spirit, and being
guided by the morning Light of the Sun of
Righteouſneſſe, is led into a very pleaſant and
ſweet Contentment of minde, and the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a good Conſcience is his great delight.</p>
                     <p>9 And that the ſundry Germinations and
Springings up of the works of Righteouſneſſe
in him is a delectable Paradiſe to him, pleaſing
both the ſight and taſte of that meaſure of
divine Life that is manifeſted in him: But
of all the Plants that grow in him, there is none
of ſo ſoveraign virtue, as that in the midſt of
this Garden; to wit, the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> which is,
a <hi>Sincere Obedience to the Will of God:</hi> Nor any
that bears ſo lethiferous and poiſonous fruit, as
the <hi>Tree of the Knowledge of good and evil,</hi> which
is, <hi>Diſobedience to the Will of God, as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in Man.</hi> For the pleaſure of the Soul
conſiſts in conforming her ſelf faithfully to
what ſhe is perſwaded in her own Conſcience
is the Will of God, what ever others would
inſinuate to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>10 And all the fruit-bearing Trees of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115236:44"/>
are watered by theſe four Rivers,
which winde along this Garden of Pleaſure,
which indeed are the <hi>four Cardinal Virtues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>11 The name of the firſt is <hi>Piſon,</hi> which is
<hi>Prudence,</hi> not the ſuggeſtions of fleſhly craft
and over-reaching ſubtilty, but the Indications
of the Spirit or divine Intellect, what is fit and
profitable and decorous to be done.</p>
                     <p>12 Here is well tryed and certain approved
<hi>Experience,</hi> healthful Induſtry, and Alacrity
to honeſt Labour.</p>
                     <p>13 And the name of the ſecond River is
<hi>Gihon,</hi> which is <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>14 And the name of the third River is <hi>Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekel,</hi>
which is <hi>Fortitude;</hi> and the fourth Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which is <hi>Temperance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>15 This is the Paradiſe where the Lord
God had placed the Man, that he might further
cultivate it and improve it.</p>
                     <p>16 And the divine Light manifeſted in the
Man, encourag'd the Man to eat of the fruits
of Paradiſe freely, and to delight himſelf in
all manner of holy Underſtanding and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>17 But withall he bade him have a ſpeciall
care how he reliſht his own Will or Power in
any thing, but that he ſhould be obedient to
the manifeſt Will of God in things great
and ſmall, or elſe aſſuredly he would loſe the
life he now lived, and become dead to all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:115236:44"/>
and Truth. So the man had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
care, and his ſoul wrought wholly towards
heavenly and divine things, and heeded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but theſe, his more noble and <hi>Maſculine</hi>
Faculties being after a manner ſolely ſet on
work, but the natural Life (in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
if it were rightly guided, there is no
ſin) being almoſt quite forgot and diſ-regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>18 But the Wiſdome of God ſaw that it
was not good for the ſoul of man, that the
<hi>Maſculine</hi> Powers thereof ſhould thus operate
alone, but that all the Faculties of Life ſhould
be ſet a float, that the whole humane Nature
might be accompliſht with the divine.</p>
                     <p>19 Now the powers of the ſoul working ſo
wholly upwards towards divine things, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Modifications or Figurations of the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life</hi> (which God acting in the frame of
the humane Nature, repreſented to the Man,
whence he had occaſion to view them and
judge of them) by the quick Underſtanding
of Man was indeed eaſily diſcern'd what they
were, and he had a determinate apprehenſion of
every particular Figuration of the <hi>Animall
Life,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20 And did cenſure them, or pronounce of
them, though truly, yet rigidly enough and
ſeverely; but as yet was not in a capacity of
taking any delight in them, there was not any
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115236:45"/>
of them fit for his turn to pleaſe himſelf in.</p>
                     <p>21 Wherefore divine Providence brought
it ſo to paſſe, for the good of the Man, and
that he might more vigorouſly and fully
be enrich'd with delight, that the operations of
the <hi>Maſculine</hi> Faculties of the Soul were for a
while well ſlaked and conſopited; during
which time the Faculties themſelves were
ſomething leſſened or weakned, yet in ſuch a
due meaſure and proportion, that conſidering
the future advantage that was expected, that
was not miſs'd that was taken away, but all as
handſome and compleat as before.</p>
                     <p>22 For what was thus abated in the <hi>Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Faculties,</hi> was compenſated abundantly in
exhibiting to the Man the grateful ſenſe of the
<hi>Feminine;</hi> for there was no way but this to
<hi>Create the Woman,</hi> which is to elicite that <hi>kindly
flowring joy or harmleſſe delight of the Natural
Life, and health of the Body;</hi> which once exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
and joyned with Simplicity and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of Spirit, it is the greateſt part of that
Paradiſe a man is capable of upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>23 And the actuating of the matter being
the moſt proper and eſſential operation of a
ſoul, man preſently acknowledg'd this <hi>kindly
flowring joy of the Body,</hi> of nearer cognation and
affinity with himſelf then any thing elſe he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had yet experience of, and he loved it as
his own life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:115236:45"/>
24 And the Man was ſo mightily taken with
his new Spouſe, which is, <hi>The kindly Joy of the
Life of the Body,</hi> that he concluded with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that any one may with a ſafe Conſcience
forgoe thoſe more earneſt attempts towards the
knowledge of the Eternal God that created
him, as alſo the performance of thoſe more
ſcrupulous injunctious of his Mother the
Church, ſo far forth as they are incompetible
with the <hi>Health and Ioy of the Life of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Body,</hi> and might in ſuch a caſe rather cleave
to his Spouſe, and become one with her; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he ſtill lived in obedience to the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable
Precepts of that Superiour Light and
Power that begot him.</p>
                     <p>25 Nor had <hi>Adam's</hi> Reaſon or Affection
tranſgreſſed at all in this; concluding nothing
but what the <hi>divine Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> would
approve as true. Wherefore <hi>Adam</hi> and his

in the preſence of it without any ſhame

                        <p>1 Adam is tempted by inordinate Pleaſure from the
ſpringing up of the Joy of the invigorated Life of
his Body. 2 A dialogue or diſpute in the minde
of Adam betwixt The inordinate Deſire of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and the natural Joy of the body. 6 The will
of Adam is drawn away to aſſent to inordinate
Pleaſure. 8 Adam having tranſgreſſed, is impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

20 He adheres to the Joy of his body, without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

and monitions of the divine Light. 21 The divine
Light takes leave of Adam therefore for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

that will not ſuffer them to ſettle in wickedneſſe,

                     </argument>
                     <p>1 BUT ſo it came to paſſe that the Life of
the Body being thus invigorated in Man,
ſtraightway the ſlyeſt and ſubtileſt of all the
<hi>Animal Figurations,</hi> the <hi>Serpent,</hi> which is <hi>the

it ſelf into the <hi>Feminine</hi> part of <hi>Adam, viz.
The kindely Joy of the body;</hi> and thus aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man, whiſper'd ſuch ſuggeſtions as theſe
unto him. What a rigid and ſevere thing is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115236:46"/>
this buſineſſe of Religion, and the Law of
God, as they call it, that deprives a man of all
manner of Pleaſure, and cuts him ſhort of all
the contentments of Life?</p>
                     <p>2 But the <hi>Womaniſh</hi> part in <hi>Adam;</hi> to wit,
<hi>The natural and kindly Joy of the body,</hi> could
witneſſe againſt this, and anſwered, We may
delight our ſelves with the operations of all
the Faculties both of ſoul and body, which
God and Nature hath beſtow'd upon us.</p>
                     <p>3. Only we are to take heed of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and of promiſcuouſly following our
own will; but we are ever to conſult with
the Will of God, and the divine Light mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in our Underſtandings, and ſo doe all
things orderly and meaſurably: For if we
tranſgreſſe againſt this, we ſhall die the death,
and loſe the Life of Virtue and Righteouſneſs,
which now is awake in us.</p>
                     <p>4 But the <hi>Serpent,</hi> which is <hi>the inordinate
deſire of Pleaſure,</hi> befooled <hi>Adam,</hi> through the
frailty of his <hi>Womaniſh Faculties,</hi> and made
him believe he ſhould not die; but with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might ſerve the free dictates of Pleaſure
or his own Will and the Will of God, that
<hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> might both rule in him, and be
no ſuch prejudice the one to the other:</p>
                     <p>5 But that his skill and experience in things
will be more enlarg'd, and ſo come nearer to
divine Perfection indeed, and imitate that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115236:47"/>
of Wiſdome which is in God, who
knows all things whatſoever, whether good or
evil.</p>
                     <p>6 This crafty ſuggeſtion ſo inſinuated it
ſelf into <hi>Adams Feminine Faculties,</hi> that his
fleſhly <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> began to be ſo ſtrong, that
it carried the aſſent of his Will away with it,
and the whole Man became a lawleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Creature: For it ſeem'd a very pleaſant

our own Luſts ſuggeſt unto us without

to gain experience and knowledge of

<hi>wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> and made <hi>Adam</hi> earthly
minded.</p>
                     <p>7 But he had not rambled very far in theſe
diſſolute courſes, but his eyes were opened,
and he ſaw the difference, how naked now he

                     <p>8 For the Voice of the divine Light had

ſomething ſlaked: But <hi>Adam</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the preſence of it, but hid himſelf from it,
meditating what he ſhould anſwer by way of
Apology or Excuſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:115236:47"/>
9 But the divine Light perſiſted, and came
up cloſer to him, and upbraided unto him, that
he was grown ſo wilde and eſtranged from her
ſelf, demanding of him in what condition he
was, and wherefore he fled.</p>
                     <p>10 Then <hi>Adam</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſed that
he found himſelf in ſuch a pitiful poor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
condition, that he was aſhamed to appear
in the Preſence of the divine Light; and that
was the reaſon he hid himſelf from it, becauſe
it would ſo manifeſtly upbraid to him his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
and Deformity.</p>
                     <p>11 And the divine Light farther examined
him, how he fell into this ſenſible beggerly
nakedneſſe he was in, charging the ſad event
upon his Diſobedience, that he had fed upon,
and taken a ſurfeit of the fruit of his own Will.</p>
                     <p>12 But <hi>Adam</hi> excuſed his rational faculties,
and ſaid, They did but follow the natural Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
of the <hi>Joy of the Body,</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> that
God himſelf beſtowed upon him for an help
and delight.</p>
                     <p>13 But the divine Light again blamed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
that he kept his <hi>Feminine faculties</hi> in no
better order nor ſubjection, that they ſhould ſo
boldly and overcomingly dictate to him ſuch
things as are not fit. To which he had nothing
to ſay, but that the ſubtile <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Deſire of Pleaſure,</hi> had beguiled both his
faculties, as well <hi>Maſculine</hi> as <hi>Feminine,</hi> his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115236:48"/>
Will and Affection was quite carried away
therewith.</p>
                     <p>14 Then the divine Light began to chaſtiſe
the <hi>Serpent,</hi> in the hearing of <hi>Adam,</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of it, that it was more accurſed, then all the
<hi>Animal Figurations</hi> beſide; and that it crept
baſely upon the belly, tempting to Riot and
Venery, and reliſhing nothing but earth and
dirt. This will always be the guiſe of it, ſo
long as it lives in a man.</p>
                     <p>15 But might I once deſcend ſo far into the
Man, as to take poſſeſſion of his <hi>Feminine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi>
I would ſet the <hi>Natural Joy of the Body</hi>
at defiance with the <hi>Serpent;</hi> and though the
ſubtilty of the <hi>Serpent</hi> may a little wound and
diſorder the Woman for a while, yet her war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
and free operations, ſhe being actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by divine vigour, ſhould afterward quite
deſtroy and extinguiſh the <hi>Seed of the Serpent;</hi>
to wit, the <hi>Operations of the inordinate deſire of
Pleaſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16 And ſhe added farther in the hearing of
<hi>Adam</hi> concerning the <hi>Woman,</hi> as ſhe thus ſtood
diſ-joyn'd from the <hi>heavenly Life,</hi> and was not
obedient to right Reaſon, that by a divine <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſis,</hi>
ſhe ſhould conceive with ſorrow, and
bring forth Vanity; And that her husband,
the <hi>Earthly minded Adam,</hi> ſhould tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her, and weary her out, and foil her; So
that the <hi>kindly Joy of the Health and Life of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115236:48"/>
Body,</hi> ſhould be much depraved, or made faint
and languid, by the unbridled humours, and
impetuous Luxury and Intemperance of the
<hi>Earthly minded Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>17 And to <hi>Adam</hi> he ſaid, who had become
ſo <hi>Earthly minded,</hi> by liſtening to the Voice of
his <hi>deceived Woman,</hi> and ſo acting diſobedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Will of God; That his Fleſh or
Earth was accurſed for his ſake, with labour
and toil ſhould he reap the fruits thereof all the
while he continued in this <hi>Earthly mindedneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18 <hi>Cares</hi> alſo and <hi>Anxieties</hi> ſhall it bring
forth unto him, and his thoughts ſhall be as
baſe as thoſe of the beaſts in the field; he ſhall
ruminate of nothing but what is Earthly and
Senſual.</p>
                     <p>19 With ſweat and anguiſh ſhould he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to ſatisfie his hunger and inſatiableneſſe,
till he returned to the Principle out of which
he was taken; for the <hi>Earthly mindedneſſe</hi> came
from this <hi>animated Earth, the Body;</hi> and is to
ſhrinke up againe into its owne Principle, and
to periſh.</p>
                     <p>20 After all theſe Caſtigations and Premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
of the divine Light, <hi>Adam</hi> was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
awakened to the ſenſe of what was
good, but his minde was ſtraightway taken up
againe with the delights of the fleſh, and dearly
embracing the <hi>Joy of his body,</hi> for all ſhe was
grown ſo inordinate, called her <hi>My Life,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115236:49"/>
ſhe was the nourſing Mother and chiefe
comfort of all men living, and none could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
without her.</p>
                     <p>21 Then the divine Wiſdome put hairy
coates made of the skins of wilde beaſts upon
<hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> and deſervedly reproached
them, ſaying, Now get you gone for a couple
of brutes. And <hi>Adam</hi> would have very gladly
eſcaped ſo, if he might, and ſet up his reſt for
ever in the beaſtiall Nature.</p>
                     <p>22 But the Eternall God of heaven, whoſe
Providence reaches to all things, and whoſe
Mercy is over all his workes, looking upon
<hi>Adam,</hi> perceived in what a pitifull ridiculous
caſe he was; who ſeeking to be like unto God
for knowledge and freedome, made himſelfe
no better then a Beaſt, and could willingly have
lived for ever in that baſer kinde of nature;
Wherefore the Eternall Lord God, in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to <hi>Adam,</hi> deſigned the contrary, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his boldneſſe and curioſity that made him
tranſgreſſe, Behold, ſayes he, <hi>Adam</hi> is become
like one of us, knowing Good and Evill: and
can of himſelfe enlarge his pleaſure, and create
new Paradiſes of his owne, which forſooth muſt
have alſo their <hi>Tree of Life</hi> or <hi>Immortality:</hi> and
<hi>Adam</hi> would for ever live in this fooliſh ſtate
he hath plac'd himſelfe in.</p>
                     <p>23 But the Eternall Lord God would not
ſuffer <hi>Adam</hi> to take up his reſt in the Beaſtial
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115236:49"/>
delight, which he had choſen, but drove him
out of this <hi>falſe Paradiſe,</hi> which he would have
made to himſelf, and ſet him to cultivate his
<hi>fleſhly members,</hi> out of which his <hi>Earthly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe</hi>
was taken.</p>
                     <p>24 I ſay, he forcibly drove out <hi>Adam</hi> from
this <hi>Paradiſe of Luxury;</hi> nor could he ſettle
perpetually in the brutiſh Life, becauſe the
<hi>Cherubim</hi> with the flaming ſword that turned
every way, beat him off; that is, the <hi>Manly
Faculties</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> met him ever
and anon in his brutiſh purpoſes, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him ſo of his folly, that he could not ſet
up his reſt for ever in this beſtial condition.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Cabbala's</hi> thou haſt read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all likelihood ſo ſtrange and
unexpected, eſpecially the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,
that the <hi>Defence</hi> it ſelf, which ſhould
cure and ceſe thy amazement, may not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in any paſſage thereof, any further ſcruple
or offence, I thought fit a while to interrupt
thee, that whatever I conjecture may leſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,
may afore-hand be ſtrengthned by this
ſhort Preface.</p>
                  <p>And for my own part I cannot preſage what
may be in any ſhew of Reaſon alledged by any
man, unleſſe it be, The unuſual myſterie of
Numbers; The uſing of the authority of the
Heathen in Explication of Scripture; The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alſo of Miracles done by them for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirming their authority; and laſtly, the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115236:52"/>
ſtrangeneſs of the Philoſophical Concluſions
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Myſterie of Numbers,</hi> that
this ancient Philoſophy of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be
wrapped up in it, will not ſeem improbable, if we
conſider that the <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the Creation was
conſerved in the hands of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his
family, who was famous for <hi>Mathematicks,</hi>
(of which <hi>Arithmetick</hi> is a neceſſary part)
firſt amongſt the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and that after he
taught the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> the ſame arts, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians
write. Beſides Prophetical and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical
writings, that it is uſual with them
to hide their ſecrets, as under the alluſions of
Names and Etymologies, ſo alſo under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrations
of Numbers, it is ſo notoriouſly
known, and that in the very Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that it needs no proof; I will inſtance
but in that one eminent example of the number
of the Beaſt 666.</p>
                  <p>As for citing the Heathen Writers ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
you are to conſider that they are the
wiſeſt and the moſt virtuous of them, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch as the Fathers ſay, had their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115236:52"/>
from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, as <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
and <hi>Plato,</hi> or elſe the Diſciples or
Friends of theſe Philoſophers. And therefore
I thought it very proper to uſe their Teſtimony
in a thing that they ſeem'd to be ſo fit witneſſes
of for the main, as having receiv'd the <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala</hi>
from the ancient Prophets; Though I
will not deny, but they have mingled their own
fooleries with it, either out of the wantonneſſe
of their Fancy, or miſtake of Judgement;
Such as are the Tranſmigration of Humane
Souls into Brutes; An utter abſtinence from
Fleſh; Too ſevere reproaches againſt the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the Body; Vilification of Marriage, and
the like; which is no more Argument againſt
the main drift of the <hi>Cabbala,</hi> then unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
ſuperſtitious Opinions, and Practiſes
of ſome deceived Churches are againſt the ſolid
grounds of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>Again, I do not alledge Philoſophers alone,
but as occaſion requires, <hi>Fathers,</hi> and which
I conceive as valid in this caſe, the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Rabbins,</hi> who in things where prejudice
need not blinde them, I ſhould think as fit as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115236:53"/>
any, to confirm a <hi>Cabbaliſtical ſenſe,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if there be a general conſent of them, and
that they do not write their private fancy, but
the minde of their whole Church.</p>
                  <p>Now if any ſhall take offence at <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
his Scholars, ſwearing as is conceived by
their Maſter that taught them the myſtery of
the <hi>Tetractys,</hi> (as you ſhall underſtand more
at large in the Explication of the fourth days
work) I must profeſs that I my ſelf am not
a little offended with it. But that high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
they bore to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as it is
a ſign of Vanity, and ſome kind of Superſtition
in them; ſo is it alſo no leſſe an Argument of
a ſtupendious meaſure of knowledge and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
in <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelf, that he ſhould
extort from them ſo great honour, and that his
Memory ſhould be ſo ſacred to them. Which
profound knowledge and ſanctity he having
got by converſing with the <hi>Jewiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
it ultimately tends to the renown of
that Church, and conſequently to the Chriſtian,
which inherits thoſe holy Oracles which were
firſt peculiar to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:115236:53"/>
But what the followers of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
tranſgreſſed in, is no more to be imputed to
him, then the Superſtitions exhibited to the
<hi>Virgin Mary</hi> can be laid to her charge. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
it may be a queſtion whether in that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorick</hi>
Oath, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they did not
ſwear by God the firſt Author of the <hi>Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and that myſterious Explication of the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trctys,</hi>
that is indeed, of all knowledge Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Natural, who firſt gave it to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and then revived or confirmed it again
to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Or if it muſt be underſtood of
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> why may it not be look'd upon as
a civill Oath, or Aſſeveration, ſuch as <hi>Joſeph's</hi>
ſwearing by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by their Honours? neither of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
for my own part I can allow or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
my ſelf that they are meerly Civill, but
touch upon Religion, or rather Idolatrous Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Miracles Pythagoras</hi> did, though
I do not believe all that are recorded of him are
true, yet thoſe that I have recited I hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
enough, they being not unbecoming the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115236:54"/>
worth of the Perſon: but thoſe that ſuppoſe
the tranſmigration of Humane Souls into the
Bodies of Beaſts, I look upon as Fables, and
his whiſpering into the ear of an Oxe to forbear
to eat Beans, as a loudly. But it ſeems very
conſonant unto Divine Providence, that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
having got the knowledge of the holy
<hi>Cabbala,</hi> which God imparted to <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſhould countenance it before
the Nations by enabling him to do Miracles.
For ſo thoſe noble and ancient Truths were
more firmly radicated amongſt the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of <hi>Greece,</hi> and happily preſerved to this
very day.</p>
                  <p>Nor can his being carried in the Air make
him ſuſpected to be a meer Magician or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer,
ſith the holy Prophets and Apoſtles
themſelves have been tranſported after that
manner, as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> from <hi>Jewry</hi> to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
and <hi>Philip</hi> after he had baptiz'd the
Eunuch to <hi>Azotus.</hi> But for my own part, I think
working of Miracles is one of the leaſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Man, and is nothing at all to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of him that does them, or rather ſeems
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115236:54"/>
to do them: For if they be Miracles, he does them
not, but ſome other power or perſon diſtinct from
him. And yet here Magicians and Witches
are greatly delighted in that this power is in
ſome ſort attributed to themſelves, and that they
are admired of the people, as is manifeſt in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus.</hi> But thus to lord it and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer
in the Attribute of Power with the
Prince of the Air, what is it but meer Pride,
the moſt irrational and provoking vice that is?
And with what groſſe folly is it here conjoin'd,
they priding and pleaſing themſelves in that
they ſometimes do that, or rather ſuffer that,
which Herns and wlde Geeſe, and every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Fowl can do of it ſelf; that is, mount
aloft and glide through the fleeting Air? But
holy and good men know that the greateſt ſweet
and perfection of a virtuous Soul, is the kindly
accompliſhment of her own Nature in true
Wiſdom and divine Love. And if any thing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
happen to them, or be done by them, it
is, that that worth &amp; knowledg that is in them
may be taken notice of, and that God thereby
may be glorified, whoſe witneſſes they are.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115236:55"/>
But no other acceſsion of happineſſe accrues to
them from this, but that hereby they may be
in a better capacity of making others happy,
which I confeſſe I conceive here <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
his caſe.</p>
                  <p>And that men may not indulge too much to
their own <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> which
they ordinarily call <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> if they be ſo
great Lights to the world as they pretend, and
ſo high that they will not condeſcend to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of humane Reaſon, it were deſirable
that ſuch perſons would keep in their heat to
concoct the crudities of their own Conceptions,
till the warrant of a Miracle call them out; and
ſo they might more rightfully challenge an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
from the people, as being authoriſed
from above to tell us ſomething we knew not
before, nor can ſo well know, as believe, the
main Argument being not Reaſon but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for the ſtrangeneſs of the Philoſophical
Concluſions themſelves, It were the ſtrangeſt
thing of all, if at firſt ſight they did not ſeem
very Paradoxical and ſtrange; Elſe why ſhould
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115236:55"/>
they be hid and conceal'd from the Vulgar, but
that they did tranſcend their capacity, and were
overmuch diſproportioned to their belief? But
in the behalf of theſe <hi>Cabbaliſtical</hi> concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I will only note thus much, that they are
ſuch that ſuppoſing them true (which I ſhall
no longer aſſert, then till ſuch time as ſome able
<hi>Philoſopher</hi> or <hi>Theologer</hi> ſhall convince
me of their falſhood) there is nothing of any
grand conſideration in <hi>Theology</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi>
that will not eaſily be extricated by this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi>
an eminent part whereof is the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Prae-exiſtency
of Souls.</hi> The evidence of the former of
which Truths is ſuch, that it has wonne the
aſſent of the moſt famous <hi>Mathematicians</hi>
of our later Ages; and the reaſonableneſſe of
the latter is no leſſe: There having never been
any Philoſopher that held the Soul of Man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
but he held that it did alſo prae-exiſt.</p>
                  <p>But Religion not being curious to expoſe
the full view of Truth to the people, but only
what was moſt neceſſary to keep them in the
fear of a Deity and obedience to the Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115236:56"/>
her ſelf with what meerly concerned the
ſtate of the Soul after the diſſolution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
concealing what ever was conceivable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her condition before. Now I ſay, it is
a pretty priviledge of falſhood, (if this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
be falſe) and very remarkable, that it
ſhould better ſute with the <hi>Attributes of
God,</hi> the <hi>viſible events of Providence,</hi>

appeal to, as if they were indeed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

But I think I may speak it not without

of the Literal Text, which is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ſtrongly rooted themſelves in the minds of ſome,
that they take that ſenſe to be more true,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115236:57"/>
then the true meaning of the text indeed. Which
is plain in no meaner a perſon then one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;

the world as a Tent according to the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Law-givers that have profeſſed themſelves to
have received their Laws from either God or
ſome good Angel. Reaſons why Moſes began
his Hiſtory with the Creation of the world. The
Sun and Moon the ſame with the Aegyptians
Oſiris and Iſis, and how they came to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
for Gods. The Apotheoſis of mortal
men, ſuch as Bacchus and Ceres, how it firſt
came into the world. That the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſpeaks ordinarily in Philoſophical things
according to the ſenſe and imagination of the
Vulgar. That there is a Philoſophical ſenſe that
lies hid in the letter of the three firſt Chapters
of Geneſis. That there is a Moral or Myſtical
ſenſe not only in theſe three Chapters, but in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other places of the Scripture.</p>

the Author of this book of

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115236:58"/>
mainly in reference to that publick indue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which at the very firſt ſight he will
appear admirable, <hi>viz.</hi> As a <hi>Politician</hi> or a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</hi>
In which his skill was ſo great, that even
in the judgement of Heathen Writers he had
the preheminence above all the reſt. <hi>Diodorus</hi>
has placed him in the head of his Catalogue of
the moſt famous Law-givers under the name
of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, if <hi>Iuſtin Martin</hi> be not miſtaken, or
if he be, at leaſt he bears them company that
are reputed the beſt, reſerv'd for the laſt and
moſt notable inſtance of thoſe that entituled
their Laws divine, and made themſelves ſpokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
betwixt God and the People. This
<hi>Mneves</hi> is ſaid to receive his Laws from <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
as <hi>Minos</hi> from <hi>Iupiter, Lycurgus</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,
Zathrauſtes</hi> from his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his
good <hi>Genius, Zamolxis</hi> from <hi>Veſta,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
from <hi>Iao;</hi> that is, <hi>Iehovah.</hi>

But
he ſpeaks like a meer Hiſtorian in the buſineſs.
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the word which he boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes
to the diminution of all their Authorities
promiſcuouſly. For he ſays they feigned they
received Laws from theſe Deities; and addes
the reaſon of it too, but like an errant Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or an incredulous Philoſopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Whether it be,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that they
judged it an admirable and plainly divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that redounded unto the profit of a multitude,
or whether they conceived that hereby the people
looking upon the greatneſſe, and ſupereminence of
their Law-givers, would be more obedient to their
Laws.</hi> That ſaying in the Schools is not ſo
trivial as true. <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad
modum recipientis, Every thing is as it is taken,</hi>
or at leaſt appears to be ſo. The tincture of
our own Natures ſtains the appearance of all
objects. So that I wonder not that <hi>Diodorus
Siculus,</hi> a man of a meer Political Spirit, (as it
is very plain how neer Hiſtory and Policy are
akin) ſhould count the receiving of Laws from
ſome Deity rather a piece of prudential fraud
and political forgery, then reality and truth.</p>
                  <p>But to leave <hi>Diodorus</hi> to his <hi>Ethniciſme</hi> and
<hi>Incredulity;</hi> as for us that ought to believe
Scripture, if we will not gain-ſay the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Greek Text, we ſhall not only be
fully perſwaded of <hi>Moſes</hi> his receiving of Laws
from Gods own mouth, but have ſome hints
to believe that ſomething Analogical to it
may have come to paſſe in other Law-givers,
Deut. 32. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>When the moſt High divided the Nations,
when he ſeparated the ſons of</hi> Adam, <hi>he ſet the
bounds of the Nations according to the number of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115236:59"/>
the Angels of God, but</hi> Jacob <hi>was the portion of
Iehovah,</hi> that is, <hi>Iao,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
but that as the great Angel of the
Covenant, (he whom <hi>Philo</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
That is, <hi>the eldeſt of the Angels, the
Archangel, the word, the Beginning, the Name
of God,</hi> which is <hi>Iehovah)</hi> I ſay, that as he gave
Laws to his charge, ſo the Tutelar Angels of
other nations might be the Inſtructers of thoſe
that they rais'd up to be Law-givers to their
charge; Though in proceſſe of time the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that were at firſt under the Government
of good Angels, by their lewdneſſe and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
might make themſelves obnoxious
to the power and deluſion of thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as they are called, <hi>deceitful and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
devils.</hi> But this is but a digreſſion; That
which I would briefly have intimated is this,
That <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Law-giver of the Jews,
was a man inſtructed of God himſelf to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and true Policy. And therefore I make
account if we will but with diligence ſearch,
we may ſurely finde the foot-ſteps of unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate
Policy in all the paſſages of the
whole <hi>Pentateuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here in the very entrance it will offer it
ſelf unto our view: Where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſuch as that noble Spirit of <hi>Plato</hi> deſires all
Governors of Commonwealths ſhould be, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115236:59"/>
has in his Epiſtle to <hi>Dion</hi> and his friends fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
that mankinde will never ceaſe to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
till ſuch time as either true and right
Philoſophers rule in the Commonwealth, or
thoſe that do rule, apply themſelves to true and
ſound Philoſophy. And what is <hi>Moſes</hi> his
<hi>Bereſhith,</hi> but a fair invitation thereto, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
at leaſt the whole fabrick of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and conſpicuous furniture of the viſible
world? As if he dare appeal unto the whole
Aſſembly of Gods Creation, to the voice of
the great Univerſe, if what he propounds to
his people over whom God hath ſet him, be
not righteous and true; And that by acting
according to his Precepts, they would but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themſelves <hi>Coſmopolitas, true Citizens of
the world, and Loyal Subjects to God and Nature.</hi>
It is <hi>Philo's</hi> interpretation upon the place,
which how true it is in <hi>Moſes</hi> vailed, I will not
here diſpute: that it is moſt true in <hi>Moſes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
Chriſt our Lord, is true without all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and controverſie. And whoſoever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
him, follows a Law juſtified by God and
the whole Creature, they ſpeaking in ſeveral
dialects the minde of their Maker. It is a
truth and life that is the ſafety of all Nations,
and the earneſt expectation of the ends of the
Earth; <hi>Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for
ever,</hi> whoſe dominion and Law neither time
nor place doth exclude. But to return to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:115236:60"/>
Another reaſon no leſſe conſiderable, why
that holy and wiſe Law-giver <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould
begin with the Creation of the world, is this:
The Laws and Ordinances which he gave to
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were given by him as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as <hi>Statutes received from God.</hi> And
therefore the great argument and incitement
to Obedience ſhould lie in this firſt and higheſt
Law-giver, God himſelf, the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
whoſe Wiſdome, Power, and Goodneſſe could
not better be ſet out then by aſcribing the
Creation of the whole viſible world unto him.
So that for his Power he might be feared, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
for his Wiſdome, and finally, for his
Goodneſſe be loved, adored, and Deified: That
as he was truly in himſelf the moſt high God,
ſo he ſhould be acknowledged of the people
to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>For certainly there is nothing that doth ſo
win away, nay, raviſh or carry captive the
mindes of poor mankinde, as Bounty and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.
All men loving themſelves moſt
affectionately, and moſt of all the meaneſt and
baſeſt ſpirits, whoſe ſouls are ſo far from being
a little rais'd and releas'd from themſelves, that
they do impotently and impetuouſly cleave
and cling to their dear carkaſes. Hence have
they out of the ſtrong reliſh, and favour of
the pleaſures and conveniencies thereof made
no ſcruple of honouring them for gods, who
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115236:60"/>
have by their induſtry, or by good luck produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
any thing that might conduce for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the happineſſe and comfort of
the body.</p>
                  <p>From hence it is that the Sun and Moon
have been accounted for the two prime Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by Idolatrous Antiquity, <hi>viz.</hi> from that
ſenſible good they conferred upon hungry
mankinde. The one watering as it were the
Earth by her humid influence; the other ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the fruit of the ground by his warm rayes,
and opening dayly all the hid treaſures of the
viſible world by his glorious approach, pleaſing
the ſight with the variety of Natures objects,
&amp; chearing the whole body by his comfortable
heat. To theſe as to the moſt conſpicuous Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
to mankinde, was the name <gap reason="foreign">

conceived Deities were in perpetual motion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two are the Aegyptians <hi>Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi>
and five more are added to them as very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Benefactors, but ſubordinate to theſe two,
and Dependents of them. And in plain ſpeech
they are theſe. <hi>Fire, Spirit, Humidity, Siccity,</hi>

That which could pleaſe or pleaſure degenerate
mankinde in the Body, (they having loſt the
Image of God in their Souls, and become
meer brutes after a manner) that muſt be their
God.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it was neceſſary for <hi>Moſes</hi> having
to deal with ſuch Terreſtrial Spirits, Sons of
Senſe and Corporeity, to propoſe to them <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>
as Maker of this Senſible and Corporeal
world, that whatever ſweet they ſuck out of
the varieties thereof, they may attribute to
him, as the firſt Fountain and Author, without
whom neither they nor any thing elſe had
been, that thereby they might be ſtirred up to
praiſe his Name, and accompliſh his Will
revealed by his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> unto them. And
this was true and ſound Prudence, aiming at
nothing but the glory of God, and the good of
the poor ignorant people.</p>
                  <p>And from the ſame Head ſprings the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his delivering of the Creation; that is,
accommodately to the apprehenſion of the
meaneſt: not ſpeaking of things according to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115236:61"/>
their very Eſſence and real Nature, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their appearances to us. Not ſtarting
of high and intricate Queſtions, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them by ſubtile Arguments, but famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
and condeſcendingly ſetting out the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the moſt eaſie and obvious
conceits they themſelves had of thoſe things
they ſaw in the world; omitting even thoſe
groſſer things that lay hid in the bowels of the
Earth, as Metals, and Minerals, and the like, as
well as thoſe things that fall not at all under
Senſe, as thoſe immaterial Subſtances, Angels,
or Intelligences. Thus fitly has the Wiſdome
and Goodneſſe of God accommodated the
outward <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Scripture, to the moſt
narrow and ſlow apprehenſion of the Vulgar.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth it therefore follow that the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
muſt not be true, becauſe it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the appearance of things to Senſe and
obvious Fancie; for there is alſo a Truth of
Appearance, according to which Scripture
moſt what ſpeaks in Philoſophical matters.</p>
                  <p>And this Poſition is the main key, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and I hope ſhall hereafter plainly prove,
whereby <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>Bereſhith</hi> may according to
the outward and literal ſenſe be underſtood
without any difficulty or claſhing one part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another. And my task at this time will
be very eaſie, for it is but tranſcribing what I
have already elſewhere occaſionally publiſhed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115236:62"/>
and recovering of it into its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore I ſay, that it is a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

brim to brim, round in compaſſe, and five cubits
the height thereof, and a line of thirty cubits did
compaſſe it round about.</hi> A thing plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that the Diameter ſhould be ten cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and the Circumference but thirty. But
it pleaſeth the Spirit of God here to ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common uſe and opinion of
men, and not according to the ſubtilty of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>
his demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>Pſalm 19. In them hath he ſet a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
for the Sunne, which as a Bridegroom
cometh out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a

Calvin</hi> obſerves, is ſpoken according to the
rude apprehenſion of the Vulgar, whom <hi>David</hi>
ſhould in vain have endevoured to teach the
myſteries of Aſtronomy. And therefore he
makes no mention of the courſe of the Sunne
in the nocturnal Hemiſphere. I'le adde but

ſtand thou ſtill upon</hi> Gibeon, <hi>and thou Moon in
the Valley of Ajalon;</hi> where it is manifeſt that
<hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſpeaks not according to the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
truth of the thing, but according to ſenſe
and appearance. For ſuppoſe the Sun placed,
and the Moon, at the beſt advantage you can,
ſo that they leave not their natural courſe, they
were ſo far from being one over <hi>Ajalon,</hi> and
the other over <hi>Gibeon,</hi> that they were in very

of many Fathers, and Modern Divines, as
<hi>Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Auguſtine, Bernard, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi>
and the reſt. But it is already manifeſt

                     </gap>his: That there is a various Intertexture of
Theoſophical and Philoſophical Truths, many
Phyſical and Metaphyſical Theorems hinted
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o us ever and anon, through thoſe words that
at firſt ſight ſeem to bear but an ordinary
groſſe ſenſe, I mean eſpecially in theſe three
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115236:63"/>
firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> And a man will be
the better aſſured of the truth of this Poſition,
if he do but conſider, That the Literal Text
of <hi>Moſes</hi> that ſets out the Creation of the
world, and offers reaſons of ſundry notable
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, bears altogether a moſt
palpable compliance with the meer rude and
ignorant conceits of the Vulgar. Wherefore
the Argument of theſe three Chapters being
ſo Philoſophical as it is, it ſeems unworthy of
that knowing Spirit of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or of Religion
it ſelf, that he ſhould not contrive under the
external contexture of this Narration, ſome
very ſingular and choice Theorems of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philoſophy and Metaphyſicks; which his
pious and learned ſucceſſors ſhould be able by
ſome ſecret Traditionary Doctrine or <hi>Cabbala</hi>
to apply to his outward Text.</p>
                  <p>For what an excellent proviſion is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
ſuch of the people whoſe pregnancy of parts
and wit might make them reſt unſatisfied, as
well in the Moral Allegory (into which they
are firſt to be initiated) as in the outward let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it ſelf; and alſo their due <hi>obedience, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>integrity</hi> of life, make them fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome more ſecret Philoſophick <hi>Cabbala</hi>
from the mouth of the knowing Prieſt; The
ſtrange unexpected richneſſe of the ſenſe
whereof, and highneſſe of Notion ſuddenly
ſhining forth, by removing aſide of the vail,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115236:64"/>
might ſtrike the ſoul of the honeſt Jew with
unexpreſſible pleaſure and amazement, and fill
his heart with joy and thankfulneſſe to God
for the good tidings therein contained, and
conciliate greater reverence then ever to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and to Religion.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſuch a <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala</hi> as
this being ſo convenient and deſirable, and
men in all Ages having profeſſed their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of ſolid and ſevere Philoſophy in this
ſtory of the Creation by their ſeveral attempts
thereupon, it ſeems to me abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that <hi>Moſes</hi> and his ſucceſſors were furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with ſome ſuch like <hi>Cabbala;</hi> which I
am ſtill the more eaſily induced to believe,
from that credible fame that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and
<hi>Plato</hi> had their Philoſophy from <hi>Moſes</hi> his
Text, which it would not ſo eaſily have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
unto them, had they had no aſſiſtance
from either <hi>Iewiſh</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prophet or
Prieſt to expound it.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt Rule that I would lay
down is this: That Natural Things, Perſons,
Motions, and Actions, declared or ſpoken of
in Scripture, admit of alſo many times a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,
Moral, or Allegorical ſenſe. This is
worth the proving it concerning our Souls
more nearly then the other. I know this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ſenſe is as great a fear to ſome faint and
unbelieving hearts, as a <hi>Spectre</hi> or <hi>Night-ſpirit.</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115236:64"/>
But it is a thing acknowledged by the moſt
wiſe, moſt pious, and moſt rational of the
<hi>Iewiſh</hi> Doctors; I will inſtance in one who is
<hi>ad inſtar omnium, Moſes Aegyptius,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the divine Oracles to <hi>Apples of Gold in
Pictures of Silver:</hi> For that the outward Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
is very comely as Silver curiouſly cut
thorough and wrought, but the inward Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
or Myſtical ſenſe is the Gold more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and more beautiful, that gliſters through
thoſe Cuttings and Artificial Carvings in the
Letter.</p>
                  <p>I will endevour to prove this point by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
paſſages in Scripture, <hi>Pſalm 25.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
The eaſie and genuine
ſenſe of theſe words is, <hi>The ſecret of the Lord
is for them that fear him, and his Covenant is
to make them know it,</hi> viz. <hi>his Secret,</hi> which
implies that the Myſterie of God lies not bare
to falſe and adulterous eyes, but is hid and
wrapped up in decent coverings from the
ſight of Vulgar and Carnal men. That his
<hi>Secrets</hi> are, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> anſwered to <hi>Alexander</hi>
concerning his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>,
<hi>publiſhed and not publiſhed.</hi> And
our Saviour himſelf, though all Goodneſſe, was
not ſo prodigal of his Pearls as to caſt them to
Swine. To them that were without he ſpake
Parables. And upon the ſame Principles cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115236:65"/>
it is not a whit unreaſonable, to conceive
<hi>Moſes</hi> to write Types and Allegories. And
we have ſufficient ground to think ſo from that
of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor. ch. 10.</hi> where when he
hath in ſhort reckoned up ſome of the main
paſſages that befell the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> (which yet no man
that hath any faith or the fear of God before
his eyes, will deny to be a reall Hiſtory) he
cloſes with this expreſſion <hi>All theſe things being
Types befell them, but were written for our inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> So
<hi>Galat.</hi> ch. 4. The Hiſtory of <hi>Abrahams</hi> having
two ſons <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaak,</hi> the one of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
the other of the free, <hi>viz. Agar</hi> and
<hi>Sara,</hi> the ſame Apoſtle there ſpeaks out, <hi>that
they are an Allegory,</hi> v. 24.</p>
                  <p>I might adde many other paſſages to this
purpoſe, but I will only raiſe one conſideration
concerning many Hiſtories of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then conclude. If ſo be the Spirit of
God meant not ſomething more by them then
the meer Hiſtory, I mean ſome uſeful and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Truth involved in them, they will be ſo
far from ſtirring us up to Piety, that they may
prove ill Precedents for falſeneſs and injurious
dealings.</p>
                  <p>For what an eaſie thing is it for a man to fancy
himſelf an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and then to circumvent his
honeſt neighbours under the notion of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians?</hi>

<hi>Siſera</hi> Captain of <hi>Jabins</hi> hoſt being worſted by
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> fled on his feet to the Tent of <hi>Jael,</hi> the
wife of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite,</hi> who was in league and

ſo courteous as to meet <hi>Siſera,</hi> and invite him
into her Tent, ſaying, Turn in my Lord, turn
in to me, Fear not. And when he had turned
in unto her into the Tent, ſhe covered him

with a mantle: And he ſaid unto her, Give me
I pray thee a little water to drink; And ſhe
opened a bottle of Milk, and gave him drink,

and ſhe ſuddenly ſo ſoon as he fell aſleep
drove a nail with an hammer into his temples,
and betrayed his Corps to the will of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

pious prudence of this holy Law-giver, ſhewing how
every paſſage makes for greater faith in God, and

                     <p>Wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> having in his minde (as is plain

from the beginning of the world to his own
time, it is very eaſie and obvious to conceive, that in
reference to what he ſhould after add, he ſaid, <hi>In the
beginning:</hi> As if the whole frame of his thoughts lay
thus. Firſt of all, God made the Heavens, and the
Earth, with all that they contain, the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, the Day and Night, the Plants, and living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that were in the Air, Water, and on the Earth,
and after all theſe he made <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> begot

                     <p>And this ſenſe I conceive is more eaſie and natural

                        <hi>Verſ. 2.</hi> In the firſt verſe there was a ſummary
Propoſal of the whole Creation in thoſe two main
parts of it, <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> Now he begins the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115236:68"/>
particular proſecution of each days work. But it is
not needful for him here again to inculcate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Earth: For it is the laſt word he ſpake
in his general Propoſal, and therefore it had been harſh
or needleſs to have repeated it preſently again. And
that's the reaſon why before the making of the Earth,
there is not prefixed, <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Let there be
an Earth.</hi> Which I conceive has impoſed upon the
ignorance and inconſiderateneſs of ſome, ſo as to
make them believe that this confuſed muddy heap
which is called <hi>the Earth,</hi> was an Eternal Firſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
independent of God, and never created by him:
Which if a man appeal to his own Faculties, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
as I ſhall again intimate when I come to

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſenſe therefore is, That the Earth was made
firſt, which was covered with water, and on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was the wind, and in all this a thick darkneſs.
And God was in this dark, windy and wet Night.
So that this Globe of Earth, and Water, and Wind,
was but one dark Tempeſt and Sea-ſtorm, a Night of
confuſion and tumultuous Agitation. For <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Verſ. 3.</hi> But in the midſt of this tempeſtuous dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
God intending to fall to his work, doth as it
were light his Lamp, or ſet up himſelf a Candle in
this dark Shop. And what ever hitherto hath been
mentioned, are words that ſtrike the Fancy and Senſe
ſtrongly, and are of eaſie perception to the rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whom every dark and ſtormy Night may well

the ſpirits of Man.</p>
                     <p>And that Day-light is a thing independent of the
Sun, as well as the Night of the Stars, is a conceit
wondrous ſutable to the imaginations of the Vulgar,
as I have my ſelf found out by converſing with them.
They are alſo prone to think, unleſſe there be a ſenſible

they are ſo ſtiffely ſtretched, that they will ſtrongly
bear againſt the weight of the upper waters; ſo that
they are not able to break them down, and therewith
to drown the world. Which conceit as it is eaſie and
agreeable with the fancy of the people, ſo it is ſo far
from doing them any hurt, that it will make them
more ſenſible of the divine Power and Providence,
who thus by main force keeps off a Sea of water that
hangs over their heads, which they diſcern through
the tranſparent Firmament, (for it looks blew as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Seas do) and would ruſh at once upon them
and drown them, did not the Power of God, and the
ſtrength of the <hi>Firmament</hi> hold it off.</p>

                        <hi>Verſ. 7.</hi> See what hath been already ſaid upon the

theſe upper waters makes them ſtill the more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
and ſo are greater ſpurs to devotion: For as they
are brought ſo near as to touch the Earth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
ſo outward ſenſe ſtill being Judge, they are to
be within a ſmall diſtance of the Clouds at the top.
And that theſe upper waters are no higher then ſo, it
is manifeſt from other paſſages in Scripture, that place
the habitation of God but amongſt the Clouds, who
yet is called <hi>the moſt High. Pſalm 104. 3. Deut.

to add any thing more.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 8. <hi>I cannot ſay properly that God ſaw it was
good.</hi> In the whole ſtory of the three firſt Chapters,
it is evident, that God is repreſented in the perſon of
a Man, ſpeaking with a mouth, and ſeeing with eyes.
Hence it is that the <hi>Firmament</hi> being of it ſelf inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> omits the ſaying, that God ſaw it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115236:70"/>
was good: For the nature of the eye is onely to ſee
things viſible.</p>
                     <p>Some ſay, God made Hell the ſecond day, and that
that is the reaſon it was not recorded, that he ſaw it
was good. But if he did not approve of it as good, why
did he make it? However that can be none of the
Literal ſenſe, and ſo impertinent to this preſent <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ver. 10. <hi>And I may now properly ſay,</hi> &amp;c. See
what hath been ſaid already upon verſe the eight.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 11. <hi>Whence you may eaſily diſcern,</hi> &amp;c. This
Obſervation is <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew's,</hi> which you may read

                        </gap>. And it was very fit
for <hi>Moſes</hi> who in his Law, which he received from
God, does ſo much inſiſt upon temporal bleſſings, and
eating of the good things of the Land, as a reward of
their obedience, to lay down ſuch principles as ſhould
beget a firm belief of the abſolute power of God over
Nature. That he could give them rain, and fruitful
ſeaſons, and a plentiful year when he pleaſed; when
as he could cauſe the Earth to bring forth without
rain, or any thing elſe to further her births, as he did
at the firſt Creation. The Meditation whereof might
well cauſe ſuch an holy reſolution as that in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Habakkuk, Although the fig-tree ſhall not
bloſſome, neither fruit be in the Vines, the labour of
the Olive fail, and the fields yeeld no meat; yet I will

But that prudent and pious caution of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
againſt Idolatry, how requiſite it was, is plain if
we conſider that the power of the Sun is ſo manifeſt,
and his operation ſo ſenſible upon the Earth for the

he hath generally drawn aſide the rude and ſimple
Heathen to idolize him for a God: And their nimble

if not rightly underſtood, vain and ridiculous; yet
theirs ſeem little better to me, that imagine God a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

and ſo confine him to Heaven, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
ſeems to do, if he be the Author of that book
<hi>De Mundo:</hi> For it is a contradiction to the very <hi>Idea</hi>
of God to be finite, and conſequently to have Figure
or Parts. But it is ſo difficult a thing for the rude
multitude to venture at a Notion of a Beeing <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial</hi>
and <hi>Infinite,</hi> that it ſeems their advantage to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115236:72"/>
conceive of God as of ſome all-powerful Perſon, that
can do what ever he pleaſeth, can make Heavens
and Earths, and beſtow his bleſſings in what meaſure
and manner he liſts, and what is chief of all, if need
be, can perſonally appear to them, can chide them, and
rebuke them, and, if they be obſtinate, doe horrible
vengeance upon them. This I ſay, will more ſtrongly
ſtrike the inward Senſe and Imagination of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
then <hi>Omnipotency</hi> placed in a <hi>Thin, Subtile, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
Immaterial</hi> Beeing, of which they can have no
perception at all, nor any tolerable conceit.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it being requiſite for the ignorant, to be
permitted to have ſome finite and figurate apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, what can be more fit then the ſhape of a
Man in the higheſt excellencies that it is capable of,
for <hi>Beauty, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Bigneſſe.</hi> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſay</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of God after this Notion,
<hi>God ſits upon the circle of the Earth, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof are as Graſhoppers;</hi> intimating that men
to God bear as little proportion, as Graſhoppers to a
man when he ſits on the graſſe amongſt them. And
now there being this neceſſity of permitting the people
ſome ſuch like apprehenſions as this, concerning God,
(and it is true Prudence, and pious Policy to comply
with their weakneſs for their good) there was the
moſt ſtrict injunctions laid upon them againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and worſhipping of Images that might be.</p>
                     <p>But if any one will ſay this was the next way to bring
them into Idolatry, to let them entertain a conceit of
God as in humane ſhape; I ſay it is not any more, then
by acknowledging Man to be God, as our Religion
does, in Chriſt. Nay, I add moreover, that Chriſt
is the true <hi>Deus Figuratus:</hi> And for his ſake was it
the more eaſily permitted unto the <hi>Jews</hi> to think of
God in the ſhape of a Man.</p>

                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115236:72"/>
And that there ought to be ſuch a thing as <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
that is, <hi>God in Humane ſhape,</hi> I think it moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
that he may apparently viſit the Earth, and to
their very outward ſenſes confound the Atheiſt and
miſ-believer at the laſt day. As he witneſſeth of
himſelf, <hi>The Father judges none, but he hath given
all Judgement unto the Son.</hi> And, <hi>that no man can ſee
the Father, but as he is united unto the Son.</hi> For the
Eternal God is <hi>Immaterial</hi> and <hi>Inviſible</hi> to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſenſes: But he hath thought good to treat with
us both in mercy and judgement, by a <hi>Mediator</hi> and
<hi>Vicegerent,</hi> that partakes of our nature as well as his
own. Wherefore it is not at all abſurd for <hi>Moſes</hi> to
ſuffer the <hi>Jews</hi> to conceive of God as in a corporeall

God in that ſhape at the laſt day.</p>

                     <p>To prevent any further trouble in making good the

moſt probable concerning the ſituation thereof, out of
<hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> adding alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
out of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Geographical</hi> Poet. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
therefore we are led by the four Rivers to the
right ſituation of Paradiſe. And <hi>Gihon,</hi> ſaith <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus;</hi>
is <hi>tractus inferior Euphratis illabens in ſinum
Perſicum;</hi> is <hi>a lower tract or ſtream of</hi> Euphrates <hi>that
ſlides into the Perſian Gulph. Piſon</hi> is <hi>Phaſis</hi> or <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitigris,</hi>
that runs through <hi>Havilah,</hi> a region near
<hi>Perſis;</hi> ſo that <hi>Piſon</hi> is a branch of <hi>Tigris,</hi> as <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi>
is of <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Thus <hi>Vatablus.</hi> And that <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi>
may have his <hi>Aethiopia, Cornelius à Lapide</hi>
notes, that the <hi>Madianites</hi> and others near the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
Gulph, are called <hi>Aethiopians;</hi> and therefore he
concludes firſt at large, that Paradiſe was ſeated about
<hi>Moſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> from theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe theſe Regions are called Eaſtern in
Scripture, (which as I have ſaid is to be underſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in reference to <hi>Judea)</hi> according to the rule of
Expoſitors. And the Lord is ſaid to have planted this
Garden of Paradiſe Eaſtward.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe Man being caſt out of Paradiſe
theſe Regions were inhabited firſt, both before the
Floud, (for <hi>Cain</hi> is ſaid to inhabite <hi>Eden, Gen. 4. 16.)</hi>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:115236:74"/>
and alſo after the Floud, as being nearer Paradiſe, and
more fertile, <hi>Gen. 8. 4.</hi> alſo 11. 2.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Paradiſe was in <hi>Eden,</hi> but <hi>Eden</hi> was near
<hi>Haran; Ezek. 27. 23. Haran,</hi> and <hi>Caunuch,</hi> and
<hi>Eden:</hi> but <hi>Haran</hi> was about <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> being a

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Paradiſe is where <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi>

                     <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, there is yet a further probability
alledged, that Paradiſe was about <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115236:74"/>
Countrey being not far diſtant from <hi>Judea.</hi> For it is
the tradition of the Fathers, that <hi>Adam</hi> when he was
ejected out of Paradiſe, having travelled over ſome
parts of the world, that he came at laſt to <hi>Judea,</hi> and
there died, and was buried in a Mount, which his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
becauſe the head of the firſt Man was laid
there, called <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
crucified for the expiation of the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt

ſhould be, it hath ſo venerable aſſertors, as <hi>Cyprian,

as <hi>Cornelius</hi> affirms.</p>
                     <p>But now for the more exact ſituation of Paradiſe,
the ſame Author ventures to place it at the very meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where the City of <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>

                     </p>

Matrimony, &amp; does after a manner encourage them to
that condition: which he does like a right Law-giver

                        <p>1 How much it ſaves the credit of our firſt Parents,
that the Serpent was found the prime Author of the

ſtory of the eaſie delivery of a certain poor woman
of Liguria. 19 That the general calamities that
lie upon mankinde, came by the tranſgreſſion of a

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN this third Chapter, there are cauſes laid down,
of ſome of the moſt notable, and moſt concerning
accidents in Nature. As of the hard travail and toil
upon the ſons of men, to get themſelves a livelihood.
Of the Antipathy betwixt Men and Serpents. Of the
incumbrance of the ground with troubleſome weeds.
Of the ſhame of Venery. Of the pangs of childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing;
and of Death it ſelf. Of all theſe <hi>Moſes</hi>
his wiſdome held fit to give an account accommodate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the capacity of the people. For theſe fall into
that grand Queſtion in Philoſophy, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115236:76"/>
                        <hi>whence ſprung up Evil?</hi> which has exerciſed the wits
of all Ages to this very day. And every fool is able
to make the Queſtion, but few men ſo wiſe, as to be
either able to give, or fit to receive a ſufficient anſwer
to it, according to the depth of the matter it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But it was very neceſſary for <hi>Moſes</hi> to hold on in
his Hiſtory, and to communicate to them thoſe plain
and intelligible Cauſes of the <hi>Evils</hi> that ever lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes; he having ſo fully aſſerted God the
Creator of Heaven and Earth, and Contriver of all
things that we ſee: Adding alſo that the Laws that
he propounded to them were delivered to him from
God, and that all proſperity and happineſs would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
them, if they obſerved the ſame. That they
ſhould eat the good things of the Land, and live a
long and healthful age.</p>
                     <p>Now it was eaſie for the people, though they were
but rude, and newly taken from making Bricks for
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to think thus with themſelves;
If God made all things, how is it that they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then they are? Why do our wives bring forth their
children with pain? Why are we obnoxious to be
ſtung with Serpents? Why may not God give us an
endleſſe life, as well as a long life? and the like. To
which <hi>Moſes</hi> in general anſwers, (to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the people, and for the faſter binding them
to the Laws he delivered them from God) That it
was <hi>diſobedience to his will,</hi> that brought all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
into the world; which is moſt certainly true.
But by what particular circumſtances it is ſet out, you
may here read in this third Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 1. <hi>The Serpent alſo.</hi> It had been too harſh
and boiſtrous, and too groſſely redounding to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> if they
had immediately done violence to ſo expreſs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115236:77"/>
of God, and ſhown themſelves profeſſed rebels
againſt him. And their poſterity would have been
ſcarce able to have remembred them without curſings
and bitterneſs, for being ſo bold and apert Authors
of ſo much miſery to them. But ſo it came to paſs, that
it was not of themſelves, but by the ſubtilty of the
Serpent that they were deceived into diſobedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overſhort by his falſe ſuggeſtions. So that their
miſtake may be looked upon with pardon and pity,
and our ſelves are fairly admoniſhed to take heed
that we forfeit not the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the power of Speech.</hi> I cannot be ſo large in
my belief, as S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who affirms, That all living
creatures in Paradiſe could ſpeak, and underſtand one
another. But according to the Literal <hi>Cabbala,</hi> I
think it is manifeſt that the Serpent could; and that
it was not the Devil in the Serpent, as ſome Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would have it. For, why ſhould the Serpent be
curſed for the Devils ſake? And beſide, the whole
buſineſs is attributed to the cunning and ſubtilty of
the Serpent, as doing it by the power of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore this were to confound two <hi>Cabbala's</hi>
into one, to talk thus of the Serpent and the Devil at
once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not eat of any of the Trees.</hi> So <hi>Chryſoſtome, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus,</hi>
and S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> as if the cunning Serpent
had made uſe of that damnable Maxime, <hi>Calumniare
fortiter, aliquid adhaerebit:</hi> So at firſt he layes his
charge high againſt God, as if he would debarre them
of neceſſary food, and ſtarve them, that at laſt he might
gain ſo much, at leaſt that he did unneceſſarily abridge
them of what made mightily for their pleaſure and
perfection.</p>

Some gather from hence, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were
blinde till they taſted of the forbidden fruit. Which
is ſo fooliſh a gloſſe, that none but a blinde man could
ever have ſtumbled upon it. For the greateſt pleaſure

inſtance of it in a woman of <hi>Liguria,</hi> who, as <hi>Diodorus

overtaken with that other labour. But ſhe went but

freſh leaves and graſſe, and came immediately again
to her task, and would not have deſiſted from her
work, but that he that hired her, in commiſeration

the corporeal world was univerſally erected into
Form and Motion on the fourth day, is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
confirmed by the titles and propertie of the

oath, wherein they ſwore by him that taught them
the myſterie of the Tetractys. That the Tetractys
was a Symbole of the whole Philoſophick Cabbala,
that lay couched under the Text of Moſes. 20 Why
Fiſh and Fowl created in the ſame day. 23 Why
living creatures were ſaid to be made in the Fift

was comprehended within the number Six.</p>

                     <p>I Have plainly and faithfully ſet forth the meaning
of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text, according to the Literal <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi>
and made his incomparable Policy, and pious
Prudence manifeſt to all the world. For whether he
had this Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
immediately from God on the Mount, or whether
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115236:79"/>
it was a very ancient tradition long before in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
parts, as ſome <hi>Rabbines</hi> will have it, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of by God in the Mount; <hi>Moſes</hi> certainly
could not have begun his <hi>Pentateuch</hi> with any thing
more proper and more material to his ſcope and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then this. And it is nothing but the ignorance
of the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> that can make him look upon it as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
it being in it ſelf as highly removed above
contempt, as true Prudence and Staidneſs is above
Madneſs and Folly.</p>
                     <p>And yet I confeſs, I think there is ſtill a greater
depth and richneſs of wiſdome in it, then has been
hitherto opened in this Literal <hi>Cabbala,</hi> and ſuch as
ſhall repreſent <hi>Moſes</hi> as profoundly ſeen in <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
and <hi>divine Morality,</hi> as he is in <hi>Politicks.</hi> And
againſt which the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> ſhall have nothing at all
to alledge, unleſs ignorance and confidence furniſh
his brain with impertinent arguments.</p>
                     <p>For he ſhall not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Philoſophick <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala</hi>
either tasking God to his ſix days labour, or
bounding the world at the Clouds, or making the
Moon bigger then the Stars, or numbring days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Suns, or bringing in a Serpent talking with a
woman, or any ſuch like paſſages, which the <hi>Atheiſts</hi>
miſunderſtanding and perverſeneſſe makes them take
offence at; But they ſhall finde him more large and
more free then any, and laying down ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as the wiſeſt <hi>Naturaliſts,</hi> and <hi>Theoſophers</hi> in all
Ages have looked upon as the choiceſt and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
Such, I ſay, are thoſe in the Philoſophick
<hi>Cabbala</hi> you have read, and I am now come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it, and make it good, that it is indeed the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text. And one great Key for the
underſtanding of it in this firſt Chapter, will be thoſe
<hi>Pythagorical</hi> Myſteries of Numbers, as I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
already in my <hi>Preface.</hi>

Ver. 1. <hi>I mean the ſame thing by both.</hi> And there
is good reaſon there ſhould be meant the ſame thing
by both. For, beſides that thoſe actuall conſpicuous
Lights are in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sun, and Stars, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
or the <hi>Aetherial Matter</hi> has in it all over the
Principles of <hi>Light;</hi> which are the <hi>round Particles,</hi>
and that very <hi>fine and ſubtile Matter that lies in the
intervals of the round Particles.</hi> He that is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
acquainted with the <hi>French</hi> Philoſophy, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the buſineſs plainly. And in the expounding
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I think I may lay down this for a ſafe
Principle, that there is no conſiderable truth in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
or <hi>Divinity,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ignorant of, and
ſo if it be found agreeable to his Text, I may very
well attribute it to him. At leaſt the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi>
wherewith <hi>Moſes</hi> was inſpired, prevents all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of Men.</p>
                     <p>But now that I underſtand this <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>
in the firſt verſe, as things diſtinct from Heaven and
Earth afterwards mentioned, the very Text of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

not this <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> of the viſible and

of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who underſtands likewiſe by <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

one, that other belonging moſt properly to the ſecond

which comprehends not <hi>Angels</hi> only, but all ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> whatever.</p>
                     <p>And that <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> ſhould be Symboles of
the <hi>World of Life</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> it is no wonder: For
you may finde a ſufficient reaſon in the <hi>Cabbala</hi> it ſelf,
at the fift verſe of this preſent Chapter, and <hi>Plotinus</hi>
aſſimilates <hi>Form</hi> to Light, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And laſtly, in the ſecond verſe of this ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
there be plain reaſons alſo laid down, why the
meer <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the outward Creation is called the
<hi>Earth,</hi> according to the deſcription of the Earth in the

unto which you may further adde, that as the Earth
is looked upon as the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the world, ſo the <hi>Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of the outward Creation is in ſome ſenſe the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Tri-une Godhead.</hi> The Hebrew words <gap reason="foreign">

do handſomely intimate a plurality, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
the <hi>Noun</hi> being in the <hi>Plural,</hi> the <hi>Verb</hi> in

<hi>Vatablus</hi> himſelf, though he ſhuffles with his Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical

of this Chapter. And that this was the Philoſophick

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite</hi> is indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in Numbers, ſo is the nature of Spirits indiviſible;
you cannot make two of one of them, as you may
make of one piece of Corporeal Matter two, by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
diviſion or ſevering them one piece from another.
Wherefore what was truly and properly created the
firſt day; was Immaterial, Indiviſible, and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

                     <p>And for the <hi>Potentiality</hi> of the outward Creation,
ſith it is not ſo properly any real Beeing, it can breed
no difficulty, but whatever it is, it is referrable fitly
enough to Incorporeal things, it being no object of
Senſe, but of Intellect, and being alſo impaſſible and
undiminiſhable, and ſo in a ſort indiviſible. For the

here it may be you'll enquire, how this <hi>Corporeal

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115236:84"/>
                        <hi>waters above, Maimonides</hi> requires no ſuch continued
Analogy in the hidden ſenſe of Scripture, as you may
ſee in his Preface to his <hi>Moreh Nevochim.</hi> But I
need not fly to that general refuge. For me thinks that
the <hi>Seminal Forms</hi> that deſcend through the Matter,
and ſo reach the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the parts of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Creation, and make them ſpring up into act, are
not unlike the drops of rain that deſcend through the
Heaven or Air, and make the Earth fruitful. Beſides,
the Seminal Forms of things lie round, as I may ſo
ſpeak, and contracted at firſt, but ſpread when they
bring any part of the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the outward Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
into act, as drops of rain ſpread when they are
fallen to the ground. So that the Analogy is palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enough, though it may ſeem too elaborate and
curious. We may adde to all this concerning the
<hi>Naides</hi> or <hi>Water Nymphs,</hi> that the Ancients under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by them <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>All manner of Souls that deſcend into the

to <hi>Plato's</hi> School, who makes the Matter unmovable

hold together, but diſſolve it ſelf into infinitely little

the Earth, as alſo the reſt of the Planets, their nature

they afterwards became opake Planets. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
ſeems here plainly to be contained in <hi>Moſes,</hi>
but is at large demonſtrated in <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.

alledging that the word is ordinarily uſed to ſignifie

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115236:86"/>
the imagination of the rude people, may be ſaid to be
lighted up, and extinguiſhed, ſo often as they appear
and diſappear; for they meaſure all by obvious ſenſe
and fancie, and may well look upon them as ſo many
Candles ſet up by divine Providence in the Night, but
by Day frugally put out, for waſting: And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Theodoret</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">

ſwallowed down the Notion, that he uſes it as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

Wherefore the word <gap reason="foreign">

who taught them this myſterious tradition. And had
it not been a right worſhipful myſterie think you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and worthy of the ſolemnity of Religion and of
an Oath, to underſtand that 1, 2, 3, 4. make <hi>Ten.</hi>
And that <hi>Ten</hi> is <hi>All,</hi> which rude mankinde told firſt
upon their fingers, and <hi>Arithmeticians</hi> diſcover it by
calling them <hi>Digits</hi> at this very day.</p>
                     <p>There is no likelihood that ſo wiſe a man as <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
was, ſhould lay any ſtreſs upon ſuch trifles, or that
his Scholars ſhould be ſuch fools as to be taken with
them. But it is well known that the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> held
the Motion of the Earth about the Sun, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is plainly
implied according to the <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala</hi> of this
Fourth days work. So much of his ſecrets got out
to common knowledge and fame. But it is very highly
probable, that he had the whole <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala</hi>
of the Creation opened to him by ſome knowing Prieſt
or Philoſopher (as we now call them) in the Oriental
parts, that under this myſterie of numbers ſet out to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115236:88"/>
him the choiceſt and moſt precious concluſions in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſophy, interpreting as I conceive, the Text
of <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſome ſuch way as I have light upon, and
making all thoſe generous and ample concluſions
good by Demonſtration and Reaſon. And ſo <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
being well furniſhed with the knowledge of
things, was willing to impart them to thoſe whoſe
piety and capacity was fit to receive them; Not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide that outward form of numbers, which they
were firſt conveied to himſelf in. But ſuch <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical</hi>
nugacities as are ordinarily recorded for his,
in dry numbers, to have been the riches of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of ſo famous a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> is a thing beyond all
credit or probability.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I conceive, that the choiceſt and moſt
precious treaſures of knowledge, being laid open in
the <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the <hi>Fourth day;</hi> from thence it was
that ſo much Solemnity and Religion was put upon
that number, which he called his <hi>Tetractys,</hi> which
ſeems to have been of two kindes, the one, the <hi>ſingle
number Four,</hi> the other <hi>Thirty ſix,</hi> made of the
four firſt <hi>Maſculine</hi> numbers, and the four firſt <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine,
viz.</hi> of 1, 3, 5, 7. and of 2, 4, 6, 8. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you ſee that the former and more ſimple <hi>Tetractys</hi>
is ſtill included and made uſe of; for Four here takes
place again in the Aſſignment of the <hi>Maſculine</hi> and
<hi>Feminine</hi> Numbers. Whence I further conceive, that
under the number of this more complex <hi>Tetrad</hi> which
contains alſo the other in it, he taught his diſciples
the myſterie of the whole Creation, opening to them
the nature of all things as well <hi>Spiritual</hi> as <hi>Corporeal.</hi>

<hi>For an even Number carries along with it diviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115236:89"/>
and paſſibility. But an odde Number, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
impaſſibility, and activity, wherefore that is
called Feminine, this Maſculine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore the putting together of the four firſt
Maſculine Numbers to the four firſt Feminine, is the
joining of the active and paſſive Principles together,
matching the parts of the Matter, with congruous
Forms from the <hi>World of life.</hi> So that I conceive
the <hi>Tetractys</hi> was a a Symbole of the whole Syſteme
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Philoſophy, which we may very
juſtly ſuſpect to be the ſame with the <hi>Moſaical Cabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi>
And the root of this <hi>Tetractys</hi> is Six, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
hits upon <hi>Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Fowl</hi> are <hi>made in the ſame day.</hi>
And here <hi>Moſes</hi> does plainly play the Philoſopher in
joining them together; for there is more affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them then is eaſily diſcerned by the heedleſſe
vulgar: for beſides that Fowls frequent the waters
very much, many kindes of them I mean, theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

the <hi>ſinnes</hi> of fiſhes and the <hi>wings</hi> of birds, the
<hi>feathers</hi> of one and the <hi>ſcales</hi> of the other, are very
Analogical. They are both alſo deſtitute of <hi>

                     <p>Inſuetum per iter gelidas enavit ad Arctos.</p>
                     <p>Caſt in this alſo, that as ſome fowls <hi>dive</hi> and ſwim

ſaid to be made in the <hi>Fift</hi> and <hi>Sixt</hi> day, thoſe Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
according to the <hi>Pythagorical myſterie</hi> being ſo

ſtrange agreement betwixt <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> his Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

the number <hi>Six</hi> has a double reference, the one to

of ſundry ſorts of <hi>Land Animals,</hi> divided into

to the Creation of the world, ſet down by

number <hi>Five,</hi> is a fit Embleme of Procreation. For
Six drawn into Six, makes Thirty Six. The conceit is
<hi>Plutarchs</hi> in his <hi>De Ei apud Delphos,</hi> though he ſpeak
it of an inferiour kinde of Generation: But me thinks
it is moſt proper to <hi>Animals.</hi> Here is ſomething al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that reſpects Man, particularly the choiceſt reſult
of this Sixt days labour. The number of the brutiſh
Nature was <hi>Five,</hi> according to <hi>Philo;</hi> but here is an

Unite ſuperadded in Man, <hi>Reaſon</hi> reaching out to the

                     </p>
                     <p>But now for the reference that <hi>Six</hi> bears to the
whole Creation, that the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> did conceive
it was ſignificant thereof, appears by the titles they
have given it. For they call it <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>The articulate and compleat effor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

I ſuppoſe they call it the Anvill from that indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
ſhaping out of new Forms and Figures upon the
Matter of the Univerſe, by virtue of the Active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that ever buſies it ſelf every where. But how
the Senary ſhould Emblematize the World, you ſhall
underſtand thus: The world is <hi>ſelf-compleat,</hi> filled
and perfected by its own parts; ſo is the <hi>Senarius,</hi>
which has no denominated part but a <hi>Sixt, Third,</hi>
and <hi>Second,</hi> viz. 1, 2, 3. which put together make
<hi>Six,</hi> and <hi>Euclide</hi> defines a perfect Number from this

<hi>A perfect Number is that which is equall to its

of the world, and you know God in the cloſe of all,
ſaw that <hi>all that he made was very good.</hi> Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the world is <gap reason="foreign">

that is, it conſiſts of an <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> Principle,
the one brought down into the other from the <hi>World

                     <p>Thus you ſee continuedly, that the property of the
Number ſets off the nature of the work of every

a very high probability, that the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> had
a <hi>Cabbala</hi> referring to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

not to weary my Reader, nor my ſelf with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
Philogy, we conclude, that the meaning of
<hi>Moſes</hi> in this laſt verſe, is this: That <hi>Adam</hi> is here
condemned to a mortal, flitting, and impermanent
ſtate, till he reach his <hi>Aethereal</hi> or pure fiery <hi>Vehicle,</hi>
and become, as our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
as one of the Angels. This, I ſay, is the condition
of mankinde, according to the Philoſophick <hi>Cabbala</hi>
of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now take a general view of this whole <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi>
and more ſummarily conſider the ſtrength
thereof; which we may refer to theſe two heads, <hi>viz.
the nature of the Truths herein contained,</hi> and the
<hi>dignity of thoſe perſons that have owned them in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Ages.</hi> And as for the <hi>Truths themſelves,</hi> firſt,
they are ſuch as may well become ſo holy and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a perſon as <hi>Moſes,</hi> if he would Philoſophize; they
being very precious and choice Truths, and very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
removed above the conceit of the vulgar, and ſo
the more likely to have been delivered to him, or to
<hi>Adam</hi> firſt by God for a ſpecial myſterie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are ſuch, that the more they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
the more irrefutable they will be found, no
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115236:103"/>
                        <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> that was ever yet propounded to men, ſo
exquiſitely well agreeing with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, the <hi>Paſſages</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and the <hi>rational Faculties</hi> of our own minds.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is a continued ſutableneſſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicability
to the Text of <hi>Moſes</hi> all along, without
any force or violence done to Grammar or Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, there is a great uſefulneſſe, if
not neceſſity, at leaſt of ſome of them, they being ſuch
ſubſtantial Props of Religion, and ſo great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to a ſedulous purification of our mindes, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of true piety.</p>
                     <p>Now for the <hi>dignity of the perſons,</hi> ſuch as were
<hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Plotinus,</hi> it will be argued
from the conſtant fame of that high degree of virtue
and righteouſneſſe, and devout love of the Deity that
is every where acknowledged in them, beſides whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
miraculous has happened to them, or been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by them.</p>
                     <p>And as for <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> if you conſult his life in
<hi>Iamblichus,</hi> he was held in ſo great admiration by
thoſe in his time, that he was thought by ſome to be
the ſon of <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom he begot of <hi>Parthenis</hi> his
known mother; and of this opinion was <hi>Epimeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Eudoxus,</hi> and <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> which conceit <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blichus</hi>
does ſoberly and earneſtly reject, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acknowledges, that his looks and ſpeeches did
ſo wonderfully carry away the minds of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
with him, that they could not withhold from
affirming, that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the off-ſpring of God.</hi>
Which is not to be taken in our ſtrict Theological
ſenſe, but according to the mode of the ancient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who looked upon men heroically, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
good and virtuous, to be divine ſouls, and of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115236:103"/>
a celeſtial extract. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> takes notice par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that they tearmed
ſuch as were <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But to return to him of whom we were ſpeaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
This eminency of his acknowledged amongſt
the Heathen, will ſeem more credible, if we but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the advantage of his converſation with the wiſeſt
men then upon Earth; to wit, the <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts</hi> and
<hi>Prophets,</hi> who had their knowledge from God, as
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> had from them. From whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that of <hi>Iamblichus</hi> to be true, which he writes
concerning <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Philoſophy: That it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>That it is

                     </p>
                     <p>But that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was acquainted with the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi>
or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Philoſophy, there is ample teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of it in Writers; as of <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> an <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Jew,</hi> in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>the Hebrew Philoſopher.</hi> I might caſt hither the
ſuffrages of <hi>Juſtine, Johannes Philoponus, Theodoret,
Hermippus</hi> in <hi>Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus, Porphyrius,</hi>
and <hi>Clemens</hi> again, who writes, that it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fame that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was a diſciple of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And though he gives no belief to the
report, yet that Learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſeems
inclinable enough to think it true, in his firſt Book
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115236:104"/>
                        <hi>De Jure Naturali juxta Hebraos,</hi> where you may
peruſe more fully the citations of the forenamed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Beſides all theſe, <hi>Iamblichus</hi> alſo affirms, that
he lived at <hi>Sidon,</hi> his Native Countrey, where he
fell acquainted with the Prophets, and Succeſſors of
one <hi>Mochus,</hi> the <hi>Phyſiologer,</hi> or Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
<gap reason="foreign">

Which, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> judiciouſly conjectures,
is to be read, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>with the Prophets that ſucceeded</hi> Moſes <hi>the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore it is very plain, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had his
Philoſophy from <hi>Moſes.</hi> And that Philoſophy which
to this very day is acknowledged to be his, we ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is ſo fitly applicable to the Text all the
way, what greater argument can there be deſired to
prove that it is the true <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala</hi> thereof?</p>
                     <p>But there is yet another argument to prove further
the likelihood of his converſing with the Prophets,
which will alſo further ſet out the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and that is the Miracles that are recorded of
him. For it ſhould ſeem <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was not only
initiated into the <hi>Moſaical Theory,</hi> but had arrived
alſo to the power of working Miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and
the ſucceeding Prophets did, and very ſtrange Facts
are recorded both in <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and <hi>Iamblichus:</hi> As
that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> when he was going over a River
with ſeveral of his companions, <hi>(Iamblichus</hi> calls the
River <hi>Neſſus, Porphyrius Caucaſus)</hi> that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the River, the River anſwered him again with
an audible and clear voice, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Salve
Pythagora.</hi> That he ſhewed his Thigh to <hi>Abaris</hi>
the Prieſt, and that he affirmed that it gliſtered like
Gold, and thence pronounced that he was <hi>Apollo.</hi>
That he was known to converſe with his friends at
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115236:104"/>
                        <hi>Metapontium,</hi> and <hi>Tauromenium</hi> (the one a Town in
<hi>Italy,</hi> the other in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and many days journey di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant)
in one and the ſame day. To theſe and many
others which I willingly omit, I ſhall only adde his
predictions of Earthquakes, or rather, becauſe that
may ſeem more natural, his preſent ſlaking of
plagues in Cities, his ſilencing of violent winds, and
tempeſts; his calming the rage of Seas, and Rivers,
and the like. Which skill <hi>Empedocles, Epimenides,</hi>
and <hi>Abaris</hi> having got from him, they grew ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
that <hi>Empedocles</hi> was ſurnamed <hi>Alexanemus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimenides,
Cathartes,</hi> and <hi>Abaris, Aethrobates,</hi>
from the power they had in <hi>ſuppreſſing of ſtorms and
winds,</hi> in <hi>freeing of Cities from the plague,</hi> and in
<hi>walking aloft in the Air:</hi> Which skill enabled <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi>
to viſit his friends after that manner at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapontium,</hi>
and <hi>Tauromenium</hi> in one and the ſame
day.</p>
                     <p>And now I have ſaid thus much of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> (and
might ſay a great deal more) there will be leſſe need
to inſiſt upon <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Plotinus,</hi> their Philoſophy
being the ſame that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his was, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
applicable to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Text. <hi>Plato's</hi> exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarity
of life and virtue, together with his high
knowledge in the more ſacred myſteries of God, and
the ſtate of the ſoul of man in this world, and that
other, deſervedly got to himſelf the title of <hi>Divine,</hi>

                     <p>But as for Miracles, I know none he did, though
ſomething highly miraculous happened, if that fame
at <hi>Athens</hi> was true, that <hi>Speuſippus, Clearchus,</hi> and
<hi>Anaxilides</hi> report to have been, concerning his birth,
which is, that <hi>Ariſto</hi> his reputed father, when he
would forcibly have had to do with <hi>Perictione,</hi> ſhe
being indeed exceeding fair and beautiful, fell ſhort
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115236:105"/>
of his purpoſe, and ſurceaſing from his attempt, that he
ſaw <hi>Apollo</hi> in a viſion, and ſo abſtained from medling
with his wife till ſhe brought forth her ſon <hi>Ariſtocles,</hi>
who after was called <hi>Plato</hi> But that is far more credible
which is reported, concerning the commending of
him to his Tutor <hi>Socrates,</hi> who the day before he
came, dreamed that he had a young Swan in his lap,
which putting forth feathers a pace, of a ſudden flew
up into the Air, and ſung very ſweetly. Wherefore
the next day when <hi>Plato</hi> was brought to him by his
father, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>But for his acquaintance with the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                     <p>As for <hi>Plotinus,</hi> that which <hi>Porphyrius</hi> records

by the Majeſty of his own Minde, as his enemy <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympius</hi>
confeſſed, to retort that Magick upon him
which he practiſed againſt <hi>Plotinus,</hi> and that ſedately
ſitting amongſt his friends, he would tell them; <hi>Now</hi>
Olympius <hi>his body it gathered like a purſe, and

                     <p>For I cannot but ſurmiſe, that he has happily and
unexpectedly light upon that, which will prove a true
reſtauration of that part of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Philoſophy,
which is ordinarily called <hi>Natural,</hi> and in which
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> may be juſtly deemed to have had no

ſome likely Equipage with the forenamed noble and
divine Spirits though the unskilfulneſſe in men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
acknowledge more of Supernatural aſſiſtance
in hot unſettled fancies, and perplexed Melancholy,
then in the calm and diſtinct uſe of Reaſon; yet for
mine own part, (but not without ſubmiſſion to better
Judgements) I ſhould look upon <hi>Des Cartes</hi> as a man
more truly inſpired in the knowledge of Nature, then
any that have profeſſed themſelves ſo this ſix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

years; and being even raviſhed with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his tranſcendent <hi>Mechanical</hi> inventions, for
the ſalving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the world, I ſhould not
ſtick to compare him with <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:115236:106"/>
thoſe skilful and cunning workers of the Tabernacle,
who, as <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifies, were filled with the Spirit of
God, and they were of an excellent underſtanding
to finde out all manner of curious works.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it any more argument, that <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was
not inſpired, becauſe he did not ſay he was, then that
others are inſpired, becauſe they ſay they are; which
to me is no argument at all. But the ſuppreſſion of
what ſo happened, would argue much more ſobriety
and modeſty, when as the profeſſion of it with ſober
men would be ſuſpected of ſome ſpice of melancholy
and diſtraction, eſpecially in Natural Philoſophy,
where the grand pleaſure is the evidence and exerciſe
of Reaſon, not a bare belief, or an ineffable ſenſe of
life, in reſpect whereof there is no true Chriſtian but
he is inſpired.</p>
                     <p>THUS much in Defence of my <hi>Philoſophick
Cabbala.</hi> It will not be unſeaſonable to ſubjoin ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by way of Apology for the <hi>Cabbaliſt:</hi> For I
finde my ſelf liable to no leſſe then three ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>trifling Curioſitie,</hi> of <hi>Raſhneſſe,</hi> and
of <hi>Inconſtancy of Judgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for the firſt, I know that men that are more
ſeverely Philoſophical and rational, will condemn me
of too much curious pains in applying Natural and
Metaphyſical Truths to an uncertain and lubricous
Text or Letter, when as they are better known, and
more fitly conveied by their proper proof and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then by fancying they are aimed at in ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and Aenigmatical Writings.</p>
                     <p>But I anſwer, ther is that fit and full congruity of
the <hi>Cabbala</hi> with the Text, beſides the backing of it
with advantages from the Hiſtory of the firſt riſe of
the <hi>Pythagorical</hi> or <hi>Platonical</hi> Philoſophy, that it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115236:106"/>
ought not to be deemed a fancie, but a very high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
that there is ſuch a <hi>Cabbala</hi> as this belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Moſaical Letter,</hi> eſpecially if you call
but to minde how luckily the nature of Numbers
ſets off the work of every day, according to the ſenſe
of the <hi>Cabbala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then again, for mine own part, I account no
pains either curious or tedious, that tend to a common
good: and I conceive no ſmaller a part of mankinde,
concerned in my labours, then the whole Nation of
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> to ſay nothing of the
ingenious <hi>Perſian,</hi> nor to deſpair of the <hi>Turk</hi> though
he be for the preſent no friend to Allegories.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we have not placed our pains inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,
having recommended ſo weighty and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Truths in ſo religious a manner to ſo great a part
of the world.</p>
                     <p>But for the imputation of <hi>Raſhneſſe,</hi> in making it
my buſineſſe <hi>to divulge thoſe ſecrets or myſteries</hi> that
<hi>Moſes</hi> had ſo ſedulouſly covered in his obſcure Text:
I ſay, it is the privilege of Chriſtianity, the times
now more then ever requiring it to pull off the vail
from <hi>Moſes</hi> his face: And that though they be
grand truths that I have diſcovered, yet they are as
uſeful as ſublime, and cannot but highly gratifie every
good and holy man that can competently judge of
them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for <hi>Inconſtancy of Judgement,</hi> which men
may ſuſpect me of, having heretofore declared the
Scripture does not teach men Philoſophy: I ſay, the
change of a mans judgement for the better, is no part
of inconſtancy, but a virtue, when as to perſiſt in
what we finde falſe, is nothing but perverſeneſſe and
pride. And it will prove no ſmall argument for the
truth of this preſent <hi>Cabbala,</hi> in that the evidence
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115236:107"/>
thereof has fetch'd me out of my former opinion
wherein I ſeemed engaged.</p>
                     <p>But to ſay the truth, I am not at all inconſiſtent
with my ſelf, for I am ſtill of opinion, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Scripture teaches not any precept of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
concerning which there can be any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
amongſt men. And when you venture beyond
the Literal ſenſe, you are not taught by the Scripture,
but what you have learned ſome other way, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
thereto. And they ought to be no traſh, nor tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
<hi>Notions,</hi> nor confutable by Reaſon, or more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Principles of Philoſophy, that a man ſhould dare
to caſt upon ſo ſacred a Text, but ſuch as one is well
aſſured, will bear the ſtricteſt examination, and that
lead to the more full knowledge of God, and do
more clearly fit the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, &amp; external
<hi>Providence</hi> to his moſt precious <hi>Attributes,</hi> and
tend to the furthering of the holy Life, which I do
again profeſſe is the ſole end of the Scripture. And
he that ventures beyond the Letter without that
guide, will ſoon be bewilder'd, and loſe himſelf in
his own fancies. Wherefore if this <hi>Philoſophick Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala</hi>
of mine, amongſt thoſe many other advantages I
have recited, had not this alſo added unto it, the aim
of advancing the divine Life in the world, I ſhould
look upon it as both falſe and unprofitable, and ſhould
have reſted ſatisfied with the <hi>Moral Cabbala.</hi> For
the divine Life is above all Natural and Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
knowledge whatſoever. And that man is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
man that is truly righteous and prudent, whom
I know I cannot but gratifie with my <hi>Moral Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala</hi>
that follows. But if any more zealous preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to prudence and righteouſneſſe, wanting either
leiſure or ability to examine my <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala</hi>
to the bottome, ſhall notwithſtanding either condemn it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115236:107"/>
or admire it, he has unbecomingly and indiſcreetly
ventured out of his own ſphere, and I cannot acquit
him of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> or <hi>Folly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor did I place my <hi>Cabbala's</hi> in this order, out of
more affection and eſteem of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> then of <hi>true
holineſſe,</hi> but have ranked them thus according to
the order of Nature: the holy and divine Life being
not at all, or elſe being eaſily loſt in man, if it be
not produc'd and conſerv'd by a radicated acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of thoſe grand truths in the <hi>Philoſophick
Cabbala, viz.</hi> The exiſtence of the Eternal God,
and a certain expectation of more conſummate hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
upon the diſſolution of this mortal body: for
to pretend to virtue and holineſſe, without reference to
God, and a life to come, is but to fall into a more
dull and flat kinde of <hi>Stoiciſme,</hi> or to be content to
feed our Cattel on this ſide of <hi>Jordan</hi> in a more
diſcreet and religious way of <hi>Epicuriſme,</hi> or at leaſt

by inſpiring his Intellect with divine knowledge,
which is the higheſt Faculty of the Soul, as the Head

I underſtand here <hi>divine Morality,</hi> ſuch as is
ingendred in the Soul by the operations of the holy
Spirit, that inward living Principle of all godlineſs
and honeſty. I ſhall be the more brief in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of this <hi>Cabbala,</hi> it being of it ſelf ſo plain and
ſenſible to any that has the experience of the life I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe;
but to them that have it not, nothing will
make it plain, or any thing at all probable.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 1. <hi>A Microcoſme or little World.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more ordinary or trivial, then to compare
Man to the Univerſe, and make him a little compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
World of himſelf. Wherefore it was not hard
to premiſe that, which may be ſo eaſily underſtood.
And the Apoſtle ſuppoſes it, when he applies the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of <hi>Light</hi> here in this Chapter, to the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115236:109"/>

which is Spiritual is not firſt, but that which is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
or Natural; afterward that which is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
The firſt Man is of the Earth, earthy; the

this earthy condition is, is very lively ſet out by</hi>

<hi>The ſubject matter;</hi> a thing 'made alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
viz. <hi>The rude Soul of Man in this diſorder that is
deſcribed;</hi> ſad Melancholy like the drown'd Earth
lies at the bottome, whence Care, and Grief, and
Diſcontent, torturous Suſpicion, and horrid Fear, are
waſhed up by the unquiet watry Deſire, or irregular
ſuggeſtions of the <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> wherein moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
is ſeated baſe Luſt and Senſuality; and above

fool-hardy Confidence, and indefatigable
Contention about vain objects. In ſhort, whatever
Paſſion and Diſtemper is in fallen Man, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to theſe Elements. But God leaves not his
creature in this evil condition; but that all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
may be diſcovered, and ſo quelled in us, and
avoided by us, he ſaith, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> as you
read in the following verſe.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 3. <hi>The day-light appears.</hi> To this alludes
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>God who commanded the light
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115236:109"/>
to ſhine out of darkneſſe, ſhine in our hearts to give
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſeems to
me to have ſtruck through the whole Six days of this
Spiritual Creation at once. The higheſt manifeſtation
of that Light created in the firſt day, being the face of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Adam,</hi> fully compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>ſixt day.</hi> Wherefore when it is ſaid, <hi>Let there
be Light,</hi> that Light is underſtood that <hi>enlightens
every man that comes into the world,</hi> which is the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Intellect</hi> as it is communicable to humane ſouls.
And the firſt day is the firſt appearance thereof, as
yet weaker and too much disjoin'd from our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but at laſt it amounts to the true and plain I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and Character of the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi>
Chriſt according to the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And God hath framed the Nature of
Man ſo, that he cannot but ſay,</hi> &amp;c. God working
in ſecond cauſes, there is nothing more ordinary
then to aſcribe that to him that is done by men, even
then when the actions ſeem leſſe competible to the
Nature of God. Wherefore it cannot ſeem harſh,
if in this <hi>Moral Cabbala</hi> we admit that man does
that by the power of God working in the ſoul,
that the Text ſays God does; as <hi>the approving of
the Light as good,</hi> and <hi>the diſtinguiſhing betwixt
Light and Darkneſſe,</hi> and the like; which things in
the myſtical ſenſe are competible both to God and
Man. And we ſpeaking in a Moral or Myſtical ſenſe,
of God acting in us, the nature of the thing requires
that what he is ſaid to do there, we ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
alſo to do the ſame through his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>For the ſoul of man is not meerly paſſive as a
piece of wood or ſtone, but is forthwith made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
by being acted upon; and therefore if God in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115236:110"/>
us rules, we rule with him; if he contend againſt ſin
in us, we alſo contend together with him againſt the
ſame; if he ſee in us what is good or evil, we, <hi>ipſo
facto,</hi> ſee by him; <hi>In his light we ſee light:</hi> and ſo
in the reſt. Wherefore the ſuppoſition is very eaſie
in this <hi>Moral Cablala,</hi> to take the liberty, where ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſenſe or more compendious expreſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it, to attribute that to man, though not to
man alone, which God alone does, when we recur
to the Literal meaning of the Text. And this is but
conſonant to the Apoſtle, <hi>I live, and yet not I.</hi> For
if the life of God or Chriſt was in him; ſurely he
did live, or elſe what did that life there? Only he
did not proudly attribute that life to himſelf, as his
own, but acknowledged it to be from God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 5.</hi> As betwixt the Natural Day and Night.
<hi>It is very frequent with the Apoſtles to ſet out by</hi>
Day <hi>and</hi> Night, <hi>the</hi> Spiritual <hi>and</hi> Natural <hi>condition
of man. As in ſuch phraſes as theſe;</hi> The night is
far ſpent, the day is at hand. Walk as children of
the Light. <hi>And elſewhere,</hi> Let us who are of the
day; <hi>and in the ſame place,</hi> You are all the ſons of
light, and ſons of the day. We are not of the night,
nor of darkneſſe. <hi>But this is too obvious to inſiſt
upon.</hi>

                        <hi>And thus Ignorance and Inquiry.</hi> The ſoul of man

I think no man is born naturally ſo ſtupid, but that

his minde diſtracted with a multitude of needleſſe

                     <p>Ver. 20. <hi>That is, that the Concupiſcible in man.</hi>
That the waters are an Emblem of this <hi>Concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Venus</hi> her being born of the Sea does intimate;
which were not ſo much to the purpoſe, did not Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philoſophy and Experience certifie, that Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence
is lodg'd in moiſture. Whence is that of

                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>De antro Nympharum)</hi> i. e. <hi>Anima ſicca ſapientiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima.</hi>
And without all queſtion the inordinate uſe
of the <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> does mightily befor the ſoul,
and makes her very uncapable of divine Senſe and
Knowledge. And yet to endevour after an utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility
of the pleaſures of the body, is as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and unwarrantable. But concerning this I
ſhall ſpeak more fully on the 22. and 31. verſes of
this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 21. <hi>Winged Ejaculations.</hi> Whether <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
or <hi>vocal,</hi> they are not unfitly reſembled to <hi>Fowls,</hi>
according to that of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <l>—<gap reason="foreign">

                     </q>

                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:115236:112"/>
And if <hi>vocal</hi> words have wings, the inward deſires
of the ſoul may well be ſaid to have wings alſo, they
being the words of the <hi>minde,</hi> as the other are of the
<hi>mouth,</hi> and fly further for the moſt part, and get ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to Heaven then the other.</p>
                     <p>Note alſo, that <hi>Origen</hi> likewiſe makes a difference
here betwixt the <hi>Fiſh</hi> and the <hi>Fowl,</hi> and makes the
Fowl to be good cogitations, the Fiſh evil. But I
account them rather both indifferent, and to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
not extirpated by the <hi>Myſtical Adam</hi> Chriſt,
the <hi>Image of God</hi> in Man. And theſe ſtrong Heats
and Ejaculations are the effects of Melancholy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the divine Principle in man, when it actuates it,
works very fiercely and ſharply, and is a great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the delightful moiſture of the <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi>
and weakens much the pleaſures of the body, to
the great advantage of the minde, if it be done with
diſcretion and due moderation, otherways if this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
be over-much indulged to, it may lead to Hecticks,
Phrenzies and Diſtractions.</p>
                     <p>The contrivance of the Text mentioning only ſuch
Fowls as frequent the waters, naturally points to this
ſenſe we have given it; but if our imagination ſtrike
out further to other winged creatures, as the Fowls
of the Mountains, and ſundry ſorts of Birds, they
may alſo have their proper meanings, and are a part
of thoſe <hi>Animal Figurations,</hi> that are to be ſubdued
and regulated by the <hi>Myſtical Adam,</hi> the Spirit of
Chriſt in us.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Might have ſomething to order.</hi> But
if you take away all the Paſſions from the Soul, the
Minde of man will be as a General without an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or an Army without an Enemy. The <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi>
define Righteouſneſſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
<hi>That it is the Harmony or
Agreement of the Irrational Parts of the Soul with
the Rational.</hi> But quite to take away all the Paſſions
of the Minde in ſtead of compoſing them to the right
rule of Reaſon and the divine Light, is as if a man
ſhould cut away all the ſtrings of an Inſtrument, in
ſtead of tuning it.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 24. <hi>And makes the Iraſcible fruitful.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
devotions help'd on by Melancholy, dry the
body very much, and heat it, and make it very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to <hi>wrath;</hi> which if it be placed upon holy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
men call <hi>Zeal;</hi> but if it be inordinate and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical,
the Apoſtle will teach us to call it <hi>bitter
zeal.</hi> This more fierce and fiery affection in man is
<hi>Plotinus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The Lion-like
nature in us,</hi> which if <hi>Adam</hi> keep in ſubjection,
there is no hurt in it, but good. And it is evident in
the Goſpel, that our Saviour Chriſt was one while
deeply impaſſionated with Sorrow, another while
very ſtrongly carried away with Zeal and Anger, as
you may obſerve in the ſtories of his raiſing up <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
and whipping the Money-changers out of the
Temple. And this is no imperfection, but rather a
perfection; the divine Life, when it has reached the
Paſſions and Body of a man, becoming thereby more
palpable, full and ſenſible. But all the danger is of
being impotently paſſionate, and when as the body
is carried away by its own diſtemper, or by the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
of the minde, notwithſtanding to imagine or
pretend, that it is the impulſe of the <hi>divine Spirit.</hi>
This is too frequent a miſtake God knows, but ſuch
as was impoſſible to happen in our Saviour; and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115236:113"/>
therefore the Paſſions of his Minde were rather Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
then Imperfections, as they are to all them that
are cloſe and ſincere followers of him, eſpecially when
they have reach'd the Sixt days progreſſe.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 26. <hi>By the name of his own Image.</hi> What
this Image of God is, <hi>Plato</hi> who was acquainted

for mine own part, I do not underſtand, how that the
Kingdome of Heaven which is to be within us, can
be any Kingdome at all, if there be no Subjects at all
there to be ruled over, and to obey. Wherefore the
Paſſions of the Body are not to be quite extinguiſhed,
but regulated, that there may be the greater plenitude
of life in the whole man.</p>
                     <p>And thoſe that endevour after ſo ſtill, ſo ſilent, and
demure condition of minde, that they would have
the ſenſe of nothing there but peace and reſt, ſtriving
to make their whole nature deſolate of all <hi>Animal

clear Day, ſhining upon a barren Heath, that feeds
neither Cow nor Horſe, neither Sheep nor Shepheard
is to be ſeen there, but only a waſte ſilent Solitude, and
one uniform parchedneſſe and vacuity. And yet while
a man fancies himſelf thus wholly divine, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how he is even then held down by his <hi>Animal
Nature;</hi> and that it is nothing but the ſtilneſſe and

in ſtead of the true divine Principle, would take the
Government to it ſelf, and in this uſurped tyranny
cruelly deſtroy all the reſt of the <hi>Animal Figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
But the true divine Life would deſtroy nothing
that is in Nature, but only regulate things, and order
them for the more full and ſincere enjoyments of man,

works of God, as the divine Life it ſelf, though they
are nothing comparable unto it. Nay, indeed they are
but an heap of confuſion without it. Wherefore the

Stoutneſſe, Flexibility, Boldneſs, Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Mildeneſs, Tartneſs, Candour, Suſpicion, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorineſs,
Deſpondency, Triumph</hi> or <hi>Gloriation.</hi>
All the <hi>Propenſions</hi> to the exerciſe of Strength, or
activity of Body; as <hi>Running, Leaping, Swimming,
Wreſtling, Juſting, Courſing,</hi> or the like: Beſides all
the Courtly Preambles, neceſſary Concomitants, and
delightful Conſequences of <hi>Marriage,</hi> which ſpring
up from the Love of Women, and the Pleaſure of
Children. To ſay nothing of thoſe enjoyments that
ariſe from correſpondent affections and meer natural
friendſhip betwixt man and man, or fuller companies
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115236:117"/>
of acquaintance; their <hi>Friendly Feaſtings, Sportings,
Muſick</hi> and <hi>Dancings.</hi> All theſe and many more
that I am not at leiſure to reckon up, be but the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
pullulations of the <hi>Animal Life,</hi> and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
they have neither good nor hurt in them. Nay,
indeed to ſpeak more truly and impartially, they are
good, according to the Approbation of him that
made them; but they become bad only to them that
are bad, and act either without meaſure, or for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
ends, or with undue circumſtances; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they are very good in their kind, they being
regulated and moderated by the divine Principle in
us.</p>
                     <p>And I think it is of great moment for men to take
notice of this truth for theſe three reaſons: Firſt,
becauſe the bounds of ſin, and of the innocent Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Nature, being not plainly and apertly ſet out
and defined, men counting the ſeveral <hi>Animal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations</hi>
and natural Motions for ſins, they heap to
themſelves ſuch a task, to wit, the quite extirpating
that, which it were neither good, nor it may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
utterly to extirpate, that they ſeem in truth
hereby to inſinuate that it is impoſſible to enter into
that Reſt or Sabbath of the people of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
promiſcuouſly ſheltring themſelves under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
cloud of ſins, and infirmities, where they aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
all, ſo as if every thing were in the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ſinful; if they be but zealous and punctual in
ſome, they account it paſſing well, and an high teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their ſanctimony. And their hypocriſie will
be ſure to pitch upon that which is leaſt of all to the
purpoſe; that is, a man will ſpend his zeal in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of ſome natural temper he himſelf is of, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the oppoſite complexion. But for the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
dictates of the divine Light, he will be ſure to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115236:117"/>
neglect them, as being more hard to perform, though
of more concernment both for himſelf and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good. But if it were more plainly defined what
is Sin, and what is not Sin, a man might with more
heart and courage fight againſt his enemy, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not ſo numerous and formidable, and he would
have the leſſe opportunity for perverſe excuſes, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
tergiverſations.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is, That men may not think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of themſelves then they are, for their abhorrency
from thoſe things that have no hurt in them, nor think
worſer of others then they deſerve, when they do but
ſuch things as are approvable by God, and the divine
Light. And this is of very great moment for the
maintaining of Chriſtian Love, and Union amongſt
men.</p>
                     <p>The third and laſt is; That they may obſerve
the madneſs and hypocriſie of the world, whoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
conteſtations or ſecret cenſures are commonly but
the conflict and antipathy of the oppoſite <hi>Figurations
of the Animal Life,</hi> who like the wilde beaſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Maſter to keep good quarter amongſt them,
are very eagerly ſet to devour one another. But by
this ſhall every man know, whether it be Complexion
or Religion that reigns in him, if he love God with
all his heart, and all his ſoul, and his neighbour as
himſelf: And can give a ſufficient reaſon for all his
actions and opinions from that <hi>Aeternal Light,</hi> the
Love of <hi>God</hi> ſhed abroad in his heart; if not, it is
but a faction of the <hi>Animal Life,</hi> ſed up and foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by either natural Temper or Cuſtome; and he is
far from being arrived to the Kingdome of Chriſt,
and entring into that true Reſt of the people of God.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Where there is no external doctrine.</hi> Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
and Preachings, and external Ordinances, there
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115236:118"/>
is no ſuch noiſe of them amongſt the holy Patriarchs,
whoſe lives <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes; and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this ſenſe I have here given the Text more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
and warrantable. But beſides <hi>Moſes</hi> unvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
being Chriſtianity it ſelf, the manner of the growth
of the true Chriſtian is here prefigured. That he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taught of God, then of Men, he having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Life in him, and needs no man to teach him:
For he has the Unction in himſelf, which will teach
him all things neceſſary to Life and Godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 6. <hi>Which is repentance from dead works.</hi> In
this verſe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the <hi>Philoſophick Cabbala,</hi> ſignified a

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; but that <hi>Water</hi> is an Embleme of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
it is ſo obvious that I need ſay nothing of it:
<hi>John's</hi> baptizing with Water to Repentance, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
repeated in the Goſpels.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 7. <hi>And breathes into him the Spirit of Life.</hi>
In alluſion to this paſſage of <hi>Moſes</hi> in all likelihood
is that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt; Thy hands have made me,
and faſhioned me, O give me underſtanding and I
ſhall live;</hi> as if like <hi>Adam,</hi> he were but a ſtatue of
Earth till God breathed into him the Spirit of Life
and Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the Water and of the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Water</hi> and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> are the two extremes; the firſt and the
laſt that makes up the Creation of the <hi>Spiritual A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> compleated in us, and includes the
middle which is <hi>Blood.</hi> Firſt therefore is <hi>Repentance</hi>
from what we delighted in before. Then the killing
of that evil and corrupt life in us, which is reſiſting to
<hi>blood,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And the 1 Epiſtle of
<hi>John</hi> ch. 5. v. 4. <hi>What ever is born of God, overcomes
the world; Who is he that overcomes the world, but
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115236:118"/>
he that believes that Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (the divine Light
and Life in us) <hi>is the Son of God?</hi> and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with power from on high to overcome all ſin and
wickedneſſe in us. <hi>This is he that comes by Water
and Blood,</hi> by repentance and perſeverance till the
death of the body of ſin, not by repentance only, and
diſlike of our former life, but by the mortification al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of it. Then the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> is awakened in
us, and will bear witneſſe of whatever is right and
true. And according to this manner of teſtimony is
it to be underſtood eſpecially, <hi>That no man can ſay
that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, but by the Spirit of
God,</hi> as the Apoſtle elſewhere affirms. This is the
<hi>heavenly Adam,</hi> which is true Light and Glory to
all them that have attain'd to the reſurrection of the
dead, and into whom God hath breathed the breath
of Life, without which, we have no right knowledge
nor ſenſe of God at all, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Ver. 8. <hi>To the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> And the
end of the doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> which was Repentance,
was for this purpoſe, that men might arrive to that
comfortable condition here deſcribed; and therefore
it was a motive for them to repent. <hi>For though ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

For the new Jeruſalem is to be built, and God
is to pitch his Tabernacle amongſt men, and to rule

upon an <hi>Hiſtorical Cabbala</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſhould
preſage would happen in the ſeventh thouſand years,

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115236:119"/>
ſhall be finiſhed, and the great <hi>Sabbath</hi> and
Feſtival ſhall be then celebrated in the height: <hi>A
thouſand years are but as one day,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter,</hi> And therefore the ſeventh thouſand years
may well be the <hi>ſeventh day:</hi> Wherefore in the end
of the ſixth thouſand years, the Kingdomes of the
Earth will be the ſecond <hi>Adams,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chriſts,</hi> as
<hi>Adam</hi> in the Sixt day was created the Lord of the
world, and all the creatures therein; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of his will bring in the <hi>Seventh day</hi> of reſt, and
peace, and joy, upon the face of the whole Earth.
Which preſage will ſeem more credible, when I ſhall
have unfolded unto you out of <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie

that, let me a little prepare your belief, by ſhewing
the truth of the ſame thing in another Figure.</p>

                        <hi>Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared,</hi>
they died, not enjoying the richneſs of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

from <hi>Adam,</hi> he was taken up alive into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and ſeems to enjoy that great bliſſe in the body.
The world then in the Seventh <hi>Chiliad,</hi> will be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
up into God, ſnatch'd up by his Spirit, inacted
by his Power. The Jeruſalem that comes down from
Heaven, will then in a moſt glorious and eminent
manner flouriſh upon Earth. God will, as I ſaid,
pitch his Tabernacle amongſt men. And for God to
be in us, and with us, is as much as for us to be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

though this diſpenſation for the preſent be but very

ſaying of it, he does not prove it. But for mine own
part, I am very prone to think, that the Soul is never
deſtitute of ſome <hi>Vehicle</hi> or other, though <hi>Plotinus</hi>
be of another minde, and conceives that the Soul at
the height is joined with God and nothing elſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
lodged in his arms. And I am the more bold
to diſſent from him in this exaltation of the Soul, I
being ſo ſecure in my own conceit of that other ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
extravagancy of his, in the debaſement of them,
that at laſt they become ſo drowſie and ſenſleſs, that
they grow up out of the ground in that dull function
of life, the efformation of Trees and Plants. And I
am not alone in this liberty of diſſenting from <hi>Ploti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
For beſides my own conceit this way, (for I muſt
confeſs I have no demonſtrative reaſons againſt his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
I am emboldened by the example of <hi>Ficinus,</hi>
who is no ſmall admirer of the forenamed Author.</p>
                     <p>That which I was about to ſay, is this; The infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
or actuating of a body being ſo <hi>Indiſpenſable</hi>
and <hi>Eſſential</hi> an act of the Soul, the temper and
condition of the body that it thus actuates, cannot but
be of mighty conſequence unto the Soul that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of the plight thereof, and reaps the joy of it or
ſorrow, by an univerſal touch and inward ſenſe, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up into her cognoſcence and animadverſion. And
we may eaſily imagine of what moment the health
and good plight of the body is to the minde that
lodges there, if we do but conſider the condition of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115236:122"/>
Plants, whoſe bodies we cannot but conceive in a more
grateful temper, while they flouriſh and are ſweet and
pleaſing to the eye, then when they are withered by
age or drought, or born down to the Earth by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
ſtorms of rain. And ſo it is with the body
of man, (where there is a Soul to take notice of its
condition) far better when it is in health by diſcretion
and moderation in diet, and exerciſe, then when it is
either parched up by ſuperſtitious melancholy, or
ſlocken and drowned in ſenſuality and intemperance;
For they are both abaters of the joyes of life, and leſſen
that plenitude of happineſs that man is capable of by

elſe how could that hold good that the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
<hi>That Godlineſs is profitable for all things, having the
promiſe of this world, and that which is to come;</hi> when
as without the health of the body, there is nothing at
all to be enjoyed in this preſent world? And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God doth not tie us to the Law of Angels, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour

worldly Wiſdome, not Philoſophy, is perſtringed in
the Myſterie of the Tree of Knowledge of good

or the Paradiſe of Luxury. That Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory

was it, that our Mother <hi>Eve</hi> could no better

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115236:123"/>
the Serpent, ate the forbidden Fruit; as a famous <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi> once very tragically inſiſted upon the
point to his attentive Auditory. But it ſhould ſeem, a
certain <hi>Smith</hi> in the Church, as <hi>Bodinus</hi> relates, when
he had heard from this venerable <hi>Preacher,</hi> that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Mankinde, ſaving a ſmall handful of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
were irrevocably laps'd into eternal damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by <hi>Adams</hi> eating of an Apple; and he having the
boldneſs to argue the matter with the <hi>Prelate,</hi> and
receiving no ſatisfaction from him in his managing the
Literal ſenſe of the Text, (and his skill it ſhould ſeem
went no further) the <hi>Smith</hi> at laſt broke out into
theſe words, <hi>Tam multas rixas pro re tantilla ineptè
excitari;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid in plain Engliſh,
<hi>What a deal of doe has there here been about the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Apple?</hi> Which blaſphemous ſaying, as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus</hi>
writes, had no ſooner come to the ears of the

the Courtiers. So dangerous a thing is an ignorant

and inſinuating it ſelf very eaſily into the mindes of
men upon that conſideration, and ſo deceiving them;
when as other paſſions cannot ſo ſlily ſurpriſe us, they
bidding more open warre to the quiet and happineſs

                        <hi>What a rigid and ſevere thing, &amp;c.</hi> This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of ſuch, as are either utter ſtrangers to Religion, or
have not yet arrived to that comfortable reſult of it,
that may be expected. For God takes no delight in
the perpetual rack of thoſe ſouls he came to redeem,
but came to redeem us from that pain and torture
which the love of our ſelves, and our untamed luſts,
and pride of ſpirit, makes us obnoxious to; which
men being loth to part with, and not having the heart
to let them be ſtruck to the very quick, and pulled up
by the roots, the work not accompliſhed according to
the full minde and purpoſe of God, there are ſtill the
ſeeds of perpetual anxiety, ſadneſs, and inevitable pain.
For to be dead, is eaſement, but to be ſtill dying, is
pain; and it is moſt ordinarily but the due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of halting and hypocriſie. And mens ſpirits
being long ſowred thus, and made ſad, their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and behaviour is ſuch, that they fright all inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
young men from any tolerable compliance in
matters of Religion, thinking that when they are once
engaged there, they are condemned <hi>ad Fodinas</hi> for
ever, and that they can never emerge out of this work
and drudgery in thoſe dark Caverns, till they die
there like the poor <hi>Americans,</hi> inſlaved and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
by the mercileſs <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But verily if we have but the patience to be laid
low enough, the ſame hand that depreſſed us, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
us above all hope and expectation. For if we be
ſufficiently baptized into the Death of Chriſt, we ſhall
aſſuredly be made partakers of his Reſurrection to
Life, and that glorious liberty of the Sons of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is written, <hi>If the Son make you free,
then are you free indeed;</hi> free from Sin, and ſecure
from the power of any Temptation. But if Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
has not had its perfect work, too mature a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115236:125"/>
of the ſweetneſs of the <hi>Animal Life,</hi> may prove
like the Countreymans cheriſhing the Snake by the
fire ſide, which he had as he thought taken up dead
in the Snow, it will move and hiſſe, and bite, and ſting.
The ſtrong preſages of the manifold corporeal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and ſatisfactions of the fleſh, may grow ſo big
and boiſterous in the minde, that the ſoul may deem
her ſelf too ſtraitly girt up, and begin to liſten to ſuch
whiſpers of the Serpent as this; <hi>What a rigid and
ſevere thing is this buſineſs of Religion?</hi> &amp;c. and
account her ſelf if ſhe be not free to every thing, that
ſhe is as good as free to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 2, 3. <hi>But the womaniſh part in Adam.</hi> 'Tis
but one and the ſame ſoul in man entertaining a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
with her ſelf that is ſet out by theſe three parts:
The <hi>Serpent, Adam,</hi> and the <hi>Woman.</hi> And here the
ſoul recollecting her ſelf, cannot but confeſs, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
denies her no honeſt, nor fitting pleaſure that
is not hazardous to her greater happineſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
her ſelf in what peril ſhe is of loſing the divine
Life, and due ſenſe of God, if ſhe venture thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly
to follow her own will, and not meaſure
all her actions and purpoſes by the divine Light that
for the preſent is at hand to direct her.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 4. <hi>But the Serpent, &amp;c.</hi> The ſenſe of this
verſe is, that the eager deſire of pleaſure had wrought
it ſelf ſo far into the ſweetneſs of the <hi>Animal Life,</hi>
that it clouded the mans judgement, and made him
fondly hope that the being ſo freely alive to his own
will was no prejudice to the will of the Spirit, and the
life of God w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was in him, when as yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Apoſtle expreſly writes, <hi>What fellowſhip is
there betwixt righteouſneſs &amp; unrighteouſneſs? What
communion betwixt light and darkneſs? What agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
betwixt Chriſt and Belial?</hi> And he elſewhere tells
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115236:125"/>
us, <hi>That Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church, that he
might ſo throughly purge it and ſanctifie it, that it
ſhould have neither ſpot nor wrinkle: but that it
ſhould be holy and unblameable,</hi> a true Virgin Bride
clothed with his divine Life and Glory. And thoſe
men that are ſo willing to halt betwixt two, the Fleſh
and the Spirit, and have houſe-room enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them both, (as if there could be any friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and communion betwixt them) let them ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
conſider whether this opinion be not the ſame
that <hi>deceived Adam</hi> was of, and let them ſuſpect the
ſame ſad event, and acknowledge it to ariſe from the
ſelf-ſame Principle, the inordinate deſire of pleaſing
their own wills, without the allowance of the divine
Light, and conſulting with the will of God.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 5. <hi>Skill and Experience in things.</hi> And ſome
men make it no ſin, but warrantable knowledge to
know the world, and account others fools that are
ignorant of that wicked myſterie. For man would be
no Slave or Idiot, but know his own liberty, and
gain experience, as he pretends, by the making uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>But that the accurate exerciſe of Reaſon in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods marvellous works in <hi>Nature,</hi> or thoſe
innocent delightful concluſions in <hi>Geometry,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,</hi>
and the like; that theſe parts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſhould be perſtringed by <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Hiſtory,
it ſeems to me not to have the leaſt probability in it:
for there are ſo very few in the world, whoſe mindes
are carried any thing ſeriouſly to ſuch objects, that it
had not been worth the taking notice of. And then
again it is plain that the miſcarriage is from the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of ſuch kinde of knowledge, as the <hi>Woman,</hi>
the <hi>flowring life of the body,</hi> occaſioned <hi>Adam</hi> to
tranſgreſſe in. Wherefore it is the fulfilling of the
various deſires of the fleſh, not an high aſpire after
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115236:126"/>
Intellectual Contemplations; for they reſpect the
<hi>Maſculine Faculties,</hi> not the <hi>Feminine,</hi> that made
way to the tranſgreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I ſay, the wiſdome that the Serpent here
promiſed, was not <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> or <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
or any of thoſe innocuous and noble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
of the underſtanding of man, but it
was the <hi>knowledge of the world,</hi> and the <hi>wiſdome of
the fleſh.</hi> For the life of the body is full of deſires,
and preſages of ſatisfaction in the obtaining of this or
the other external thing, whether it be in <hi>Honour, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
or <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and if they ſhake off the divine
Guide within them, they will have it by hook or by
crook. And this worldly wiſdome is ſo plauſible in
the world, and ſo ſweetly reliſhed by the meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man, that it were temptation enough for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
if it were but to be eſteemed wiſe, to adventure
upon ſuch things as would initiate him therein.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 6. <hi>But the wiſdome of the fleſh.</hi> The Apoſtle
calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Which wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> he
ſaith, <hi>is enmity with God.</hi> But the free and cautious
uſe of Reaſon, the knowledge of the fabrick of the
world, and the courſe of natural cauſes, to underſtand
the Rudiments of <hi>Geometry,</hi> and the Principles of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,</hi>
and the like; what man that is not a <hi>Fool,</hi>
or a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> will ever aſſert that God bears any
enmity to theſe things? For again, theſe kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
are not ſo properly the knowledg of <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil,</hi> as of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood,</hi> the knowledge
of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> referring to that experience we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up in <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> encounters.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe men that from this Text of Scripture
would perſtringe Philoſophy, and an honeſt and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
enquiry into the true knowledge of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I ſuſpect them partly of <hi>ignorance,</hi> and partly
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115236:126"/>
of a <hi>ſly</hi> and <hi>partial kinde of countenancing of thoſe
pleaſures that beaſts have as well as men,</hi> and I think
in as high a degree, eſpecially Baboons and Satyres,
and ſuch like letcherous <hi>Animals.</hi> And I fear there
are no men ſo ſubject to ſuch miſ-interpretations of
Scripture, as the boldeſt <hi>Religioniſts,</hi> and <hi>Mock-Prophets,</hi>
who are very full of heat and ſpirits, and
have their imagination too often infected with the
fumes of thoſe lower parts, the full ſenſe and pleaſure
whereof they prefer before all the ſubtile delights of
<hi>Reaſon</hi> and generous <hi>Contemplation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But leaving theſe <hi>Sanguine-inſpired Seers,</hi> to the
ſweet deception and gullery of their own corrupted
fancy, let us liſten and keep cloſe to him that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deceive nor be deceived, I mean <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his
holy Apoſtles; and now in particular, let us conſider
that grave and pious Monition of S. <hi>Peter, Beloved, I
beſeech you, as Strangers and Pilgrims, abſtain from
fleſhly luſts that warre againſt the ſoul.</hi> Wherein,
this holy man inſtructed of God, plainly intimates
that the ſoul in this world is as a traveller in a ſtrange
Countrey, and that ſhe is journeying on to a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more ſutable to her, then this in the body. Whence
it follows, that the tender patronizing of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that are mortal and die with the body, is a badg
of a poor, baſe, degenerate minde, and unacquainted
with her own nature and dignity.</p>

ſtrength and power to divine and holy things. <hi>This
was</hi> Adams <hi>miſtake, that he thought he could ſerve
two Maſters, The will of God, and the dictates of
the fleſh. But thus he became eſtranged to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life and Power,</hi> which will not dwell in a body
that is ſubject unto ſin; For the holy Spirit of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
will fly deceit, and remove from thoughts that

are without underſtanding, (viz. <hi>ſuch as are ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

unrighteouſneſſe cometh in.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 8. <hi>Could not endure the preſence of it.</hi> For
the divine Light now was only a convincer of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
but adminiſtred nothing of the divine Love
and Power, as it does to them that are obedient and
ſincere followers of its precepts, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi>
could no more endure the preſence of it, then ſore eyes
the Sun or Candle-light.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 9. <hi>Perſiſted and came up cloſer to him.</hi> This
divine Light is God, as he is manifeſted in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of man, but his Love and Power are not fit to
be communicated to <hi>Adam</hi> in this diſſolute and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
condition he is in, but meerly conviction, to
bring him to repentance. And after the hurry of his
inordinate pleaſures and paſſions, when he was for a
time left in the ſuds, as they call it, this light of
Conſcience did more ſtrictly, and particularly ſift
and examine him, and he might well wonder with

things before, having loſt thoſe by promiſcuouſly

done, and that they are but the ſuggeſtions of nature,
which is the work of God in the world, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may do them, how, and in what meaſure
they pleaſe; But here the divine Light does not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe
<hi>Adam</hi> for the exerciſe of his <hi>Feminine</hi> faculties,
but that in the exerciſe of them they were not regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an higher and more holy rule, and that he
kept them in no more ſubjection unto the <hi>Maſculine.</hi>

                        <hi>To which he had nothing to ſay, but,</hi> &amp;c. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that <hi>Adams</hi> temptations were very ſtrong, and
ſo accommodate to the vigorous life of the body, that,
as he thought, he could not reſiſt. But the will of
man aſſiſted by God, as <hi>Adam's</hi> was, if it be ſincere,
what can it not doe?</p>
                     <p>Ver. 14. <hi>Then the divine Light began to chaſtiſe
the Serpent.</hi> From this 14 verſe to the 20. there
ſeems to be a deſcription of the conſcience of a man
plainly convincing him of all the uglineſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of thoſe ſinful courſes he is engaged in, with
ſome hints alſo of the advantages of the better life, if
he converted to it, which is like a preſent flame kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his minde for a time, but the true love of the
divine Life, and the power of grace being not alſo
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115236:128"/>
communicated unto his ſoul, and his body being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg'd
of the filth it has contracted by former evil
courſes, this flame is preſently extinct, and all thoſe
monitions and repreſentations of what ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
him are drowned in oblivion, and he preſently
ſettles to his old ill ways again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it crept baſely upon the belly.</hi> See what has
been ſaid out of <hi>Philo</hi> upon ver. 1.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 15. <hi>But might I once deſcend ſo far.</hi> This
the divine Light might be very well ſaid to ſpeak in
<hi>Adam.</hi> For his conſcience might well re-minde him,
how grateful a ſenſe of the <hi>harmleſs joyes of the body</hi>
he had in his ſtate of obedience and ſincerity; and if
the divine Light had wrought it ſelf into a more full
and univerſal poſſeſſion of all his faculties, the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>joyes of the body,</hi> which had been the off-ſpring
of the woman, had ſo far exceeded the tumultuous
pleaſures of inordinate deſires, that they would like
the Sun-beams playing upon a fire, extinguiſh the heat
thereof, as is already ſaid in this fifteenth verſe.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 16. <hi>So that the kindly Joy of the health of
the body ſhall be much depraved.</hi> The divine Light
in the Conſcience of <hi>Adam</hi> might very well ſay all
this, he having had already a good taſte of it in all
likelihood, having found himſelf after inordinate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating
his furious deſires of pleaſure in a dull, languid,
nauſeating condition, though new recruits ſpurred
him up to new follies. For the <hi>Moral Cabbala</hi> does
not ſuppoſe it was one ſingle miſtaken act that brought
<hi>Adam</hi> to this confuſion of minde, but diſobedience at
large, and leading a life unguided by the Light and
Law of God.</p>
                     <p>Earthly minded Adam. Philo <hi>calls him</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Ver. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Adams</hi> Conſcience was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115236:128"/>
by the divine Light and Reaſon, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
ſo inſtructed him for the preſent, that he could
eaſily read his own doom, if he perſiſted in theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of diſobedience, that he ſhould be prick'd and
vex'd in his wilde rangings after inordinate pleaſure
all the while the <hi>Earthly mind</hi> was his light &amp; guide.
But after all this conviction, what way <hi>Adam</hi> would
ſettle in, did not God viſit him with an higher pitch
of ſuperadvenient grace that would conveigh <hi>Faith,
Power,</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> unto him, you ſee in the verſe
immediately following.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 20. <hi>Adam was not ſufficiently.</hi> For meer
conviction of Light disjoin'd from <hi>Faith, Power,</hi> and
<hi>Affection,</hi> may indeed diſturb the minde and confound
it, but is not able of it ſelf to compoſe it and ſettle it
to good, in men that have contracted a cuſtome of

caſtigation of the divine Light manifeſted in <hi>Adams</hi>
Conſcience was over, he forthwith falls into the ſame
ſenſe of things, and purſues the ſame reſolutions that
he had in deſigne before, and very feelingly concludes
with himſelf, that be that as true as it will, that his
Conſcience dictated unto him, yet nothing can be
more true then this; <hi>That the Joy of his body was
a neceſſary ſolace of life, and therefore he would ſet up
his happineſs in the improvement thereof.</hi> And ſo
adhering in his affection to it, counted it <hi>his very life,</hi>
and that there was no living at all without it. They
are almoſt the words of <hi>Philo,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſenſe of
the body, in which was this corporeal Joy, <gap reason="foreign">

to that purpoſe. And to clothe men according to
their conditions and quality, what is more ordinary,
or more fit and natural? As thoſe that are fools they
ordinarily clothe them in a fools coat. And ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
will and affection being carried ſo reſolvedly to
the brutiſh life, it is not incongruous to conceive that
the divine Light judging them <hi>very Brutes,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
ſhe gives them is ſet out in this paſſage of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
them with the <hi>skins of beaſts.</hi> The meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of this verſe is, that the <hi>divine Light</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of <hi>Adam</hi> had another bout with him, and that
<hi>Adam</hi> was convinced that he ſhould grow a kinde of
a <hi>Brute,</hi> by the courſes he meant to follow. And
indeed he was content ſo to be, as a man may well
conceive, the pleaſure of ſin having ſo weakned all
the powers of that higher life in him, that there was
little or nothing, eſpecially for the preſent, able to
carry him at all upwards towards Heaven and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>And of a truth, vile <hi>Epicuriſme,</hi> and <hi>Senſuality</hi>
will make the ſoul of man ſo degenerate and blinde,
that he will not only be content to ſlide into brutiſh
immorality, but pleaſe himſelf in this very opinion
that he is a real <hi>Brute</hi> already, an <hi>Ape, Satyre,</hi> or
<hi>Baboon,</hi> and that the beſt of men are no better, ſaving
that civilizing of them and induſtrious education has
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115236:129"/>
made them appear in a more refined ſhape, and long
inculcate Precepts have been miſtaken for <hi>connate
Principles</hi> of <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Natural Knowledge,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
there be no indiſpenſable grounds of <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Virtue,</hi> but what has hapned to be taken up by
<hi>over-ruling Cuſtome.</hi> Which things, I dare ſay, are as
eaſily confutable, as any concluſion in <hi>Mathematicks</hi>
is demonſtrable. But as many as are thus ſottiſh, let
them enjoy their own wildeneſs and ignorance, it is
ſufficient for a good man that he is conſcious unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that he is more nobly deſcended, better bred and
born, and more skilfully taught, by the purged facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his own minde.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 22. <hi>Deſign'd the contrary.</hi> The mercy of the
Almighty is ſuch to poor man, that his weak and
dark ſpirit cannot be always ſo reſolvedly wicked as
he is contented to be; wherefore it is a fond ſurmiſe
of deſperate men, that do all the violence they can to
the remainders of that Light and Principle of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and honeſty left in them, hoping thereby to come
to reſt and tranquillity of minde, by laying dead, or
quite obliterating all the rules of godlineſs &amp; morality
out of their ſouls. For it is not in their power ſo to
do, nor have they any reaſon to promiſe themſelves
they are hereby ſecure from the pangs of Conſcience.
For ſome paſſages of Providence or other may ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
them, that they ſhall be forced to acknowledg
their errour and rebellion with unexpreſſible bitterneſs
and confuſion of ſpirit. And the longer they have
run wrong, the more tedious journey they have to
return back.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it is more ſafe to cloſe with that life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
that when it is attained to, neither deſerves nor
is obnoxious to any <hi>change</hi> or <hi>death;</hi> I mean when
we have arrived to the due meaſure of it. For this is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115236:130"/>
the natural accompliſhment of the ſoul, all elſe but
ruſt and dirt that lies upon it.</p>
                     <p>Ver. 23. <hi>Out of this Paradiſe of Luxury.</hi> The
<hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> takes no notice of any more
Paradiſes then one, calling it always the <hi>Garden of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
But the <hi>Seventy</hi> more favourable to our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cabbala,</hi> that which they call <hi>a Garden in Eden</hi> at
firſt, they after name <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which may
ſignifie <hi>the Garden of Luxury.</hi> But whether there
be any force at all in this or no, that Supplement I
have made in the foregoing verſe will make good the
ſenſe of our <hi>Cabbala.</hi> And in the very Letter and
Hiſtory of the Scripture, if a man take notice, he muſt
of neceſſity make a ſupply of ſomething or another to
paſs to what follows with due cohaeſion and clearneſs
of ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>So in the very next Chapter, where God dooms
<hi>Cain</hi> to be a Vagabond, and he cryes out that <hi>every
man that meets him will kill him,</hi> according to the
conciſe ſtory of the Text; there was none but <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> in the world to meet him, and yet there is a
mark ſet upon him by God as if there had been then
ſeveral people in the world, into whoſe hands he might
fall, and loſe his life by them. And then again at
ver. 17. <hi>Cain</hi> had no ſooner got into the <hi>Land of
Nod,</hi> but he has a wife and a childe by her, and he
is forthwith ſaid to build a City, when as there is no
mention of any but himſelf, his wife, and his childe
to be the Artificers; but any ingenious Reader will
eaſily make to himſelf fitting ſupplements, ever ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
due diſtances of time and right preparations to
all that is ſaid to be acted. And ſo in the ſtory of
<hi>Samſon,</hi> where he is ſaid to take three hundred Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
it may be rationally ſuppoſed, that Countrey was
full of ſuch creatures, that he had a competency of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115236:130"/>
time, a ſufficient number to help him, and the like.
That the Hiſtory of Scripture is very conciſe, no body
can deny; and therefore where eaſie, natural, and
agreeable ſupplements will clear the ſenſe, I conceive
it is very warrantable to ſuppoſe ſome ſuch ſupplies,
and for a Paraphraſt, judiciouſly to interweave them.</p>
                     <p>But now that Paradiſe at firſt ſhould ſignifie a ſtate
of divine pleaſure, and afterward of ſenſual voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
it is no more harſh then that <hi>Adam</hi> one while
is the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Man,</hi> another while
the <hi>Earthly</hi> and <hi>Carnal.</hi> For one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
thing may be a Symbole of contrary Spiritual
Myſteries. So a <hi>Lion</hi> and a <hi>Serpent</hi> are figures of
Chriſt, as well as of the Devil; and therefore it is not
ſo hard to admit that this <hi>Garden of Eden</hi> may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematize,
while <hi>Adam</hi> is diſcours'd of as innocent
and obedient to God, the <hi>delights of the Spirit;</hi> but
after his forſaking God, <hi>the pleaſures of the Fleſh;</hi>
and conſequently, that the fruit of the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in
the one, may be <hi>perſeverance and eſtabliſhment in the
divine Life;</hi> in the other, <hi>a ſettlement and fixedneſs
in the brutiſh and ſenſual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ver. 24.</hi> The manly faculties of Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
<hi>Theſe I conceive may be underſtood by the</hi>
Cherubim <hi>and</hi> flaming Sword. <hi>For the</hi> Cherubim
<hi>bear the Image of a man, and Reaſon is a cutting, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
thing like a Sword, the Stoicks call it</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
dividing and diſtinguiſhing Reaſon. <hi>For
Reaſon is nothing but a diſtinct diſcernment of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's
of things, whereby the minde is able to ſever
what will not ſute, and lay together what will. But
if any body will like better of</hi> Philo's <hi>interpretation
here, of the</hi> Cherubim <hi>and</hi> flaming Sword, <hi>who makes
the</hi> Cherubim <hi>to ſignifie the</hi> goodneſs <hi>and</hi> power of
God; <hi>the</hi> flaming Sword, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the</hi> effectual
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115236:131"/>
and operative Wiſdome or Word of God; <hi>it does not
at all claſh with what we have already ſet down. For
my ſelf alſo ſuppoſe, that God by his</hi> Son <hi>the</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Word <hi>works upon the Reaſon and Conſcience of
man:</hi> For that Word is living and powerful, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the
dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints
and marrow, and is the diſcerner of the thoughts and
intents of the heart, neither is there any creature
that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have
to do, <hi>Heb. 4.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That he could not ſet up his reſt for ever.</hi> Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
a mans heart is not ſo in his own hand, that he
can do himſelf all the miſchief he is contented to do.
For we are more Gods then our own, and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Power has dominion over us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let not a man vainly fancy, that by violently run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into all enormity of life, and extinguiſhing all
the Principles of Piety and Virtue in him, that he
ſhall be able thus to hide himſelf from God, and never
be re-minded of him again for ever. For though a
man may happen thus to forget God for a time, yet he
can never forget us, ſith all things lie open to his ſight.
And the power of his <hi>ever-living Word</hi> will eaſily cut
through all that thickneſs and darkneſs, which we
ſhrowd our ſelves in, and wound us ſo, as to make us
look back with ſhame and ſorrow at a time that we
leaſt thought of.</p>
                     <p>But that our pain may be the leſſe, and our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
commence the ſooner, it will be our wiſdome to
comply with the divine Light betimes; for the ſooner
we begin, the work is the eaſier, and will be the
more timely diſpatch'd through the power of God
working in us. But this I muſt confeſs (and I think
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115236:131"/>
my ſelf bound, to bear witneſs to ſo true and uſeful
a myſterie wrapt up in this <hi>Moſaical</hi> covering) that
there is no other paſſage nor return into happineſs then
by death. Whence <hi>Plato</hi> alſo that had been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with theſe holy writings, has defined Philoſophy
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The meditation of death, viz.</hi> the
dying to the luſt of the fleſh and inordinate deſires of
the body; which Purgatory if we had once paſſed
through, there would ſoon ſpring up that <hi>Morning
Joy,</hi> the reſurrection from the dead, and our arrival
to everlaſting life and glory. And there is no other
way then this that is manifeſtable either by <hi>Scripture,
Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Experience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thoſe that through the grace of God and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
thirſt after the divine Righteouſneſs, have
born the Croſſe till the perfect death of the body of
ſin, and make it their buſineſs to have no more ſenſe
nor reliſh of themſelves, or their own particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
then if they were not at all, they being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed
as to themſelves, and turned into a <hi>Chaos</hi> or
dark <hi>Nothingneſs,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak, they become
thereby fitted for the <hi>new Creation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this perſonal life being thus deſtroyed, God
calls unto them in the dead of the Night, when all
things are ſilent about them, awakes them and raiſes
them up, and breathes into them the breath of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life, and ever after actuates them by his own
Spirit, and takes all the humane faculties unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
guiding or allowing all their operations, always
holding up the ſpirit of man ſo, that he will never
ſink into ſin; and from henceforth death and ſorrow
is ſwallowed up for ever, for the ſting of Death is Sin.</p>
                     <p>But whatever liberty and joy men take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that is not founded in this new life, is falſe and
frivolous, and will end but in ſadneſs, bitterneſs, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115236:132"/>
intolerable thraldome. For the <hi>Corporeal life</hi> and
<hi>ſenſe</hi> will ſo deeply have ſunk into the ſoul, that it
will be beyond all meaſure hard and painfull to diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
her.</p>
                     <p>But as many as have paſſed the Death, have arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to that Life that abides for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>And this Life is <hi>pure and immaculate Love,</hi> and
this <hi>Love</hi> is God, as he is communicable unto man,
and is the ſole Life and Eſſence of Virtue truly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
or rather, as all colours are but the reflexion of
the Rayes of the Sun ſo all Virtue is but this One va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
coloured and figured from the diverſity of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
and <hi>Circumſtances.</hi> But when ſhe playes with
eaſe within her own pure and undiſturbed Light, ſhe
is moſt lovely and amiable; and if ſhe ſtep out into
zeal, Satyrical rebuke, and conteſtation, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcent
and debaſement for the preſent, but the
deſign is, a more enlarged exaltation of her own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the getting more univerſal foot-hold in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſons, by diſlodging her deformed enemy.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>divine Love</hi> is the love of the <hi>divine Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and that <hi>Beauty</hi> is the <hi>divine Life</hi> which would
gladly inſinuate it ſelf, and become one with that
particular Principle of Natural life, the Soul of man.
And whatever man ſhe has taken hold upon, and won
him to her ſelf, ſhe does ſo actuate and guide, as that
whatever he has, ſhe gets the uſe of, and improves it
to her own <hi>intereſt,</hi> that is, the advancement of her
ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But ſhe obſerving that her progreſs and ſpeed is
not ſo faſt as ſhe could wiſh, (that is, that mankind
is not made ſo fully and ſo generally happy by her, as
ſhe could deſire, and as they are capable of) ſhe
raiſes in a man his Anger &amp; Indignation againſt thoſe
things that are obſtacles and impediments in her way,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115236:132"/>
beating down by ſolid Reaſon ſuch things as pretend
to Reaſon, and ſuch things as are neither the genuine
off-ſpring of the humane faculties, nor the effects of
her own union with them, diſcountenancing them, and
deriding them as Monſters and Mongrel things, they
being no accompliſhment of the humane nature, nor
any gift of the divine. She obſerving alſo that mankind
is very giddily buſie to improve their natural faculties
without her, and promiſe themſelves very rare effects
of their art and induſtry, which if they could bring
to paſſe, would be in the end but a ſcourge and plague
to them, and make them more deſperately bold,
ſenſual, Atheiſtical, and wicked, (for no fire
but that of Gods Spirit in a man can clear up the true
knowledge of himſelf unto us) ſhe therefore taketh
courage (though ſhe ſee her ſelf ſlighted, or unknown)
and deſervedly magnifies her ſelf above all the effects
of Art and humane induſtry, and boldly tells the
world, what petty and poor things they are if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto her.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth ſhe at all ſtick to pour out her ſcorn and
deriſion unto the full upon thoſe gariſh effects of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
Fancy, where Melancholy dictates ſtrange and
uncouth dreams, out of a dark hole, like the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Heathen Oracles. For it is not only an
injury to her ſelf, that ſuch <hi>Antick Phantaſmes</hi> are
preferred before the pure ſimplicity of her own beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but a great miſchief to her darling the Soul of man,
that he ſhould forſake thoſe faculties ſhe has a minde
to ſanctifie and take into her ſelf, and ſhould give
himſelf up to meer inconſiderate imaginations, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
impreſſes, chuſing them for his guide, becauſe
they are ſtrongeſt, not trueſt, and he will not ſo much
as examine them.</p>
                     <p>Such like as theſe and ſeveral other occaſions there
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115236:133"/>
are, that oftentimes figure the <hi>divine Life</hi> in good
men, and ſharpen it into an high degree of zeal and
anger. But whom in wrath ſhe then wounds, ſhe
pities, as being an affectionate Lover of univerſal
mankind, though an unreconcileable diſliker of their
vices.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE now gone through my <hi>Threefold Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi>
which I hope all ſincere and judicious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will entertain with unprejudic'd candour and
kinde acceptance. For as I have lively ſet out the
myſteries of the holy and precious life of a Chriſtian,
even in the <hi>Moſaical Letter,</hi> ſo I have carefully and
on purpoſe cleared and aſſerted the grand eſſential
Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, as it is a <hi>particular
Religion,</hi> avoiding that rock of ſcandal, that ſome
who are taken for no ſmall Lights in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
world have caſt before men, who attenuate all ſo
into Allegories, that they leave the very Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion ſuſpected, eſpecially themſelves
not vouchſafing to take notice, that there is any ſuch
thing as the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt now exiſtent,</hi> much leſſe
that he is a <hi>Mediatour with God for us,</hi> or that he
was a <hi>ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> when he hung at Jeruſalem
upon the Croſſe, or that there ſhall be again any
<hi>appearance of him in the Heavens,</hi> as it was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the two Angels to his Apoſtles that ſaw him
aſcend; or that there is any <hi>life to come,</hi> after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of the natural body, though our Saviour
Chriſt ſays expreſly, <hi>that after the Reſurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are
like the Angels of God.</hi> But to be ſo <hi>ſpiritual</hi> as to
interpret this of a myſterious reſurrection of a man
in this life, is in effect to be ſo truly <hi>carnal,</hi> as to
inſinuate there is no ſuch thing at all as the <hi>Life to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115236:133"/>
come,</hi> and to adde to <hi>Sadduciſme, Epicuriſme</hi> alſo or
worſe, that is, a religious liberty of ſilling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
houſes with brats of the adulterous bed, under
pretence that they are now riſen to that ſtate that
they may without blame commit that, which in other
mortals is down-right adultery. Such unlawful ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Letter as this, is to me no ſign of a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
man,</hi> but of one at leaſt <hi>indiſcreet and light min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
more groſſe in my conceit then <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and
<hi>Philetas,</hi> who yet affirmed that the reſurrection
was paſt, and ſo allegorized away the faith of the
people.</p>
                     <p>For mine own part I cannot admire any mans fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
but only his <hi>Reaſon, Modeſty, Diſcretion</hi> and
<hi>Miracles,</hi> the main thing being preſuppoſed (which
yet is the birth-right of the meaneſt Chriſtian) <hi>to be
truly and ſincerely Pious.</hi> But if his imagination
grow rampant, and he aſpire to appear ſome ſtrange
thing in the world, ſuch as was never yet heard of,
that man ſeems to me thereby plainly to bewray his
own <hi>Carnality</hi> and <hi>Ignorance.</hi> For there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Truths then what are plainly ſet down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
already, and the beſt, the plaineſt of all. So
that if any one will ſtep out to be ſo venerable an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer
of the world,</hi> that no man may appear to
have ſaid any thing like unto him either in his own
age, or foregoing generations; verily I am ſo blunt
a Fool as to make bold to pronounce, that I ſuſpect
the party not a little ſeaſon'd with <hi>ſpiritual Pride</hi>
and <hi>Melancholy:</hi> For God be thanked, the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
is ſo plain a Rule of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi> to the ſincere and
obedient ſoul, that no man can adde any thing to it.</p>
                     <p>But then for compariſon of perſons, what dotage
is it for any man, becauſe he can read the <hi>common Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet
of Honeſty and a Pious life,</hi> in the Hiſtory of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115236:134"/>
the Old and New Teſtament, finely allegorizing, as
is conceiv'd, thoſe <hi>external Tranſactions</hi> to a myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
application of what concerns the <hi>inward man,</hi> to
either place himſelf, or for others to place him in the
ſame level with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of men,</hi> and <hi>Prince of the higheſt Angelical
Orders,</hi> who roſe out of the grave by the Omnipotent
hand of his Father, and was ſeen to aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by his Apoſtles that gazed upon him as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
through the Clouds, and whom all true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
expect viſibly to appear there again and re-viſit
the world according to the promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Now it ſeems to me a very unreaſonable and raſh
thing, if not impious and blaſphemous, to acknowledge
any man whatſoever comparable to ſo <hi>ſacred a Perſon</hi>
as our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> every way approved himſelf,
and was approved by a voice from Heaven, ſaying,
<hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him.</hi> If any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having none of theſe teſtimonies from above, nor
being able to do any thing more then other men, ſhall
be ſo unmannerly as to place himſelf in the ſame order
and rank with <hi>Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> becauſe he has
got ſome fine fancies and phraſes, and ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
interpretations of Scripture, which he will
have immediately ſuggeſted from the Spirit; I cannot
forbear again to pronounce, that this man is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with an high degree of either <hi>pride</hi> or <hi>madneſs,</hi>
and if he can perſwade any others to look upon him
as ſo <hi>ſacred a Prophet,</hi> that it muſt be in them at
leaſt <hi>Inadvertency</hi> or <hi>Ignorance;</hi> Nay, I think I
ſhall not ſay amiſſe if I attribute their miſtake to a
kinde of <hi>Pride</hi> alſo. For <hi>Pride</hi> affects nothing more
then <hi>Singularity;</hi> and therefore undervaluing the
plain ſimplicity of ordinary <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſuch as at
firſt ſight is held forth in the Goſpel of Chriſt, they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115236:134"/>
think it no ſmall privilege to have a Prophet of their
own; eſpecially they getting this advantage thereby,
that they can very preſently, as they fancy, cenſure and
diſcern the truth or falſhood of all that venture to
ſpeak out of the Rode of their own Sect; as if every
body were bound to conne their leſſons according to
their Book. And it is a fine thing to become ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
wiſe at ſo cheap a rate, and diſcover who is
<hi>Spiritual,</hi> or who is the <hi>Carnal,</hi> or meer <hi>Moral</hi> man.
This is indeed the folly of all Sects, and there is no
way better that I know, to be freed from ſuch invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements,
then by earneſtly endevouring after that
which they all pretend to, and to become truly more
holy and ſincere then other men; for the throughly
purified man is certainly delivered from all theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things I could not forbear to ſpeak in zeal to
the honour of my <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the good and ſafety of
his <hi>Church.</hi> For if men once get a trick to call the
world <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> where the <hi>death of Chriſt on the
Croſſe at Jeruſalem is not acknowledged a ſacrifice
for ſin,</hi> nor <hi>himſelf now in his humane Perſon a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
with God the Father,</hi> and <hi>the Head of his
Church Militant and Triumphant;</hi> nor that there
is <hi>any Eternal Life nor Reſurrection, but that in the
Moral or Myſtical ſenſe:</hi> aſſuredly this will prove
the moſt dangerous way imaginable, quite to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that in time, which is moſt properly called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, out of the world, and to leave meerly
the name thereof behinde.</p>
                     <p>But a Religion ſo manifeſtly eſtabliſhed by God in a
moſt miraculous manner, and being ſo perfect, that the
wit of man cannot imagine any thing more compleat,
and better fitted for winning ſouls to God: It can
be nothing but giddineſs or light-mindedneſs, to think
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115236:135"/>
that this Religion can be ever ſuperannuated in the
world, but that it ſhall laſt till <hi>Chriſts Corporeal
appearance in the Clouds.</hi> For there is no reaſon at
all that the holy Ghoſt ſhould be thought to come in
the fleſh of ſome particular man, no more then God
the Father did under the Law. For what can he tell
us more or better, then Chriſt already has told us;
or what himſelf may tell us without any perſonal
ſhape? And there is no Prophecie of any ſuch thing,
but onely of that which is better, that Chriſt will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
for all thoſe that are his faithful and obedient
followers, the Spirit of Truth and Righteouſneſſe, and
indue them with the divine Life, and that it ſhall ſo
at length come to paſs, that Juſtice, Peace, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall more univerſally and fully flouriſh in the
world, then ever yet they have done. And that faith
in God, and of the Life to come ſhall be more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
ſealed upon the hearts of men; and that there
ſhall be a neerer union and conjunction betwixt the
humane and divine nature in us, then ever, and more
frequent and ſenſible commerce betwixt the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the <hi>Aethereal</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Region, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as I have already declared concerning the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day</hi> in this <hi>Defence of the Moral Cabbala.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in the mean time though that full <hi>Sabbatiſme</hi>
be ſo far off, yet I doubt not but there have been and
are very ſweet and joyful <hi>praelibations</hi> of it, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
perſons, which quickens their hopes and deſires
of the compleatment thereof, and divine Providence is
not idle, all things working towards this laſt <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraphe;</hi>
and the heads of Sects themſelves, though
I never ſaw any yet that my light and judgement
could pronounce infallible and perfect, (as I think
there never will be any till <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf come again,
who will appear in no <hi>Sectarian</hi> way, for himſelf
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115236:135"/>
hath given us an intimation, <hi>that if any one ſay, Loe
here is Chriſt, or there is Chriſt, believe it not)</hi> yet
ſuch is the groſſe ignorance or hypocriſie of ordinary
carnal Churches (as they call them) that ſome heads
of Sects, I ſay, have ſpoken very true and weighty
things againſt them, very lively ſetting them out &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painting
them in their own colors, inſomuch that they
will be able, not only to turn from them the affections
of all plain hearted men, that are faſt friends to the
eternal Righteouſneſs of God, and prefer that before
the moſt ſpecious devices of arbitrarious Superſtition,
but alſo to raiſe their anger and indignation againſt
them. But it does not preſently follow, that becauſe a
man can truly diſcover the groſs faults &amp; falſities that
are in another, that therefore he is utterly blameleſs
himſelf, and not at all impoſed upon by his natural
complexion, nor ſpeaks any thing that is falſe, nor
omits any thing that is both true and neceſſary. But
be theſe Sects what they will be, the grand Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
themſelves are ſo naked and obnoxious, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they caſt away from them their hypocriſie, pride,
and covetouſneſſe, they will in all likelihood raiſe
ſuch ſtorms in all Chriſtendome, that in proceſſe of
time, not onely Eccleſiaſtical but Civil power it ſelf
will be involved in thoſe ruines, and Chriſt alone will
be exalted in that day. <hi>For before he deliver up the
Kingdome to his Father, he is to put down all Rule,
and all Authority and Power; For he muſt reign till
he have put all his enemies under his feet; The laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death:</hi> which as I have
already ſignified unto you, though he be now the
<hi>King of Terrours,</hi> will in that great <hi>Feſtival</hi> and
<hi>Sabbatiſme,</hi> by reaſon of ſo ſenſible and palpable
union betwixt the Heavenly and Earthly nature, be
but a pleaſant paſſage into an higher room, or to uſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115236:136"/>
that more myſterious expreſſion of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Moſes,</hi> in whoſe writings this <hi>Sabbatiſme</hi> is
adumbrated, God will draw up a mans ſoul to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by an <hi>Amorous kiſſe;</hi> For ſuch was the death of
that holy man <hi>Moſes,</hi> who is ſaid to have died in
<hi>Moab</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>in the kiſſes and embracements
of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſhall be the condition of the Church of
Chriſt for many hundred years; Till the Wheel of
Providence driving on further, and the Stage of things
drawing on to their laſt Period, men ſhall not onely
be freed from the fear and pain of death, but there
ſhall be no capacity of dying at all. <hi>For then ſhall
the day of the Lord come, wherein the Heavens ſhall
paſſe away with a noiſe, and the Elements melt with
fervent heat, and the Earth with all the things in it
ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Thus Chriſt having done venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon the obſtinately wicked and diſobedient,
and fully triumphed over all his enemies, he will
give up his Kingdome to his Father, whoſe <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent</hi>
hitherto he hath been in the affairs of both
Men and Angels. But till then whoſoever by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be more Spiritual and Myſtical then other
men, would ſmother thoſe eſſential Principles of the
Chriſtian Religion, that have reference to the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> let him phraſe it as well as he
will, or ſpeak as magnificently of himſelf as he can,
we are never to let go the plain and warrantable
Faith of the Word, for ungrounded fancies and fine
ſayings.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let every man ſeek God apart, and
ſearch out the Truth in the holy Scripture, preparing
himſelf for a right underſtanding thereof, by ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
