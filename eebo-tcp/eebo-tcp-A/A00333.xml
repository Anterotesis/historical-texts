            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the Right Worshipfull, the <hi>Maior, Shiriffes and Aldermen,</hi> together with all that vnfainedly feare God, <hi>and sincerely loue the truth, in that religious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Citie of <hi>Norwich, W.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, Fathers, and Brethren, as <hi>Elisha</hi> said<note place="margin">2. King 4. 13.</note> vnto the <hi>Shunamite</hi> (who prouided a chamber for the Prophet) Behold, thou hast had all this care for vs, but what shall we doe for thee? So may I truely say. The Citie of <hi>Norwich</hi> hath beene very carefull for me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding kinde vnto mee sometime an vnworthy Minister of Christ amongst them, but what shall I doe for them, wherby to shew my selfe thainkefull for their loue? fiue yeares it was my blessed hap (through the goodnesse of God) to reape the benefit of two very reverend &amp; godly persons then your Citie Preachers,<note place="margin">M. Moore. M. Roberts.</note> and now Cittizens of Heauen, (whose memorie is blessed of all that knew them, and must of me be euer honored as my Fathers in the Lord, and with them also I inioyed the labours of many learned and godly persons besides, which made your Citie like <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Iericho,</hi> which mainetained<note place="margin">2. King. 2.</note> the Schooles of Prophets amongst them. Oh the heauenly harmony and sweete amitie that then was amongest you from the highest to the lowest! The magistrates and the Ministers imbracing and seconding one an other, and the common people affording due reverence, &amp; obedience to
<pb facs="tcp:22673:3"/>
them both. No matters of weight were vsually concluded in your common assemblies for the good of your Citie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had first consulted with your graue and godlie Preachers. <hi>It was Dauids ioy,</hi> to see the people goe vnto the house of the Lorde. And whose heart was not filled with ioy, to see in Norwich the continuall resorte that was eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day through the yeare, and that for many yeers togither vnto the holy exercises of Religion, which were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually supported by woorthy and sincere Preachers, and graced by the presence of so many graue and Religious Magistrates? And so great a meeting of learned, godly, and faithfull Pastors; aboue twenty together, of good account haue I seene vsually frequenting the holy exercises, and all hauing pastorall charges in the Cittie, besides those of the Cathedrall Church. And all these were of one heart, and one minde, all as brethren imbracing most louingly each other from the heart, boldely conuersing, and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing one with another, no man suspecting each other. Such was their care and vigilancie, yea, and such was their grauitie and modestie, yea such was their grace and humillitie, and such was their charitie, and fidelitie; but especially so well were things managed by the wisdome &amp; moderation of those two worthies before mentioned, who were still amongst the rest as presidents, or leaders of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that it was not possible for any iarre or contention to be of any longer continuance then a sparke of fire produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the violent stroke of the steele and flint, of which a man might truly say, <hi>Oritur moritur,</hi> if any were kindled with one word, the next word quencheth it againe; their heauenly doctrines were greedily receiued of you for the truthes sake, and themselues were alwaies welcome vnto you for their doctrine sake, but whether of their doctrines or their persons were in greater price with you, it is hard for me to say. Being inuited to your houses (as daily they were by one or other) they were seldome or neuer dis-ioyned, but whither some went, all went: none were excluded, to shew that you had not the word in respect of persons, but all were imbraced alike, that all might receiue incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:22673:3"/>
alike in the worke of the Lord: in which course of yours, whether your aboundant loue, or christian wisedom ought to haue the preheminence, I know not: passing sweet was the one, and exceeding pleasant was the other, yea gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious &amp; admirable were you in both chargeable: I confesse it was vnto you, yet such was the loue you bare to those, whose feet brought you the glad tidings of peace, that you counted nothing too deare for them. I write not thus to flatter you: the Searcher of hearts wil witnesse for me, that I speak the truth &amp; lie not, my conscience tels me that I shuld do you open wrong, if I should not acknowlege the City of Norwich to haue been alwaies as kind and louing to their Preachers, as they haue beene famous for their gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In all, let God haue the glorie. As for my selfe, (the most vnworthy of all) I must acknowledge my selfe by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bands of loue to be tied vnto you, but espetially, for that in my troubles which befell me about matters of my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie (though long since, yet neuer to be forgotten) it pleased you for the most part in your own persons as occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but espetially in the person of a most worthy Senator, then your chiefe magistrate (and now also a glorious citizen of heauen, to stand forth in the face of all the world for my iust defense, as also afterward when all meanes fayled, to extend your inlarged harts to the vtmost of your power for my maintenance. Abounding was your loue before, but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it superabounded, and by the chearfull working therof it appeared to all the world, that your faith was not dead nor barren, but like <hi>Dauids</hi> blessed tree, planted by the riuers of celestiall waters, which bringeth forth his fruite in due season, without either fading or fall of the leafe; so farre were you from driuing me away (as it hath pleased Enuie to remour it home euen to the place where I dwell) that I must needs confesse, that you did labour to the vtmost of your skill, to haue kept me still amongst you, and no lesse was the care for the rest of my brethren, &amp; fellow laborers, who being in the fame predicament with my selfe, were also inforced (through the indisposition of those times) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue their tents from amongst you, to the general griefe of
<pb facs="tcp:22673:4"/>
themselues, and the most parte of your Citie, and to place them elsewhere, vpon those aggrauated rumours posted after me by the malignant messengers of the enuious man, it hath bin my happc (God purposing for my good I trust to haue it so) to be not alittle sifted in this countrey, where it hath pleased the Lord of his goodnesse to place mee: to which end, there hath beene also posting from hence vnto you for coppies of records and I wote not what, assuring themselues, that from thense would come such shot that would batter downe my hold, and make me quite to giue ouer; and no lesse in boasting manner most confidently they gaue out amongst themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>es. But God be thanked, who suffered them like deluded soules, no lesse foolish then malitiously to triumph before the victorie: and my feare is, that those men which traueled so far, and searched so neare, and were at such cost and raked (as it were) so many backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and troubled both themselues, and others, and all for the finding, and reuiewing of an old rotten coffin (so many yeares since buried with a blocks end in it, sor want of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se) haue receiued the most hurt themselues: for some of them (besides the forfiture of their credit which they pawned vpon the bargaine) haue prooued since that, like cloth that shrinkes in the wetting, and hauing borrowed till no man will trust them, are glad to liue where no man doth know them, shifting for themselues <hi>tanquam indiuidua vaga,</hi> which are <hi>vix demonstratiua</hi> in their owne countrey, wherof I take no pleasure at all, for I haue alwaies wished them more good then they doe themselues: and I hope, the rest of their confederates will make good vse of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes falls. But as for you, right Worshipfull, and in the Lord intirely beloued, your hearts, and hands haue euer bin free from such kinde of practises, and blessed be God that hath euer kept you from casting in your lot amongst them, whose deuising hath bin still to spreade nets for the innocent and simple man: and as the remembrance of your antient loue doth much reioyce me; so is my ioy much more increased, through the constant continuance of your loue, which by many signes and tokens, did most plentifully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb facs="tcp:22673:4"/>
when (after many yeares discontinuance) it pleased the Lord of his goodnesse, to bring mee amongst you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And now, beloued in the Lord, what remaineth, but that you continue your antient &amp; holy courses, that so the fame of your faith, loue, and zeale, which is spread farre and neare, may increase yet more and more, to your euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting commendation. And if you haue still the holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies and sacred exercises of religion continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, as I hope you haue, I beseeeh you be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God for them, and make your best vse of them while you may. And you that be the worthy Senatours and gouernours of that Citie, let me intreate you to follow the good example of your predecessours, grace the holy assemblies with your presence, and goe before the people to Gods house, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did in fetching home the Arke; incourage your Pastors and Preachers still, and shew forth the power of religion in your holy conversation and good gouernment, as you haue done. And my good brethren which be of the ministerie in that Citie, if I haue found grace in your eyes, and may be counted worthy to aduise you in the Lord, be you all of one heart and of one minde in the Lord. And I beseech you forget not the holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, which one of your antient Fathers and Pastours was<note place="margin">M. Moore.</note> wont oftentimes to put you in minde of; though there may be some difference in opinion, about matters of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and lesse weight, yet let there be no difference in brotherly affection, but loue one another in the Lord from the heart, remembring that of the Apostle: If any be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, God shall reueale it vnto him in his good time: and let none be too forward in rushing into the heart and conscience of his brother, for that is (as you know) Gods prerogatiue, but rather imitate the Lord himselfe, who said; if <hi>Solomon</hi> did sinne against him, he would visite<note place="margin">2. Sam 7.</note> him with the roddes of the children of men: but yet his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnesse and mercy, he would not take from him. So, though there may perhappes arise some hote disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, about this or that, and in heate, you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance sometimes strike too hard, and make the sparkles

               </gap>ie too fast; yea, cause may be giuen sometime to reprehend one another roundly, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Peter,</hi> yet let charitie &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnes neuer depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongst you, &amp; the God of peace shall blesse you as he hath done, to the wonder of the world. I know you are already established in the present truth, and therefore neede none of my instructions: yet, for somuch as sound faith hath neede of a strengthning, and a pure minde, of a stirring vp, and a wearie heart, of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, I beare my selfe somewhat bold vpon your Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an patience, to write thus vnto you as I doe. And now (right Worshipful, and the rest of your Citie beloued in the Lord) for a testimonie of a heart that would be thankfull, if my <hi>velle &amp; posse,</hi> would be sutable the one to the other, I doe heere offer vnto your Christian consideration, &amp; curteous patronage, these Dialogues, which I haue at times, for my owne recreation, translated out of Latine into english. And because they containe varietie of matters, therefore I dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to your whole Citie, which also comprehendeth varietie of wits and dispositions.

What should I say more? Good wine needes no Iuy bush, and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> hath no need of my commendations. To the learned and iudicious, yea generally to all men, he is so wel knowne for his deepe learning, and profound iudgement: that for the entertainment of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But of children that come to their end by vntimely death, I suppose I may (and that not vnprobably) say, that more haue miscaried in the nursing, then otherwise, as shall further appeare by the reasons of this reuerend and learned Authour. And for further confirmation thereof, marke what I shall tell thee.

There was then in presence an ancient graue Matrone, and a midwife, who openly protested, that she knew a Nurse, that had taken (for greedinesse of gaine) three seuerall women children to nurse at one instant, and they were not of the meanest sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> neither: and her manner was to goe forth in the morning, and come no more in againe till night, but to leaue the poore tender Infants in the Cradle togither without any companie or comfort, which within a short space by continuall crying
<pb facs="tcp:22673:6"/>
and beating themselues one against another for want of food, ended their miserable and wofull dayes: a thing able to break a heart of flint. This midwife being demaunded whether she spake this vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearesay or no, did protest that she was an eie witnesse thereof her selfe, and saw them all three laid forth vpon a boord together. The hearing whereof caused some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eyes, and bitter sighs. This cruell murtherer answered the Law, but she could not giue the poore Infants their innocent blood againe.

to wash your rotten salt fish: and it is truely said, that you spend water in vaine, for a fish alwayes smelleth like fish, though you should besméere it with swéet oyntments. And no maruel though they smel so when they are dead, for the most of them do smel so soone as they are taken. Flesh bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powdred in brine may be kept very swéet many yéeres together, and common salt wil preserue it from smelling: being dried in the smoake and the wind, it gathereth no ill sauour.

And farre is he from the faith of the Gospel, that trusteth to such things: And farre is hee from Christian charity, that for meate and drinkes sake, will gréeue his Christian brother, whose liberty Christ hath purchased with his blood. What bitter contentions doe we sée amongst Christians? What deadly reproaches about garments of this fashion, or that fashion, and about the colour of garments, and about meates which the waters yéelde, and which the fieldes yéelde? If this mischéefe had infected but a few, it might be contemned: but now the whole world we sée is at deadly centention about them and the like.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fish.</speaker>
               <p>I haue also heard of an excellent Diuine, <hi>Gerson</hi> I thinke his name is, that hath added this, that if there bée any cause of the like moment, with those which the canons of the Church do except by name, that then also the force of the law doth cease. For there be peculiar habites of states of mens bodies, which do make the restraint of meat more daungerous than an euident disease. And there be secret diseases which yet do not appeare, which in truth may bée so much the more dangerous. And they which compel chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or very old folkes, or sicke and féeble persons, either to taste, or to eate fish, doe commit a double sinne, first against brotherly charitie: Secondly, against the mind and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Church, which would not haue them wrapped in a law, which cannot keepe it without their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, or danger.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer Christ did institute, he instituted it to the health both of soule and bodie, neither can any potentate chalenge vnto himselfe so great power, as that by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions he may driue any persons to endaunger their liues. As if one by fasting one night, should not be able to sleepe, and for want of sleepe, should be in danger of a fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie: he that shal driue a man to this inconuenience, is (both against the minde of the Church, and against the will of God) a murtherer of his neighbor. Princes so often as they sée cause, do make lawes to punish men by death: what<note place="margin">Princes may punish by death.</note> they may do I do not define; this I thinke I may say, that they should deale more safely, if they did not punish any by death, but for such causes as are expressed in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In heynous crimes, the Lord doth call men away from the vttermost bond of circumstance that may leade thereunto, as in the case of periurie, he forbiddeth to swear at all; to kéepe men from murther, he forbids men to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie. We for a humane constitution doe driue men to the vttermost bound or verie point of manflaughter. But so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as there appeareth any probable cause, it is the part of charitie to exhort our neighbours, vnto those things which
<pb facs="tcp:22673:27"/>
the weakenesse of his bodie doth require. And if there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> cause, yet it is the dutie of christian charitie, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably to interpret the matter, that it might be done with a good minde, vnlesse he that wil eate, shall shew ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a manifest contempt of the lawes. And such as shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously, and seditiously, eate any thing that is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by law, the ciuill Magistrate doth iustly punish. But what euery man may eate in his own house, for the health of his bodie, it is for Physitians, and not for Magistrates to determine.</p>
               <p>But if hereupon also any shall be so wicked as to raise any tumult, let him be guiltie of sedition, and not he that prouideth for his bodily health, not breaking either Gods law or mans law. And such is the lenitie and moderation of the Church of Christ, that vpon good cause, they will of their owne accord stirre vp men to vse such things as the health of their bodie shall require, and which their licences or charters wil also arme men against the accusations and backbitings of ill disposed persons.</p>
               <p>It may be called zeale, if any man shall deale seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his owne body, for euerie man is best knowne vnto himselfe; but where is the pietie, or where is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of these men, who contrarie to the law of nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the law of God, and contrarie to the meaning of the Church, would enforce their weak brother vnto death, or to some kinde of disease more cruell than death it selfe?</p>

There stoode on the shoare some strong men, and vsed to the sea, which with long poales did strengthen themselues against the waues, so as the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermost of them could reach his pole vnto him that coulde swimme, and so by that means diuers were drawen to shore, and saued.</p>

               <p>There is a certaine man, none of the meaner sort, who vsed to goe much a hunting. In the Country he met with a certaine damsel, the daughter of a very poore man: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne

to be excéedingly in loue with her, and he a man of good yeares: and for her sake he did very often lie abroad all night, his pretence was still hunting. His wife, being a singular good woman, and suspecting I wot not what, shee made a search for her husbands game, and stil was at him for that he had gotten with hunting, and went so farre, that at last shée came to that rustical cosage or cabine of turfes, where he vsed to lie, and fished out all his businesse, the place where he slept, what he drunke, what prouision there was made for him: there was no houshold stuffe but méeee pouerty. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron went home, and by and by came againe thither, and brought with her a good bed, and all furniture belonging to it, and plate to drinke out of, and mony to buy things withall, praying them that if he came th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After a few daies, her husband came thither againe by stealth, and saw euery thing more plentiful, and hansomer than it was wont to be, he asked how all that came about: they said, there was a certaine honest matron of kindred to him, that had brought those things thither, and charged them to entertaine him in the best manner that they could. By and by his conscience was touched, and he beganne to suspect that this was his wiues doing. Being returned home, he asked her if she had not béene there, she did not deny it: then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her to what end she sent that stuffe thither? hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (quoth she) you are vsed to lie and fare better at home, I saw that you were but homely vsed there, and I thought it my dutie, (when your pleasure was to lie there) to see you haue better entertainement.</p>

               <p>So I will, and it is best of all. There Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (who cannot lie) taught me, that neither whoremongers, nor forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catours shall inherite the kingdome of heauen. When I had read that, I began thus to thinke with my selfe: It is but a small thing that I looke to get by my fathers inheritance, and yet I had rather renounce all whoredomes, and harlots, then to be dis-inherited of my father. How much more should I take héede that I be not dis-inherited of my heauenly father? And yet against my father (if he shold dis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inherit me) I might be relieued by the laws of men; but if God should dis-inherite me, I haue no refuge to flie vnto. Therefore I did fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue with my selfe wholy to renounce all harlots.</p>

               <p>So it seemed good vnto nature, to fit and match eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans turne: how carefull is nature that nothing may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; see how she hath represented two persons in this one childe; the nose and eies resemble the father; the fore-heade and chinne the mother. Can you commit such pretious pledge to another bodies trust? Me thinke they are double cruell that are able to doe it: for that is not done onely with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of the Infant that is put away, but also with their owne perill, because the milke which is corrupted by chaunge, doth oftentimes bréede most perillous diseases. And therefore it falleth out, that while they prouide for the fashion or beautie of one bodie, they neglect the liues of two bodies, and while they go about to preuent sudden old age, they cast themselues into an vntimely death; but I will go sée what I can do with your husband and friends.</p>

               <p>The way to death is more hard than death it selfe. But if a man can frée his minde from that imagination of feare of death, he shall abate a great part of that euil. To bée short, whatsoeuer is bitter, either in sickenesse, or in death, is made more tollerable, if a man doe wholy commit himselfe ouer to the good will of God. For as touching the féeling of death, when the soule is pulled from the body, I thinke it to be either none at all, or very stupide and blockish, because na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before it be come to that passe, doth dead, and astonish, or mortifie, and as it were, cast asléep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Againe with the like noyse they cried; if thou beléeuest these things, crush my hand, saith the one, and mine, said the other, and so he did. And so with turning of his head this way and that way, and crushing of their haudes there were almost thrée houres spent, since <hi>George</hi> began to gaspe for breath. Here <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> standing vpright, pronounced his absolution againe; but before he could finish it, <hi>George</hi> was gone.

               <p>Yes, onely one he was aduised by, both a good Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a good man. His name is <hi>Iacob Castrutius,</hi> he told <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> that he would do the best good that he could for his friend but said withall, that there was more helpe in God then in Phisitions. <hi>Cornelius</hi> receiued this speach in as good part as if he had giuen him most certain hope of life. Therfore though he were euer to his abilitie good to the poore, yet now whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he could spare, after he had taken order for his wife and children, he gaue it to the néedie, not to these proude beggers, that are in euerie place, but to the honest poore, who wrought hard for their liuing, and yet were poore, their charges being greater then their labour could supplie, I prayed him to go to his bed, and to send for the Minister, rather then by walking vp and downe to weary his thin wasted bodie. His answere was, that his care was alwayes rather to be helpfull, than troublesome to his friends, if it were possible, and that hée
<pb facs="tcp:22673:84"/>
would not be vnlike himselfe at his death. And truly he did not kéepe his bed aboue one day, and part of a night, before he left this world. In the meane time, for the weakenesse of his bodie, he leaned on a staffe, or sate in a Chaire, seldome would he lie in his bed, but vpon his bed sometime, aud sit right vp. At this time he did euer giue something in charge of looking to those that were knowne to be honest poore folke, or reade on some holy Booke, which might stirre vp his minde to trust in God, and might also set forth the loue of God to vs-ward. If through wearinesse he were not able to reade, he would heare some friend rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He did often with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous zeale exhort his familie to concord and mutuall loue, and to the studie of true godlinesse: and those that tooke care for his death, he did comfort most louingly. He did also admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them all, and all his friends to pay euerie man his owne.</p>

                  </gap>, but without any secret confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for he saide that his minde was not troubled with anie thing. Néere his pastor beganne to deale with him about his
<pb facs="tcp:22673:85"/>
buriall, and asked him, where, and in what manner he would be buried? Bury me (saide the other) euen as you would burie a christian man of the most inferior sorte, neither doe I care where you lay this body of mine, it will be found out well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the last day wheresoeuer it be laide, and as for fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pompe I regarde it not. Then there was mention made of the ringing of belles, of yéerely dirges to be sung, of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the communion of merites to be purchased: to which his answer was, My pastor, I shal be neuer the worse, if there be no bell rung for me: if you bestow any solemne funerall on me, it is more than néede: or if there be any other thing that the publike custome of the church requireth, if it may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without offence to the weake ones, I leaue it to your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Neither is it my purpose, either to buy any mannes prayers, or to spoile any man of his merits, Christ hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited sufficiently for me, and I hope the prayers of the church will not alittle prosite me while I am aliue. My whole trust is, that the prince of Pastors the Lord Iesus, hath done away all my sinnes, and fastned them vnto his Crosse, and that hée hath written and sealed my pardon with his most pretious blood, whereby he hath made vs assured of eternall life, if wée put all our trust in him. For God forbidde that I with mans merites and pardons should prouoke my God to enter into iudgement with his seruant, being most assured, that in his sight no flesh liuing shall be iustified, I appeale from his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to his mercy, which is great and vnspeakeable. Hauing spoken these things the Minister departed. <hi>Cornelius</hi> hauing conceiued great hope of saluation, with great ioy and chéere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, willeth some things to be read vnto him out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which tend to prooue the resurrection of the dead, and the rewarde of immortallitie, as that out of <hi>Esay</hi> concerning the death of <hi>Hezechia,</hi> together with his song: then the fiftéenth chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians: then of the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> out of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but especially the hystorie of Christes passion out of the Gospel. Oh how gréedily did he deuoure (as it were) euery thing in his minde? at some things sighing, at some lifting vp his hands with thankesgiuing, reioycing at
<pb facs="tcp:22673:85"/>
some, and at many things that were read vnto him, he would cast forth certaine short prayers. After dinner, when he had slept a while, he willed the twelfth chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> to be read vnto him, euen to the end: héere you would haue saide he had béene a man transfigurated, and inspired with a new spirite. Now it grew towards the euening, he called for his wife and children, and raising vp himselfe so well as he could, he spak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But héere <hi>Cornelius</hi> interrupted her, and saide, My most deare sister in Christ, if the Lord Iesus shall vouchsafe to bestowe this strength of spirite vpon thée, be not thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his heauenly gift, but embrace it: for it will be better both for thée and thy children: but if the infirmitie of the flesh shall call thée to the married state, then knowe that my death doth set thée frée from that power which I haue had ouer thée, but not from that faithfulnesse, which both in respect of mée and thée, thou owest vnto all the children common to vs both. As touching matrimonie, vse that libertie which the Lorde hath permitted vnto thée: onely this I request, and admonish thée of, that thou choose a man of those conditions: and thou also to shew thy selfe in such sort towards him, that he may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his owne goodnesse be drawen, or by thy commoditie may be prouoked to loue his sonnes in lawe. And moreouer, beware that thou doost not binde thy selfe by any vow: Kéepe thy selfe frée to God and our children, whome I would haue thée so to traine vp in all piety, that they may not addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="tcp:22673:86"/>
vnto my trade, vntill by their yeares and experience of things, it shall appeare for what kind of life they are most fit. Then turning to his children, hée exhorted them to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of godlinesse, to obey their mother, and to haue mutuall loue and concord amongst themselues. Hauing ended these sayings, he kissed his wife, and his children, and prayed God to blesse them. After all this, he looking vppon the rest that were present, he said, before to morrow morning, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus which rose againe in the morning, will vouchsafe of his great mercie to call this soule out of the sepulchre of this body, and out of the darkenesse of this mortalitie, into his heauenly light.

The night being past, about foure of the clocke, all his family being about him, he willed the whole Psalme to be read vnto him, which the Lord Iesus praying rchearsed vpon the crosse. That done, he said, The Lord is my light and my saluation, whom shall I feare? The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I be afraide? Then he folded his hands vpon his breast in maner of a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant, and lifting his eyes toward heauen, he said, Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus receiue my spirit. And forthwith closed vp his eies, as one about to sléepe, and with a little sigh yéelded vp the ghost, you would haue said he had béene asléepe.</p>
