         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is now in the Preſs, a <hi>GEOGRAPHICAL DISCRIPTION</hi> of <hi>ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, SCOTLAND,</hi> and <hi>IRELAND,</hi> with the <hi>Iſles</hi> thereto belonging: which in a compendious Method treateth of ſuch <hi>things</hi> that are moſt neceſſary to be known, and as yet hath not been treated of by any <hi>Author.</hi> And for the further Utility and Adornment thereof, ſhall be added a <hi>MAPP</hi> and <hi>TABLE</hi> to every County of <hi>England;</hi> beſides ſeveral general Ones. Which ſaid <hi>Volumn,</hi> for the conveniency of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> ſhall be <hi>Printed</hi> in a ſmall-ſiezed <hi>Folio,</hi> and finiſhed with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
            <p>And for the better ſatisfying of all ſuch that have a deſire to be concerned in the ſaid <hi>Work,</hi> it is thought convenient to give an <hi>Account</hi> as to the Method thereof, which in brief is as followeth:</p>
            <p>The firſt Enterprize ſhall be to give (in a compendious Method) a Diſcription of the Kingdoms in general, as to their <hi>Scituation, Clime, Temperature</hi> of <hi>Air, Extent, Diviſion, Fertility, Proviſions, Commodities, Manufactures,</hi> and <hi>Trade;</hi> alſo of their <hi>Inhabitants</hi> both Ancient, and Modern; their <hi>Laws, Cuſtoms, Government,</hi> both Civil and Spiritual, the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> the Precedency and Degrees of <hi>Honour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And having thus run over theſe, and the like general <hi>Heads;</hi> the next attempt will be to take a particular Survey of each <hi>County</hi> in the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of his <hi>Majeſties Dominions;</hi> and therein to give an <hi>Account</hi> as to their <hi>Scituation</hi> with other <hi>Counties,</hi> their <hi>Extent, Fertility,</hi> what <hi>Commodities</hi> and <hi>Manufactures</hi> they produce; their chief <hi>Rivers, Hills,</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that have <hi>Emunities</hi> granted unto them; as <hi>Cities, Boroughs,</hi> or <hi>Towns Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate;</hi> as alſo, of ſuch as have the Conveniency of <hi>Markets,</hi> and <hi>Fairs:</hi> with other <hi>Things</hi> of Remark both Ancient and Moderne: which <hi>Geographically</hi> ſhall be treated of.</p>
            <p>And for effecting the ſame, an <hi>Abſtract</hi> is firſt made from all approved <hi>Authors</hi> yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, that have Writ of the ſame Subject, as well thoſe in general, as thoſe of particular <hi>Counties;</hi> beſides the Aſſiſtance of ſeveral <hi>Manuſcripts:</hi> Which ſaid <hi>Abſtracts</hi> ſo taken, (being digeſted into a <hi>Geographical Method</hi>) are (and ſhall be) ſuperviſed by thoſe that are known in the ſaid <hi>Parts,</hi> and accordingly enlarged, or rectified as occaſion requireth. And for the better perfecting the ſaid <hi>Work,</hi> an account of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> that each <hi>County</hi> is Ennobled with (eſpecially ſo as Friends to the ſaid <hi>Worke</hi>) as to their <hi>Names, Titles,</hi> and <hi>Seats</hi> ſhall be given: Which for the avoiding of <hi>Exceptions,</hi> ſhall be placed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetically;</hi> and beſides which, all thoſe that are <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> ſhall have their <hi>Coates</hi> of <hi>Armes</hi> affixed to the <hi>Mapp,</hi> or <hi>Mapps</hi> of the <hi>County</hi> or <hi>Counties,</hi> by them made choice of, (ſo as allowed of by the Kings of <hi>Arms</hi>) in a Border encirculing the ſame, to remain to future Ages. A <hi>Work</hi> very neceſſary, and uſeful for all <hi>Men;</hi> wherefore theſe <hi>Propoſals</hi> are humbly tendred by me <hi>Richard Blome,</hi> Lodging at Mr. <hi>Kids,</hi> at the Corner of <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</hi> near <hi>New-Market.</hi>
