            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Arist. 2. Metaphiſ.</note> Had I laboured with ouer-abundance of * fictions, or flouriſhes, perhaps they had expoſed me, cenſurable, and diſprized this ſacred ſubiect: Therefore I rest more ſparing in that kind.</p>
            <p>Two things I would treat of: Firſt, the <hi>matter,</hi> ſecondly, the <hi>manner</hi> of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the <hi>matter,</hi> (ſo farre as I haue dealt) it is Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and indighted by the holy Spirit of God, not lyable to errour, and needs no blanching.</p>
            <p>In it Theologie ſits as Queene, attended by her handmaid<note place="margin">The excellence and vſe of this Hiſtory.</note> Philoſophy; both concurring, to make the vnderſtanding Reader, a good Diuine, and a wiſe Moralist.</p>
            <p>As for the Diuinity, it diſcouers the Almighty in his two great Attributes; in his Mercy, deliuering his Church; in his Iuſtice, confounding her enemies.</p>
            <p>As for the Morality, it offers to vs the wholy practicke part of Philoſophy, dealt out into Ethicks, Politicks, and Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Ethicall part (the obiect whereof is the Manners of a priuate man) ranges through the whole booke, and empties
<pb facs="tcp:15922:4"/>
it ſelfe into the Catalogue of Morall vertues, either thoſe that<note place="margin">Heiland in Eth. Mores inſtituu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ad virtutem.</note> gouerne the body; as Fortitude, Chap. 9. 2. and Temperance, Chap. 1. 8. or thoſe which direct the ſoule, either in outward things, as Liberality, Chap. 1. 3. Magnificence, Chap. 1. 6. Magnanimity, Chap. 2. 20. and Modesty, Chap. 6. 12. or in conuerſation, as Iuſtice, Chap. 7. 9. Manſuetude, Chap. 5. 2, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Politicall part (the obiect whereof is Publike Society) inſtructs, firſt, in the behauiour of a Prince, to his Subiect; in puniſhing his vice, Chap. 7. 10. in rewarding of vertues, Chap. 8. 2, 15. Secondly, in the behauiour of the Subiect to his Prince; in obſeruing his Lawes, and diſcouering his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Chap. 2. 22. Thirdly, the behauiour of a Subiect, to a Subiect; in mutuality of loue, Chap. 4. 7. in propagation of peace, Chap. 10. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Oeconomicall part (the obiect whereof is Priuate So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety) teacheth, firſt, the carriage of the Wife, to her Husband; in obeying, chap. 1. 22. of the Husband, to his Wife, in ruling, chap. 1. 22. Secondly, of a Father, to his Child, in aduiſing, chap. 2. 7, 10. of a Child, to his Father, in obſeruing. chap. 2. 20. Thirdly, of a Maſter, to his Seruant, in commanding. chap. 4. 5. of a Seruant, to his Maſter, in effecting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, chap. 4. 6.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in this Hiſtory, the two principall faculties of the ſoule are (nor in vaine) imployed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Intellect, whoſe proper obiect is Truth. Secondly,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Eth 3. Obiectum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis non eſt niſi bonum. Ariſt. Eth. 10.</note> the Will, whoſe proper obiect is * Good, whether Philoſophicall, which that great Maſter of Philoſophy cals * Wiſdome; or The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall, which we poynt at now, hoping to enioy hereafter.</p>
            <p>Who the Pen-man of this ſacred Hiſtory was, or why the<note place="margin">De dubijs non definies, ſed ſuſpenſam te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas ſententiam; Seneca de for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali vita.</note> name of God (as in few other parts of the Bible) is vnmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this, it is immateriall, and doubtfull. For the firſt, it is enough for an vncurious queſtioner to know, it was indited
<pb facs="tcp:15922:4"/>
by the Spirit of God: for the ſecond, let it ſuffice, that, that Spirit will'd not here to reueale his name.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As for the Manner of this Hiſtory (conſiſting in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riphraſe, the adiournment of the Story, and interpoſition of Meditations) I hope it hath not iniured the Matter: For in this, I was not the leaſt carefull, to vſe the light of the beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors (<hi>Authoritatis quorum ſum germanus</hi>) not daring to goe vn-led, for feare of ſtumbling. Some ſay, Diuinity in Verſe, is incongruous and vnpleaſing: ſuch I referre to the <hi>Pſalmes of Dauid,</hi> or the Song of his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> to be corrected. But in theſe lewd times, the ſalt, and ſoule of a Verſe, is obſcene ſcurrility, without which it ſeemes dull, and liueleſſe: And though the ſacred Hiſtory needs not (as humane doe) Poetry, to perpetuate the remembrance, (being by Gods owne mouth bleſt with Eternity) yet Verſe (working ſo neere vpon the ſoule, and ſpirit) will oft times draw thoſe to haue a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in familiarity, who (perchance) before, ſcarce knew there was ſuch a Booke.</p>
            <p>Reader, be more than my haſty pen ſtiles thee: Reade me with aduice, and thereafter iudge me, and in that iudgement cenſure me. If I iangle, thinke my intent thereby, is to toll bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ringers in. Farewell.</p>
