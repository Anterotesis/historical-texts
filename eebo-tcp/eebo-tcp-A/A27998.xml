            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE great Mischiefs which we already feel,
and the far greater yet, we justly fear from
the Vniversal Depravation of our <hi>Manners,</hi>
and horrible Contempt of <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Things,
have with good reason alarm'd all the <hi>Wiser part</hi> of
the <hi>Nation,</hi> who have a due Concern for the <hi>Interests</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Good</hi> of their <hi>Country.</hi>
Considering Men in all places express their Melancholy
Apprehensions, that if <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Prophaness</hi> should
without controul spread their <hi>Infection</hi> much farther,
the Consequences would be fatal; and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we have by <hi>His Majesty</hi>'s unrivall'd Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and most prudent Conduct, surmounted our fears
of <hi>Foreign Enemies,</hi> the Nation is still in greater
Danger from our <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Immoralities,</hi> our more
formidable ones at Home. <hi>His Majesty</hi> therefore, to
put a <hi>stop</hi> to the <hi>progress</hi> of this <hi>dreadful Evil,</hi>
and after he has sav'd us from our <hi>Enemies,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from our <hi>Selves,</hi> (his last and hardest Task)
has been pleas'd to recommend from the <hi>Throne</hi> the
<hi>Suppressing</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Irreligion;</hi> and our
<hi>Honourable Representatives,</hi> in nothing more
honourable than in this, have express'd a <hi>ready</hi> and
<hi>becoming Zeal</hi> for the accomplishing this <hi>Great</hi>
and <hi>Good Design.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To think of extirpating <hi>Vice</hi> would be indeed a vain
Imagination; to suppress its growth, and reduce its
<pb facs="tcp:48294:3"/>
Power and Interest, is not impossible. And tho' it must
be granted, that even this is hard to be effected, yet
when a Work is necessary, the Difficulty should only whet
the <hi>Courage,</hi> and provoke the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the Vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
And when our <hi>Government</hi> shall endeavour
to stop the various <hi>Sources</hi> of this <hi>Mischief,</hi> when it
shall attack with vigour the many <hi>monstrous Heads</hi>
of this <hi>Hydra,</hi> that terrible one that <hi>poisons the
Stage,</hi> and from thence conveys a <hi>deadly Contagion</hi>
through the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> may, perhaps, receive a <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
stroke.</hi> It must be confess'd, but not to the
<hi>Honour</hi> of a <hi>Christian Nation,</hi> that <hi>Poetry</hi> was
never in the worst of Times, or among the worst of
Men, employ'd to more <hi>detestable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urposes</hi> than it
has been by the Writers of this Age. This Weapon
which might have been manag'd with great advantage
against <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Prophaness,</hi> they have made an
Instrument of <hi>Destruction,</hi> and plung'd it into the
Bowels of their <hi>Native Country.</hi> I will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay
that the worst of our <hi>Poets,</hi> no not he who in the late
<hi>loose Reigns</hi> introduc'd and establish'd that pernicious
way of Writing, which <hi>corrupted</hi> the <hi>Stage,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd</hi>
our <hi>Manners,</hi> had this effect in view, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
design'd the <hi>fatal Consequences</hi> that attended their
<hi>performances.</hi> 'Tis hard to imagine that any Men
should be so intellectually Wicked, as to promote <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality</hi>
and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> meerly for the sake of doing
so; but this has been, and is still my complaint, that it
is eventually true, that the <hi>Loose</hi> and <hi>Prophane Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
of our <hi>Poets,</hi> whatever they design'd, have greatly
contributed to that decay of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and corruption of
<hi>Manners,</hi> which threaten the <hi>Nation</hi> with such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Consequences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:3"/>The Regard I have for the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and my Zeal for the <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of
my <hi>Country,</hi> have extorted these <hi>Complaints</hi> from
me: And though I know 'tis impossible to escape the
<hi>Reproaches</hi> of those who will think themselves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>unjustly,</hi> or too <hi>severely</hi> censured in this
Matter; yet that is no <hi>discouragement</hi> to me. If
I can <hi>escape</hi> the Defamation of their <hi>Panegyricks,</hi>
I think my self very safe. I have no Personal Quarrel
with any of the <hi>Writers</hi> I have censur'd; and if they
think fit to <hi>expose</hi> my <hi>Name</hi> for asserting the <hi>Cause</hi>
of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> I have no reason to be
displeased with them for doing me so <hi>great</hi> an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
If it be not possible to regulate this <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi>
and reform this <hi>evil Manner</hi> of <hi>Writing,</hi>
at least I am willing that <hi>Posterity</hi> should know, if
my <hi>Writings</hi> should <hi>continue</hi> so long, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> I mean as far as
Poetry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s concerned in them, were not given up without
Opposition, or any Protestations enter'd against it.</p>
            <p>One of the most <hi>Famous Poets</hi> of the Stage has
at last expresly own'd, that the <hi>Charge</hi> brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him is <hi>too just.</hi> He has done it in <hi>two Lines;</hi>
the <hi>two best</hi> he ever writ, and by which, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
he has acquir'd more <hi>true Honour</hi> than by all
the Volumes he has publish'd. The <hi>two Lines</hi>
are these:
<q>
                  <l>What I have loosely, or prophanely writ,</l>
                  <l>Let them to Fires, (their due Desert) commit.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Verses before</hi> Beauty in Distress.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>particular Persons</hi> endeavour to vindicate
themselves, yet in the general 'tis allow'd that the
<pb facs="tcp:48294:4"/>
               <hi>Stage</hi> requires a <hi>Reformation.</hi> The <hi>chief</hi> things
that are said in the <hi>defence</hi> of our <hi>Modern Plays,</hi>
are these; that they are an <hi>agreeable Diversion,</hi>
and that they mightily <hi>polish</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> our
<hi>Language.</hi> But of what Persons must that <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
he compos'd, who shall call that an <hi>agreeable
Diversion,</hi> where <hi>Prophaness</hi> and <hi>Immorality</hi>
are kindly treated and encouraged, and <hi>Vertue</hi> and
<hi>Wisdom</hi> exposed and put out of Countenance? Was
it not an Argument of the great <hi>Degeneracy</hi> of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> when they became <hi>delighted</hi> with the
<hi>bloody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

for the <hi>Sport</hi> and <hi>Pastime</hi> of the cruel Spectators?
But 'tis infinitely more pardonable to be thus <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
than to make <hi>Sport</hi> with the <hi>Tragical</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
of the <hi>English Theatre.</hi> 'Tis sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is in part true; though it must be own'd at the same
time that our most famous <hi>Masters,</hi> and most correct
<hi>Writers</hi> of <hi>English,</hi> are either of the Clergy, or else
are Gentlemen whose <hi>Stile</hi> seems to have nothing of the
<hi>Air</hi> of the <hi>Theatre</hi> in it. But suppose it were indeed
<hi>true,</hi> that we owe all the <hi>Refinements</hi> of our <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:4"/>
to the <hi>Stage,</hi> will that make amends for the
Mischiefs which are <hi>universally</hi> laid to its Charge?
Does the Honour and Happiness of a People depend
upon the <hi>Politeness</hi> of their <hi>Language,</hi> or the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of their <hi>Manners?</hi> let these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the <hi>old English</hi> Vertue, but so far as 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
by them, and we'll be contented to take our <hi>old
Language</hi> in the Condition they found it.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>degree</hi> of Vertue necessary to the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
of every <hi>Civil Society,</hi> without which the <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest</hi>
Laws, and the most <hi>prudent</hi> Provisions will be
in vain. Not many <hi>Princes</hi> have Vertue enough for
themselves, but none, no not the <hi>Best,</hi> not our <hi>Great
King</hi> himself, who has enough for <hi>many Kings,</hi> has
enough for himself, and his People too. For if the

to put the <hi>Laws</hi> in Execution; if the <hi>Numbers</hi> and
<hi>Confidence</hi> of the <hi>Criminals</hi> become so <hi>great,</hi> that
they stand upon their <hi>defence, despise</hi> the Authority,

for <hi>want</hi> of Vertue, let the <hi>Magistrate</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi>
be never so <hi>good,</hi> must be certainly <hi>undone.</hi> Whoever
therefore, as the Poets of the <hi>Stage</hi> have done, shall
by any means <hi>sink</hi> the <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> the

for a <hi>profligate</hi> and <hi>flagitious</hi> People
will destroy themselves in spite of the <hi>best Laws</hi> and
the <hi>wisest Ministers</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>ground</hi> of my Controversie with the
<hi>Stage.</hi> If a <hi>Foreign</hi> Enemy should invade the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
every <hi>English-man</hi> should take the alarm, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:48294:5"/>
he has receiv'd from them no <hi>personal</hi> Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The same Reason will justifie the <hi>Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
I have made to those <hi>Poets</hi> I have at any time
<hi>condemn'd,</hi> and will plainly show that I did not do it
unprovok'd. Whoever <hi>undermines</hi> the <hi>Goverment,
provokes</hi> every Man that <hi>loves It,</hi> to <hi>resist</hi> him.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great damage also to the Nation, that so
much of its <hi>finest Spirit</hi> is thus wasted, or employed
to very <hi>bad Ends.</hi> 'Tis plain that many of a <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Genius</hi> are likewise fit for the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Employments both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and there
are but very few, that are such <hi>meer Poets,</hi> as only
to be capable of being <hi>Turners of Verses.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Youth</hi> who are <hi>Poetically</hi> inclin'd, would
consider the Matter, and thereupon apply themselves
to Business, or <hi>severer</hi> Studies, many of them might
arise to <hi>eminent Stations,</hi> and at the same time <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>
themselves, and become very <hi>serviceable</hi> to
their Country; and by this means they would acquire
greater Honour and Reputation, than ever they will
do by their <hi>Rhimes and Plays:</hi> For if they would
reflect, they would soon be convinc'd, that tho' <hi>Poetry</hi>
is indeed an <hi>Ornament</hi> to those that have more noble
and more useful Qualities, yet when it becomes a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
'tis one of the meanest and lowest sort: 'Tis
like <hi>Dancing</hi> and <hi>Musick</hi> which we value in a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi>
when a <hi>Musician</hi> or a <hi>Dancing-Master</hi>
make no <hi>considerable</hi> Figure: So greatly different
are the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Esteem,</hi> which all Men pay, and
not without good reason, to the same <hi>Attainment,</hi>
when 'tis in one an <hi>Accomplishment,</hi> in another,
a <hi>Trade.</hi>

and I find Mr. <hi>Le Clerk</hi> of the <hi>same
Opinion,</hi> that the <hi>Moderns</hi> have wholly <hi>form'd</hi>
themselves on the <hi>Models</hi> of the Ancients, and that
we have scarce any thing but the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin
Poetry</hi> in the World. We have no <hi>Originals,</hi> but
all <hi>Copiers</hi> and <hi>Transcribers</hi> of <hi>Homer, Pindar,</hi>
and <hi>Theocritus, Virgil, Horace,</hi> and <hi>Ovid.</hi>
Their <hi>Design,</hi> their <hi>Phrase,</hi> their <hi>Manner,</hi> and
even their <hi>Heathen Theology,</hi> appear in all the
<hi>Poems</hi> that have since their <hi>Time</hi> been published to
the World, especially in the <hi>Learned Languages.</hi>
'Tis therefore to be wish'd that some <hi>good Genius,
qualify'd</hi> for such an <hi>Undertaking,</hi> would break
the <hi>Ice,</hi> assert the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and set up for
an <hi>Original</hi> in <hi>Writing</hi> in a way accommodated to
the <hi>Religion, Manners,</hi> and other <hi>Circumstances</hi>
we are now under. But however we write, I think
'tis <hi>high time</hi> to leave out our <hi>Allusions</hi> to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Divinity;</hi> for how <hi>beautiful</hi> soever they might
be in in the <hi>Pagan Authors,</hi> who wrote to a People
that believ'd in those <hi>Deities,</hi> 'tis the most <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
and <hi>senseless</hi> thing in the World for a <hi>Christian
Poet</hi> to bring in upon all <hi>Occasions</hi> the <hi>Rabble</hi> and
<hi>Riffraffe</hi> of <hi>Heathenish Gods;</hi> and yet if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on our <hi>Modern</hi> Poems one would think we were
all <hi>Pagans</hi> to this day. What have we to do with
<hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno, Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and the rest?
<pb facs="tcp:48294:6"/>
We know they are a Iest, and yet they are brought
into all our most <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>chastest</hi> Poems. Solemn
Prayers are made to them by <hi>Christian Writers,</hi>
than which there cannot be a more intollerable <hi>Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</hi>
I know 'tis said, as I have elsewhere ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erv'd,
that the <hi>Christian Scheme</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is not so
well accommodated to P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etical <hi>Writings,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our <hi>Poets</hi> are oblig'd to embelish their <hi>Works</hi>
with the <hi>Pagan Theology:</hi> A <hi>wretched Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy!</hi>
Are our <hi>Poets</hi> then so dry and barren, have
they so little <hi>Learning,</hi> and so poor a stock of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
that they are not able to furnish themselves with
proper <hi>Allusions,</hi> surprizing <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Similes,</hi> without reviving the old exploded <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
of the <hi>Heathens?</hi> As in this <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi>
they will find a Poem that is indeed an <hi>Original,</hi> and
not beholding to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Springs;</hi> so
they will find, if it be not depress'd by the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase,
a <hi>sublime Stile, elevated Thoughts,
magnificent Expressions</hi> where the <hi>Subject</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
them, and great <hi>richness</hi> and <hi>abundance</hi>
throughout the whole, without the <hi>Aids</hi> of the <hi>Pagan
System</hi> of <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been generally allow'd that almost all the
<hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> is writ in <hi>Metre;</hi> though a very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Person, famous for his Skill in these <hi>Matters,</hi>
has assured me that this is a <hi>mistake:</hi> However that
be, 'tis universally agreed that the <hi>Subject</hi> of it is
treated in a Poetical manner; that is, the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the <hi>Allusions,</hi> the <hi>Similes,</hi> and the <hi>Diction,</hi>
are such as are proper only to Poems. But 'tis a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
among learned Men what kind of Poem it is:
Some are of <hi>Opinion</hi> that there never was any such
<pb facs="tcp:48294:6"/>
Man in Being as <hi>Job,</hi> but that the Person is <hi>feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and all the <hi>Sacred Story</hi> concerning him is made
up of <hi>Allegories</hi> and <hi>Fables,</hi> composed for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Mankind,</hi> like the Parabolical Relations
in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> and of this Opinion were
many of the <hi>Ancient Jews.</hi> Others believe that this
<hi>Book</hi> contains a relation of nothing but <hi>real Facts,</hi>
without <hi>feigned Incidents</hi> or <hi>Episodes;</hi> and that
therefore it is an <hi>Historical Poem,</hi> like that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
which contains the <hi>Narration</hi> of a <hi>Series</hi> of
<hi>real Actions</hi> in a <hi>poetical</hi> way without interposing
any <hi>feign'd Stories.</hi> Most of the <hi>Commentators</hi>
and <hi>Criticks</hi> that have writ on this <hi>Book,</hi> if not all,
are of one of these <hi>two Opinions.</hi> But I have in
Conversation met with learned Men that are of a <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Opinion;</hi> that is, that this is a <hi>Poem</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on a <hi>true History,</hi> as those of <hi>Homer</hi> probably
were: But then they say the <hi>Conduct,</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
the <hi>Machines,</hi> the <hi>Incidents,</hi> and the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodes,</hi>
which make up a great part of the <hi>Poem,</hi>
were form'd in the Poet's <hi>Imagination,</hi> and that
therefore this <hi>Poem</hi> is of the <hi>Epick</hi> kind. As to
the <hi>first Opinion,</hi> I think the <hi>Scriptures</hi> fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it, by asserting the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Job</hi>
so plainly, that it leaves no room for any tolerable
Evasion. As to the <hi>two last,</hi> many things of Weight
and Importance may be urg'd on either side; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall not undertake to decide the Controversie, but
content my self in giving the <hi>Reasons</hi> that I have read
or heard offer'd to support each <hi>Assertion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those of the <hi>last Opinion</hi> in the <hi>defence</hi> of it
alledge, that the <hi>Frame</hi> of the <hi>whole Book</hi> shews it
to be the Work of <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Contrivance,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:7"/>
and not a relation of a Series of <hi>real Actions.</hi> No
Body can believe, say they, that <hi>Satan</hi> did really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before <hi>God,</hi> and that the <hi>Discourse</hi> recited in
the <hi>Book</hi> was indeed held between them in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Holy Angels:</hi> 'Tis not credible that the
<hi>Messengers</hi> that brought an account to <hi>Job</hi> of so
many <hi>Sufferings</hi> that befel him, did really come upon
the heels of one another so fast, and in such a manner
as is there <hi>related.</hi> They think 'tis improbable that
<hi>Job</hi> should sit so long upon a <hi>Dunghil,</hi> and that his
<hi>Acquaintance</hi> should wait seven days and nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
without speaking a word to their <hi>sorrowful
Friend.</hi> They look on this to be a Poetical way of
representing the <hi>vast Distress</hi> that overwhelmed the
<hi>patient Sufferer.</hi> They say, 'tis incredible that all
those <hi>prolix Discourses</hi> should be actually held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Job</hi> and his <hi>Friends:</hi> and that a Man in such
<hi>sad Circumstances,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> is supposed to be, should
speak so very long, and use so many Poetical <hi>Similes,
Metaphors,</hi> and beautiful <hi>Descriptions</hi> as are
found in his several <hi>Speeches.</hi> They urge also that
it has an Air of <hi>Contrivance</hi> to sink a Man so
suddenly from the most <hi>prosperous</hi> Condition, and to
lay him under such <hi>grievous Sufferings,</hi> and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>extremity</hi> of <hi>Misery,</hi> and then by a no less <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
and <hi>surprizing Revolution,</hi> in so short a space
of time, to make him again the <hi>most happy</hi> Man
in the World. They urge that in the Catastrophe,
when this <hi>patient Man</hi> is rewarded for his <hi>inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perseverance,</hi> the allotting him just the same
number of <hi>Children</hi> as he had lost, and just a double
quantity of <hi>Riches</hi> as he enjoyed before, seems too
<hi>nice</hi> to be a <hi>real Fact.</hi> The Men of this <hi>Opinion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:7"/>
do not dispute the <hi>reality</hi> of the Person of <hi>Job:</hi>
They allow there was a Person of that <hi>Name,</hi> emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and famous for his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;</hi>
for this the <hi>Scriptures</hi> expresly affirm; and
they suppose some <hi>great Poet,</hi> under the Guidance and
Assistance of <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> did for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Mankind</hi> chuse this <hi>Subject,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the <hi>Poem</hi> upon it of which we are now discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
They affirm that this Poem of <hi>Job</hi> is of the
<hi>Epick</hi> kind, here being found all the <hi>essential</hi> parts
requir'd in the <hi>Constitution</hi> of such a Poem. They
add farther as a <hi>confirmation</hi> of their <hi>Opinion,</hi>
that though <hi>Machines,</hi> that is, the introducing of
<hi>Invisible Superiour Beings,</hi> and the interesting of
them in the Business of the Poem, are not necessary to
an <hi>Epick</hi> Poem; yet as it does greatly heighten and
embelish the <hi>Narration,</hi> they can't but take notice
that this <hi>Conduct</hi> is observed here; for the <hi>chief
Apostate Angel,</hi> and even the <hi>Divine Being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
are both introduced in the most proper manner
that can be; and as this perhaps is the <hi>Original</hi> of
that sort of <hi>Writing,</hi> so it does thereby discover a
great <hi>Air</hi> of the Allegorial <hi>Epick</hi> Poetry.</p>
            <p>Those on the other side argue thus: As according
to a <hi>settled Maxim</hi> of <hi>Interpreting</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
we should not without apparent Necessity quit the <hi>plain</hi>
and <hi>literal Sense,</hi> and embrace a <hi>foreign, more
strain'd</hi> and <hi>less obvious Meaning:</hi> so without the
same necessity we should not turn the Relation of any
<hi>Fact</hi> into <hi>Invention</hi> and <hi>Allegory.</hi> And to make
it appear that there is no such <hi>reason</hi> in this Case, they
alledge that there is nothing related in this <hi>Book,</hi> but
what may well be suppos'd to have actually happened;
<pb facs="tcp:48294:8"/>
that though many things appear <hi>improbable</hi> and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>credible</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> this is no <hi>convincing
proof</hi> that they were not <hi>real Facts.</hi> For all Men
that are are verst in <hi>History</hi> will meet with many
wonderful and improbable <hi>Occurrences,</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
upon <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi> they are forc'd
to believe; and they say that for that reason, because
the <hi>Facts</hi> were so <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>surprizing,</hi>
they were recorded in this <hi>Book</hi> for our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi>
and <hi>Instruction.</hi> They had rather give
their <hi>Assent</hi> to some things that sound only harsh and
improbable, for many such <hi>Relations</hi> are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, than by departing from the <hi>literal Sense</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and embolden <hi>uncautious</hi> and <hi>wanton Wits</hi>
to break in upon the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and turn the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of the <hi>Bible</hi> into <hi>Parables</hi> and <hi>Allegories;</hi> for
the Consequence of such a <hi>licentious</hi> way of <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting</hi>
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> they look on as very mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.
They think that the unnecessary <hi>Concessions</hi>
of some <hi>Divines</hi> in these <hi>Points</hi> tend mightily to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle
Men in the <hi>Principles</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and
weaken their <hi>Reverence</hi> of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They do indeed al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow the appearance of <hi>Satan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Discourse</hi> on that
<hi>Occasion</hi> to be an <hi>Allegory,</hi> for there are <hi>cogent</hi>
Reasons for it; but for the rest of the <hi>relations</hi> in
the Book they see no <hi>necessity</hi> of making them <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical</hi>
also. There is the like <hi>Allegory</hi> us'd in the
<hi>History</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> where 'tis said a <hi>Spirit</hi> appear'd
before the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and offer'd to be a <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spirit</hi> in the Mouths of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s <hi>Prophets</hi> to
perswade their <hi>Master</hi> to go down to <hi>War</hi> to <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math
Gilead,</hi> and he had leave given him to do so:
<pb facs="tcp:48294:8"/>
But though this be an <hi>Allegory,</hi> yet without doubt
all the rest of the <hi>Story</hi> about this <hi>Expedition</hi> of
<hi>Ahab</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> was <hi>real.</hi> And to
be more particular, that <hi>Almighty God</hi> should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the <hi>great Enemy</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> to afflict and
persecute a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>good Man</hi> for the <hi>proof</hi> of
his <hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>Uprightness;</hi> and to make his
<hi>Vertues</hi> more <hi>conspicuous</hi> and <hi>exemplary,</hi> that
he should leave him for a time under this sharp and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<hi>Trial,</hi> and at last <hi>deliver</hi> the <hi>patient Sufferer,</hi>
and <hi>restore</hi> him to his former <hi>flourishing</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This has nothing in it but what is very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Course of <hi>Divine Providence;</hi> and if there
be any <hi>Facts</hi> in the <hi>Book,</hi> that seem improbable, 'tis
owing to the <hi>Poetical</hi> manner of representing them,
in which perhaps the <hi>Time, Order, Place,</hi> and other
<hi>Circumstances,</hi> are not so nicely observed.</p>
            <p>But whether this be an <hi>Epick,</hi> or barely an <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Poem,</hi> which I leave undecided, the <hi>Character</hi>
of <hi>Job</hi> may in my <hi>Opinion</hi> be every way proper for
the first. The <hi>Hero</hi> is indeed a <hi>passive</hi> one, and this
perhaps will be made a great <hi>Objection</hi> against this
Assertion; because <hi>Homer's</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Heroes</hi> are
very active <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ersons. For the <hi>Criticks</hi> forming their
<hi>Model</hi> of an <hi>Heroick Poem</hi> intirely upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of these <hi>two famous Writers,</hi> make <hi>great</hi>
and <hi>illustrious</hi> Actions necessary to the <hi>Hero</hi> of the
<hi>Poem,</hi> which <hi>con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orming</hi> my self to their Precepts,
I have formerly <hi>asserted.</hi> But upon what Authority
is this imposed on the <hi>World?</hi> What <hi>Commission</hi>
had these two <hi>Poets</hi> to <hi>settle</hi> the <hi>limits</hi> and <hi>extent</hi>
of <hi>Epick Poetry,</hi> or who can prove they ever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to do so? They wrote according to their own <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:9"/>
and <hi>Measures;</hi> and must all <hi>future</hi> Ages be
bound up to follow their Examples, without producing
any other <hi>Reason?</hi> Yet this <hi>Opinion,</hi> how groundless
and absurd soever it appears, some imagine, has been
the <hi>great obstruction</hi> to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
among the <hi>Moderns.</hi> But it may be urged that
the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> was written before <hi>Homer</hi> and
<hi>Virgil,</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> has as much reason to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by this Example, as by that of the <hi>Pagan
Writers.</hi> And if we look into the Reason of the
<hi>Matter,</hi> and reflect on the End and Design
of an Epick <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oem,</hi> which is to instruct the World in
some important <hi>Moral Truth,</hi> by the <hi>Narration</hi> of
some great and illustrious <hi>Subject-Matter,</hi> there is
no question but the <hi>relation</hi> of the Sufferings, as well
as the Actions of <hi>great Persons,</hi> are very conducive
to that end; and indeed what else is the <hi>Subject</hi> of
the <hi>Odysses?</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Iliad</hi> is all <hi>active,</hi> and
a very <hi>fighting Poem;</hi> but if the <hi>Odysses</hi> be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
'tis of another nature, there is more a great
deal of the <hi>Heroes Sufferings</hi> not evaded by Arms,
but by little <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Subtilties,</hi> than there is of
Action; and yet Mr. <hi>Rapin</hi> accounts this the more
<hi>perfect Poem.</hi> In short, 'tis hard to offer any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the <hi>Hero</hi> of the <hi>Poem</hi> may not be as well
<hi>active</hi> as <hi>passive.</hi> If it be said, the Authority of
<hi>Homer</hi> is against it (for as for <hi>Virgil</hi> he is but a
<hi>Copier</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Model) the answer is, that the
<hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Book of Job</hi> is <hi>for it;</hi> and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
that <hi>Homer</hi> is of this <hi>Opinion</hi> in his <hi>second,</hi>
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> against it in his <hi>first</hi> Poem. If it be said that
<hi>Reason</hi> is against it, let that <hi>Reason</hi> be produc'd;
let it be shown that the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of a <hi>great Man</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:9"/>
manag'd with <hi>equal Skill,</hi> will not equally serve the
Ends of <hi>Epick Poetry.</hi> As for what the <hi>Criticks</hi>
say on this Point, 'tis plain that <hi>Homer</hi> has been the
<hi>great Lawgiver</hi> to those Men; they have done <hi>little</hi>
but turn'd his <hi>Examples</hi> into <hi>Precepts;</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no <hi>Reasons</hi> to support what they <hi>assert,</hi> they are
of no <hi>weight</hi> in this <hi>Matter. Job</hi> then is a <hi>Hero</hi>
proper for an <hi>Epick Poem,</hi> an Illustrious Person fit
to support the <hi>Dignity</hi> of that <hi>Character:</hi> He is
by the <hi>Instigation</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> brought into miserable
<hi>Streights</hi> and unparalell'd <hi>Sufferings,</hi> to try his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi>
and <hi>Integrity.</hi> He appears brave in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,</hi>
and valiant in <hi>Affliction,</hi> maintains his <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
and with that his <hi>Character,</hi> under the most
powerful <hi>Temptations,</hi> and exasperating <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
that the Malice of <hi>Hell</hi> could invent, and
thereby gives a most noble Example of <hi>passive Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
a <hi>Character</hi> no way <hi>inferiour</hi> to that of the
<hi>active Hero.</hi> When the various Efforts to break this
<hi>mighty Man's</hi> Invincible <hi>Constancy</hi> prov'd ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
he is at the latter end of the <hi>Poem acquitted</hi> by
<hi>God Himself,</hi> and rewarded highly for his <hi>Patience</hi>
and <hi>Perseverance;</hi> whereby the <hi>Justice</hi> of Divine
Providence is asserted, and Mankind encouraged to be
stedfast in their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> upon a sure
<hi>Belief</hi> that <hi>Vertue</hi> will not always be neglected, but
will at last receive a suitable Reward.</p>
            <p>Whatever others assert, in my <hi>Judgment</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
of the <hi>Poem</hi> ought not to be drawn without some
defects; for as the representing of a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of
<hi>Vertue,</hi> which is never to be <hi>found</hi> in any <hi>meer
Man,</hi> offends against the Establish'd Rule in <hi>Epick
Writings,</hi> which excludes all things improbable, so
<pb facs="tcp:48294:10"/>
instead of promoting, it rather obstructs the End of
that <hi>Poetry:</hi> For a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
may amaze and dazle us; but when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
for our <hi>Imitation,</hi> it will rather discourage,
than excite us: But when the Examples of <hi>Vertue</hi>
that are set before us, are discern'd to have a mixture
of <hi>Imperfection,</hi> we are provok'd and embolden'd to
<hi>form</hi> our selves according to such a Pattern, where
there appears no <hi>Impossibility,</hi> as there does in the
other, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f becoming like it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Poem</hi> seems to me to abound in all kinds of
<hi>Beauties,</hi> which are admir'd in Poetical <hi>Writings.</hi> What
noble strains of Eloquence occurr in every place where
they ought to appear, especially in the <hi>latter part</hi> of
this <hi>Book?</hi> How <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>moving</hi> are the
<hi>Thoughts</hi> in the <hi>Passionate,</hi> how <hi>proper, just</hi> and
<hi>instructive</hi> in the <hi>Moral,</hi> how <hi>sublime, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>majestick</hi> in the other Parts? What Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is there of elegant Expression, beautiful <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi>
bold and surprizing <hi>Metaphors,</hi> natural,
strong, and lively <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Descriptions</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole? In many of these it exceeds, and in
all of them it equals the most <hi>Celebrated Writings</hi>
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> And if it should <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi>
happen, that <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> should be well
<hi>Translated</hi> into the English <hi>Language,</hi> I am very
confident that this <hi>Book,</hi> were it Translated or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrased
with <hi>equal Skill,</hi> would outshine them in all
<hi>sorts of Perfection.</hi> But as to the <hi>chief</hi> End and
Design of an Epick Poem, the giving a noble and
true <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> the <hi>Justification</hi> of
his <hi>Providence,</hi> the <hi>Instruction</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> in
<hi>Moral Duties,</hi> and animating the <hi>Reader</hi> from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="tcp:48294:10"/>
Motives to <hi>imitate</hi> the Illustrious Examples of
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> set before them, in this respect,
which is infinitely the most considerable, this of <hi>Job</hi>
put all the <hi>Poems</hi> of the <hi>Heathen World</hi> out of
Countenance. How will <hi>Homer</hi>'s wretched Tribe of
<hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddesses,</hi> introduc'd with all the Follies
and Vices too of <hi>corrupt Mankind</hi> appear to the
<hi>World</hi> as now instructed and inlighten'd with the
<hi>Christian Revelation?</hi> And tho' <hi>Virgil</hi> is in that,
as in other things, more judicious and cautious than
the <hi>Greek Poet,</hi> yet his <hi>Theology</hi> must be very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to a <hi>Christian Reader;</hi> and if the <hi>Machines</hi>
of these <hi>Poets</hi> in which so much of the Beauty of their
<hi>Poems</hi> consists are so contemptible and ridiculous, a
great part of their Excellency is gone.</p>
            <p>There are indeed some few <hi>Moral Sentences</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terspers'd
in these <hi>Poets;</hi> but as they seem inserted
only as Embellishments of the <hi>Writing,</hi> so the <hi>Body</hi>
of the <hi>Poem</hi> carries little Instruction in it. For my
part, when I consider these <hi>Poems,</hi> I am of Mr. <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Clerk</hi>'s Opinion, that the <hi>Authors</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else in their view than to entertain and
please the <hi>Reader,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ubi supra.</note> and that all the Materials and
Contrivance were accommodated to that End. 'Tis
true, <hi>Criticks</hi> in after-Ages, a sort of Men who are
very apt to discover in <hi>Writings</hi> many notable things
that never enter'd into the <hi>Author's Thoughts,</hi>
have found out wise and instructive <hi>Morals</hi> in the
<hi>Poems</hi> before-mention'd; yet this seems an <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of their own. For as the <hi>Learned Man</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned
observes, 'tis scarce possible to relate
any wonderful <hi>Action</hi> of a Great Person, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<hi>Occurrence,</hi> but 'twill be very easie to draw
<pb facs="tcp:48294:11"/>
some <hi>Moral Inference</hi> from it, tho' the <hi>Writer</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had it in his <hi>Imagination.</hi> And the very same
Person has with as great <hi>grounds</hi> of Probability
drawn from the <hi>Iliad</hi> and the <hi>Aencis, Morals</hi> very
different from those that are commonly mention'd, and
has offer'd sufficient <hi>Reasons</hi> to make us <hi>doubtful</hi>
whether the <hi>Morals</hi> attributed to these <hi>Poems</hi> were
ever intended by the <hi>Authors.</hi> And if this be true
of these two <hi>famous Writers,</hi> that only the pleasing
and amusing, not the instructing of <hi>Mankind</hi> was
their <hi>Design,</hi> 'tis more apparently true of the greatest
part of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> especially the <hi>Dramatick</hi>
Poets.</p>
            <p>Since this <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> and other Poetical parts of
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> some of which I have likewise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to <hi>paraphrase,</hi> does at least equal the <hi>chief
Beauties</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and by their Vsefulness
in their excellent <hi>Instructions</hi> infinitely excel them,
'tis a Matter of <hi>Admiration</hi> that the <hi>Christian</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
should be so far enamour'd with the Pagan <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
as to form themselves entirely by their Patterns,
to be taken up with the <hi>Study</hi> of them to the <hi>total
neglect</hi> of these <hi>inspir'd Writings.</hi> What pains and
labour have our Men been at, how great a part of
their short <hi>Lives</hi> have they <hi>spent,</hi> what a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of <hi>Volumes</hi> have they publish'd to illustrate the
Meaning and discover the Excellencies of <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi> Poets, and to <hi>translate</hi> them into their own
<hi>Languages?</hi> If this were the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
that had nothing else to employ themselves about, and
had no other <hi>Capacity</hi> of being useful to <hi>Mankind,</hi>
it might perhaps pass for an inoffensive <hi>Amusement,</hi>
and a pardonable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort of <hi>Idleness.</hi> But 'tis indeed
<pb facs="tcp:48294:11"/>
wonderful that to give a new <hi>Sense</hi> to an Expression in
an ancient Poet, to slop a Period more exactly, to
rectifie a <hi>Word,</hi> to give a <hi>truer Spelling</hi> to a
Man's Name, or to restore a <hi>corrupt Sentence,</hi>
should be look'd on as such a <hi>Perfection,</hi> as sets a
Man in the first <hi>Rank</hi> of <hi>Learned Men;</hi> and that
a kind of <hi>Knowledge</hi> which does not make <hi>Mankind</hi>
any ways <hi>wiser</hi> or <hi>better,</hi> should procure a <hi>mighty
Reputation,</hi> and dignifie the <hi>Owners</hi> of it with the
<hi>honourable Titles</hi> of <hi>great Criticks,</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi>
of <hi>polite Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not <hi>derogate</hi> from the <hi>true value</hi> of
<hi>Classical Knowledge.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi>
should be study'd, that we may understand those
<hi>Languages</hi> of which there is such a <hi>manifest Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity:</hi>
But 'tis most <hi>evident,</hi> that for the <hi>Sense,</hi> for
the noble and sublime <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and what is more
than all other <hi>Considerations,</hi> for the <hi>forming</hi> a
Man's <hi>Mind</hi> according to the <hi>justest Ideas</hi> of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
and <hi>true Wisdom,</hi> and thereby promoting his
Honour and his Happiness, the <hi>Poetical</hi> parts of the
<hi>Scripture</hi> have, as before suggested, an <hi>infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
above all others put together, and therefore
one would think should not be less worthy of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s
<hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Application,</hi> than <hi>Homer</hi> and his
Followers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Language</hi> in which this <hi>Book</hi> was written is
<hi>Hebrew;</hi> and considering the very great <hi>difference</hi>
there is between the <hi>Stil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> or manner of <hi>Expression</hi> in
the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> part of the World, their <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,</hi>
as well as their <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of another kind than ours, 'tis very strange that a
<hi>literal Translation</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> as 'tis now found in
<pb facs="tcp:48294:12"/>
the <hi>Bible,</hi> especially considering how long time since it
was <hi>written,</hi> how <hi>little</hi> the <hi>Language</hi> is understood,
and how much the <hi>Idiom</hi> of it is lost, should not sound
much more harsh, and be less capable of being <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood</hi>
than it is. I am confident that if several of
the <hi>Greek Poets</hi> should be <hi>verbally translated,</hi> they
would be more <hi>obscure,</hi> if not altogether <hi>unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
And if in a <hi>literal Translation</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Job written</hi> in an <hi>Eastern Language</hi> does so much
affect us, and raises in our <hi>Minds</hi> such an <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of its <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> what a <hi>wonderful</hi>
and <hi>inimitable</hi> kind of <hi>Eloquence</hi> must be suppos'd
in the <hi>Original,</hi> when we can't <hi>translate verbatim</hi>
a <hi>good Poem</hi> from one <hi>Modern Language</hi> into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
tho' it be done by the nearest <hi>Neighbours,</hi>
without a mighty <hi>diminution</hi> of its <hi>Excellence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Time</hi> when <hi>Job</hi> liv'd, it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he was <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Predecessor,</hi> or at least his
Contemporary; and that for these <hi>Reasons.</hi> This
<hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>devout Man</hi> was allow'd to offer <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi>
to God, which only the <hi>Priests</hi> under the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical
Dispensation</hi> had <hi>Authority</hi> to do, and that
only <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> or <hi>Temple.</hi> This <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Person</hi> seems intirely <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>Modes</hi>
of the <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> and of their manner of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Counsel of <hi>God</hi> either by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi>
or by the <hi>Prophets;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> 'tis evident the
<hi>Mosaical Scheme</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> was not yet <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
In the whole <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> there is no mention
made of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor of the many
<hi>Miracles</hi> wrought either in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or in the <hi>Passage</hi>
of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> though nothing
could have been more <hi>pertinent</hi> and <hi>sutable</hi> to the
<pb facs="tcp:48294:12"/>
               <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi> had <hi>Job</hi> liv'd
after that <hi>wonderful Deliverance;</hi> and there is
scarce any <hi>Writer</hi> that follow'd that <hi>Time,</hi> that does
not mention or allude to that <hi>famous History.</hi> And
this is yet farther confirm'd by the long <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi>
which was protracted to <hi>two hundred</hi> Years, which
agrees to the <hi>Times</hi> of the <hi>Old Patriarchs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Utz,</hi> the <hi>Country</hi> in which this
<hi>great Man</hi> liv'd, there are different <hi>Opinions,</hi> occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
chiefly by the <hi>uncertainty</hi> which <hi>Utz</hi> it was (for
<hi>three</hi> are mention'd) from whom it receiv'd its <hi>Name.</hi>
The first <hi>Utz</hi> the Son of <hi>Aram</hi> is mention'd, <hi>Gen. 10.
23.</hi> who is reported to be the <hi>Founder</hi> of <hi>Damascus</hi>
and <hi>Trachonitis;</hi> and many <hi>Writers,</hi> for this reason,
conclude the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> to have been in the <hi>Plain</hi> of
<hi>Jordan</hi> in the <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Trachonitis,</hi> where the
<hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> is shown to <hi>Strangers</hi> at this day: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
place it in the Famous <hi>Valley</hi> of <hi>Damascus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second <hi>Utz,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nachor</hi> is mention'd,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 21. from him the <hi>Country</hi> where he liv'd is
call'd <hi>Usitis</hi> or <hi>Ausitis,</hi> which by <hi>Ptolemy</hi> is plac'd
near <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the City <hi>Babylon;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many <hi>Authors</hi> believe <hi>Job</hi> had his <hi>Habitation</hi>
in that part of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third <hi>Utz,</hi> who, as <hi>Spanh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

accounted of the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Esau,</hi> is mention'd, <hi>Gen. 36.
28.</hi> the <hi>Horites</hi> being driven out by the <hi>Edomites,</hi>
their <hi>Country</hi> was after that call'd <hi>Idumea,</hi> which
has for its <hi>bounds Arabia, Canaan,</hi> and the <hi>Red
Sea,</hi> and in this <hi>Country</hi> many believe was the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation</hi>
of <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if a Man could remove the Obstructions of
<hi>great Learning</hi> and <hi>Critical Remarks,</hi> methinks it
<pb facs="tcp:48294:13"/>
should be a very easie matter to <hi>settle</hi> this <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Point.</hi> `Tis allow'd by all, that <hi>Utz</hi> the Country of
<hi>Job</hi> was expos'd to the <hi>Incursions</hi> and <hi>Depredations</hi>
of the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> and 'tis allowed likewise that <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
was Eastward of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Now suppose that in
our <hi>English History</hi> there had been mention'd a <hi>great
Man,</hi> that had in ancient Times been plunder'd by a
<hi>Band</hi> of <hi>Scotch-men;</hi> and the Habitation or Country
of this <hi>unfortunate Man</hi> being mention'd by an obscure
or obsolete <hi>Word,</hi> a Controversie should arise in what
part of <hi>England</hi> this Man lived; would not any Man
that was derivered from the encumbrance of <hi>great Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>learned Observations,</hi> presently conclude, that
he lived in the <hi>North</hi> part of <hi>England</hi> not <hi>far</hi> from
the <hi>Borders</hi> of <hi>Scotland?</hi> And must it not have been a
Critick of extraordinary <hi>Sagacity</hi> that should have
<hi>found</hi> out his <hi>Seat</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> or at the <hi>Land</hi>'s
End? And yet those that place the Country of <hi>Job</hi> in
<hi>Idumea,</hi> or near <hi>Damascus,</hi> remove it <hi>farther</hi> from
<hi>Chaldea</hi> than those two Places <hi>before-named</hi> are
from <hi>Scotland.</hi> 'Tis not <hi>therefore</hi> to be doubted but
that the Country of <hi>Job</hi> was in the Eastern part of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>
and 'tis probable 'twas near the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi>

this Book was wrote in the <hi>Time</hi> when the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were under the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Bondage, and that it was
compos'd to encourage them to a <hi>patient suffering</hi> of
their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and to confirm them in their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Deliverance.</hi> And those of this
Opinion believe, that either <hi>Moses</hi> himself was the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
or at least the <hi>Translator</hi> of it; and that this was
a <hi>Tradition</hi> among the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> several <hi>Authors</hi>
testifie. Others are of Opinion, that the Writing was of
much later date, and give these Reasons for it. They
alledge that there are many <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi>
Words, and Forms of Expression that were not in use
among the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers, the <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of which must be fetch'd from the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> that
there are many Elegancies relating to the <hi>Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and several <hi>Fish</hi> and <hi>Birds</hi> which shew it to be of
a Modern <hi>Date,</hi> and from hence they conclude that it
was then <hi>wrote</hi> when these <hi>Foreign</hi> words and manners
of Expression were introduc'd into the <hi>Hebrew Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
They believe <hi>therefore</hi> that the <hi>Author</hi>
liv'd after <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and before <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
because he is <hi>mention'd</hi> by that <hi>Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some believe that <hi>Isaiah</hi> himself was the <hi>Author,</hi>
the time when he lived being very sutable to this Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
besides the Majesty and Sublimity of his <hi>Stile,</hi> his
singular Erudition, the <hi>similitude</hi> of Character, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Words, and Forms of speaking common to them both.
<hi>Grotius</hi> imagines the <hi>Author</hi> to be an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
after the Custom of that <hi>Nation,</hi> he calls <hi>Arabia</hi>
the <hi>East,</hi> tho' others suppose he was an <hi>Idumean,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he abounds with <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Words:
Whether he was the one or the other, 'tis plain the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:14"/>
was well vers'd in the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> and
those of the Neighbouring Countries: And that in the
Writing of this Book he was under the direction and
guidance of <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> has been universally
acknowledged by the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> in all Ages.</p>
            <p>But one single Reflexion prevails with me to believe
that the <hi>Author</hi> was of the oldest <hi>date;</hi> and that is,
that I cannot imagine that if he had lived <hi>after</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> from their <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Bondage, and <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical
Scheme</hi> of Religion, he could have been so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
silent as to both. 'Tis hardly to be imagin'd that
if he had liv'd <hi>after Moses</hi> he should ever have design'd
to be so accurate and nice in <hi>relation</hi> to <hi>Time,</hi> as not
to say any thing in the whole Book but what might be
well suppos'd to have been said by one who liv'd <hi>before
Moses.</hi> This exact Care seems not agreeable to the
<hi>Writers</hi> of that Age. And if it should be suppos'd, that
an <hi>Author,</hi> that many years after took this <hi>Subject</hi> of
<hi>Job</hi> to write upon, should resolve to say <hi>nothing</hi> but
what might be fit to be said in that time when <hi>Job</hi>
liv'd; yet 'tis a great <hi>difficulty</hi> to believe that he
should be so successful, as not in any one Place, or in
any one Expression, to drop any thing that should men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or allude to some <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> that happen'd
after; especially such <hi>famous</hi> ones, as the <hi>Miracles</hi>
wrought when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were brought out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
their <hi>Settlement</hi> in the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
the <hi>Rites</hi> of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Religion. The same <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
therefore</hi> that convince me that <hi>Job</hi> himself
liv'd before, or in the <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> perswade me
to think the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>this Poem,</hi> whoever he was,
did so too; and <hi>therefore</hi> 'tis very probable that this
of <hi>Job</hi> is the oldest <hi>Book</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:14"/>The <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Poem</hi> is this: <hi>Job,</hi> a Prince
in his Country, of distinguish'd <hi>Piety</hi> and eminent <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
at the Entrance of the <hi>Narration,</hi> is represented
as happy as the favour of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the affluence of
all <hi>Earthly Possessions</hi> can make him. From this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
State</hi> of <hi>Prosperity</hi> he is all on a sudden, by the
permission of <hi>Providence,</hi> for the <hi>trial</hi> of his <hi>Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
depriv'd of his <hi>Estate,</hi> his <hi>Children,</hi> his <hi>Friends</hi>
and <hi>Health,</hi> and reduc'd to a Condition as perfectly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
as his former had been happy. After this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
change of his <hi>Fortune,</hi> to exasperate the <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness</hi>
and <hi>anguish</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> his <hi>Wife,</hi> in a most
<hi>profane</hi> manner, provokes and tempts him to <hi>quit</hi> all
his <hi>Pretensions</hi> to <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>desperately</hi> to renounce
all his <hi>dependence</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> and all <hi>expectations</hi>
of <hi>Deliverance</hi> from him. In this, she is <hi>imitated</hi>
by the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>old Grecians,</hi> as well as other
<hi>Idolatrous Countries,</hi> who us'd under any <hi>great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities</hi>
to rail <hi>bitterly</hi> at their Gods, to pull down
their <hi>Images,</hi> and drag them about the <hi>Streets,</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
on them for not <hi>preventing</hi> their <hi>misfortunes.</hi>
After this <hi>three Persons,</hi> eminent for their <hi>Birth,
Vertue</hi> and <hi>Wisdom, Eliphaz, Bildad</hi> and <hi>Zophar</hi>
(perhaps <hi>Elihu</hi> was with <hi>Job</hi> before) went to <hi>comfort</hi>
their distress'd Friend. Their Design was <hi>good,</hi> and
<hi>they</hi> considering that Wickedness was the <hi>meritorious</hi>
Cause of <hi>Suffering,</hi> and that <hi>Divine Justice</hi> was not
to be clear'd, if <hi>proffligate</hi> and <hi>impious</hi> Men should
go unpunish'd; and having themselves <hi>often</hi> seen as well
as heard by <hi>Tradition</hi> from their <hi>Forefathers,</hi> that
wicked <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Families</hi> had <hi>frequently,</hi> by the
<hi>just Judgment of God,</hi> been utterly destroy'd, concluded
that, <hi>Job</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>outward Figure</hi> he made
of a very upright and religious <hi>Person,</hi> must needs be
<pb facs="tcp:48294:15"/>
               <hi>guilty</hi> of some <hi>great,</hi> tho' <hi>secret</hi> Crimes: Otherwise
<hi>they</hi> could not conceive how it was <hi>consistent</hi> with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to suffer him to be so very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.
Their <hi>Opinion</hi> was, that a <hi>good Man,</hi> such
as <hi>Job</hi> was suppos'd to be, could never be so far <hi>forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> and abandon'd to such <hi>prodigious Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi>
This is the <hi>Point</hi> they labour to prove. They
press this very hard on their afflicted Friend, hoping
thereby to bring him to a Confession of his <hi>Sins,</hi> and a
<hi>sutable Repentance,</hi> upon which <hi>they</hi> believ'd, as
<hi>they often</hi> assur'd him, <hi>God</hi> would <hi>withdraw</hi> his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
<hi>hand,</hi> ease his <hi>Complaints,</hi> and restore him to
his <hi>former Prosperity.</hi> On the <hi>other</hi> hand, <hi>Job,</hi> who
was sure he was no <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> but that he was in good
earnest a <hi>Lover</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and
was not conscious of any such <hi>conceal'd</hi> and <hi>secret
Guilt,</hi> as his <hi>Friends</hi> reproach'd him with, <hi>asserts</hi> in
his <hi>defence,</hi> that his <hi>Friends</hi> proceeded in their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi>
on erroneous grounds: That <hi>they</hi> mistook his
<hi>Case,</hi> and the <hi>Methods</hi> of relieving him. He affirms
that neither <hi>their Notions,</hi> nor their <hi>Observations</hi>
were <hi>true.</hi> For tho' they asserted the <hi>contrary,</hi> he was
<hi>fully</hi> assur'd that God did <hi>often</hi> afflict even with the
<hi>greatest Severity</hi> many <hi>just</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Men, and
suffer'd in the mean time the <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Man</hi> to live in the most flourishing <hi>Condition;</hi> and
that therefore there could be no <hi>Argument</hi> drawnfrom
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Mans <hi>Sufferings</hi> that he was a <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Person.</hi> In some of his <hi>Debates</hi> on this
Head, he is so <hi>far transported</hi> as to <hi>censure</hi> rashly the
<hi>Divine Administration,</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> had too little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> of <hi>good Men,</hi>
whom he punish'd with so <hi>severe</hi> a hand, whilst he <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>'d
the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and prosper'd their Vndertakings;
<pb facs="tcp:48294:15"/>
or at least that he made not that distinction between them
that the Iustice of <hi>Righteous Government</hi> requires.
But as to <hi>himself</hi> his <hi>Anguish</hi> and <hi>Impatience</hi> rose
to such a <hi>degree,</hi> as vented themselves in many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
relating to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Severity</hi> to him, unbecoming
an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>patient Sufferer,</hi> which made a <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Critick</hi> say, that <hi>Job</hi> who had a <hi>good Cause,</hi>
discomposed by his <hi>Impatience</hi> manag'd it ill, as his
<hi>Friends</hi> had a <hi>bad</hi> one, but manag'd it <hi>well.</hi> Their
<hi>Debates</hi> being ended, <hi>Elihu</hi> a wise young Man that
had heard the <hi>Arguments</hi> on either side, undertakes as
<hi>Moderator</hi> to compose the Controversie, and set them
both right. He agrees with <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and his two <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> was a <hi>Hater</hi> of <hi>Wickedness</hi> and
<hi>Irreligion,</hi> and that he <hi>often</hi> punished those that were
<hi>guilty</hi> of them; but then he will not allow that <hi>Job</hi>
may from thence be justly condemn'd as a wicked Man,
because a good Man may <hi>often</hi> be afflicted by <hi>God</hi>
for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> Ends. On the other side, tho' he does
not censure <hi>Job</hi> for his <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> or any concealed
or secret <hi>Guilt,</hi> yet he condemns him for the <hi>Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
he express'd in his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and for his bold
and rash Expressions that seem'd to charge <hi>God</hi> with
<hi>Injustice.</hi> After this <hi>God himself</hi> condescends to speak
and put an end to their long <hi>Debate.</hi> He condemns
<hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and his <hi>two Friends,</hi> for their <hi>unjust</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> for his <hi>unjust</hi> Censures of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence;</hi> but on the comparison declares that
<hi>Job</hi> had the <hi>better Cause,</hi> and had spoken <hi>better</hi> of
him than his <hi>Friends</hi> had done; perhaps that Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Job</hi>'s is alluded to, <hi>The Lord has given, and the
Lord has taken away, blessed be the Name of the
Lord.</hi> Then he delivers him from his <hi>great</hi> Afflictions
and restores him to his <hi>former</hi> happy <hi>Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:16"/>'Tis <hi>evident</hi> that the <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> is to
show that the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> does not only guide
and over-rule the <hi>highest</hi> and most <hi>important Affairs,</hi>
The <hi>Enterprizes</hi> of aspiring <hi>Princes,</hi> and the <hi>Rise</hi>
and <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Empires,</hi> but that it inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and mingles it self with all the <hi>Concerns</hi> of <hi>Humane
Life,</hi> and thereby prepares the Mind of the <hi>Reader</hi> to
acknowledge him as the great <hi>Moderator</hi> of the
<hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Director</hi> of all our <hi>Actions,</hi> and <hi>Disposer</hi>
of all the <hi>Events</hi> that happen to <hi>Mankind.</hi> By which
<hi>Impression</hi> he is dispos'd to submit <hi>himself</hi> and all his
<hi>Concernments</hi> with humble <hi>Resignation</hi> to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>'s
<hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Unerring</hi> Conduct.</p>
            <p>And more particularly, the <hi>Design</hi> is to justifie the
<hi>Divine Providence</hi> in suffering <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
Men to live in the undisturbed <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of
all the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> their Hearts can desire,
while <hi>good</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Men are often overwhelmed
with <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Distress,</hi> and expos'd to the scorn
and outrage of their <hi>insulting</hi> Enemies. The solving
of this difficulty, which has so often puzled the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
and discomposed the <hi>Temper</hi> of the Wisest
and Best of Men, seems to be chiefly aim'd at in this
<hi>Writing.</hi> And 'tis observable that in the <hi>Debates</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Job</hi> and his <hi>Friends,</hi> when they are prest with
any difficulty concerning the <hi>Divine Administration</hi>
of Affairs, and are at a loss how to reconcile Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with their own <hi>Notions</hi> of Iustice and Goodness,
they fly to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Infinite Greatness,</hi> and seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Controversie into his <hi>absolute Sovereignty,</hi>
and <hi>uncontroulable Power,</hi> which occasions many

They seem to think that when we are puzled
and confounded, and after all our Attempts can by no
<pb facs="tcp:48294:16"/>
means account for the Proceedings of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
that directly thwart our Opinions of <hi>Wisdom</hi>
and <hi>Justice,</hi> we should enter upon the <hi>Contemplation</hi>
of the <hi>Glorious Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and consider they
so far transcend all the low <hi>created Perfections</hi> in
Man, that ours are by no means to be a measure of <hi>his.</hi>
They may and do assist us in many Instances, as <hi>faint
Representations</hi> of the <hi>Divine Excellency;</hi> but
whenever we see any Conduct of <hi>Divine Providence</hi>
that we can't reduce to our ways of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> we
should humbly adore and not dispute. We should fetch a
<hi>Solution</hi> from the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and boundless <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
in <hi>God,</hi> who is always Good, and Iust, and Wise, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when in his <hi>Administration</hi> he seems to be most
the contrary. And 'tis very plain that when <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks
them in the latter end of the Book, he insists on
no other <hi>Justification</hi> of his Proceedings with Men,
than his <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> his absolute <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,</hi>
and transcendent <hi>Greatness,</hi> that render him
unaccountable able to his <hi>Creatures</hi> for all his <hi>Actions.</hi> And
therefore in the sharpest and severest <hi>Trials,</hi> when
<hi>Providence</hi> seems vigilant and industrious, as <hi>Job</hi>
expresses it, to find occasions of afflicting, when it runs
<hi>counter</hi> to all our Desires, <hi>defeats</hi> our <hi>Hopes,</hi> and
<hi>disappoints</hi> all our <hi>Designs;</hi> in such a hard Case we
are to moderate our <hi>Passions,</hi> submit our <hi>Wills</hi> and our
<hi>Reason</hi> too, and acquiesce in this Belief, that nothing is
more certain than that <hi>God</hi> can do his <hi>Creature</hi> no
wrong, and that in all his <hi>Dispensations</hi> he has both
wise and gracious Designs, tho' our <hi>shallow</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent
Reason</hi> is not able to discern them.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable that one <hi>Reason</hi> why we are apt to
censure <hi>God</hi>'s Proceedings is, that we take his <hi>Idea</hi>
too nicely from our selves. For tho' we must <hi>form</hi> our
<pb facs="tcp:48294:17"/>
               <hi>Idea</hi> of him from the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of our selves,
yet this must not be too strict, nor extended too far. For
'tis plain that <hi>God</hi>'s Knowledge is another thing from
ours; he knows by one single <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Intuition,</hi> we know
by <hi>Reasoning,</hi> that is by deducing one <hi>Proposition</hi>
from two others, and by forming in a tedious way, a long
depending Chain of Consequences, which are for that
reason apt to create a distrust. Now as our inferiour
kind of Knowledge is by no means a measure of that
most perfect kind in the <hi>Divine Understanding,</hi> so
the Iustice, Mercy and Goodness, which are the <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of a <hi>Creature</hi>'s, may be of a lower kind, and
therefore an unfit measure of those <hi>Perfections</hi> in the
<hi>Divine Will.</hi> 'Tis probable that for this reason the
<hi>Disputants</hi> in this <hi>Poem,</hi> for the clearing of <hi>God</hi>'s
<hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> betake themselves so often to the
transcendent <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of the <hi>Divine
Nature,</hi> whereby they plainly intimate that we are by
no means <hi>competent Judges</hi> of his <hi>Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another means to quiet Men's Minds concerning the
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Dispensations</hi> in those
Instances that are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arshest and most unaccountable
to us, is to reflect on the narrow and broken, as well as
obscure <hi>Prospect</hi> which we have of the wide <hi>Sphere</hi> of
his <hi>Providence.</hi> Did we clearly and fully understand
how we are related to all the Parts of <hi>Mankind,</hi> both
to our <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> and to those who have liv'd in
the <hi>past,</hi> or shall live in the <hi>future Ages</hi> of the World;
had we besides a clear Knowledge of our <hi>relation</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Reasonable,</hi> but <hi>Superior Creatures,</hi> I mean
the <hi>Angels</hi> that inhabit the <hi>Immense</hi> and <hi>Glorious
Regions</hi> above us, and to those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill the <hi>Stars</hi> and
<hi>Planets;</hi> (for 'tis improbable this Ball of <hi>Earth,</hi> the
Dregs and Sediment of the <hi>World</hi> should be so full of
<pb facs="tcp:48294:17"/>
               <hi>Reasonable Beings,</hi> and the nobler Parts of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
should not be peopled with sutable <hi>Inhabitants)</hi>
Had we a perfect and comprehensive View of the whole
<hi>Scheme</hi> of the <hi>Divine Oeconomy</hi> in relation to all
these <hi>Parts</hi> of his <hi>Government,</hi> and how in his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi>
in the different Parts of it he promoted
the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious Design</hi> of the whole, we should
have quite another <hi>Apprehension</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Wisdom
and Iustice. He that contemplates a <hi>Leg</hi> or an <hi>Arm</hi>
with its relation to a <hi>Humane Body,</hi> of which they
are Parts, has a very <hi>different Notion</hi> of them from
him, who considers them divided, without any dependance
on, or connexion with the Whole. It is not in our Power
to make any but partial and very lame <hi>Observations</hi> of
<hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and upon such
imperfect <hi>Views,</hi> 'tis no wonder if our Constructions
and Conclusions are often <hi>erroneous,</hi> and this, it may
be, is another Reason why these <hi>Wise Men</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the <hi>Debate</hi> about <hi>Providence</hi> in this <hi>Book,</hi>
lead us so often to contemplate the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s
<hi>Creation,</hi> of which our selves are so small a Part.</p>
            <p>Besides this Principal and most Conspicuous Design,
other Vseful and Excellent Ends are pursu'd in this
<hi>Poem:</hi> One of which is to enlarge and raise our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> to give us worthy and
honourable <hi>Thoughts</hi> of his <hi>Infinite Perfections,</hi>
and <hi>form</hi> in our <hi>Minds</hi> a sutable <hi>Idea</hi> of his <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
The <hi>Representations</hi> of <hi>God's Transcendent
Excellencies,</hi> of <hi>his Independent, Sovereign</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible
Power,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Purity, Wisdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> are in many Parts of this <hi>Book</hi>
so noble, so lively and admirable, that they are very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of leaving in our <hi>Thoughts</hi> very deep and lasting
<hi>Impressions:</hi> And to give us right and just <hi>Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:18"/>
of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> on which our <hi>Notions</hi>
of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Conduct</hi> of our <hi>Lives,</hi> our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and our <hi>Happiness</hi> depend, is to do one of the
greatest <hi>Services</hi> that can be done to <hi>Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another great End is to set before us for our <hi>Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
an <hi>Illustrious Example</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> and all
kinds of <hi>Vertue,</hi> in the most <hi>contrary</hi> Circumstances
of <hi>Life</hi> that can be, the most <hi>Flourishing,</hi> and the most
<hi>Miserable.</hi> And this is done in the <hi>Character</hi> of
<hi>Job:</hi> While he possess'd a greater <hi>Substance</hi> than any
Man in the Country where he liv'd, and was blest with
a <hi>compleat</hi> Collection of all those <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> that
are suppos'd to make a Man happy in this <hi>World,</hi> he
maintain'd his <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> inviolable, he
was no less <hi>eminent</hi> for his <hi>Piety,</hi> than for his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
and <hi>Abundance.</hi> He strictly preserv'd his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
and <hi>Humility,</hi> his <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
his <hi>Continence,</hi> his <hi>Compassion,</hi> and his
great <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>Mankind;</hi> as appears by the first, and
Thirty first Chapters of this <hi>Book.</hi> And when by a
strange and surprizing <hi>Revolution</hi> the <hi>Scene</hi> was
chang'd, and this <hi>Righteous Person</hi> being depriv'd of
his Children and Possessions, and afflicted with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Pain and Sickness, became the most <hi>wretched</hi>
and <hi>unhappy Man</hi> that can be imagin'd, he then by
the Exercise of other rare <hi>Vertues,</hi> maintains as great
a Character in his <hi>Sufferings:</hi> He shows an admirable
<hi>Instance</hi> of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi> of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
and <hi>Perseverance,</hi> holds <hi>fast</hi> his <hi>Religion,</hi> and
still expresses his unalterable <hi>Dependence</hi> on his <hi>God.</hi>
In short, his Mind was neither elated, nor soften'd by
the greatest <hi>Prosperity,</hi> nor sowr'd or broken by the
greatest <hi>Adversity.</hi> 'Tis true indeed that he vented
several <hi>passionate, rash,</hi> and unbecoming Expressions;
<pb facs="tcp:48294:18"/>
but when we consider the <hi>Anguish</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> under
such <hi>prodigious Sufferings,</hi> the <hi>profane Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of his <hi>Wife,</hi> the exasperating <hi>Reproaches</hi> of
his mistaken <hi>Friends,</hi> who after all his heavy <hi>Losses</hi>
would have robb'd him too of his <hi>Integrity,</hi> it will not
be hard to excuse those Expressions: And no more can
be concluded from them than this, that tho' he was an
Excellent, he was not a Faultless <hi>Man. Moses,</hi> who
was honour'd with the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>meekest Man</hi>
on Earth, did on some provoking <hi>Occasions</hi> lose his
<hi>Temper;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> may be allow'd to be the most <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Person</hi> in the World, tho' in such <hi>Streights</hi> and
<hi>Distress,</hi> and urg'd with such <hi>Provocations,</hi> some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<hi>Speeches</hi> might be extorted from him.</p>
            <p>I cannot but observe in this place, that <hi>Job</hi> a Person
of such <hi>Piety,</hi> and so many rare and admirable <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
had no <hi>Advantages</hi> from the <hi>Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
made to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Jewish Prophets.</hi> He was
a <hi>Stranger</hi> to their <hi>Law</hi> and their <hi>System</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
The <hi>Light</hi> that directed him must be only that of
Natural Reason and Conscience, assisted by some Oral
Traditions from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and by what <hi>God</hi>
was pleas'd sometimes to communicate by <hi>Dreams</hi> and
<hi>Visions</hi> in those darker <hi>Ages</hi> of the World. By this it
appears, that great <hi>Advances</hi> may be made in <hi>Vertue</hi>
by a diligent attendance to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of our <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Light.</hi> Would Men but improve their Reason, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
their Consciences, and stand in awe of themselves,
they would become <hi>Worshippers</hi> of God, as well as
<hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> in an <hi>eminent</hi> degree. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this to the Consideration of those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that
do not acknowledge the <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> either of
the <hi>Mosaick,</hi> or of the <hi>Christian Institution.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have not attempted a close <hi>Translation</hi> of this
<hi>Sacred Book,</hi> but a <hi>Paraphrase.</hi> For the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
being written in an <hi>Eastern Language,</hi> their
Manner and Turns of <hi>Expression</hi> are, as before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
so very different from ours, that I thought a
<hi>Paraphrase</hi> more proper and advantageous for a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
European Language.</hi> But as I judg'd it would
not bear a strict <hi>Translation,</hi> so on the other hand I
have endeavour'd, that the <hi>Paraphrase</hi> should not be too
<hi>loose</hi> and <hi>wide,</hi> but that the <hi>Reader</hi> may all along
carry with him the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Original.</hi> I have
often diffus'd the <hi>Sense</hi> in other Expression. I have
amplify'd the <hi>Text</hi> in many Places that appear'd more
<hi>Poetical,</hi> and from <hi>General Heads</hi> I have descended
sometimes to <hi>Particulars,</hi> the Enumeration of which,
I believ'd, would illustrate and enliven the <hi>Original.</hi>
I have avoided the immediate Repetition of the <hi>same
Thought</hi> in Words little different from the first,
which is so very common in this <hi>Book,</hi> as well as in
that of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and other <hi>Poetical</hi> Places of the
<hi>Scripture.</hi> For tho' this was no doubt accounted in
the <hi>Eastern Countries</hi> at that time a great <hi>Beauty</hi>
and <hi>Ornament</hi> to the <hi>Writing,</hi> yet we have quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Taste of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and therefore I have
thought it best to accommodate that Matter to the
<pb facs="tcp:48294:19"/>
               <hi>Modern</hi> way of <hi>Writing.</hi> The Method of <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
in the <hi>Eastern Countries</hi> is what the <hi>Europeans</hi>
think irregular; the same Matter treated on before
frequently recurs, and the Connexion is sometimes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and often obscure. The <hi>Transitions</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
neglected, and a new <hi>Subject</hi> enter'd upon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the preparation for it which we expect should be
made. We censure these <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> in
<hi>Writings</hi> as defects, and no doubt they would censure
ours as much. I would not peremptorily condemn their
Taste, for the Opinion of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Ornament</hi>
seems not to be capable of being determin'd by any fixt
and unalterable <hi>Rule. Truth</hi> and <hi>good Sense</hi> are setled
upon Eternal and unchangeable <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reasons;</hi>
but the manner of Expression, and the method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
them, and what concerns the <hi>Dress,</hi> the <hi>Pomp</hi>
and <hi>Ornament</hi> of them, these are perhaps indifferent
Ceremonies, and every <hi>Nation</hi> may have <hi>Authority</hi>
to establish which they please. 'Tis plain the Eastern
<hi>World</hi> have not the same <hi>Apprehensions</hi> of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Ornament</hi> that we have: They believe there
is a great <hi>Beauty</hi> in the <hi>neglect</hi> of what we call <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Regularity,</hi> as is evident in their <hi>Gardens</hi>
and <hi>Buildings.</hi> What we censure as careless, wild
and extravagant, strikes them with more <hi>Admiration,</hi>
and gives them greater <hi>Pleasure,</hi> than all our elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and orderly Contrivances. All that can be said is,
that our <hi>Tasts</hi> are different, and if they are barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to us, we are so to them, some of which especially
the <hi>Chinese</hi> are, or at least have been very Wise and
Polite <hi>Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We in this part of the <hi>World</hi> are all so full of
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and are so bigotted to the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin Sects,</hi> that we are ready to account all
<pb facs="tcp:48294:20"/>
               <hi>Authors Heretical</hi> that are without the <hi>Pale</hi> of the
<hi>Classicks.</hi> This seems to me to be a narrow <hi>Sectarian
Spirit,</hi> that prompts Men to impose their <hi>Fancies</hi> and
<hi>Opinions</hi> on all the <hi>World</hi> besides. Whatever high
Opinion we have of our own <hi>Attainments,</hi> we should
have that <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a due regard for the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of
other <hi>Nations;</hi> and not with the <hi>haughty Air</hi> of a
<hi>Supercilious Critick,</hi> censure and condemn every
thing that deviates from the <hi>Examples</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have therefore in this <hi>Paraphrase</hi> proceeded all
along from <hi>Chapter</hi> to <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Verse</hi> to <hi>Verse,</hi>
in the Order they are set down, excepting some very <hi>few</hi>
inconsiderable <hi>Transpositions:</hi> So that I have by no
means alter'd the Method and Order of the <hi>Narration,</hi>
or any way chang'd the <hi>Model.</hi> And 'twill be hard to
give a <hi>Reason</hi> why the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> has
not as great a <hi>Right</hi> to be made the <hi>Standard</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to try <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as those <hi>two Authors</hi>
have to bring this to their <hi>Tribunal.</hi> If the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the <hi>Hebrew Language</hi> had been look'd on in
<hi>Europe</hi> to have been as necessary as the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin;</hi> had it been as great an <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment</hi>
for a Man to understand the first as the
last; and had there been as great a <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Authors</hi>
of all sorts of <hi>Learning</hi> left in the <hi>Language,</hi> that
there might have been an equal <hi>Inducement</hi> to have
study'd and taught it universally in the <hi>Schools,</hi> I say
had this been, the <hi>Grammarians</hi> and <hi>Criticks</hi> might
perhaps have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ixt on this as the best <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Writings,</hi> and have drawn their <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
from the <hi>Example</hi> they found here: For 'tis
plain all their Precepts are founded on <hi>Examples,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48294:20"/>
and on those <hi>Examples</hi> with which they were most
conversant, and in such <hi>Languages</hi> as were most in
vogue, and which most of them were oblig'd to <hi>profess</hi>
and <hi>teach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have indeed supply'd in some Places the <hi>Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and other <hi>Connexions,</hi> which according to their
manner of <hi>Writing</hi> are omitted in the <hi>Original,</hi> that
the <hi>Reader</hi> of the <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> who is unaccustomed to
that way, may not be embarrass'd or interrupted. There
are many <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>obscure Places,</hi> about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which I have consulted the <hi>ablest</hi> and most <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Writers,</hi> and have taken that <hi>Sense</hi> which I
look'd on as most <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>supported</hi> by the best
<hi>Reasons:</hi> And in this I have chiefly been obliged to
the Excellent <hi>Paraphrase</hi> of the <hi>Learned Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Ely,</hi> and the <hi>Collection</hi> of the <hi>Critici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have added a <hi>Paraphrase</hi> upon several other <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Parts of the <hi>Bible;</hi> which, in my Opinion, are
<hi>nobler</hi> Examples of the true <hi>sublime Stile,</hi> than any
can be <hi>sound</hi> in the <hi>Pagan Writers.</hi> The <hi>Images</hi>
are so strong, the <hi>Thoughts</hi> so great, the <hi>Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
so divine, and the <hi>Figures</hi> so admirable, bold and
moving, that the wonderful manner of these <hi>Writers</hi> is
quite inimitable. One thing I must advertise the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of, that in the <hi>Prophets</hi> 'tis common with them,
that they may <hi>represent</hi> the Certainty of their <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
with the greater <hi>Advantage,</hi> to use the <hi>past</hi>
for the <hi>future Tense,</hi> that is, to speak of <hi>Things</hi> to
come, as already done; so that their <hi>Prophecies</hi> often
seem <hi>Historical Narrations</hi> of <hi>Matters</hi> already trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted:
Therefore the <hi>Reader</hi> is not to be surpriz'd,
when in the second <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> he finds that <hi>great
Prophet</hi> speaking of what befel the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>
in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as things past in his own Time, which did
<pb facs="tcp:48294:21"/>
not happen till long after his <hi>Death.</hi> I am of Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
<hi>Judgment,</hi> who in his <hi>Preface</hi> declares that
there are no more noble <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Poetry</hi> to be
found than those the <hi>Scriptures</hi> furnish us withal, and
therefore I have made this <hi>Attempt.</hi> 'Tis true,
Mr. <hi>Sandys,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of <hi>great Merit,</hi> has
done this <hi>before;</hi> but that I did not know till after I
had begun this <hi>Work,</hi> and made some <hi>Progress</hi> in it;
and when I had perus'd part of his <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> I
thought I might be able to supply some <hi>Defects,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in relation to <hi>Perspicuity</hi> and <hi>Coherence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Leviathan</hi> and <hi>Behemoth,</hi> mention'd in
the latter Part of this <hi>Book,</hi> I have appropriated the
Character of the <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and of the
<hi>last</hi> to the <hi>Elephant.</hi> I believe the Marks enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Learned Bochart,</hi> do justly determine the
<hi>Description</hi> of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> to the <hi>Crocodile;</hi>
but I can't see any necessity from what he urges, to
conclude <hi>Behemoth</hi> to be the <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> or
<hi>River-Horse.</hi> The Character given in <hi>Job</hi> is, in my
Opinion, more sutable to the <hi>Elephant.</hi> The <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
alledg'd on both sides may be seen in the <hi>Critici</hi>
before-cited; and whether the one or the other be true,
is not a Matter of that <hi>Importance</hi> as should oblige
me to transcribe the <hi>Arguments</hi> in this Place. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by the Reasons of some <hi>Learned</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
I have taken the <hi>Unicorn</hi> for the <hi>Uri</hi> or <hi>wild
Bull,</hi> and not the <hi>Oryx,</hi> or <hi>wild Goat,</hi> according
to <hi>Boshart,</hi> or the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> according to others.
I impose not my <hi>Opinion</hi> on others: These are <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of <hi>small Moment,</hi> and every Man is at liberty
to think as he pleases.</p>

                  <l>Can more than Humane Understanding boast.</l>
                  <l>If you should dye, the Grave and endless Night</l>
                  <l>Would overwhelm all Intellectual Light.</l>
                  <l>Blind Ignorance would unmolested reign,</l>
                  <l>And Folly Universal Empire gain.</l>
                  <l>But know, since you your Friend so hardly press,</l>
                  <l>As well as you, some Reason I possess,</l>
                  <l>Nor is its Light more dim, or Vigour less.</l>
                  <l>Yet you and I in this debate must own,</l>
                  <l>We've no great Flights of Wit, or Depths of Wisdom shown.</l>
                  <l>That God is Wise, and still does Right decree,</l>
                  <l>All other Nations grant, as well as we.</l>
                  <l>But you perversly manage the Debate,</l>
                  <l>And the true Question never justly State.</l>
                  <l>You ought to prove, that some enormous fault</l>
                  <l>Has on my Head this sore Affliction brought.</l>
                  <l>You should my close Hypocrisy detect,</l>
                  <l>Which makes th' Allmighty my Complaint reject.</l>

                  <l>Your suff'ring Friend insultingly deride.</l>
                  <l>Because th' Allmighty does his Ear incline</l>
                  <l>To hear your Pray'r, while he is deaf to mine;</l>
                  <l>Because your Days are prosp'rous, you despise</l>

                  <l>Contempt th' afflicted Righteous Man attends,</l>
                  <l>And Scorn, instead of Pity, from his Friends.</l>
                  <l>A Man reduc'd to Misery and Want,</l>
                  <l>Who once could Honour and Abundance vaunt,</l>

                  <l>Is scorn'd, when glimm'ring with expiring Light.</l>
                  <l>Yet of the Just this is the Common Fate,</l>

                  <l>And would some Mercy, some Compassion show,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>When the three Men who pious <hi>Iob</hi> arraign'd,</l>
                  <l>And their high Charge in long replys maintain'd,</l>
                  <l>Perceiv'd him firmly fixt in his Defence,</l>
                  <l>And resolute to clear his Innocence;</l>
                  <l>They hopeless of Success from this debate,</l>
                  <l>Let fall the Argument, and silent sate.</l>
                  <l>Then a young Man, who as a faithful Friend,</l>
                  <l>When the three Sages came, did <hi>Iob</hi> attend,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48294:89"/>And who attention gave, and duly weigh'd</l>
                  <l>What for their Cause on either side was said,</l>
                  <l>Only in years inferiour to the rest,</l>
                  <l>Felt a just Anger kindled in his Breast.</l>
                  <l>His Name was <hi>Elibu,</hi> in Blood ally'd</l>
                  <l>To faithful <hi>Abram</hi> by the Brother's side.</l>
                  <l>Against good <hi>Iob</hi> did his Displeasure rise,</l>
                  <l>Because in all his long and sharp replies</l>
                  <l>He had less warmth, and less Concernment shown</l>
                  <l>For his great Maker's Honour, than his own:</l>
                  <l>Nor did the wise young Man less Passion feel</l>
                  <l>Against the rash, uncharitable Zeal</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Accusers, who could not defend</l>
                  <l>Their groundless Charge against their suff'ring Friend.</l>
                  <l>Yet did he long discreetly moderate</l>
                  <l>His struggling Passion, and attentive wait</l>
                  <l>Till the grave Men had finish'd their Debate.</l>
                  <l>But when he saw they had their Treasures spent,</l>
                  <l>And none resum'd their baffl'd Argument;</l>
                  <l>Unable to forbear, he Silence broke,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Iob</hi>'s severe Accusers thus bespoke.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Your Wisdom which profoundly I rever'd,</l>
                  <l>From giving my Opinion me deterr'd.</l>
                  <l>Aw'd by your Fame, and Age, and Eloquence,</l>
                  <l>I never yet have interpos'd my Sence.</l>
                  <l>For one so young, I judg'd it rather meet</l>
                  <l>To sit a modest Learner at the Feet</l>
                  <l>Of Men of such Experience, than to rise</l>
                  <l>To dictate to the Grave, and teach the Wise.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:48294:89"/>But now, convinc'd of my Mistake, I find</l>
                  <l>That Man, tho' grey with years, continues blind,</l>
                  <l>Unless Celestial Light irradiates his Mind.</l>
                  <l>Wisdom Divine is ne'er to be acquir'd,</l>
                  <l>Unless the Man be from above inspir'd.</l>
                  <l>'Tis not the sure possession of the Great,</l>
                  <l>Nor does it still adorn the Teacher's Seat.</l>
                  <l>Many are in acquiring Knowledge slow,</l>
                  <l>Nor by experience will they Wiser grow.</l>
                  <l>Therefore Attention give, and I'll declare</l>
                  <l>What in this great Affair, my Notions are.</l>
                  <l>Let none condemn me, that I speak at last,</l>
                  <l>I've interrupted no Discourses past.</l>
                  <l>Your Arguments I've weigh'd, which you pretend,</l>
                  <l>Prove your Indictment brought against your Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>But after all, if I may freely speak,</l>
                  <l>To gain your Cause, your Reasons are too weak.</l>
                  <l>You never could in this prolix Dispute,</l>
                  <l>Make good your Charge, or <hi>Iob</hi>'s Defence confute.</l>
                  <l>In vain you say, that you will silent stand,</l>
                  <l>And leave him wholly to th' Allmighty's Hand;</l>
                  <l>Hoping his Terrors will your Friend subdue,</l>
                  <l>Which your weak Arguments can never do.</l>
                  <l>Weapons so feeble I disdain to weild,</l>
                  <l>When to dispute with <hi>Iob</hi> I take the Field.</l>
                  <l>To me he ne'er did his Discourse direct,</l>
                  <l>Nor will I use your Words his Error to correct.</l>
                  <l>To all around I justly may complain,</l>
                  <l>That for Instruction I have staid in vain.</l>

                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48294:90"/>You are exhausted, and confounded left,</l>
                  <l>Silent you stand, as if of Speech bereft.</l>
                  <l>Therefore, as I have told you, I will give</l>
                  <l>My Judgment, and this great Debate revive.</l>
                  <l>While I my Lips by Violence restrain,</l>
                  <l>My fullness gives unsufferable Pain.</l>
                  <l>My struggling Thoughts which in my Bosom pent,</l>
                  <l>Like new press'd Wines within the Vate, ferment,</l>
                  <l>Will make me burst, unless they find a Vent.</l>
                  <l>To ease my self I am compell'd to speak,</l>
                  <l>Full, working Vessels, if not open'd, break.</l>
                  <l>While I attempt your Errors to correct,</l>
                  <l>I will not Persons, but the Cause respect.</l>

                  <l>And sure, O <hi>Iob,</hi> this Preface I have made,</l>
                  <l>Suffices thy Attention to perswade.</l>
                  <l>To my discourse afford a patient Ear,</l>
                  <l>I am prepar'd to speak, if thou art so to hear.</l>
                  <l>And be assur'd whatever I impart,</l>
                  <l>Shall be the inward Language of my Heart.</l>
                  <l>Such plain and clear Instruction I will give,</l>
                  <l>That thou with Ease my meaning shalt receive.</l>
                  <l>And first consider well, our Structure came</l>
                  <l>From the same Model, and our Clay's the same.</l>

                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48294:90"/>With Breath th' Almighty did my Breast inspire,</l>
                  <l>And kindled in my Veins the Vital Fire.</l>
                  <l>Therefore, if thou thy Cause wilt now defend,</l>
                  <l>Thou only with thy Equal shalt contend.</l>
                  <l>To plead with God thou rashly didst demand,</l>
                  <l>First answer me, I in his Place will stand.</l>
                  <l>Thou needest not thy Brother-Creature fear,</l>
                  <l>I can't in dreadful Majesty appear.</l>
                  <l>I bring no Terrors with me to affright;</l>
                  <l>No Force, but Reason's clear, convincing Light.</l>
                  <l>I'll not accuse thee, as thy Friends have done,</l>
                  <l>Of secret Errors, and of Crimes unknown.</l>
                  <l>None but th' Almighty's all-observing Eye,</l>
                  <l>The Heart his proper Empire can descry.</l>
                  <l>I shall assault thee with no other Force,</l>
                  <l>Then what I borrow from thy own Discourse.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Have I not heard thee oft in thy Defence,</l>
                  <l>Boldly assert thy spotless Innocence.</l>
                  <l>Hast thou not said, thy Justice to maintain,</l>
                  <l>"My Heart is pure, my Hands are free from stain.</l>
                  <l>He, who I hop'd, would mitigate my Woe,</l>
                  <l>On slight pretences is become my Foe.</l>
                  <l>He seeks occasions to repeat his Strokes,</l>
                  <l>And every slight Offence his Wrath provokes.</l>
                  <l>In Prison me his Captive he detains,</l>
                  <l>And loads my fetter'd Feet with pond'rous Chains.</l>
                  <l>And yet his watchful Guards around me stay,</l>
                  <l>Lest I should loose my Bonds, and break away."</l>

                  <l>Impatient of thy Grief thou seekest Ease.</l>

                  <l>Here thy presumptuous Arrogance is clear.</l>

                  <l>Himself, with him that gave him Breath, compare?</l>
                  <l>Why dost thou then engage in this dispute,</l>
                  <l>Audacious Man, wouldst thou thy God confute?</l>
                  <l>Will he his secret Counsels open lay,</l>
                  <l>And his mysterious Providence display?</l>
                  <l>Will he be summon'd to his Creature's Bar,</l>
                  <l>The grounds of his Transactions to declare?</l>
                  <l>Will e'er th' Almighty Soveraign condescend,</l>
                  <l>The Conduct of his Empire to defend,</l>
                  <l>A peevish Creature's Error to amend?</l>
                  <l>Will he, because he does our Censure fear,</l>
                  <l>Set forth his Justice, and his Prudence clear,</l>
                  <l>And let the hidden Springs of Government appear?</l>
                  <l>Th' Almighty's Works, thou shouldst have understood,</l>
                  <l>Because they're his, are therefore Just and Good.</l>
                  <l>Where shallow Reason can't the grounds discern</l>
                  <l>Of Providence, it should submission learn.</l>
                  <l>Not that our Knowledge of his Works and Ways,</l>
                  <l>Does e'er our kind Creator's Envy raise;</l>
                  <l>For he by various ways does Knowledge give,</l>

                  <l>He seems this impious Doctrine to defend,</l>

                  <l>Of Years an Hundred, and twice Twenty more,</l>
                  <l>To those were added, which he liv'd before.</l>
                  <l>So the Good Man his numerous Progeny,</l>
                  <l>Did to the fourth Succession live to see.</l>
                  <l>Then ripe with Hoary Age, and fully pleas'd,</l>

               <l>What does the Heathen Fire with so much Rage?</l>
               <l>What <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Sons in such Designs engage</l>
               <l>As they can ne'er effect, or if they do,</l>

               <l>Infatuated Men! you'll sure repent</l>
               <l>Your rash Attempts, too late the sad event</l>
               <l>Will show your Projects vain, your Malice impotent.</l>
               <l>Confed'rate Princes wicked Friendship make,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>ATtend, O Heav'ns, and you Empyreal Sphears</l>
               <l>Did you possess as many list'ning Ears,</l>
               <l>As Starry Eyes, all, as you roll along,</l>
               <l>Should be employ'd to hear my following Song.</l>
               <l>To my important words a while attend,</l>
               <l>And back my Notes in tuneful Ecchoes send.</l>
               <l>Peace, ye tumultuous Waters of the Deep,</l>
               <l>A while ye yelling Monsters silence keep,</l>
               <l>And let the Billows roll, and rock themselves asleep.</l>
               <l>Be still, ye Earthquakes, in the Caves beneath,</l>
               <l>Ye Winds be husht, and stop your stormy Breath.</l>
               <l>Thunders, your bellowing, deaf'ning Noise forbear,</l>
               <l>Tempests be gone, and leave in Peace the Air;</l>
               <l>That so the quiet Earth, and Air, and Sea,</l>
               <l>Without disturbance may attention pay,</l>
               <l>Whilst I th' Almighty's wondrous Deeds display.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And let not my Divine Discourse be vain,</l>
               <l>Let it distill as Dew, and drop as Rain,</l>
               <l>

               <l>And with rich Fruits the smiling Vally fills.</l>
               <l>Whilst I to all the World aloud proclaim</l>
               <l>His Majesty, his great and awful Name,</l>
               <l>Whilst I his Triumphs sing, ye Tribes, do you</l>
               <l>To God ascribe the Pow'r and Glory due.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God is a Rock unchang'd by Ages past,</l>
               <l>And by the future shall unshaken last.</l>
               <l>Perfect are all his Works, and all his Ways;</l>
               <l>From Truth's Eternal Rule he never strays.</l>
               <l>Upright and Equal all his Acts appear,</l>
               <l>He's just, when kind, and gracious, when severe.</l>
               <l>Therefore, ye Sons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> be it known</l>
               <l>On your own heads you've pull'd Destruction down.</l>
               <l>Your black Offences have incens'd your God,</l>
               <l>And forc'd his hand to take his vengeful Rod.</l>
               <l>Say not that yours, the Faults of Children are,</l>
               <l>Which a kind Father is induc'd to spare:</l>
               <l>Your Crimson Spots, your foul and loathsome stains</l>
               <l>Tell the rank Poison that infects your Veins.</l>
               <l>Your unexampled Contumacy shows</l>
               <l>You are not Children, but invet'rate Foes.</l>
               <l>Th' Almighty's Goodness do you thus despise,</l>
               <l>Ah foolish Generation and unwise!</l>
               <l>Your Great Deliverer do you thus requite?</l>
               <l>His Pow'r and Mercy thus perversly slight?</l>
               <l>You by a vast expence of Wonders bought,</l>
               <l>He from your Bondage back from <hi>Egypt</hi> brought.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:48294:141"/>He then advanc'd you to Imperial Sway,</l>
               <l>And made the Pagan Kings your Laws obey.</l>
               <l>From all Mankind he chose you for his own,</l>
               <l>And did your Sons with Pow'r and Plenty crown.</l>
               <l>Consult our antient Fathers, to the source</l>
               <l>Of our recorded Story have recourse:</l>
               <l>You'll find when God did with a lib'ral hand</l>
               <l>Among the Nations give the parted Land,</l>
               <l>He <hi>Canaan's</hi> happy Region did divide,</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Offspring should at last reside.</l>
               <l>He from the Pagan did his People bound,</l>
               <l>And for himself fenc'd this Inclosure round,</l>
               <l>And blest with his Abode the sacred Ground.</l>
               <l>To Wealth and Pow'r he <hi>Israel</hi> did advance,</l>
               <l>And with his Gifts enrich'd his own Inheritance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To seek out <hi>Iacob</hi> he the Desart past,</l>
               <l>And found him in a lonesome yelling Wast,</l>
               <l>With pain and want, and servile Chains opprest,</l>
               <l>A Prey to every fierce <hi>Egyptian</hi> Beast.</l>
               <l>God with Compassion mov'd to such distress,</l>
               <l>Led the lost Stranger thro' the Wilderness.</l>
               <l>He shielded him with his resistless Might,</l>
               <l>And to direct him to proceed aright,</l>
               <l>He on his Mind diffus'd his Heav'nly Light.</l>
               <l>He did his Wants and Pleasures too supply,</l>
               <l>And kept him as the Apple of his Eye.</l>
               <l>See as an Eagle o'er her young ones flys,</l>
               <l>Spreads out her Wings, and flutters in the Skys.</l>
               <l>

               <l>Their Courage to provoke, and make 'em dare</l>
               <l>To try their Wings, and trust themselves in Air:</l>
               <l>So did th' Almighty <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Sons excite,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Egypt's</hi> Prisons to attempt their flight:</l>
               <l>Which he assisted with a Father's Care,</l>
               <l>And did their way thro' parting Waves prepare.</l>
               <l>He thro' the pathless Desart was their guide,</l>
               <l>And when the Tribes for <hi>Egypt's</hi> Onions cry'd,</l>
               <l>He in the Wilderness his Table spread,</l>
               <l>And in his Airy Ovens bak'd the Bread,</l>
               <l>With which th' ungrateful Murmurers were fed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then marching onward with a mighty hand,</l>
               <l>He led them to possess a fertile Land.</l>
               <l>There they the vanquish'd Heathen Lords pursu'd,</l>
               <l>Reduc'd their Towns, and their strong Forts subdu'd,</l>
               <l>That they the fruitful Region might enjoy,</l>
               <l>And with delights their ravish'd Senses cloy.</l>
               <l>A Soil which Nature's choicest Favours crown,</l>
               <l>With Floods of Milk and Hony overflown:</l>
               <l>Hony, that runs in yellow, fragrant Seas,</l>
               <l>From out the holes of Rocks and hollow Trees.</l>
               <l>Bath'd in their Oyl their chearful Faces shone,</l>
               <l>And with the Grape's rich blood they warm'd their own.</l>
               <l>And yet the Tribes by gracious Heav'n carest,</l>
               <l>Rever'd abroad, at home with Plenty blest,</l>
               <l>Grew fat and vicious, like a pamper'd Beast.</l>
               <l>They all the Bounds of grateful Duty broke,</l>
               <l>Spurn'd at their Lord, and kick'd against his Yoke.</l>
