            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas <hi>Robert Smith</hi> Eſquire, now high Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> hath lately received a Writ, bearing date the 27 day of <hi>May,</hi> in the eighteenth yeere of His now Majeſties raigne, thereby commanding him to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a Proclamation whereby all His Majeſties Subjects belonging to the Trained-bands or Militia of this Kingdome are forbidden to riſe, march, muſter, or exerciſe, by vertue of any Order or Ordinance of one or both Houſes of Parliament, without conſent or warrant from His Majeſty, upon paine of puniſhment according to the lawes. And whereas the ſaid high Sheriffe hath now addreſſed himſelf to both Houſes of Parliament for adviſe and directions therein; conceiving the ſaid Proclamation to be contrariant and repugnant to the Ordinance and judgment of both Houſes of Parliament concerning the Militia: It is therefore declared by the Lords and Commons in Parliament (they intending nothing by the ſaid Ordinance but the protection and ſecurity of His Maieſties Perſon, the defence of the Kingdome againſt forren invaſion, and the preſervation of the publique peace, againſt inteſtine rebellions and inſurrections here at home, the maintenance of the priviledges and authority of Parliament according to the Proteſtation) That the ſaid writ is illegall, for that by the conſtitution and policy of this Kingdome, the King by his Proclamation cannot declare the Law contrary to the Conſtitution oſ any of the inferiour Courts of juſtice, much leſſe againſt the high Court of Parliament; And likewiſe for that this Writ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that to be done which they are obliged unto by their duty to God, their allegiance to His Maieſty, and the truſt repoſed in them by the Common-wealth (the law ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intruſted them to provide for the good and ſafety thereof.) And that the ſaid high Sheriffe hath done nothing, in forbearing to publiſh the ſaid Proclamation, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his duty, and in obedience to the Order of both Houſes. And he is hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not to publiſh the ſaid Proclamation, or any other Proclamations or Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the like nature that concerne the Parliament, without firſt acquainting the ſaid Houſes. And it is further declared, that the ſaid high Sheriffe, and other Sheriffes of other Counties within this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> for their obedience to the Orders and Ordinance of Parliament, or that have or hereafter ſhall doe any thing in the execution thereof, ſhall be protected by the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of both the ſaid Houſes.</p>
