            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have
as it were brought forth wind, we have not wrought

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He holy Prophet having in the foregoing
Chapter set forth many gracious <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
promises,</hi> doth here in this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
them with a <hi>song</hi> of solemn and
publick thanksgiving, blessing the Lord for his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100393:4"/>
salvation to his Church, and his severity against
the enemies thereof.</p>
            <p>Whereupon we find the Church entertaining
many <hi>holy Resolutions,</hi> as fruits and expressions of
that her joy. She resoves to <hi>trust in the Lord for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
in regard of his strength and fidelity towards
his people, and of his power and jealousie against
their enemies, <hi>ver. 4, 5, 6, 7.</hi> She resolves to
<hi>wait upon God</hi> in the midst of judgements, upon the
remembrance of that <hi>Name</hi> of his, whereby he
made himself known to his people in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod.
34 6, 7. as a God able to give <hi>being</hi> to every
promise, and by his <hi>truth and power</hi> to performe
what his <hi>mercy</hi> had covenanted to do for her,
<hi>Micah 7. 20. ver. 8, 9, 12.</hi> And this confident
waiting upon God in trouble is commended <hi>ab op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posito</hi>
by the contrary disposition of wicked men,
whom favours and mercies cannot perswade to
learn righteousness, <hi>ver. 10, 11.</hi> She resolves <hi>to
submit</hi> to Gods fatherly Government alone, and to
renounce all other usurping and tyrannical Lords,
who had exercised domination over her, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
of Gods judgements executed on them,
and his mercies renued to his people, <hi>v. 13, 14, 15.</hi>
She resolves to <hi>poure out her prayer</hi> unto God in the
midst of all present troubles, acknowledging her
own impotency, and the miscarriage of all her own
carnal counsels and contrivances, and thereupon
trusting no longer in her self, but in God which
raiseth the dead, <hi>ver. 16, 17, 18, 19.</hi> Lastly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all these pious dispositions and noble resolves,
she concludeth her song with a <hi>triumphal Epinicion</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100393:4"/>
and insultation over all her enemies, and with
an assurance that as they should <hi>die and not live,
fall and not rise,</hi> their persons and their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
should perish, <hi>ver. 14.</hi> so she should <hi>live, and
rise and sing, and flourish,</hi> as the herbs buried in the
Earth, when the dew of Heaven falls on them to
refresh them, <hi>ver. 19.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some refer the words to the <hi>Babylonian Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
wherein they were as dead bones in a grave,
<hi>Ezek. 37. 11, 12.</hi> without any strength, wisdome,
or visible hope of being ever delivered.</p>
            <p>Some to the <hi>afflicted state of the Church</hi> under
the Gospel, and the <hi>Rest</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> which the
Lord would give them at the last, out of all their
labours and sufferings, <hi>Heb. 4. 9. Rev. 20. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some to the <hi>last Resurrection</hi> and the faith of
the Church touching that. And there is
nothing more usual then for the Church and
holy men therein to support their hearts above
their incumbent afflictions, and to secure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the comfort of promised deliverance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the seeming improbabilities
thereof, by the general doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
See <hi>Job 19. 25, 26, 27. Isa. 66. 14. Hos. 6. 2. 2 Cor.

            <p>Whatever was the particular state of the
the Church then, certain it is, that <hi>in the general

            <p>The <hi>sore affliction</hi> here of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100393:5"/>
to the pangs of a woman in travel, who
earnestly cryeth out, and striveth to be delivered;
a frequent allusion to expresse any exquisite pain
by, <hi>Isa. 13. 8. Jer. 13. 21.</hi> She had in this her
sore distresse, cryed with strong groans and cryes
unto God to be delivered, but all in vain, she
brought forth nothing but <hi>wind, pain without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi>
Jer. 12. 13. <hi>Wind</hi> is an usual expression, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Scripture describeth <hi>frustraneous events,
Jer. 5. 13. Hos. 8. 7. 12. 1.</hi> the womb of the
Church miscarried, and brought forth, <hi>flatum
pro faetu,</hi> they looked for salvation and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but they were totally disapointed, they
had the pains of a travelling woman but not the
<hi>comfort</hi> of a child born, <hi>John 16. 21.</hi> when they
looked for deliverance from one calamity, they
fell into another; or as some render it, instead
of bringing forth a child, or working any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
they were delivered of their own spirit,
or <hi>gave up the Ghost.</hi> The next words are a litteral
explication of the metaphor, We <hi>have not
wrought any salvation</hi> or deliverance. All our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
and cries end in <hi>vanity</hi> and disappointment.
All our <hi>Hopes</hi> touching the ruine of our enemies,
<hi>ver. 14.</hi> are come to nothing, they <hi>are not fallen.</hi>
But we <hi>are dead</hi> men, very <hi>carcasses,</hi> we <hi>dwell in
the dust,</hi> we are as low as calamity can make
us.</p>
            <p>Now above all this misery the <hi>Church by faith</hi>
lifteth up her head, in the assurance of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Resurrection. She turnes away from the
view and sense of her own sufferings, from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100393:5"/>
               <hi>conceptions</hi> and <hi>parturitions</hi> of her own Counsels,
and carnal contrivances, and <hi>with a triumphant. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postrophe</hi>
turns to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thy dead men shall live]</hi> The pronown is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
emphatical, for they are the words of the
Church to God, as appears by the continuation
of the context, from <hi>ver. 16.</hi> so it is not
meant of all, but of <hi>Gods dead men,</hi> whether <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively</hi>
in any desperate clamity, or <hi>really</hi>
in their graves, For the words will extend to both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall live]</hi> or <hi>do live,</hi> are <hi>prisoners of hope,</hi>
have a <hi>seed</hi> of life in them, even in the grave.
It is the Apostles similitude and illustration,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>With my dead body]</hi> In the Original it is thus.
<hi>My dead body, They shall live;</hi> by an usual <hi>Enal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage</hi>
of the number, every one of my dead bodies
shall live. Some make it an expression of the
Prophets <hi>faith,</hi> applying to himself the comfort
of that common salvation,<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> preaching nothing to
them which he was not in his own particular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of.<note place="margin">Sasbout.</note> Some take it as an <hi>Answer of Christ
to the</hi> Churches faith, as if it related to that,
<hi>Mat. 27. 52, 53.</hi> I conceive them to be the <hi>words of
the Church</hi> still, comforting her self in the assurance
of Gods mercy to every one of her mystical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which assurance is expressed by a kind of
<hi>Hypotyposis,</hi> calling the dead to come forth out of
the dust, and to rejoyce for her deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thy dew is as the dew of Herbs]</hi> Thy divine
<hi>word,</hi> power, and promise is able to do unto us as
<hi>dew</hi> unto herbs, though they seem outwardly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100393:6"/>
dried up and dead, yet having a <hi>vital Root,</hi> they
do by the fall of the dew send forth their Leaves
and beauty again. Now God hath more care of
us then of <hi>herbs,</hi> and his spirit more efficacy then
the <hi>dew,</hi> and therefore however we may be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and consumed with calamity and death,
yet he will raise us up again, and cloath us with
beauty and glory. Thus the Scripture often ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
from <hi>natural</hi> to <hi>supernatural</hi> things, Jer. 31. 35,
36. <hi>Jer. 33. 20, 21. Psal. 89. 36, 37. 1 Cor. 15. 36.</hi>
And this similitude of <hi>dew</hi> reviving and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
decayed herbs we frequently meet with, <hi>Prov.
19. 12. Isa. 66. 14. Hos. 14. 5, 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the earth shall cast out the dead</hi>] as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
doth an untimely birth. The Grave shall
be <hi>in Travel</hi> with the dead,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the Apostle seems
to point at such a Metaphor, <hi>Acts 2. 24.</hi> and shall
be delivered of them. Another version thus,
<hi>Thou shalt cast the Giants in the earth.</hi> They who
here as Giants did trample on the Church, and
were formidable unto her, shall then <hi>fall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi>
when thy people shall awake and sing, as
<hi>ver. 14.</hi> so elsewhere, <hi>They shall take them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
whose captives they were, and they shall rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their oppressors,</hi> Isa. 14. 2. <hi>the sons of them that
afflicted them shall come bending unto them</hi> Isa. 60. 14.
65. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>In the words we observe two general parts
1. The Churches <hi>complaint</hi> under very great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and disappointment, <hi>ver. 18. 2.</hi> Her <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi>
over all her enemies and sufferings, <hi>ver. 19.</hi>
The <hi>complaint</hi> being expressed by the metaphor of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100393:6"/>
               <hi>conception</hi> and parturition intimateth. 1. The
<hi>Greatnesse</hi> of their affliction. 2. The <hi>Contrivances</hi>
they used to procure deliverance from it. 3. The
<hi>disappointment</hi> of them all; we have <hi>brought forth
winde,</hi> as elsewhere ye shall <hi>conceive chaffe, and
shall bring forth stubble,</hi> Isa. 33. 11.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Triumph</hi> we may consider, 1. The <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of it, <hi>Deliverance</hi> from the lowest to the best
condition, from <hi>death</hi> to life, from a <hi>carcasse</hi> to a
Resurrection, from <hi>corruption</hi> to glory, from <hi>dust</hi>
to singing. 2. The <hi>Reasons</hi> of it, 1. In regard of
the <hi>subject, Mortui tui,</hi> Gods dead men, <hi>Cadaver
meum,</hi> the Churches dead body. 2. In regard of
the <hi>Author</hi> and vertue whereby it should be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
the Word, the Power, the Spirit of God
metaphorically expressed, <hi>Ros tuus, Thy dew is as the
dew of herbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the first general the Prophets <hi>complaint</hi> we
may observe three things.</p>
            <p>1. That the Lord exerciseth his own people,
yea his whole Church sometimes with sore and
sharp afflictions, with the <hi>pangs</hi> and throws of a
woman in travel. Sometimes we finde them in a
<hi>house of bondage</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> sometimes in a Grave
in <hi>Babylon;</hi> often oppressed with <hi>Philistims, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,
Cananites, Ammonites, Edomites, Syrians,</hi>
under the tyranny of the four great <hi>Monarchies</hi> of
the earth. So the Christian Church first under the
persecutions of the Heathen Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
then under persecutions of <hi>Antichrist</hi> &amp; her witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
prophesying in sackcloth 1260. years.<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 3. 12. 6.</note> As Christ
first suffered &amp; then entred into glory, <hi>Luk. 24. 26.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100393:7"/>
so must his Church, <hi>Rom. 8. 17.</hi> Christ hath a
double Kingdom, that of his <hi>patience,</hi> and that of
his <hi>power,</hi> we must be subjects under the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his <hi>patience,</hi> before we come to that of
his <hi>power.</hi> The Church must passe through the
Sea and the Wildernesse to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they must be
in a working and suffering condition, before they
come to the <hi>Rest or Sabbath</hi> which remaineth for
them, <hi>Heb. 4. 9. Davids</hi> militant Raign must go
before <hi>Solomons</hi> peaceable Raign.</p>
            <p>Our sins must this way be mortified. Our
faith, hope, love, patience, humility, Christian
courage and fortitude be <hi>exercised.</hi> Our conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unto Christ evidenced. The <hi>measure</hi> of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
of the enemy <hi>filled.</hi> The <hi>glory</hi> of God mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in supporting them under, in delivering them
out of all their afflictions, and raising them up
when they are at lowest.</p>
            <p>Therefore we should not esteem it strange when
we fall into divers temptations, or see the Church
of God in the world in a suffering or dying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 12, 13, 17. Jam. 1. 2.</hi> If we will have
Christ for our husband, we must take him for
better for worse. 1. His afflictions are <hi>short,</hi>
and but for a moment, <hi>Isa. 54. 7. 2 Cor. 4. 17.
2. Sanctified</hi> by the Spirit of glory and of God
resting upon us, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 13, 14. 3.</hi> Seconded
with <hi>grace</hi> and the power of Christ to support
us under them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. 4. Operative</hi> unto
peace, righteousness and glory, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. Heb.
12. 11. 5.</hi> Not <hi>worthy to be compared</hi> with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that shall be revealed, <hi>Rom. 8. 18. 6. Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100393:7"/>
to our need, 1 Pet. 1. 6.</hi> and to our <hi>strength, 1 Cor.
10. 13.</hi> If we will come to glory we must go the
same way unto it as Christ did, the <hi>way of holinesse,</hi>
and the way of <hi>sufferings,</hi> Act. 14. 22. and surely if
there be enough in a womans child to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the pains of her travel, <hi>John 16. 21.</hi> There
will certainly be <hi>enough in the glory</hi> to come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
all our pains, either in our obedience or
in our afflictions.</p>
            <p>II. We might here note, That even Gods own ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in time of trouble &amp; calamity are very apt to
betake themselves to their own <hi>conceptions</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
for deliverance; they are big oftentimes
with their <hi>own counsels,</hi> and in pain tobring forth
and execute their own <hi>projections,</hi> in order to the
freeing of themselves from trouble.<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 2.</note>
when he was afraid of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
his relation unto <hi>Sarah; David</hi> fearing
<hi>Achish</hi> the King of <hi>Gath</hi> fained himself mad,
1 <hi>Sam. 21. 11, 12, 13.</hi> when he feared the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his adultery, he gave order for the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Uriah,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 15. one sin is the womb
of another. When <hi>Asa</hi> was in danger from
<hi>Baasha</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> he bought his peace with
the spoils of the Temple, 2 <hi>Chron. 16. 1, 2.</hi> when
<hi>Jonah</hi> was afraid of preaching destruction to <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi>
he fled unto <hi>Tarshish</hi> from the presence and
service of the Lord, <hi>Jonah 1. 3.</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was
afraid of suffering with Christ, he flies to that
woful Sanctuary of denying and forswearing him,
<hi>Mat. 26. 69—74.</hi> thus the <hi>fear of man causeth a
snare,</hi> Prov. 29. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100393:8"/>
This therefore is a necessary duty in time of
fear and danger, to look up (as the Church here
after disappointment by other refuges, doth) with
a victorious and <hi>triumphant faith</hi> unto God,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 13.</note> and
to make him onely our fear and our dread, <hi>not
to trust in fraud</hi> and perversenesse, or to betake
our selves unto a <hi>refuge of lies,</hi> Isa. 30. 12. 28. 15.
but to build our confidence upon that sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
on the which he that believeth <hi>shall not need
make hast.</hi> If we <hi>lean not</hi> upon our <hi>own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
nor be <hi>wise in our own eyes,</hi> but <hi>in all our ways
acknowledge him,</hi> and trust in him, and fear him,
and depart from evil, we have this gracious
promise that he will <hi>direct our paths,</hi> Prov. 3. 5, 7.
the more we deny our selves, the more is he
engaged to help us. But when we travel with
our <hi>own conceptions</hi> and will needs be the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of our own deliverance, it cannot be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
if the Lord turn our devices into vanity,
and make our belly prepare wind and deceit, <hi>Job
15. 35.</hi> as it here followeth. We have <hi>brought
forth wind, we have not wrought any deliverance,</hi>
all our endeavours have been vain and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>
            <p>III. Carnal Counsels and humane contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are usually carried on with <hi>pain,</hi> and end in
<hi>disappointment,</hi> and do obstruct the progress and
execution of Gods promises unto us. If we would
go on in Gods way, and use the means which he
hath directed, and build our faith and hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>his promises,</hi> we have then <hi>his Word</hi> to secure
us, <hi>his Spirit</hi> to strengthen us, <hi>his Grace</hi> to assist
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100393:8"/>
us, his <hi>Power</hi> and fidelity to comfort us, we
have him engaged to work our works for us, and
his Angels to bear us in our Wayes. But when
we seek out diverticles and inventions of our
own, when we will <hi>walk in the light of our fire, and
in the sparks which we have kindled,</hi> Isa. 50. 11. and
be <hi>wise in our own conceit,</hi> Rom. 12. 16. and walk
<hi>after our own thoughts, Isa. 65. 2.</hi> no wonder if we
be disappointed, and made <hi>ashamed of our own
counsels,</hi> Hos. 10. 6. when we <hi>sow the wind,</hi> it is
not strange if we <hi>reap the whirle-winde,</hi> Hos. 8. 7.
And therefore it is <hi>our wisdom to cease from our
own wisdom,</hi> as the wise man exhorteth, <hi>Prov.
23. 4.</hi> in as much as the Lord hath pronounced
a <hi>curse</hi> upon those that are <hi>prudent in their own sight,</hi>
Isa. 5. 21. whom usually he disappointeth, <hi>Job. 5.
12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have considered the Churches complaint,
her anguish, her disappointment. Now <hi>in her
Triumph</hi> we are first to view her <hi>deliverance,</hi> and
then the <hi>causes</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>In the deliverance is a <hi>Gradation</hi> both in the
misery from which, and in the condition unto
which they are restored. For the former, 1. It
extends unto <hi>dead men,</hi> whom to quicken exceeds
the power of nature. But we do not use to give
men over, and lay them out for dead as soon as
their breath fails them, some diseases look like
death; therefore the deliverance goes further
unto <hi>Cadaver meum,</hi> my carkasse, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of vital heat have forsaken, laid out,
carried away, severed from the living, hastning to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100393:9"/>
putrefaction. But death makes yet a further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse,
this carcasse must be had out of sight,
lodged in the bowels of the earth, and there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into dust, <hi>his house must know him no more,</hi>
Job 7. 10. and yet even here when death hath
carried a man to the end of his journey, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in its own dominion, so far shall the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
extend. The <hi>Damsel</hi> whom Christ
raised was <hi>mortua,</hi> though yet in the house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the living, <hi>Mark 5. 35.</hi> The <hi>widows son</hi>
gone a little further into the Region of death,
coffin'd up, laid on the Biere, carried out from the
House, a <hi>Carcasse,</hi> Luke 7. 14. <hi>Lazarus</hi> in deaths
den, <hi>Inhabitator pulveris,</hi> as far as death could
carry him, yet raised up, <hi>John 11. 38, 44.</hi> so there
is a gradation in the <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> of this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
There is likewise a gradation in the
<hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> the condition unto which they
are restored.</p>
            <p>1. They shall <hi>Live,</hi> and this is a favour though
one stay in prison.</p>
            <p>2. They shall <hi>Rise,</hi> their life shal be to an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the wicked shall live again, but it shall be
to die again; but these dead shall live and rise,
their life shall be an advancement to them.</p>
            <p>3. They shall <hi>Awake,</hi> like a man out of sleep
refreshed and comforted, <hi>Psal. 17. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. They shall <hi>sing,</hi> as victors over the grave,
never to return thither more. So we have here,
1. <hi>The sad condition</hi> of the Church. 2. The
<hi>great mercy</hi> and power of God to them in that
condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100393:9"/>
Their <hi>sad</hi> condition in the former of these two
gradations.</p>
            <p>1. They are <hi>dead men,</hi> in a condition of death,
their <hi>whole life a conflict with mortality.</hi> And <hi>though</hi>
this be <hi>not a calamity peculiar</hi> to them, (for death
feedeth equally upon all) and though there be
a great alleviation in their being <hi>Mortui tui,</hi> The
Lords dead men; yet in some respects we finde
the weight of <hi>mortality</hi> on the Churches side.
Wicked men meet many times with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
live in pleasure, and then die in ease, spend their
days in wealth and jollity, in vanity and folly, and
go suddenly to the grave, <hi>die onely once and together,</hi>
Job 21. 13. whereas holy men have complain'd
of <hi>dying daily, 1 Cor. 15. 31.</hi> of being in <hi>deaths
often,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 23. of being <hi>compassed about with
death,</hi> Psal. 18. 4. The wicked have no <hi>bands</hi> in
their death, <hi>Psal. 73. 4.</hi> they are at <hi>an agreement</hi>
with it, have as it were hired it not to disquiet
them, <hi>Isa. 28. 15.</hi> they put it <hi>far from them,</hi> Amos
6. 3. whereas good men have their souls often
<hi>drawing nigh</hi> to the grave, <hi>Psal. 88. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dead, then here they are, 1. <hi>Quoad mortis
praeludia,</hi> all the fore-runners and harbingers of
death common to them with all others, sorrows,
sicknesses, distresses, and infirmities of all
sorts.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quoad vitae exitum,</hi> they end their days in
the same manner as other men; the <hi>wise man as the
fool,</hi> Eccles. 2. 16. Psalm 49. 10. thus in common,
good men and bad. But godly men</p>
            <p>3. Are dead <hi>quoad affectus,</hi> Their affections
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100393:10"/>
and meditations are upon death. Wicked men
feed and fat their lusts, fetch out all the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that sin hath in it. Whereas holy men <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie</hi>
their earthly members, <hi>crucifie</hi> the flesh with
affections and lusts, are <hi>ever dying</hi> to sin and the
world, <hi>Rom. 6. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. They are dead, <hi>quoad seculum,</hi> crucified to
the world, <hi>Gal. 6. 14.</hi> and therefore hated by it,
<hi>John 15. 19.</hi> nothing to be looked for from it, but
<hi>persecution</hi> and tribulation, <hi>John. 16. 33.</hi> as men
have done to the green tree so they will to the dry,
<hi>Luk. 23. 31.</hi> suffering belongs to the essence and
calling of Christians, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 21.</hi> they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
appointed, 1 <hi>Thes. 3. 3.</hi> They are in his sense
properly <hi>Mortui tui,</hi> the Lords dead men; for
worldlings are <hi>not sufferers by calling</hi> and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as true Christians are. They are not in
trouble as other men, <hi>Psalme 73. 5. Job 21.
7—13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. From <hi>Mortui tui,</hi> it proceeds to <hi>Cadaver
meum;</hi> and such they are not onely by dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
after death, <hi>but by condition</hi> before it; used
like a dead <hi>carcasse,</hi> exposed to contempt and
dishonour, as the <hi>refuse and off-scouring of men,</hi>
Lam. 31. 45. 1 Cor. 4. 13. <hi>troden</hi> under foot, <hi>Isa.
63. 18.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 51.</note> had in <hi>derision,</hi> Jer. 20. 8.<note place="margin">Jer. 20. 8.</note> filled with <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
Psal. 123. 3. made <hi>as the ground</hi> and as the
street for proud men to go over, <hi>Isa. 51. 23.</hi> thus
the <hi>righteous is an abomination to the wicked,</hi> they
loath him as a man would do a dead carcasse,
<hi>Prov. 29. 27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. From dishonour they proceed to a kinde
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100393:10"/>
of despaire; They are <hi>Habitatores pulveris,</hi> they
dwell in the <hi>dust,</hi> they are not <hi>onely</hi> dust by <hi>consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
Gen. 3. 19. and by <hi>dissolution,</hi> making the
Grave their House, and their <hi>bed in darknesse,
Job 17. 13.</hi> but further <hi>by estimation,</hi> they judge
<hi>so of themselves,</hi> abhorring themselves, and putting
their mouths in the dust, <hi>Job 42. 6. Lam. 3. 29.</hi> they
are valued <hi>so by others,</hi> Isa. 10. 6. as the mire of
the streets. This is the sad condition of the
Church sometimes in this world under persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and captivity, so they were in <hi>Babylon</hi> as <hi>dead
bones in a grave,</hi> Ezek. 37. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>By all which we learn what to look for in the
world when we give our names to God. The
usage not onely of <hi>strangers</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> but even
of <hi>dead carcasses,</hi> to be buried in contempt and
dishonour. The way to life lies through the
countrey of death, as the way to <hi>Canaan</hi> through
a sea and a wilderness; no scorns, no graves must
deter us from a godly life, if ever we hope for
a blessed resurrection. Neither may we think it
strange when we meet with troubles in the world
which are but the preludes and prefaces unto
death, nor when one evil is over, may we sing
a <hi>requiem</hi> to our souls as if all were passed, but
look for vicissitudes and successions of sorrow,
for <hi>clouds after rain,</hi> till we are landed in the
Countrey of death. And since our tenure in this
world is so obnoxious both to encumbrance and
uncertainty, we should die to the world while we
are in it, as those who are very shortly to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
from it, and having no abiding station here,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100393:11"/>
be careful to look after that <hi>City which hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi>
and so to acquaint our selves before hand
with death by meditation on it, and preparation
for it, that it may not come as a messenger of
wrath, but as an Harbinger of glory, that in our
death we may be <hi>Mortui tui,</hi> The Lords dead
men, and <hi>prisoners of Hope,</hi> the Spirit of Christ
in us being the earnest and seed of a Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto life.</p>
            <p>We have considered the sad condition of the
Church expressed by our Prophet in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical
<hi>Climax,</hi> Dead men, a Carcasse, Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the dust. Let us next take a view of the
mercy of God in her deliverance, a deliverance
not onely commensurate to her troubles, but
victorious over them, <hi>dead</hi> indeed, but she shall
<hi>live; a carcasse,</hi> but she shall <hi>arise; asleep,</hi> but she
shall <hi>awake;</hi> in the <hi>dust,</hi> but she shall <hi>sing.</hi> So
there is mercy fully answerable to the misery,
no temptation without an issue, no calamity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an escape.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Vivent Mortui,</hi> or as others read it, <hi>Vivant.</hi>
True both. They <hi>do live,</hi> They <hi>shall live.</hi> They
have life in death, and that life shall work them
out of death.</p>
            <p>1. They <hi>do live</hi> in death. Wicked men are
<hi>dead while</hi> they <hi>live,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 6. <hi>dead in Law</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sentence of the curse, as <hi>Adam</hi> was legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dead by guilt and obnoxiousness the same day
that he did eat the forbidden fruit. Dead in
<hi>conscience</hi> under the pain of that sentence, and
under the bondage of deserved and denounced
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100393:11"/>
wrath, <hi>Heb. 2. 15. Heb. 10. 27. dead in sin,</hi> under the
power of Lust, <hi>Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 1. Psal. 14. 3.</hi> their <hi>throats
Sepulchres</hi> full of rotten words, <hi>Rom. 3. 13.</hi> their
<hi>hearts Sepulchres</hi> full of unclean affections, <hi>Matth. 23.
27, 28.</hi> their <hi>lives Sepulchres</hi> full of dead works,
<hi>Heb. 6. 1.</hi> But <hi>mortui tui,</hi> the Lords dead men <hi>live</hi>
even in the Kingdome and Country of <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. They live in <hi>praeludiis mortis,</hi> in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of death; in the greatest calamities they
bear up their hearts in <hi>the favour</hi> of God, which is
better then life, <hi>Psal. 63. 3. 2 Cor. 6. 9.</hi> In these
things, <hi>all</hi> these things; we are <hi>Conquerours, more</hi>
then Conquerours, <hi>Rom. 8. 37.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They live in <hi>Regno mortis,</hi> in the Kingdome
and Country of death; when death hath possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, they live still: you are <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>your
life is hid, Col. 3. 3.</hi> The death of a Christian is not
the taking away of life, but the <hi>laying up</hi> of life; as
a Parent takes the Childs money, and keeps it for
him: He that believeth shall live, though he die,
<hi>John 11. 25.</hi> As <hi>Abel</hi> being dead, yet speaketh,
<hi>Heb. 11. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, their <hi>very bodies,</hi> though dead to them, do
<hi>live to God,</hi> for he is the <hi>God of the living, Mat. 22.
32.</hi> therefore the Jews call their burying pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Domus Viventium.</hi> 1. They <hi>live in the Promise</hi>
and Power of God, <hi>Mat. 22. 29.</hi> 2. They live in
<hi>the Life of Christ</hi> their Head; whether we wake or
sleep <hi>we live together with him, 1 Thes. 5. 10.</hi> as
we are risen with him, and sit with him in heaven,
<hi>Col. 3. 1. Eph. 2. 6.</hi> 3. They live in <hi>the Seed of the
Spirit of Holiness,</hi> whose Temples they are, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100393:12"/>
is in them a pledge and seminal virtue of Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Rom. 8. 11.</hi> compared with 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 16. 6. 19.</hi>
In which respect the Apostle compareth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the faithful unto <hi>Seed, I Cor. 15. 42.</hi> to
note, that by the Inhabitation and Sanctification of
the Spirit, there is a <hi>vital virtue</hi> in the body to
spring up and awake again.</p>
            <p>Thus even in the state of death, we have <hi>vitam
Absconditam, Col. 3. 3.</hi> hidden out of our sight and
sense, as <hi>seed</hi> in the Furrow, as a <hi>jewel</hi> in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
as an <hi>Orphans estate</hi> in the hand of his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
hidden with Christ the first fruits, and in
God the Author and Fountain of Life. Thus <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt,</hi>
they do live.</p>
            <p>And further, <hi>vivent,</hi> they shall live; for our life
in Christ is not a <hi>decaying,</hi> but a <hi>growing</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
life, <hi>Joh. 10. 10</hi> therefore it will break
forth into the similitude of Christs glorious Body,
in whom it is hid, as the Corn groweth into the
likeness of that seed wherein it was originally and
virtually contained, <hi>Joh. 12. 24. Col. 3. 4. Phil. 3. 21.</hi>
1 <hi>Joh. 3. 2, 3.</hi> Of <hi>natural life</hi> we cannot say, <hi>I live,</hi>
and <hi>I shall live,</hi> for natural life runs into death, as
<hi>Jordan</hi> into the dead Sea: But of <hi>Christian life</hi> we
may say, <hi>I live, and I shall live;</hi> it is a life which
<hi>runs into life,</hi> though through the way of death; as
the waters of the <hi>Caspian Sea</hi> are said through sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
passages to have communion with the
great Ocean. It <hi>comes from heaven,</hi> Christ the
Fountain and Center of it: and it <hi>goes back unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
As a piece of earth falls to the whole earth, so
every piece of heaven will find the way to its
whole.</p>

2. <hi>Resurgent:</hi> With my dead body they shall
arise, their life shall be given them for their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement:
wicked</hi> men shall <hi>live again,</hi> that they
may <hi>dye again,</hi> and shall rise, <hi>ut lapsu graviore ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi>
that they may be thrown deeper. <hi>Pharoahs But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
and <hi>Baker</hi> came both out of prison, the one to
his <hi>office,</hi> the other to <hi>dishonor,</hi> the one to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,</hi>
the other to be <hi>executed:</hi> So <hi>mortui tui,</hi> and
<hi>mortui seculi,</hi> shall both come out of their graves,
the one from a prison to a <hi>Furnace,</hi> the other from
a prison to a <hi>Palace:</hi> In which respect Believers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are called, <hi>children of the Resurrection, Luke 20. 36.</hi>
It is a Resurrection of life to the one, of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the other, <hi>Joh. 5. 29.</hi> And therefore to
distinguish them from the other, it is added:</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Expergiscimini.</hi> They shall awake as a man
refreshed with sleep, which puts a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ween the deaths and Resurrections of the
godly and the wicked.</p>
            <p>1. The death of the godly is <hi>but asleep:</hi> 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the <hi>seeds of life</hi> abiding in them. A man in
sleep ceaseth from the <hi>acts</hi> of sense, but the <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
he retaineth still: So an holy man, though he
lose in death the <hi>acts of life,</hi> yet the <hi>seed and root</hi>
he hath not lost, he lives to God still.</p>
            <p>2. In regard of his <hi>weariness of the world,</hi> and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of dayes: A man wearied with labour lies
down willingly to rest: <hi>Abraham</hi> d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed <hi>full of dayes,</hi>
he was satiated, and desired no more, <hi>Gen. 25. 8.</hi>
the Apostle had enough of the world, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to <hi>depart, and to be with Christ, Phil. 1. 23.</hi>
whereas a wicked man, how old soever, is not said
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100393:13"/>
to die <hi>full of years,</hi> or satisfied with life: He may
be <hi>loaded,</hi> but not <hi>replenished;</hi> he knows not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is going, and therefore he would fain stay
in the world still.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, Have not wicked men
brought death upon themselves, as <hi>Achitophel, Saul,
Judas,</hi> and godly men been sometimes unwilling
to die, as <hi>Hezekiah? Isai. 38. 1, 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True both, yet neither the one out of the love of
death, nor the other out of love of the world: wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men are impatient of present anguish, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
touching future terrours, and therefore
rush upon the one to avoid the other: But godly
men are weary of the body of sin, and believe the
favour of God, and glory of Christs presence, and
that makes them <hi>desire to depart,</hi> and to be with
him: Nor did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> decline death out of a <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
fear,</hi> being able to plead unto God his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but out o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a desire to live to <hi>compleat the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
of the Church which he had begun, and
that he might have a <hi>Successor</hi> to derive the Line of
the Royal Seed unto.</p>
            <p>So then death to the godly is <hi>but a sleep,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the <hi>rest</hi> it giveth them, <hi>Rev. 14. 13.</hi> from
sins, f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om sorrows, from labours, from enemies, from
temptations, from fear, from evils to come; and
therefore <hi>Job</hi> calls the <hi>grave his bed, Job 17. 13.</hi> and
so the Prophet, <hi>They shall lye down in their beds, Isa.
57. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This awaking makes a great <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the godly and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
the one riseth <hi>refreshed,</hi> as sleep repaireth the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100393:13"/>
decays of Nature, so that a man riseth vigorous
and recruited; therefore the time of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is called the <hi>time of refreshing,</hi> and of <hi>restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things, Acts 3. 19, 21.</hi> The other riseth <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,</hi>
as a man awakened with a <hi>Thunder-clap,</hi>
or whose house is in a <hi>flame</hi> about him; the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes
to <hi>his work,</hi> the other to <hi>his Judgement;</hi> it is
<hi>morning</hi> and everlasting day to the one, it is <hi>horrour
and darkness</hi> to the other; and therefore it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Cantate,</hi> when they awake they shall sing: as
<hi>David</hi> when he awaked, calls on his <hi>Lute and Harp</hi>
to awake with him, <hi>Psal. 57. 8. In their graves,</hi> at
<hi>Bobylon,</hi> they <hi>hung their Harps on the Willows,</hi> no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
then, <hi>Psal. 137. 3.</hi> but they go out of their
graves, as <hi>Israel</hi> out of the Red Sea, with <hi>Victory</hi>
and <hi>Triumph</hi> over Death and Hell, and so shall <hi>sing
the Song of</hi> Moses <hi>and the Lamb. Dust and Ashes,</hi> in
the Scripture phrase, are <hi>ceremonies of mourning,
Job 2. 12. Mic. 1. 10.</hi> but here they who inhabit
the dust, are called upon to <hi>put off their prison gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and to shake themselves from their dust,
<hi>Isai. 52. 1, 2.</hi> to awake unto singing and triumph;
when they awake they are satisfied, <hi>Psalm 17. 15.</hi>
Thus we see the deliverance of the Church, is fully
as large as their distress. From all which we learn:</p>
            <p>1. The true cause why <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>calamities</hi>
leading thereunto, do still remain after Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over them; to wit: 1 To <hi>exercise our Faith
and Hope</hi> in Gods Promises, for the <hi>righteous hath
hope in his death, Prov. 14. 32.</hi> 2 to <hi>conform</hi> us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Christ,</hi> as well in the way to life, as in the end,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100393:14"/>
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 13. 3</hi> To <hi>wean us</hi> from the love of the
world, which both useth us ill, and passeth away,
1 <hi>John 2. 15, 17. John 15. 19. 4</hi> To encrease our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of glory,</hi> that we may with good <hi>Jacob, wait for
the salvation of the Lord, Gen. 49. 18. 5</hi> To <hi>commend
our love to Christ,</hi> which makes us willing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that we may go to him, as a stone is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be broken in moving towards its center,
<hi>Phil. 1. 23. 6</hi> To <hi>commend the power of Righteousness,</hi>
which is not afraid of the King of Terrours, nor
to go to Christ, though there be a <hi>Lion in the way,
Act. 21. 13. Rom. 8. 35-37. 7</hi> To shew the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and <hi>virtue of the Death of Christ,</hi> which makes
a <hi>Bed</hi> of a Grave, an <hi>Antidote</hi> of a Serpent; hath
brought <hi>sweetness out of the strong,</hi> and meat out of
the Eater; hath <hi>bound Death</hi> with her own Grave
Cloaths, and set a <hi>Guard</hi> of Angels over the bodies
of the Saints; hath <hi>rolled</hi> away the heavy st<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne
from the graves of his people, and made it a place
of ease and refreshment; hath made our <hi>Graves
like a Garden,</hi> that our bodies like herbs might
spring out again; hath slain Death as <hi>Benaiah</hi> did
the Lion, in its own pit, and hath made it sick of the
bodies of his people, and <hi>travel in pain</hi> like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with-Child, till at last it be delivered of
them.</p>
            <p>2 We should by Faith and Hope in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
comfort our selves against all other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and incourage our selves against <hi>Death</hi> it self,
which is but a <hi>depositary,</hi> and shall be an <hi>accomptant</hi>
unto God for every member of his Church, though
it hath swallowed them, as the Whale did <hi>Jonah,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100393:14"/>
it shall cast them up again: though to the wicked
it be a <hi>Trap-door</hi> which lets them down to Hell, and
so keeps them in the midst of laughter <hi>sorrowful,</hi>
in the midst of plenty and pleasures <hi>fearful,</hi> in the
midst of hope <hi>doubtful,</hi> when they remember the
dayes of <hi>darkness,</hi> for they be many, and the dayes
of <hi>torment,</hi> for they be more: Yet to Believers it
is <hi>a Bed, a Rest, a Sleep a Friend,</hi> when it shuts the
door between us and the world, it opens a door
between us and heaven: Pardon of sin, and peace
with God, makes us bold to play with the hole of
the <hi>Asp</hi> and with the <hi>Cocatrice</hi> den, <hi>Isai. 11. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have thus far considered the <hi>Church</hi> as
dead, buried in the dust; as quickned, raised, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened,
delighted in God: We are</p>
            <p>III. To take a view of the <hi>causes</hi> of this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which are 1 <hi>Dispositive,</hi> in regard of the
<hi>Subject. 2 Efficient,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>dispositive</hi> causes qualifying the Subject for
this deliverance, are in the two Pronowns, <hi>Tui,</hi> and
<hi>Meum:</hi> thy dead men: my dead body. These
mercies are not promised generally unto <hi>all dead
men,</hi> but unto the <hi>Lords dead men,</hi> whom he hath
chosen and formed for himself, <hi>Psalm 4. 3. Isai. 43.
21.</hi> If he say thou art mine, neither water, nor
fire, nor East, West, North, South, <hi>Egypt, Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
nor any other Enemy shall keep us back from
him, <hi>Isai. 43. 1, 2, 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. His we must be, if we will not be <hi>lost</hi> in death.
1 <hi>His</hi> by <hi>Consanguinity;</hi> for Christ having taken
upon him the Nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and so vouchsafing to call Believers <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100393:15"/>
Heb. 2. 11.</hi> by that means God is become our
<hi>Father, John 20. 17.</hi> and therefore in the deluge of
desolation, he will bring us into his <hi>Ark,</hi> as
<hi>Rahab,</hi> when she was delivered her self, called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
her Kindred to share therein with her, <hi>Josh.
6. 23.</hi> 2 His by <hi>purchase;</hi> there was a dear and
precious price paid for us, we were bought with
no less a price then the <hi>Blood of God, Act. 20. 28.</hi>
and therefore he will vindicate his Claim and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
unto us; no man will lose what he hath paid
for, if he be able to rescue and recover it out of the
hands of unjust possessors: Christ having bought
us, Death shall not with-hold us from him, the
<hi>Redeemed</hi> of the Lord shall <hi>return, Isai. 51. 11.
3</hi> His by <hi>Covenant;</hi> thy <hi>Maker</hi> is thy <hi>Husband,
Isai. 54. 5.</hi> and being married to her, he will make
her return, <hi>Jer. 3. 14.</hi> Any loving Husband would
fetch back his Wife from the Dead, if he were
able to do it. 4 His by <hi>Dedication,</hi> Inhabitation,
Consecration, <hi>as a Temple, 1 Cor. 6. 19.</hi> If Death
destroy his Temple, he will raise it up again, <hi>John
2. 19.</hi> The Spirit that dwelleth in us, will quicken
our mortal bodies, <hi>Rom. 8. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>His dead men</hi> we must be; we must <hi>dye to sin,</hi>
because he died for it; we must kill that which
killed Christ; we must be dead unto sin, if we
will live unto God, <hi>Rom. 6. 11.</hi> His <hi>dead</hi> men, his
<hi>perseverantly</hi> until death, <hi>Rev. 2. 10.</hi> His <hi>patiently,</hi>
even unto death, <hi>Heb. 10. 36.</hi> Nothing must sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
us from his love. His <hi>ultimately,</hi> whether we
live, we must <hi>live to the Lord,</hi> or whether we die,
we must <hi>die unto the Lord, Rom. 14. 8.</hi> that he may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100393:15"/>
be <hi>glorified in our mortal bodies by life, or by death,
Phil. 1. 20.</hi> And being thus <hi>His dead men:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 We are sure Death comes not but with a
<hi>Commission</hi> from him, his <hi>providence</hi> sendeth it, his
<hi>power</hi> restraineth it, his <hi>love</hi> and wisdome guideth
and ordereth it to our good; it is <hi>his Officer,</hi> it shall
touch us no further then he gives it authority, <hi>John
19. 11.</hi> He hath muzled and chained it; he saith to
Death, as to Satan concerning <hi>Job,</hi> He is in thine
hand, but <hi>touch not his Soul,</hi> meddle not with his
Conscience, or with his Peace; and for his <hi>Body,</hi>
thou shalt but keep it, thou shalt not destroy it,
thou shalt be <hi>accomptable</hi> for every piece of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>2. Being <hi>His dead men,</hi> he hath alwayes an <hi>eye of
compassion</hi> upon us, our sorrows and sufferings he
esteems his own, <hi>Isai. 63. 9. Col. 1. 24. Act. 9. 4.</hi>
and if they be his, he will certainly save us from
them, and conquer them as well in us, as <hi>in himself,</hi>
for <hi>unto him belong the issues from death, Psalm
68 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 As ever therefore we look for blessedness in
death, or deliverance from it, we must labour both
living and dying, to <hi>be the Lords,</hi> that he may own
us when the world hath cast us out, that we may
be precious in his sight, when we are <hi>loathsome</hi> to
the world; <hi>jewels</hi> to him, when <hi>dung</hi> to men, that
our <hi>Graves</hi> may not only have <hi>worms</hi> in them to
consume us, but <hi>Angels</hi> to guard us. If we die in
our sins, and be <hi>Satans</hi> dead men, we shall never
rise with comfort, <hi>rottenness</hi> will feed not on our
<hi>bodies</hi> only, but on our <hi>names,</hi> we shall have worms
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100393:16"/>
in our <hi>consciences,</hi> as well as in our <hi>carcasses:</hi> But
when we can say, <hi>Lord, I am thine, thou art mine,</hi> we
may thence infer, <hi>we shall not dye, Hab. 1. 12.</hi> We
have a life which death cannot reach, <hi>Col. 3. 3.</hi>
this therefore must be our special care, to be <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui
tui,</hi> to dye to the Lord, <hi>to fall asleep in Christ,
1 Cor. 15. 18.</hi> that when he comes we may be
found in him, and so may be ever with him, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi>
4. 17. This is the first qualification of the Subject
for deliverance, to be <hi>Mortui tui,</hi> the Lords dead
men.</p>
            <p>2. The next is, that it is <hi>Cadaver meum: 1 Mine,</hi>
as the words of <hi>Christ,</hi> being my body, they shall
surely rise: 2 <hi>Mine,</hi> as the words of the <hi>Church;</hi>
Every member of my dead body shall rise in the
unity of the whole.</p>
            <p>1 Then my <hi>dead body</hi> being members of an Head
that lives for ever, and hath the Keys of Hell and
the Grave, shall certainly rise: <hi>His life</hi> is the
Foundation of ours, <hi>Because I live, ye shall live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
John 14. 19.</hi> If death had held him, it would
much more have held us: But because in him the
<hi>Mercies of</hi> David <hi>are sure,</hi> therefore his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is an assurance of ours, <hi>Act. 13. 34.</hi> Christ
will not be <hi>incompleat,</hi> and the Church is <hi>his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Eph. 1. 23.</hi> The feet under water are safe,
when the Head is above it: Christ is said to be
the <hi>first that rose from the dead, Act. 26. 23.</hi> the first
<hi>begotten,</hi> the first <hi>born</hi> from the dead, <hi>Rev. 1. 5. Col.
1. 18.</hi> For though some were raised <hi>before him,</hi> yet
not <hi>without him,</hi> but by the Fellowship of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
As though light rise before the Sun,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100393:16"/>
yet it doth not rise but from the Sun. The Mace
goes before the Magistrate, but it doth so only in
attendance upon him: He the <hi>only Conquerour</hi> of
Death; and as the first fruits did sanctifie the
whole Mass, <hi>Rom. 11. 16.</hi> so Christ by his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
did <hi>consecrate</hi> all such as dye in the Lord, to
be a kind of <hi>first fruits,</hi> and <hi>first born, Jam. 1. 18.
Heb. 12. 23.</hi> and therefore it is said, that they <hi>shall
rise first, 1 Thes. 4. 16.</hi> His Resurrection is unto all
his members</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Arrha, a pledge</hi> and earnest of theirs; He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
paid our debt, death cannot detain us in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it: His Resurrection hath <hi>justified</hi> us against
the <hi>claim of death,</hi> and will <hi>glorifie</hi> us against the
<hi>power of death:</hi> What he did purchase by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his death, is <hi>made applicable</hi> to us by the
power of his Resurrection, <hi>Rom. 8. 34.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Exemplar;</hi> His the <hi>pattern</hi> of ours: He taken
not only from <hi>prison,</hi> but from <hi>judgement,</hi> death had
no more to do with him, <hi>Isal. 53. 8. Rom. 6. 9.</hi> In
like manner we shall <hi>rise Victors</hi> over death, never
any more to be subject unto it: This the Apostle
calleth the <hi>Image</hi> of the Heavenly <hi>Adam, 1 Cor. 15.
49. Phil. 3. 21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 <hi>Primitiae:</hi> The <hi>beginning</hi> of the future Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
for he rose not barely in a personal, but
in <hi>a publick capacity,</hi> though it were a damnable
<hi>Heresie</hi> of <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> that the Resurrection <hi>was past,
2 Tim. 2. 18.</hi> yet it is a truth to say, <hi>that it is begun.</hi>
He first, then we at his coming, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 23. By
what is <hi>past in the Head,</hi> we are assured of what is
<hi>expected</hi> in his Members.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100393:17"/>
2 All the particular Members of the Church
shall rise <hi>in the unity of one body,</hi> as mystically joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto one Head, and as <hi>one Family, Eph. 3. 15.</hi> and
<hi>all one in Christ, Gal. 3. 28.</hi> not barely the persons
singly considered, but as a Church and Body shall
rise.</p>
            <p>1 Then be careful to be found in <hi>Christ</hi> at his
coming; for though all men shall rise, yet with a
great difference. The wicked <hi>potestate judicis,</hi> as
malefactors are brought out of prison to the Judge
to be condemned. The godly <hi>virtute capitis,</hi> the
life of Christ shall be manifested in their bodies,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
            <p>2 A Christian must not onely believe, <hi>Thy dead</hi>
men shall live, but furth 1 <hi>My dead</hi> body shall
arise too. Herein is the <hi>Life of Faith</hi> in bringing
down <hi>general promises</hi> to our <hi>own particular cases,</hi>
interests and comforts, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13, 14. Joh. 20. 28.
Gal. 2. 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Since we shall all rise as one, we should
<hi>all live as one.</hi> As we have <hi>all one Head, one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
one Faith, one Hope,</hi> one Inheritance, one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
salvation,</hi> so we should have <hi>one heart, and one
soul,</hi> Act. 4. 32. Love as brethren, have the same
care as fellow members one of another, <hi>weep with
them that weep, rejoyce with them that rejoyce,</hi>
That our life <hi>of faith</hi> on earth may in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
expresse our life <hi>of vision</hi> in heaven, and
since we shall agree there, not to fall our in our
way thither, <hi>Eph. 4 1. 6. Phil. 2. 1, 2, 3. Col. 3. 12,
13.</hi> And thus much of the <hi>dispositive</hi> cause, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
the <hi>subject</hi> of this deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100393:17"/>
2 The Efficient follows. The word and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, being like <hi>dew</hi> to the tender <hi>herbs,</hi>
to revive them when they seem dead. Whence we
observe,</p>
            <p>1 The <hi>facility</hi> of the last <hi>Resurrection</hi> in regard
of God, to whom miracles are as easie as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
operations, A <hi>Miracle</hi> being nothing but a
<hi>new creation.</hi> It is as impossible to us to cause raine
as to raise a dead body. He therefore who we see
doth cause the one, we may believe on his word
that he will the other. We finde <hi>Raine and
dew</hi> used as Arguments to prove the <hi>omnipotency</hi>
and greatnesse of God, <hi>Psal. 147. 5, 8. Job 5. 9, 10.
ler. 14. 22. Zach. 10. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this teacheth us a very useful point, to
<hi>observe the wisdome</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of heaven and <hi>course of nature,</hi> and
from thence to argue for the setling of our <hi>faith</hi>
in such things as exceed the course of nature;
for there is no lesse omnipotency required to
govern <hi>natural causes,</hi> then to work those that are
<hi>supernatural.</hi> He therfore that keepeth his Law, and
sheweth his power in the one, will do so in the
other too. The Lord strengthneth our faith by
the consideration of <hi>natural</hi> things, the bow in the
clouds, <hi>Gen. 9. 12. Isa. 54. 9.</hi> the stability of the
mountains, <hi>Isa. 54. 10.</hi> the multitude of starres,
<hi>Gen. 15. 5.</hi> the highth of the heavens, <hi>Psal. 103 11.</hi>
the beauty of the Lilies, <hi>Mat. 6. 28, 30.</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the Moon and Stars, <hi>ler. 31. 35, 36.</hi>
the Covenant of Day and Night, <hi>ler. 33. 20, 21.</hi>
Thus the Lord teacheth us to make use of the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100393:18"/>
of nature to confirme our faith in him.</p>
            <p>I go quietly to bed and am not frighted with
the horror of the night. I know the day will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
It is <hi>Gods Covenant.</hi> I put my seed into the
ground in the Winter, I know it will grow
into an harvest, the Sun will return, it is <hi>Gods
Covenant.</hi> And why should I not trust him, as well
in his <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> as of <hi>Nature?</hi> why
should I not believe that that power which
quickens <hi>dead corn,</hi> can quicken <hi>dead men,</hi> and can
provide as well for my <hi>salvation</hi> as for my <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, all unbelief doth secretly question
the <hi>power</hi> of God. Things past and present all
can believe, because they are seen. But things
<hi>promised,</hi> when they pose reason, and transcend
the course of natural causes, and the contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and projections which we can forecast, we
many times stagger and falter about. <hi>Israel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
what God had done, and that omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently,
<hi>He smote the rock and the waters gushed out,</hi>
and yet in the same breath they question his <hi>power,
can he furnish a Table in the wildernesse? can he
give bread also and provide flesh for his people?</hi>
Psalm 78. 19, 20, 22. <hi>Moses</hi> himself stagger'd,
when the Lord made a promise which seemed
to exceed the power of ordinary causes, <hi>Numb.
11. 21, 22.</hi> And therefore when God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the faith of his servants, he draweth them
off from viewing the greatnesse and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the promises in themselves, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his <hi>power.</hi> Is <hi>any thing too hard for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100393:18"/>
the Lord?</hi> Gen. 18. 14. <hi>I am the Lord, the God of
all flesh, is there any thing too hard for me?</hi> Jer.
32. 27. <hi>If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant
of this people in these dayes, should it also be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in mine eyes, saith the Lord of Hosts?</hi> Zach. 8. 6.
And therefore in all cases of difficulty, when sense
and reason, flesh and blood, dictate nothing but
despaire, we should by faith look up to the <hi>truth</hi>
of God promising, and to the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>name</hi>
of God giving being to his promis<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, whose <hi>ways
are higher then our wayes, and his thoughts then our
thoughts,</hi> Isa. 55. 8. 9. So did <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> 2 Chron.
20. 12. so <hi>David,</hi> I Sam. 30. 6. so the Prophet,
<hi>Ezek. 37. 3.</hi> so <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4. 19, 20, 21. so <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Luke 5. 5. so we should all do when we walk
in darkness and have no light, <hi>still trust in the
Name of the Lord, and stay upon our God,</hi> Isa.
50. 10.</p>
            <p>2 We hence learn the <hi>Original of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
it is an <hi>Heavenly</hi> work, as <hi>dew</hi> which
comes from heaven to revive the grass. The
Lord resolves the lineage and <hi>genealogie</hi> of corn
into Heaven, <hi>Hos. 2. 21.</hi> takes it to himself to be
the <hi>father of the dew,</hi> Job 38. 28. It comes from
him whose body did shed drops of heavenly dew
in the garden, and by them did slay death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
he herbs of the grave.</p>
            <p>We must labour therefore by an heavenly
conversation to have our <hi>Bodies Temples of the holy</hi>
Spirit, that this <hi>Heavenly vertue,</hi> when it hath
drawn us out of our graves, may then <hi>carry us
to Heaven;</hi> for as that <hi>which is earthly,</hi> when it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100393:19"/>
is out of its place, never leaves descending till
<hi>it goes to Earth:</hi> so that which is <hi>Heavenly,</hi>
will never cease rising till it get to Heaven.
<hi>Earthly vapors may be drawn up,</hi> but they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in rain and winde. Wicked men, though
raised, will fall again. Any thing <hi>of heaven</hi> will
go <hi>to heaven,</hi> any thing <hi>of Christ</hi> will <hi>go to
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this dear and worthy Lay, though
my custom be to be very sparing in Funeral Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
yet many things were in her so remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the mentioning of them cannot but tend to
the Edification of others.</p>
            <p>I shall not mention her meere <hi>Exterrals.</hi> The
worth, credit and dignity of her family. The
gentlenesse and sweetnesse of her <hi>disposition,</hi> and
all amiable accomplishments which rendred her
lovely to those that knew her; nor set forth the
proportion between her and the present Text.
I shall onely name such things as commended
her to God as well as to men.</p>
            <p>She looked after <hi>Heaven</hi> very <hi>young:</hi> would
frequently blesse God for the Religious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which she had under her parents. She was
even then assaulted with <hi>Temptations</hi> unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme,
and to think that there was no God.
But took the best course to repell and resist
them, that the most experienced Christian could
have directed her unto. Immediately betaking
her self by <hi>prayer</hi> unto that God whom she was
tempted to deny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100393:19"/>
She was a woman <hi>mighty in the Scriptures,</hi>
read them over once a year, and searched after
the sense of difficult places out of the several
Annotations before her. She was as it were a
<hi>Concordance</hi> directing usually to the Book and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
where any place of Scripture mentioned in
discourse, was to be found.</p>
            <p>She was constant in reading <hi>substantial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,</hi>
of <hi>dogmatical</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Divinity, and
by that means grew greatly acquainted with the
whole Body of wholsome doctrine.</p>
            <p>She was unweariedly <hi>constant</hi> in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>private duties,</hi> in so much that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believed by him, who had best reason to
know it, that for twelve years together she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intermitted her morning and evening addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
unto the Throne of Grace. When she was
suddenly surprized with the pangs of this last
child, she ran into her closet to be first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
of her prayer, and to poure out her
soul to God, before she was delivered of her
child.</p>
            <p>She had a singular delight in the <hi>publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
and was a most constant frequenter of
them, with very serious and devout attention,
calling her memory to an account when she
came home, and if any particular slipt from her
forgotten, she would enquire of her husband in bed
to recover it for her.</p>
            <p>She left behind her in her closet a paper book,
wherein with her own hand she had collected
divers <hi>general Directions</hi> for an holy spending
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100393:21"/>
of the day, with several particular meanes
for the faithful observance of those General
Rules.</p>
            <p>She highly honoured <hi>Holinesse</hi> in the poorest
and meanest persons, and would frequently with
some decent and modest excuse get off from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
&amp; impertinent discourse, that she might
have her fill of more edifying conference with
such, in whom she had learned of <hi>David,</hi> to place
her delight.</p>
            <p>For divers months before her death she was
wonderfully improved heavenward, as those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her observed, not regarding the world,
nor letting any vain word drop from her; and
her <hi>countenance</hi> many times after her coming out
of her closet, seemed to have strange impressions
of her conversing with God shining in it, as
some conversant with her have professed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
            <p>She was greatly adorned with <hi>Meeknesse, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi>
and <hi>Humility,</hi> which are graces in the sight
of God of great price. When one wish'd her
<hi>ioy</hi> with the <hi>Honour</hi> lately come to her, she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That there was a greater Honour
which she looked after, which would bring with
it more solid joy.</p>
            <p>She alwayes expressed much <hi>Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi>
to her <hi>parents,</hi> in all comely and dutiful
comportment towards them, which much endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them unto her.</p>
            <p>Full of <hi>conjugal affection</hi> to her dear husband
revoking with an ingenuous Retraction any word
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100393:21"/>
which might fall from her, which she judged
lesse becoming that Honour and Reverence which
she did bear to him. When he was ingaged upon
publick concernments, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when he cross'd the seas to wait on his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty, she daily put up such ardent
and heavenly petitions unto God for him, as
caused those about her to conclude it impossible
that the husband of so many prayers and teares
should meet with any miscarriage. Wonderful
watchful over his <hi>Bodily health;</hi> and spying out
distempers in him before he discovered them
himself. Earnestly desiring what is now come
to passe, that he might survive her, that she
might never know the wound of a deceased
Husband.</p>
            <p>She had a more then ordinary care in the <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her children,</hi> holding them close to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and committing to memory both Scripture
and Catechisme, wherein by her diligence they
made a very strange progress, a pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof to speak nothing of her children
yet living, was her eldest son, who went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in his childhood, about the age of five or six
years, of whose wonderful proficiency in the
knowledge of God, an exact account is given by
a grave and godly Divine in the printed Sermon,
which he preached at his Funeral.</p>
            <p>She was very affable and kind to her <hi>servants,</hi>
specially encouraging them unto <hi>holy duties,</hi> who
have professed themselves very much benefited in
their spiritual concernments by the discourses
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100393:22"/>
which she hath had with them.</p>
            <p>She was very <hi>charitable</hi> and ready to do good
to poor distressed persons, specially those of the
<hi>houshold of faith,</hi> visiting, edifying, and comforting
them, and with her <hi>liberality</hi> relieving their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
acknowledging Gods free and rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in allowing her a plentiful portion of outward
blessings, and that she was not in the low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those whom her charity relieved:</p>
            <p>In her sicknesse and extremities of travel and
other pains, she earnestly <hi>pleaded Gods promises</hi>
of <hi>healing,</hi> of <hi>easing,</hi> of refreshing those that were
weak and heavy laden, acknowledging her self
so to be, not in body onely, but in soul too, and
was full of holy and servent ejaculations.</p>
            <p>Yea, when the disease affected her <hi>head,</hi> and
disturbed her <hi>expressions,</hi> yet even then her
speeches had still a <hi>tincture of Holinesse,</hi> and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
of that spirit wherewith her heart was
seasoned.</p>
            <p>She advised those about her to set about the
great and one necessary work of their <hi>souls</hi> while
they were in <hi>health,</hi> assuring them that in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
all the strength they had would be taken up
about that.</p>
            <p>She desired her <hi>husband</hi> to read to her in her
sicknesse <hi>Mistris Moores</hi> Evidences for salvation,
set forth in a Sermon preached by a Reverend
Divine at her Funeral, meditating with much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
upon them.</p>
            <p>And when some <hi>cloud</hi> overcast her soul, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
her husband to pray with her, and seconded
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100393:22"/>
him with much enlargement of heart, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God for the recovery of light again.</p>
            <p>Thus lived and died this excellent Lady, a
worthy patterne for the great ones of her sex to
imitate. Such works will follow them into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
world, where none of the vanities of this,
no Pleasures, no Pomp, no Luxury, no Bravery,
no Balls, no Enterludes, no Amorous or Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
discourses, or other like Impertinencies
of the world will have any admittance. The
more seriously you walk with God, and <hi>plie</hi>
the concernments of your immortal souls, living
as those that <hi>resolve to be saved,</hi> the greater
will be your treasure of <hi>comfort</hi> in your death,
and of <hi>glory</hi> in another life; whereas all your
other delights and experiments for content will
expire, and give up the Ghost in <hi>Solomons va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and vexation of Spirit.</hi> The Lord make us
all wise unto salvation.</p>
