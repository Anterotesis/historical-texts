            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here present thee with a Book written some years since by that great and Reverend Bishop <hi>Tho. Morton,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> in the defence of that Order he bore, and for which he suffered so great indignities. And as it was his Honour to suffer in so good a Cause, so it was his great Contentment and satisfaction when he came to the end of his long race, that he kept a good Conscience, though he lost all this world afforded him for it.</p>
            <p>It would be very superfluous in this place to write an <hi>Encomium</hi> of this Great Prelate, who is farr beyond what I can do; and is already well performed by that excellent person Dr. <hi>Berwick</hi> late Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who was well acquainted with him many years, and
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:96777:6"/>
had the happiness once to be his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Chaplain: I only think fit to say this of him, that he was an Antient Bishop, and had all the qualifications fit for his Order, either to Adorn or Govern a Church: but above all, he was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for his invincible Patience under so many violent Persecutions, and almost necessities; alwayes rejoycing in his Losses, and protesting he thought himself richer with nothing and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, than those were who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his goodly Bishoprick. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he that considers the excellency of this Prelate, with the rest of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who with him underwent the fiery Trial, will conclude as <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth of the first Persecution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,<note place="margin">Apol. cap. 5.</note>

            <p>I must not omit, among the various Qualities of this <hi>great Man,</hi> to tell thee, he was <hi>44</hi> years a Bishop, a thing so extraordinary, that since the first Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christianity, and consequently of Bishops in this Island,<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Saviour, but one exceeded him; and he came not to these Dignities <hi>per Saltum,</hi> but passed through all other inferiour Charges before he arrived at the height. And one thing is considerable in his Translation to <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> that King <hi>James</hi> was pleased to do it at the particular motion of that great Prelate Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who never was known to move the King for the Preferment of any before.</p>
            <p>How excellent he was in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, his manifold Writings against the Papists have given the World sufficient testimony; and in this he went so high, that if he believed not the Pope to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> he thought him very like him. And yet there was never any who more approved of the antient Customs of the Catholique Church, than himself: And of this I shall give you this particular instance. For that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Bowing to the Lords Table at the first entrance into the Church, he did not only commend by his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but publickly declared in a Letter he wrote to St. <hi>John's</hi> Colledge, where he had been Fellow, in behalf of a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his, Mr. <hi>Low,</hi> for whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired

            <p>I have before told you how great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice this worthy Prelate did in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies against the Papists: This was not all the work that lay on his
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:96777:9"/>
shoulders: for he no sooner came to the Office of a Bishop, but he met with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of Adversary, who began then to question the Authority of the Church in her ordaining decent Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in her service. And when he found that a private Conference with these sort of men did little prevail, he then published his <hi>Defence of the Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Ceremonies;</hi> a discourse so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, that it must satisfie any person that is governed by reason, and not by phansie and affection. But as these men began then to undermine the Out-works (as I may so call them) of Episcopal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: so this great man lived to see the whole Hierarchy by them destroyed, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted down, Root and Branch, and that as Popish and Antichristian; to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of all Mankind, the Wonder of the Reformed Church, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Triumph of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conclave, And were it not that those years so late past were perfectly a time of Paradoxes, what wise man could imagine that they and their Order should be counted Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, who were the greatest opposers of it, who had writ so many unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Volumns against it; and who had
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:96777:10"/>
by divers of their Martyrdom in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days asserted the Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctrine, against the Corruptions and Novelties of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>This was the occasion which put this Learned Bishop to write this ensuing Tract, which when he had first done, he communicated it to the Most Reverend Father in God <hi>James Usher</hi> Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Armagh;</hi> and it did so satisfie that Learned Primate, that he put it forth with some Discourses of his own, without our Bishops Name or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though in the Codicel annexed to our Bishops Will, 'tis owned by him for his. But afterwards when the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was hotly pressed, and a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to forein Reformed Churches pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, our Bishop renewed his former Discourse, made several additions to it; and where he found it necessary, took occasion to answer both <hi>Salmasius</hi> and <hi>Blondel,</hi> and so it swelled to the Volume it now is. This was by his Lordship com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my charge, either to publish, or not, as I thought fit. And truly I had once determined still to have kept it by me, hoping that the wonderful Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both of our King and Church
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:96777:10"/>
would have made all Disourses of this Nature unnecessary: but since it hath pleased Almighty God to suffer these <hi>Troublers of Israel</hi> still to continue amongst us their disturbances and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, I thought it a du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I owed to the Memory of this <hi>Blessed Bishop</hi> to publish this Discourse; which I did not doubt, but might do God and his Church some service. But before I would attempt so great a Work, I communicated both my Design and Book to the Most Reverend Father in God <hi>Gilbert</hi> Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was pleased not only to approve the Work, but command the speedy publishing of it.</p>
            <p>This immediately put me upon the Examination of the several Quotations I found in it, having most of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by me, fearing that either through the mistake of his Lordships hand, which was not very easie to be read, or the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Transcribers, some Errours might creep in the places cited; and I dare assure the Reader, that for all the Works which I have by me, and I want but few, they are exactly true.</p>
            <p>The Method used in this Discourse
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:96777:11"/>
is a way our Bishop had been very suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful against the Papists, and I hope may prove so against our Adversaries of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind; which is the Testimony of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines in the Churches beyond the Seas to our Episcopal Government, which they do not only commend, but admire and wish for. Nay, divers ef them expound those very Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which are urged for Bishops, as we do; so that if our Dissenters will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any sort of men but themselves, they must be convinced with this kind of Argument.</p>
            <p>It seems to me, I confess, extreamly strange, that in these last and worst times some men should so applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their own phansies, as to condemn what went before them even in the most pure Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>I find not in all my little reading any that set himself against that Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der till <hi>Aerius,</hi>

And truly
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:96777:11"/>
I could wish secular Interest, such as, want of a Bishoprick, Applause with a Party, self-justification in former mistakes, and an unwillingness to let the world know they were formerly deceived, did not with-hold many amongst us from doing that, which, I doubt not, they are more than sufficiently convinced they ought to do. And I do heartily wish, since Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is the thing pretended, that they gave some assurance 'twas Conscience and not Interest prevailed with them by their peaceable Passive Obedience to our Laws, and not to fill our streets with their unreasonable complaints against our Government and Governours, and still to seduce a sort of empty people of great Faith and little Sense, who are in the right only because they are sure they are in the right.</p>

               </note> he gives no other Title but <hi>Nebulo in Anglia,</hi> shewing neither respect to the Learning, nor to the quality of the Doctor, who as he confessed, was Chaplain to his late Majesty.

But here, I would ask any impartial Reader, whether from this place, he hath colour of Reason to imagin D. <hi>Blondells</hi> Proposition? Was it possible that all the world could in a moment alter the Government establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the Apostles, and that without the contradiction or repining of any in the Church to the Contrary? Was it possible for a Council to do this, and no footsteps remain of this decree? Nay, were all those Holy Martyrs the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Successors, unto whose mission God gave daily Testimony by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful miracles they did, seduced by a lying Spirit, to impose upon all Christians a Yoke, as some call, Antichristian? Certainly he who will allow such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Fancy hath a Faith to believe Impossibilities.</p>
            <p>I might say a great deal more upon this subject, but that was to forestal the ensuing Discourse, which will more

been so advanced by a learned man, that he saith the Magistrate is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judg of what Religion his Subjects must be on, that he is the only infallible Judg of Controversie and Scripture; and that he that is a Subject to the Great Turk, and follows the Religion of Mahomet and dies for that Faith, is as much nay more a Martyr than the Primitive Christians were in the first ten Persecutions. And it is to me no wonder at all that this Opinion hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it many Followers: For besides that this increaseth the Civil Magistrates Jurisdiction; (Dominion is a thing all mankind contend for) and so cannot much offend the best Supreme Governour, since 'tis an errour of a good meaning to teach Subjects obedience: Yet it carries along with it this advantage, that it enables the Embracers of it to swim with every stream, and so finds them a Religious Expedient to consult their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interest and Advantage, let the world turn upside down.

yet the Apostles, who were guided by an Infallible Spirit, setled Episcopacy in them all: There was not in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy Episcopacy and in a Republick Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, but one and the same in both. And this is matter of Fact and hath greater Authority to attest it, than any humane story of that Antiquity, which all mankind admits for Truth. And for to affirm, that, though this be true this Government is alterable, if the Magistrate judg it not so conducing to Piety as another he sets up: What is it but to say, that God did not foresee what contingencies would fall out in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages; and that the Apostles did not know what would advance true Religion and Piety in succeeding Ages, so well as Magistrates that follow, who are easily blinded and deceived, when it conduceth to their Temporal Interest? But if we must fansy nothing to have a lasting Reason, but what we judg to have so; I doubt this Atheistical Age will quickly lay aside all Institutions of Christ, by judging them (as some openly do of all Religion) not to be of a lasting necessity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:96777:17"/>Besides, <hi>he that shall affirm that nothing can be a Medium to bind the Consciences of men as of Divine right unalterably, but what is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Divine Testimony</hi> in some sense speaks true; but if this be included in the assertion, that this must be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every capacity, that is obliged to obey this divine Right, 'tis false. For upon that account the Scripture it self should not bind those, who have not understanding enough to know how they are admitted as such. For to say the Scripture is the word of God, because my Conscience, which in plain English is nothing but my Opinion, tells me so, is no better an Argument than every <hi>Turc</hi> hath for his Alcoran. But if there is a necessity to prove the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be Divine, (viz. the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these books by the Catholick Church)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he who hath not sense nor Learning enough to find out the truth of this, must either admit the Scripture of divine Authority, when the reason why it is so is not obvious to his understanding, or else all illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate people are not obliged to believe the truth of its Doctrine, and obey it.
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:96777:17"/>
Now let us apply this to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If the same Authority which tells us, these books are Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture, tells us withall that the very Apostles the Penmen of the New Testament did settle such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and if we find the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Age practiced it; allow it to be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious in Scripture, (which certainly it is not) yet is not there as sufficient as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, that that Government was settled by the Apostles, and so in some sense of Divine Right, and so unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as we have to admit for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Revelation or any other book that ever was questioned? Now for to affirm, <hi>that Antiquity is not a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for our assent, unless we have a full assurance that the succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages did not vary from what the Apostles delivered, or that they could not mistake in the delivery:</hi> What is it but to say we must have greater Authority for matter of Fact than what a fact can have? and doth not this Opinion destroy the Authority of Scripture totally? For if the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches delivery of such books as the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apostles be not sufficient
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:96777:18"/>
for a rational man to ground his assent, that these books were their writings, and so Divine, unless we have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that she could not mistake in the delivery of those books; we must either believe the Church incapable of Errour in the delivery of Scripture, or else we have no assurance to ground our Assent. Now to believe a Church incapable of Errour savours little of Reason, and to believe her only incapable in the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Scripture savours much of Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But if we must understand the Church (for by Church here I mean the Governours of it) to be a wise, sober body of pious and rational men, and so by consequence that they would receive no books, as the writings of inspired men, but such of whose Authentickness they had rational Grounds (as perhaps the very authentique Letters under the Apostles own hands, which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> mentions, or some other good Authority) And if this be sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to gain our assent:<note place="margin">De Praescrip. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:96777:18"/>But <hi>if the Apostolical practice be sufficiently attested, then to affirm, 'tis not enough to bind continually, unless it be known to be God's mind it should do so,</hi> is either to say the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles knew not the mind of God, or else would not reveal it. For certainly we have much more reason to say, their practice binds unalterably, than any one can have to say it doth not. For we have much more reason to demand of these men some mind of God, why we should change Apostolical Practice; than they have of us, why we constantly practice what the inspired Apostles did? Neither do I understand, <hi>how an Argument from Apostolical practice must suppose a different State of things than what they were when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles established Governours over Churches.</hi> For why should not we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Apostles did constitute, what they practiced? And certainly he must be as infallible as the Pope pretends too, that is sure any Exposition of Scripture, that contradicts or concurs not with Apostolical practice, is true, if there can be any rational Exposition of those Scriptures, which concurs with that
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:96777:19"/>
practice. And he who shall not believe there are such Expositions, and though not infallible yet sober, and I dare say much surer than any to the contrary, must condemn all the Antient Fathers of the Church, as ignorant and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, and believe some new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of men of Yesterday and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of some idle Haereticks of greater Authority than those great lights of the Catholick Church. And now to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from some few practices in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, which were laid aside, such as the Holy kiss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Constitution may; is just such an Argument, that if a circumstance, a Ceremony may be changed, the whole Substance may too: unless a man will affirm, there is no more need of a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding succession of Church-Governours, than there is of the most minute practice in those daies.</p>
            <p>But here I expect it should be said. <hi>What necessity is there of a Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ministers? A ministry is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, but to think that every Minister must</hi> as some in derision say, <hi>draw his Pedegree from the Apostles, that is a narrow principle and fit only for
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:96777:19"/>
Bigots to believe, and such as are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily deceived with the Great names of Antiquity and Catholique Tradition.</hi> I confess I was sorry, when I considered this Opinion, to find that the French Ministers, when they maintained their vocation to be lawful, (unto which Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> made his Reply) lay this down for their first Argument.<note place="margin">Premierement, quand il n'y auroit autre raison que ceste-cy a scauoir que nous avons la vraye et pure doctrine en son entire, elle suffiroit pour prouver que nous auons aussi la vraye vocation qui en depend.

For though the difference here may be, that these may have the doctrine entire, when other Haereticks have not; yet since with the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they dispute with, that is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; it is no more an Argument to justifie their Vocation, than for any Haereticks, who believes he holds all

Doctrine, true and entire for his. But in answer to this sort of ingenious men of larger Souls and looser principles, I demand, What Divine Demonstration have they, that a man may have a lawful call to the Ministry, and not at all derive this power from those unto whom our Saviour first gave the power of constituting Successours? Certainly he, who goes about to shake a Position that for more than <hi>1500</hi> years all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans believed, had need be as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable in his proofs, as Principles in Mathematicks are. Nay he had need be infallible in his Expositions of Scripture, since he must give a contrary sense to them, than all Catholique Writers have done before; considering that if he be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, he destroys the very Being of a Church, and by depriving them of lawful Pastors, robbs Christians of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and all other Spiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p>But if all Vocation to the Ministry must be either Extraordinary such as the Apostles were, or Ordinary such as the Bishops their Successors were, it would do well these generous men would shew us by what Title they claim. If
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:96777:20"/>
extraordinary, certainly 'tis as necessary for them to prove their Mission by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as it was for the Apostles, nay as it Was for our Saviour: who expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.24.</note> 
               <hi>If I had not done amongst them, those works which none other man did, they had not had Sin.</hi> If ordinary, they would do well to shew us, that this their call to the Ministry was that ordinary way by which the Church enjoyed her Pastors. For unless they can do that, they must believe, nay they must tell the World, that those Good and Pious men, who succeeded the Apostles, and who for the defence of the Doctrine of the Gospel resisted unto blood, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to cheat Christians of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Soul of Man of those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous principles, this liberal age is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to allow her. And it is very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to say that the Successours of the Apostles, in those writings we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, do differ in many things, and do maintain some things not altogether consonant to truth. 'Tis true I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they are but men, and therefore subject to frailties and errours as all mankind is: but this is so far from weakening their Authority, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:96777:21"/>
strengthens it: That since they are men and so subject to mistakes and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongst themselves, it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they should all agree in the Doctrine and practice of Episcopacy, unless they were all convinced it was a principle not to be disputed against. And let not some say that our Bishops now a daies differ from the Apostolical Bishops: 'tis possible they may in some external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which the Piety and Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Christian Princes have annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto that Order, believing they could not honour those too much who were set apart to serve at the Altar of our Lord. Yet I desire any man to shew me whether the Catholick Church did not at all times believe for <hi>1500</hi> years together, that a Bishop was absolutely necessary for Ordination? And if Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, which the Author to the Hebrews reckons as one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, yea one stone of the Foundation of the Doctrine of Christ, which <hi>(since the words are; the Doctrine of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, and Ordination is ever performed with it)</hi> may amongst others comprehend Ordination; then he who shall destroy a lawful Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:96777:21"/>
pulls away one of the Foundation Stones of the Christian Aedifice; and, if he doth not destroy, certainly he endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Building.</p>
            <p>But why the Scripture should be thought deficient in Necessaries, <hi>If E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Government being necessary be not determined,</hi> I understand not; <hi>for if by not determined by a Law be meant absolutely,</hi> 'tis begging the Question. For there is no man but knows 'tis the Assertion of all who hold Episcopacy Apostolical, that 'tis deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined there. But if by determining by a Law, is meant, so positive and clear a Determination as is Obvious to every Capacity, and can admit of no Cavil, then 'tis a strange conclusion. For, I doubt, some great Articles of our Faith are not so evidently revealed, and so positively determined, but may admit of divers c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vils; and those too not from unlearned and irrational men, who allow the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as we do, to be sole Judg in such Controversies. And if this be so, then either those great Truths are not <hi>necessaria,</hi> or the Scripture is defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in <hi>necessariis,</hi> both which are strange Conclusions. And now to suppose, <hi>That
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:96777:22"/>
Episcopal Government is a matter of Christian Liberty,</hi> because it is not so clearly determined by a positive Law, is to suppose that every thing, of which we have not positive and clear Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture as will admit of no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, is of Christian Liberty: and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

against; nay 'tis no more than for an Atheist to deny the Divinity of our Saviour, because there is no place which asserts it in Scripture, but the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> dispute against. But to expect that <hi>this also must be express the binding Nature of the Law,</hi> 'tis far more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.

For the Infallibility of the first Authors of it is enough to teach it ought to continue, unless from as great an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the contrary be proved.</p>
            <p>And upon this account those other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments must be of as little force, which affirm, That <hi>all standing Laws and Rules of Church-Government are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to several Forms, and that therefore the Scripture hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no Government, but left it arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily.</hi> For, first this is begging the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: For, whoever affirms this, must know that divers Laws of Government, as particularly that of Ordination hath by the Catholick Church for more than

pretends to be a Government, must have some principal Laws and Rules common with the best Government, and yet in as much as that Government wants the perfection of a better, these Principles though they sute with that Government, yet do not conduce so well to the end of Government, as when they are made use of in a better. To illustrate this by an Instance. Divers of the principal Laws of <hi>England</hi> agree with the Laws of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Countries, now to affirm that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is not established in <hi>England,</hi> because our Laws are or may be used to a Government not Monarchical, is such a way of arguing as will hardly deceive a considering man. And though this may be said as to Government in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, abstracting Divinity from it: Yet if we find these Laws and Rules, that are given in Scripture for Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are more eminently condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the benefit of the Church in Episcopacy than in any other; and if we have greater Authority than we have of any Fact so antient, that the Church ever understood and practiced these Rules and Laws in Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, can any rational man be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:96777:24"/>
that Episcopacy is of Christian Liberty; because the Rules and Laws of Episcopal Government may be forced and strained to the fond Inventions of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick brain?</p>
            <p>And now Reader I must begg thy pardon, I have been so long on this last Argument. I hope the danger as well as the Novelty of the Opinion will be my excuse. I proceed.</p>
            <p>We have in the last place another sort of Adversaries that are Enemies to Episcopacy; and the reason is, because they are friends to their Lands; and unless they destroy their Order, they cannot divide the Spoil. And because this is an Argument not fit to be openly urged, they pretend to annex them to the Crown, and that (say they) will both enrich and strengthen the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. To these two men I shall only lay down these Positions, and if I make them good, this Argument will vanish as smoke. The first is, That these Lands in the Churches hands conduce more to the Interest of the Crown, than if they were annexed to the Crown. And the second is, that the Crown at present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as much in Revenue over and
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:96777:24"/>
above what the Church men have, as it doth from any Lands not yet altered from the Crown, Quantity for Quantity.</p>
            <p>For the first, I take that to conduce to the Interest of the Crown, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth a great number of understanding able men to depend upon the Crown. Now since all Ecclesiastical Preferments depend either immediately or mediately on his Majesties disposal, this must make all who that way seek for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deserve well of the Crown, that that they may obtain their desires. And this doth not only encourage those who are possessed of Ecclesiastical Dignities, but doth also perswade and encline Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ministers to serve his Majesty, that they may be considered and rewarded for it. Of this we have a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in our late ill Times, when, if I mistake not, as I think I do not, there were <hi>8000</hi> forsook all for the Covenant. Of an <hi>129</hi> Parishes within the Bills of Mortality of <hi>London,</hi> (I have the list now by me) an <hi>115</hi> was turned out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all the Prebends of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s and <hi>Westminster.</hi> And the Great depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Clergy was so great an Eye-sore in the beginning of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:96777:25"/>
Times, that the Principal Reason, why some seemed so zealous to Vote Bishops out of the Lords House, was that they were a dead weight, and that their Interest did so depend on the Court, that they always Voted as they received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: which thing though in it self not true, yet certainly shews, That their Interest is involved with the Crown and that he that will ruin the Monarchy must begin with the Church.</p>
            <p>Now let any man answer me, Hath not this great Body of Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgy a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Interest in the Nation? Do we not find in many Parishes that the Minister carries as great a sway as the Lord of the Mannour? Is it then prudence to alienate the Churches Land, to destroy this Body of Men who depend on the Crown? What will be the consequence of this? This first will make every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Minister seek what either his Patron or Parish do desire. For he is at his height, he can hope for no more. This will augment the number of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, who are already increased to such a multitude, that their Lands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed both Crown Lands, Church Lands, Nobility and Gentry. And if that be
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:96777:25"/>
true, (which Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> affirms, and is not improbable) that the Interest of <hi>England</hi> is in her Lands; certainly all means ought to be used to continue Lands in the hands of those whose Interest it is to support the Crown, rather than suffer them to be divided amongst a giddy multitude, who judg of nothing but as it conduceth to their present profit. I shall not here enter into the Religious Account of Church Lands, nor add what I have seen in some Papers of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s, that when the Abbies were dissolved, there were but <hi>28</hi> Temporal Lords gave assent to it, and that in his time <hi>22</hi> of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies were expired: I shall not answer that which is in every Mouth, that the Church had near a Moiety of the Nation, since it was not the Church, but their Tenants had again nine parts of that ten, and in those times a Church Lease was counted better than <hi>Capite</hi> Land, since the Tenancy was never altered but upon consent or miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, their Children were not subject to Wardships, their Revenues, for all but stock, not liable to Subsidies, and their Lands maintained at the charge of the
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:96777:26"/>
Church from all vexatious Titles and Law Suits. But this is not my work at present.</p>
            <p>The second thing I am to prove, is, That the, Crown receives as much from the Dignified Clergy's Lands, as it doth for so much of its own. And this will appear, if we consider that every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop at his Entrance in four years pays the full reserved Rent of his Bishoprick, after that a full Tenth yearly; and 'tis not ordinary for any Bishop to continue in one and the same Bishoprick above seven year; so that if we call the First-fruits a Fine which comes in seven year, and the yearly Tenths, it is a good cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Revenue to the Crown. Whereas in the Crown Lands the reserved Rents are little, and much of that expended in Collection: The Fines seldom come to any thing, and they, or the greatest part of them, are commonly swallowed up by them who gather them. I know, at his Majesties Restauration the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Fines were extraordinary: but though men look on their Profit with an evil Eye, yet they are not willing to consider their vast expense; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the almost Ruined Cathedrals,
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:96777:26"/>
Episcopal Houses, Redemption of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Allowances to Purchasers, and particular Contributions, besides those great Acts of Charity and Munificence, which scarce any who have died but have left a good Example to their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
            <p>But besides this, if we consider that the Priesthood under the Gospel is more honourable than that under the Law, as being the Dispenser of a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and that it is Christ's own Command, that they who Preach the Gospel should <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should live of the reward the Gospel brings, that a Messenger of such good News doth merit; we will conclude, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Clergy deserves at least a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Revenue, to that which God was pleased to command and set apart for the Priests under the Law. And truly if we examine what that was, we shall find our Churches Revenue comes not near it. Then certainly we have no reason to repine at what they have, unless we are of the Opinion of some amongst us, that to serve God is in it self not necessary; and so their needs neither persons to be dedicated to
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:96777:27"/>
serve at the Altar, nor maintenance for them.</p>
            <p>How great the Revenue was, the Priests had under the Law, we may compute, if we consider that they had the Tith of every thing in kind,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Review History of Tyths,</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>456.</hi>
               </note> which as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> tells us was rather a Fifth than a Tenth; that they had a great proportion out of every Sacrifice, that all Free-will Offerings were theirs; so that to give to God and his Priests was one and the same thing: and besides all this in that little Country, which I think exceeds not our four Northern Counties, they had <hi>48</hi> Cities allotted them with their Suburbs, which was to extend round about their Cities <hi>2000</hi> Cubits, which was something more at the lowest reckoning than half a mile; so that allow the City a square and half a mile over, there is a square of a mile and half, which makes <hi>3</hi> square miles, and contains in it <hi>1920</hi> Acres; so that in that little Land they had <hi>92160</hi> Acres, which the soil being then so rich, by the multitude of Inhabitants, and Gods special blessing, was a vast Revenue, and far exceeds what our Clergy ever
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:96777:27"/>
had. And therefore any sober judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person may judg at the Intentions of those men, who in their scurrilous and seditious Pamphlets make our Clergy, <hi>like Bell,</hi> to devour the best of the Land.<note place="margin">Omnia Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesta a Belo.</note> They are desirous to devour it themselves, and, that they may be fresh Instruments to pull down more judgments upon this Nation, they desire to involve us in New Sacriledges; as if this Nation had not been sufficiently punished by sins of this kind, unless they fill up the measure by new Additions.</p>
            <p>But this being not so properly the Subject in hand, I shall leave it at present, and conclude this Preface, when I have added, what I have received from good Authority concerning two great men amongst the Dissenters of the last Age; that the World may see, that the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then were neither in Opinion nor Temper like unto those, who now cause great Separations amongst us.</p>
            <p>The first is of Mr. <hi>Tho. Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> the <hi>Antesignanus</hi> of that Party in his Age. Sir <hi>George Paul</hi> in the life of Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> tells us, that the Reason of his first discontent was, that in the Exercises that were done
<pb n="lxvi" facs="tcp:96777:28"/>
before Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> Dr. <hi>Thomas Preston</hi> got all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and a Pension from the Queen, when he, who was the better Scholar was not taken notice of. This beg at in him Great Discontent and Anger first at the Queens Supremacy in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticals, and afterwards at all the Orders of the Church.<note place="margin">Fuller <hi>History of</hi> Camb. p. <hi>139.</hi>
               </note> But though he continued long in this Temper, yet before his death he grew very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. And when he came to dy, which he did at <hi>Warwick</hi> at the Hospital, of which <hi>Robert Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> had made him Master, he did seriously lament the unnecessary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he had caused in the Church, by the Schism he had been the great Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter of; and wished he was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his life again, that he might te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie to the World, the dislike he had of his former ways. And in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he died. The truth of which Story I have from the third hand: A sober person present at his death told a friend of his a Gentleman of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who assured a Clergy-man of my Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="lxvii" facs="tcp:96777:28"/>The second is Mr. <hi>John Dod,</hi> a man whose Name is known to all this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What thing he scrupled in the Ceremonies his neerest Relations could but guess. For I am informed by one of them who lived above half a year in his house with him, that in all that time, he never spake one word of them to him. He advised a Grandchild of his to go for Ordination to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> because he was the Bishop, Students in <hi>Cambridg</hi> received Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from: And when he asked his advise about Subscription, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, If you scruple nothing, why do you question it? When one of his own Children seemed to doubt kneeling at the Sacrament, and asked his advice, whether she should leave the Church, and get some Minister to give her the Sacrament in the house, in the Posture she inclined to take it in? the good old man man rejected the motion with some eagerness, and bid her go to her Parish Church, and receive kneeling: When for refusal of Subscription in the third year of King <hi>James</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, he refused to Preach; And when by Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> I think I mistake not his
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:96777:29"/>
Name, a Minister in <hi>Teukesbury</hi> he was pressed to it by that Argument, that he was a Minister not of Man, but of Jesus Christ. He replied, 'tis true, he was a Minister of Jesus Christ but by Man, and not from Christ as the Apostles only were; and therefore if by the Laws of Men he was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Preaching, he ought to obey: and never did Preach, till Mr. <hi>Knightly</hi> his Patron procured him a Licence from Archbishop <hi>Abbot.</hi> Where by Ordinance of Parliament the Common Prayer Book was laid aside, he never forsook the use of it, but read always as much, as his very old Age would suffer him. When he was desired to Baptize a Child after the Mode of those Times, without the Common-Prayer-Book, he refused, but administred both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to that Order, (the Cross only excepted, which practice made some imagine 'twas the only thing he scrupled). And when by Accident a great Commander in the Parliaments Army (who formerly had been his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor) came with Forces that way, he asked Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> why he did not Pray and Preach up the Parliament. He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:96777:29"/>
He Preached Jesus Christ, which was the work of a Minister. And after that asked that Commander, Who he fought for? He answered, For the King and Parliament. The good old man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, But what if the King be in a fight, and you should kill him? The Commander replied, He must take his fortune. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> returned, 'Tis a strange fighting for the King, to kill him; and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer did so trouble and concern this good man, that after this discourse ended, he mentioned it with great horror to some of his Relations. A little before <hi>Naseby</hi> fight, King <hi>Charles</hi> of blessed memory sent the late Earl of <hi>Lyndsey</hi> to Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> to know his Opinion of the War. His Lordship found him ill, however he sate up and dictated his sense of it. But the Earl was on a sudden, by reason of the Fight hurried away, that whether the King had the paper or no, I cannot learn; but the Original, or a Copy of it, was by some zealous men suppressed. And their lived near him a Justice of Peace in those ill times, (who, though he pretended to much Piety, had little honesty, as appeared at his death) that was thought the man who suppressed it. And when by some of
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:96777:30"/>
Mr. <hi>Dod</hi>'s Relations he was asked about it, he made this answer, That in his old Age he began to dote. I have done my utmost to retrive it, and am not yet out of hopes to do it; which if I can compass, the World shall see, this man was none of those who disliked the Liturgy, despised our Ecclesiastical Government, none of those who gathered Proselytes by broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinions contrary to the Established Laws, none of those who Preached in Corners, and so applaud themselves and their fancies, that they fill our streets with their unreasonable Argumentations, none of those who study to deceive, because either they have deceived or been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves.</p>
            <p>I have now done, I only desire the Reader to lay aside all interest and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and as an indifferent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd person, to read this Discourse I here offer thee. And since all Truth is great, and will prevail, I cannot but hope this truth will have a good success. If the constant practice of the Primitive Church, if the Authority of all the great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the Protestant Church, if the universal consent of Antient holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if the concurrent Testimony of
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:96777:30"/>
Modern Divines, if the confessions of so many great Divines in our late ill times, the blood of Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> or the Martyrdom of our late blessed Sovereign, have any Rhetorique at all, let these compel thee to forsake these Separations, and to return to the bosome of that Church, whose Orders are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical, whose Ceremonies are Primitive, and whose Doctrin is most Orthodox.</p>

                  <hi>OUr Fourth Argument</hi> (say the same Opposites) <hi>standeth thus</hi>: Cap. 1.20. <hi>Our Saviour saith, That the seven Candlesticks which thou sawest, are the seven Churches; but he doth not say, that the seven Stars are the seven Angels of the same Churches; but the Angels of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96777:85"/>
Churches, omitting not without a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the number of the Angels, lest we should understand by Angel, one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister alone, and not a company.</hi> So they. We are first to unriddle the Mystery, it is indeed so mystical and obscure. Thus then, <hi>The number of Seven, which is used in repeating the Churches is in the repetition of the word Angel omitted, and therefore in the omission</hi> (forsooth) <hi>there must be a mystery.</hi>Yea, and also the Mystery must be this, to wit, <hi>That the omitting of the repetition of Seven, must signifie, that the word Angel, is not to be taken singularly for any one person, but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively for many.</hi> This is their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. We answer, That this their Mystery, their great friend Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> would have called a Mistake, who interpreteth the omission thus, <note n="(7)" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Stars of the Churches, they signifie seven Angels.</hi> So he. As much as if he had said, Although the word <hi>Seven</hi> were not added in the second place; yet it could not but be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

               <p>As for example, If any one of our Opposites had commanded his Servant saying, Make ready for me <hi>two Horses,</hi> the <hi>White Horse</hi> and the <hi>Bay</hi>; where in repeating the word <hi>Bay,</hi> is omitted the word <hi>Horse</hi>: Would it be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse in his Servant for not making ready the <hi>Bay,</hi> to say, that the reason was that the word <hi>Horse</hi> was Mystical? Now to the Mystery it self; which is (say they) <hi>That therefore by the word Angel is not understood one Minister alone</hi>: Which in our scanning is no more consequent, than in the former Example to conclude, from the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the word <hi>Horse,</hi> that therefore the <hi>Bay</hi> was but a <hi>Mare.</hi>

               <head>SECT. XXVI. That the personal continuance of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy</hi> was during life, against the most novel Figments to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</head>
               <p>FIrst, The Angels or Supreme Ministers in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to whom the Epistles according to the Scriptures were written, seeing that they were always chargeable to inform the Presbyters with the Contents, therefore they must be supposed to be in Office before they could discharge any such Function. Because <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> and all the other Apostles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their functions until their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the narrative parts of every of the said Epistles Christ giveth every of the Prelates to know [<hi>That he knew their works</hi>] and that he had them in estimation according to their works, namely, works done long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, insomuch that he chargeth one [<hi>To do his former works</hi>] c. 2. v. 3.

and commendeth another because [<hi>His last works were better than his former.</hi>] c. 3. v. 19.

               <p>Thirdly, Besides some were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned for not executing their Offices against the Heretical <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and Idolatrous <hi>Balaamites,</hi> and <hi>Jesabel,</hi> as well out of the Convocation of Presbyters, as with their consent when they were met: Which proveth that in the interim between <hi>Convents,</hi> and <hi>not Convents,</hi> the Prelates office was permanent. Whereas the <hi>Deambulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Actors</hi> use to have their <hi>Quietus est,</hi> and to forgo their Imployments for want of Continuance more or less.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:96777:102"/>Fourthly, If we look forwards to the time to come, Christ is found threatning the Prelates that were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. One [<hi>to be removed, if he did not repent</hi>] c. 2. v. 3. And denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing against another, [<hi>To come against him, if he should not repent and do his former works,</hi>] c. 2. v. 14. But useth this to be the process of <hi>Deambulatory Officers,</hi> if they have offended grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously in one <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> to elect them again upon an expected Repentance?</p>
               <p>Lastly, to one of these Prelates Christ made a royal Promise, saying [<hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</hi>] c. 2. v. 9. Wherein is as well implied Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his Function, as Constancy in his Christian profession, especially this being written unto him, even as he was President over others. Which is a Faithfulness which the Spirit of God frequently mentioneth commending it in <hi>Tychicus,</hi> Eph. 2.21. and in <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. v. 1.2.
