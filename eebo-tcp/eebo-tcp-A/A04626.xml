            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which all mankind is subiect more or lesse; as labour, care, trauell, sicknesse, diseases, aches, paines, wants, griefes for death of friends, and other ineuitable casualties.</p>
                  <p>Extraordinary euills are either persecution inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the godly by the wicked: or wrongs which are done by men of the world for malice or couetousnes, or meerly out of a mischieuous disposition; or calamities, which can bee impute directly to no second cause, but to Gods own hand.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning all these kinds of euill, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the word <hi>Tribulation,</hi> the Apostle speaking by inspiration, commaunds vs to bee <hi>patient.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This patience in the Old Testament is termed silence, <hi>Esay 30. 15. In silentio &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In silence and hope shall be your strength.</hi> That is, If yee quietly indure your affliction, and put your trust in the Lord, yee shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. <hi>Psal. 39. 9.

He is brought as a Lambe to the slaughter, and as a sheepe before her shearers is dumbe, so he openeth not his mouth.</hi> Yet let no man imagine that Christs patience was onely outward; twas inward also: Hee vnderwent whatsoeuer was laid vpon him, with a quiet mind. And so must wee indure all tribulation with a quiet mind: a quiet mind is the principall thing in the definition of Patience, giuen both by Philosophers and Diuines. <hi>Tully</hi> sayes, <hi>Patientia est virtus omnis adversitatis impetus aequanimiter portans:</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is a vertue which suffers all aduersitie with a quiet mind. <hi>August.

Now whereas he sayes by euils, we must vnderstand only aduersities or crosses, tis euident tis no true patience, when a man suffers the euill of sin in himselfe or others with a quiet mind. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> sayes well, <hi>vera patientia est pati contra quod libeat, non praeter quod</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ad Eugenium.</note> 
                     <hi>liceat.</hi> Tis true patience to suffer against our will, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst godlinesse. They therefore are greatly to bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med which suffer themselues to bee drawne into any sin; as drunkennesse or whoredome by leud companions, bee they neuer so great.</p>
                  <p>Againe, whereas tis said that, to the making vp of true patience, there is required a quiet mind, void of perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it seemes tis the Lords will that we voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selues vnto affliction. Patience perforce is no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: if wee suffer murmuringly and with grudging, though we suffer neuer so much, tis nothing worth.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet let any imagine, that wee are here called to such a kind of voluntary suffering, that we should run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to affliction, and of our owne accord enter into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Twas sencelesly done by <hi>Baals</hi> Priests to launce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; And the Romanists cannot without sinne imitate them, whiles they whip themselues, and goe in haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, and lye on the ground: <hi>Who requires this at their hands:</hi> We must quietly vndergo any affliction that is cast vpon vs: wee must not voluntarily rush into any tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath beene said, tis easie to gather the Doctrine of this Text, and tis this: All Christians must, with a quiet and godly m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

There is no one dutie wherunto we are oftner called in Scripture, then vnto Patience; and no maruell: For there is no vertue more necessary then patience, none more excellent.

                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. calls it, <hi>Magnum Dei donum:</hi> The great gift of God. And the Apostle sayes to all Christians, <hi>Yee haue need of patience, Heb.</hi> 10. 36. Well doth hee say, Yee haue need of patience; because, <hi>so many are the troubles of the righteous, Psalm.</hi> 34. And no man can come where Christ now is, except hee patiently <hi>take vp his crosse dayly, Luke</hi> 9. 23. Tis the Apostles resolution, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Wee must through much tribulation enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if yee search the Scripture, yee shall find, that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation hath beene the lot of the righteous in all ages. The first Saint, <hi>Abel,</hi> least he should want trouble, was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by his owne brother <hi>Cain.</hi> How was <hi>Noah</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the wicked world? Who knowes not the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of all their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Wildernesse, in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon?</hi>

Yea <hi>Paul</hi> sets it downe as a Law that shall not bee broken, That, <hi>all that will liue godly in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution, 2 Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Church hath often and long beene free from tribulation; as whiles <hi>Ioseph</hi> liued in <hi>Egypt:</hi> In the time of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon:</hi> And tis written, <hi>Act. 9. 31. Then had the Churches rest throughout all Iudea, and Galile, and Samaria.</hi> So also tis recorded in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, and in the dayes of diuers other Christian Emperours the Church had much peace.</p>
                  <p>And how can we forget the wonderfull peace and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which our owne Church hath enioyed, in the reign of our late blessed Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and our late Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord King <hi>Iames?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the Church and people of God, haue


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8297:5"/>
sundry times beene free from publike persecution by the hand of Authority, as in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes. As also from open inuasion, as in 88. Yet neuer was there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some <hi>Ismaels</hi> and <hi>Esaus</hi> in the Church, to persecute all <hi>Isaacs</hi> and <hi>Iakobs.</hi> So it was in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, as hee testifies, <hi>Gal. 4. 29. As he that was borne after the flesh, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him that was borne after the spirit; so is it now:</hi> and so hath it beene euer since; and so it is now, and so shall it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the dissolution of all things: <hi>All that will liue godly in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They shall not alwayes be banished, imprisoned, wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, tormented, burnt, &amp;c. But they shall bee alwayes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, reproched, reuiled, slandred, nicknamed, derided, made laughing stocks, and table talke, and musick for drunkards and wantons, and swearing swaggerers, and euery idle, rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and vnthriftie companion. The mouth of the Lord hath said it, <hi>Esay 59. 15. He that departeth from euill maketh himselfe a prey;</hi> that is to say, Hee makes himselfe a scorne and derision to all that are round about him: which are not resolued to deny vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. Sheep among wolues can haue no rest: No more can the children of God among the children of this world. Tis worthily obserued by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in <hi>Psal. 55. Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam deerit persecutio Christiano: si ergo pro Christo pressuram non dum pateris, vide ne pie in Christo viuere non dum coeperis.</hi> Persecution shall neuer be wanting to a Christian, if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as yet thou sufferest no tribulation for Christs sake, suspect thy selfe that thou hast not yet begun to liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ Iesus. If thou liue so priuately that none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad take notice of thee: yet, if thou walke with God, with an vpright heart, the Deuil will raise vp some storme against thee in thine owne Family: Thou shalt be sure to find, either a mocking <hi>Cham,</hi> or a rebellious <hi>Absolon,</hi> or a spitefull <hi>Doeg,</hi> or a cursing <hi>Shemei,</hi> or a false hearted <hi>Ioab,</hi> or a scoffing <hi>Michol.</hi> Lastly, if all the world would let thee


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8297:6"/>
alone; yet, if thou be a child of God, thou shalt in no case want some tribulation long: Some sicknesse or weaknesse shall take hold vpon thee: Some anguish of heart, or griefe of mind shall trouble thee; Crosses will come one in the neck of another: Thou shalt lose thy goods by Sea, by Land, by Fire, by Thieues: Thy hopefull Corne-fields shall bee blighted; thy sheepe and thy fatlings shall die in thy pasture; thy louing friends, nay thy beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall be taken from thee: some, whiles they hang on the brests; others when they are growne vp and are of great hope: Nay more, thy dearest <hi>Rachel</hi> shall bee taken out of thy bosome; or the Lord will take away from thy head, thy glory, thy sweet companion, thy staffe thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Some way or other thou shalt surely be afflicted: for the Spirit of Truth hath said it, <hi>Heb. 12. 6. Whom the Lord loueth hee chasteneth, and scourgeth euery sonne whom hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then it is so plaine, that all Gods children must thorough much tribulation enter into the kingdome of heauen: it followes directly, that all that will bee saued, must of necessitie bee armed with patience. For how shall we be able to keepe faith and our holy profession, if we be not heartned with patience and quiet mindes to beare all tribulation?</p>
                  <p>The want of this Grace of Patience hath beene the cause, why many (who made a good profession) when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, or some other tribulation arose, haue started backe and behaued themselues like meere worldlings. VVherfore least any of vs in time of tribulation should fall away, and giue vp all that wee haue heard, like the hearers which are compared to the stony ground, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. Let vs euen now whiles it is called to day, begin to vse the best meanes that we can to settle our soules in patience. There be very many means prescribed by Diuines; among which may it please you to take notice of these fiue?</p>
                  <p>The first is Prayer. <hi>In his owne strength</hi> (saith <hi>Hannah)</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Meanes.</note>


                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8297:6"/>
                     <hi>shall no man preuaile, 1. Sam.</hi> 2. 9. But, <hi>our helpe commeth from the Lord our God which made heauen and earth, Psalm.</hi> 121. 2. Now the sanctified meanes to obtaine any good thing, as helpe, strength, patience in tribulation, is Prayer, as Christ saith, <hi>Matth. 7. 7. Aske and it shall bee giuen you:</hi> againe, <hi>Iohn 16. 23. Whatsoeuer yee shall aske the Father in my name, hee will giue it you.</hi> On the other side S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chap. 4. 2. <hi>Yee haue not, because yee aske not.</hi> Many surely haue not patience in tribulation, because they are not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in prayer: wherefore, if wee affect this great and rare gift of patience, let vs be instant in prayer. Euery Booke is full of the commendation of prayer; but he that would reape any benefit by prayer, must resolue with himselfe to enter into a set course of prayer, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did, and continually vpon euery occasion lift vp his heart vnto God, and be very thankfull for the least fauour.</p>
                  <p>The second meanes is humblenesse of mind. If thou <note place="margin">2.</note> wouldst bee patient in tribulation thou must labour for Humilitie, which is the ground-worke of all Grace. <hi>God giues Grace to the humble,</hi> saith <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> He which is of an humble Spirit, hath that within him, which will quench the furious passion of impatience, as soone as it begins to burne out.</p>
                  <p>If thou hast cause of griefe or vexation giuen thee by a froward wife, a strange husband, a rebellious child, a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute seruant, an vniust or foule-mouthed neighbour, a faithlesse friend, or a cruell enemy; thy humble spirit will tell thee, that thou hast behaued thy selfe more vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards thy heauenly Father: and if he strike thee with sicknesse, with want, or any other calamitie; if hee take from thee thy children, thy friends, thy wealth, thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; If thou hast an humble minde, it will tell thee this, It is Gods great mercy that thou thy selfe art not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and cast into hell. It will make thee say with <hi>Dauid,</hi> in that great triall when he fled from <hi>Absolon, 2 Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel 15. 26. Here am I., let him doe to mee as seemeth good vnto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:8297:7"/>
The third meanes to worke patience, is the ioynt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Faith, Hope, and a good Conscience. Hee that by <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> faith laies hold on the forgiuenesse of sin, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God by the bloud of Christ: And withall by the eye of hope <hi>entreth within the vayle,</hi> and beholdeth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prepared: This man shall bee able quietly, constantly, <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19.</note> and patiently to indure all crosses, afflictions and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which God, the Deuill, and all the world can lay vpon him; especially if hee ioyne vnto faith and hope a good conscience. For the cabbinet to lay vp, the jewells of faith and hope in, that they may stand vs in stead at euery as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, is a good conscience. Faith indeed first breeds a good conscience, and then a good conscience doth (as it were) nourish faith; so that hee which stickes not to make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of a good conscience, will quickly fall away from faith, and then euery tribulation will make him impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
                  <p>This threefold cord of faith, hope, and a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is that which heretofore hath kept the Saints and Martyrs constant and patient in all their afflictions. They were put vpon troubles and tribulation, intolerable inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane iudgement; yet were they more then conquerours through faith, hope, and a good conscience. Because they beleeued their sinnes were forgiuen, and in the course of sobrietie, righteousnesse and godlinesse, waited for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of their Sauiour Christ, nothing could dash them out of countenance.</p>
                  <p>Wouldest thou bee patient in tribulation? then must thou doe as thou hearest the Saints haue done. Thou must first beleeue, according to the tenour of the Gospel, that thy sinnes are forgiuen, and withall consider what a wonderfull benefit this is; then canst thou not chuse but be patient in any tribulation. It is most certaine, thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer didst truely esteeme the fauour of God in Christ; thou didst neuer soundly ponder what an inestimable benefit the forgiuenesse of sins is, if thou canst not be contented


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8297:7"/>
therewith, and willing with patience to indure any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation which the Lord shall lay vpon thee. Moreouer, if thou hast respect vnto the recompence of reward, thou wilt esteem reproch, losse of Honor, wealth, friends, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contentment, greater treasure then all the commodities in the world.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, a good conscience is a strong supporter in all manner of tribulation; did not the Heathen say,
<q>
                        <l>—Hic murus aheneus esto</l>
                        <l>Nil conscire mali.—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a brazen wall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all assault to be guiltie of no sin.</p>
                  <p>What made <hi>Ioseph</hi> so patient in prison? His conscience was not clogged with guilt: what made his brethren so much moued at the first touch? They had euill conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Euen so any tribulation will make thee impatient, if thou hast not purged thy conscience from dead workes: but if thou resoluest in all things to walke honestly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it cost thee, thou shalt be able to beare with a quiet mind whatsoeuer befall thee.</p>
                  <p>The fourth meanes to cause patience, is to set thy selfe <note place="margin">4.</note> to indure hardnesse as a good Souldier of Iesus Christ, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. It is good for a man to beare the yoake from his youth, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 27. Tribulation worketh patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>The fifth meanes of patience, is to enter into serious <note place="margin">5.</note> meditation concerning the ground, carriage, vse, and issue of all tribulation.</p>
                  <p>The principall meditations wherewith our hearts may <note place="margin">1. Medit.</note> be taken vp, are foure. First, that all tribulation comes from God. Secondly, that in all tribulation he deales wisely and louingly. Thirdly, that he sends tribulation for some good end. Fourthly, that he is ready alwayes to afford helpe for the present, and to deliuer in fit season. All these well weighed are able to make vs patient in any tribulation. To speake to them seuerally.</p>
                  <p>First, That all our afflictions from the one end of our


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8297:8"/>
life vnto the other, both great and small, come vpon vs from God himselfe, is plaine by the constant confession of the Saints, and the euidence of Scripture. <hi>Iob</hi> sayes, <hi>Iob 1. 21. The Lord gaue, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If yee read the Text, yee shall find that the <hi>Sabeaus</hi> took away his Oxen and Asses: the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> his Camels; yet <hi>Iob</hi> makes this confession, <hi>The Lord hath taken away. Psalme 119. 75. Dauid</hi> saith to God, <hi>Thou hast afflicted mee;</hi> yet we know it was <hi>Saul</hi> and his followers, and <hi>Shemei</hi> and <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> &amp;c. that afflicted <hi>Dauid.</hi> So the <hi>Israelites</hi> say, <hi>Hos. 6. 1. Come let vs returne vnto the Lord: hee hath torne, hee hath smitten vs. Amos 3. 6. Shall there be euill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it? Iob 5. 6. Affliction commeth not out of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here ye see it is a confessed truth, All tribulation comes from the Lord. Which being so, what fitter exhortation can I adde, then that <hi>Heb 12. 5. My sonne despise not the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him, verse 9. Wee haue had fathers of our flesh which corrected vs, and wee gaue them reuerence, shall wee not much rather bee in subiection to the Father of Spirits?</hi> Marke how <hi>Dauid</hi> in a great tribulation behaues himselfe, onely vpon this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that it was the Lords doing, <hi>Psalm. 39. 9. I was dumbe, and opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi> Here yee see <hi>Dauid</hi> professes hee was silent in affliction, because hee considered it was Gods doing. Nothing is more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to represse the violence of griefe in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then to call to mind that wee haue to doe, not with mortall men, but with the Almighty and euerliuing God. For how comes it to passe that the greater part of the world is ouertaken with impatience, when trouble lights vpon them; but because they doe not recount, that they wrangle and brawle with God himselfe? Therefore, whiles some cast their crosses and afflictions vpon fortune, some impute them to the malice or cruelty of this or that man, some ascribe them to one cause, and some vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8297:8"/>
and scarce one of an hundred absolutely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Gods hand; they freely fall to grieue, complaine, fret and murmure without measure.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Dauid</hi> cleane contrary, that hee may silence all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious motions, turnes his eye to the Lord, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him in his wise prouidence, as the author of all his trouble, resolues to bee silent and put it vp with a quiet mind. And so accordingly let vs know, that in any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction that befalls vs at any time, this is the principall worke of faith, to humble vs vnder Gods hand, and make vs rest in his doing with silence, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> counsells, Ch. 1. 5. 6. <hi>Humble your selues vnder the mightie hand of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides (as <hi>Caluine</hi> notes) which is the second Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">2. Medit.</note> it must be obserued that men do then subiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to God in tribulation with quiet and patient mindes, when they are perswaded that, as God doth all, so he doth it as a wise Iudge and louing Father. For many wicked men in tribulation acknowledge Gods hand; yet because they reckon of him as a cruell Tyrant, they cease not through impatience to blaspheme his holy name. But <hi>Dauid</hi> doth so acknowledge Gods iudgements vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that hee takes them as from the hand of a wise God, and louing Father; and therefore rests well pleased and patient whatsoeuer he doth, saying, <hi>I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth, because thou, O Lord, didst it:</hi> Thou, I say, which, as thou art the Almightie God, so thou art also wise, louing, and tender Father vnto mee.</p>
                  <p>Euen so, if we, when we are cast into the bed of sorrow, and furnace of tribulation, would seriously meditate vpon the wisdome and loue of the great God (from whose hand we say we take the visitation) assuredly we should possesse our soules in patience.</p>
                  <p>A man that is perswaded of the loue and skill of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician or Chirurgeon, which is but a man like himselfe and may be false, or deceiued; will put himselfe into his hand most readily, and be content to be launched and se<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

to take downe bitter pills and fulsome potions, and to doe or suffer any thing according to his direction, in hope of bodily health. How much more would wee bee patient in any tribulation, if we were thoroughly perswaded, that our God (without whose prouidence one haire falls not from our head) did administer these bitter things vnto vs, in wonderfull wisdome and great loue to our soules? This made <hi>Dauid</hi> so patient, <hi>Psal. 119. 75. I know O Lord</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that thy iudgements are right, and that thou in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hast afflicted me.</hi> Therefore was he so quiet; and when his spirit began to lash out in a kind of discontented hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, because Gods hand was vpon him so heauy and so long: marke how hee checks himselfe, saying, <hi>Psal. 42. 11. Why art thou cast downe, O my soule, and why art thou disquic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within mee? Hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi> Here note, I pray you, what the ground of <hi>Dauids</hi> patience in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, when his enemies reproched him, saying, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> it was this, hee was fully perswaded that God was his God, that is to say, his wise Guardian, his mightie Protector, his louing father, and that hee did all that hee did to him most wisely, most louingly, with respect vnto the amendment of his life, and the saluation of his soule. Euen so, if we also would beleeue Gods Word, which tels vs, that God as often as hee suffers any tribulation to fall vpon vs; in wisdome, loue, and faithfulnesse causes vs to bee afflicted, we would be quiet vnder his mightie hand; yea, wee would solace our soules with the peaceable fruit of affliction in the end. This made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say in the name of all beleeuers, <hi>Rom. 5. 3. Wee glory in tribulations.</hi> This made <hi>Dauid</hi> say long before, <hi>Psal. 94. 19. In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my</hi> sorrowfull <hi>thoughts within mee, thy comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my snule.</hi> Where note, hee saith not, when my tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and sorrowes are ouer, but euen in the middest of the multitude of them, I feele sound spirituall comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know that thou art the onely wise God, and my


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8297:9"/>
mercifull Sauiour and Redeemer, which bringest all these things vpon mee. Thou diddest cause <hi>Saul</hi> to persecute mee, and mine own sonne <hi>Absolon</hi> to rise vp against mee; Thou baddest <hi>Shemei</hi> to curse mee, and many others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and reuile me; Thou hast often cast mee vpon the bed of sicknesse; thou, I say, which art the only wise God, and my louing Sauiour, didst all these things; therefore I am so farre from fretting, that I find comfort, euen whiles I <note place="margin">See more in the treatise of faith.</note> am exercised vnder thy hand.</p>
                  <p>The like comfort will arise vnto any one of vs, in any trouble or tribulation, vpon the like consideration; to wit, that God (who is the author of all afflictions) sends them vpon vs, in singular wisdome and loue for our good: which that it may make the deeper impression, I wil come to the third Meditation; which is, touching the speciall <note place="margin">3. Medit.</note> ends for which God doth suffer tribulation to fall vpon vs. The ends are three. First, Gods owne glory. Secondly, The example of others. Thirdly, Our owne speciall good; vpon which I will chiefly insist.</p>
                  <p>First, One way whereby God is said to be glorified in his Saints, is when they patiently suffer tribulation for his names sake. Thus did the Martyrs glorifie God, whiles they cheerefully suffered for the truth.</p>
                  <p>The second end, is the example of others. Therefore doth God bring strong Christians to bee tried by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they which are weake (seeing their patience and constancy) may bee encouraged to bee quiet in the day of triall.</p>
                  <p>The third end is for our owne good, and that foure wayes. First, To try vs. Secondly, To purge vs. Thirdly, To quicken vs. Fourthly. To heape more glory vpon vs. That for these foure ends God sends tribulation vpon vs, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident by Scripture. For the first end, which is triall, it is said, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 12. Beloued, thinke it not strange concerning the fiery tryall, which is to try you, as though some strange thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto you; But reioyce,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut. 8. 2. 3. Moses</hi> saith to


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8297:10"/>
the people of <hi>Israel, The Lord led thee these forty yeeres in the Wildernesse, to humble thee, and to proue thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keepe his commandements, or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But did not God sufficiently know them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this kind of tryall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes surely: for as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 139. 2. He vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands our thoughts a farre off.</hi> But wee know not our selues, before we be tried by some tribulation. Some think they are strong, and that nothing can disquiet them; but when God laies his hand vpon them, they are troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue measure. Others thinke they haue no strength, that they shall not bee able to stand in the euill day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grow exceeding sad: But when they are brought to the lists, they are found stronger then many which made great boast.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the world is prone to censure all that labour to liue godly in Christ as hypocrites, as Satan said of <hi>Iob.</hi> Therefore the Lord, to cleere his children of this grieuous imputation, tries them with afflictions, that their vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may shine out, as <hi>Iobs</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>The second benefit of tribulation is purging our soules, <hi>Esay</hi> 1. 25. God saith to his Church; <hi>I will turne my hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and purely purge away thy drosse. Esay 27. 7. Hath hee smote Israel, as he smote those that smote him? Answ.</hi> Verse 9. <hi>By this shall the iniquitie of Iacob bee purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sinne.</hi> Here the Spirit declares the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ends, for which God strikes his children, and the wicked; The wicked he strikes to destroy them: His chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren hee strikes too, but it is to purge away their sinne. So againe, God sayes of some of the <hi>Israelites, Zach. 13. 9. I will refine them as siluer, and will try them as gold.</hi> VVhen these mettalls are cast into the fire, the drosse onely is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, they came out more pure. So Gods children, when they are cast into the furnace of affliction, come out more pure. Thus was <hi>Dauid</hi> purged by affliction, as he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8297:10"/>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. Nay one of the most notorious sinners that euer was, <hi>Manasses,</hi> was purged by tribulation, 2 <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles 33. 12. When hee was in affliction hee besought the Lord, and humbled himselfe greatly before the God of his Fathers, and when hee was brought to Ierusalem into his Kingdome, hee tooke away the strange God, and repaired the Altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Iudah to serue the Lord:</hi> what an alteration is here wrought by tribulation? The like effect it hath in euery one in whom God hath any portion. Neither hath any man almost from the beginning beene soundly turned from his sinfull wayes, but by some affliction of body or mind. Aske your owne consciences, yee that are truely conuerted, whether your conuersion were not occasioned by tribulation.</p>
                  <p>The third end of tribulation, is to quicken all Sauing graces in vs, <hi>Psal. 119. 72. Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>It is good for mee that I haue bin afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes:</hi> why, but did not <hi>Dauid</hi> know Gods Statutes before? Yes: but by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hee was put in mind to walke the way of the Lord more diligently. Affliction made him more frequent and earnest in prayer: Affliction made him put his trust in God more confidently: Affliction made him more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer his owne wayes, and more carefull to keepe them in compasse which were committed to his charge: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction made him more compassionate towards others that were in any tribulation: Affliction made him more humble. In a word, by affliction, God did so frame and fashion him that he made him a man after his owne heart; therefore well may he say, as hee doth; <hi>It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted.</hi> The like good end doth God ayme at when hee afflicts any of vs, as it is plainely declared, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes 12. 10. Hee chastens vs for our profit, that wee may bee made partakers of his holinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth end of our tribulation is, that wee may bee the more glorified in heauen. <hi>Rom. 8. 17. If wee suffer with


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8297:11"/>
Christ, we shall be glorified together, 1 Pet. 1. 7. The tryall of our faith,</hi> thogh it be tried with fire, <hi>shalbe found vnto praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus yee see how many excellent ends of tribulation the Lord propounds, which being duly considered, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make vs not onely patient in any tribulation, but also joyfull and thankfull. I cannot omit what S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayes of tribulation, hauing respect only vnto the last end, to wit, the multiplying of our glory according to the measure of our tribulation. His words bee these: <hi>That I may after this languishing life see Christ in glory, and be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of so great a good; what though sicknesse weakens me, labours oppresse me, watchings spend me, cold benumne me, heat inflame me? Nay, though my whole life be spent in sighes and sorrowes; what is all to that rest which shall insue in the life to come? Why</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Non est ad astra mallis é terris via. <hi>Senec.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>doe wee complaine of want of rest seeing wee haue vndertaken a iourney wearisome and troublesome?</hi> Besides, there is no other way to heauen; as Christ was ordained first to suffer tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and then <hi>to enter into his Glory, Luke</hi> 24. 26. So all that are Christs are <hi>appointed to afflictions, 1 Thess.</hi> 3. 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Whom God did fore-know, he also did prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate to be conformed to the image of his Sonne,</hi> that is, Not onely in regard of holinesse, but also of tribulation: For <hi>the seruant is not greater then the Lord; If they haue persecuted mee, they will persecute you also,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 20. And yet againe, <hi>Luke 9. 23. Whosoeuer will come after mee, must take vp his crosse dayly.</hi> Now no man can bee said to take vp his crosse, but he that is patient in tribulation. The crosse of it selfe is not the way to the Crowne; but the patient bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Crosse. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes fitly, <hi>If a man striue for masteries, he is not crowned, except he striue lawfully, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 5. Wherefore, if we desire the ioyes of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, let vs be content to walke patiently without murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and fretting, through the stony lane of tribulation. The <hi>Israelites</hi> liked the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> very well, but when they felt hardship in the Wildernesse, they murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8297:11"/>
and the Prophet sayes, They prouoked the Lord, and he slew them by thousands. If we commit the like sinne, how shall wee escape the like iudgement? when <hi>Dauid</hi> sent Embassadours to the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> to comfort him after his Fathers death, he euill intreated them, and <hi>Dauid</hi> was exceeding angry. Behold afflictions are the Lords Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, which hee sends vnto vs for many good ends; wherefore if wee grudge and repine, if we mourne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure, and fret and chafe at them, surely wee shall greatly prouoke the Lords indignation against vs.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore hearing these things, be perswaded to be patient in all manner of tribulation, the rather, because God hath promised to bee with vs in all trouble, and to help vs to beare it, and in very good time to deliuer vs out of all our tribulation. This is the fourth Meditation. The <note place="margin">4. Medit.</note> first clause whereof; <hi>viz.</hi> That God will bee with vs, and helpe vs in trouble, may be proued: First, By the promises out of Gods Word: Secondly, By examples, instances, and experience. The Scripture is full of promises of Gods comfortable presence; I will cite onely that of <hi>Esa. 43. 1. Thus saith the Lord, feare not, for I haue redeemed thee, and when thou passest through the waters I will bee with thee: when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burnt: For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Sauiour. Feare not, for I am with thee.</hi> Here, by fire and water we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all manner of tribulation into which Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall: In all which the Lord promises to be with them; and how can they miscarry with whom the Almightie is?</p>
                  <p>But perhaps some wil say, This is indeed a large &amp; graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promise; but it was made only to the people of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Paul</hi> speaking to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which were <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as well as wee, saith, <hi>Rom. 15. 4. Whatsoeuer things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scripture might haue hope.</hi> More plainely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. the Spirit teacheth euery one to apply vnto himselfe that promise which was made onely to <hi>Ioshua, I will not leaue thee, nor forsake thee:</hi> wherby it is sure, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.</note>


                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:8297:12"/>
that what promise soeuer thou findest in all the Scripture made to a beleeuer, thou (if thou beleeuest) hast as good interest in it, as he to whom it was made. Wherefore, when thou fallest into any tribulation, comfort thy selfe with the promise of Gods presence; because he saith, <hi>I will not leaue thee.</hi> Neither hath God onely <hi>promised</hi> his presence, <note place="margin">Iosh. 1.</note> but also <hi>afforded</hi> it vnto his children. <hi>Esay</hi> 63. 9. It is said of Gods people, <hi>In all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saued them; In his loue and in his pittie hee redeemed them, and hee bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old.</hi> More particularly, how often doth <hi>Dauid</hi> say, That God was with him in the needfull time of trouble, and that he was his rock, his fortresse, his refuge, his strong helpe, that hee deliuered him out of all his troubles: and <hi>Psa.</hi> 23. 4. he makes this comfortable profession, <hi>Though I walke through the valley of the shadow of death, I will feare no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: for thou art with me.</hi> Not to multiply examples; how confidently doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say in the name of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3, 4. Blessed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth vs in all our tribulation:</hi> Againe, verse 5. <hi>As the sufferings of Christ abound in vs; so our consolation also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth by Christ. Russinus lib. 1. cap.</hi> 36. brings an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent example of God presence in affliction. One <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> was, for the profession of the Christian Faith, wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and tortured about two or three houres most cruelly; yet neuerthelesse that godly man was all the while ioyful, and cheerefully sang Psalmes vnto God. After hee was let loose, some of his friends asked him whether he felt no paine vpon the racke: Hee said, some small paine he felt; but there was with him a faire young man, as hee seemed, who still wiped the sweat from his face, and refreshing him as it were with coole water, caused that hee felt lesse paine then when he was let downe. All that are in tribulation now adayes, doe not behold the presence of the Lord, as <hi>Theodorus</hi> did; but all that beleeue are partakers of the Lords spirituall presence, whereby he inables them to doe


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8297:12"/>
or suffer any thing, according to that, <hi>Phil. 4. 13. I am able to doe all things, thorough Christ Iesus that strengtheneth mee.</hi> Vpon which word <hi>Bernard</hi> wel notes, that man by Nature impotent, by Grace is made omnipotent: verily, hee that beleeues is made able to doe or suffer any thing. <hi>For all things are possible to him that beleeueth, Mar.</hi> 9. 23. And no maruell; for Faith drawes whom the Lord of Life and Glory, and makes him present in euery place, in euery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and how can there want comfort in his presence, where is fulnesse of ioy for euer? It was the perswasion or spirituall sight of this presence of the Lord, that helped the Saints in all their tribulation. This made <hi>Moses, not feare the Kings wrath, Heb. 11. 27. Hee indured, as seeing him who is inuisible.</hi> This supported <hi>Dauid</hi> when hee was in his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, and his owne men spake of stoning him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. What was it but the presence of the Lord, that strengthened both the three children before the fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den? This made <hi>Peter</hi> sleep sweetly in prison the night before hee should bee slaine, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. This made <hi>Stephen</hi> speake boldly to his fierce ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Asts</hi> 7. This made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> sing Psalmes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at midnight, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. This made many beleeuers, which were tried by mockings, scourgings, and wrackings, despise the paine and the shame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. In like manner, if wee could perswade our selues that the Lord, according to his gracious promise, is with vs in all our tribulation, it would make vs quiet, and strongly comfort vs. O the ioy of the Lords presence, is able to bring mighty things to passe: what cannot he doe, and turne to our good; which called light out of darknes, &amp; made all things of nothing; if we would but giue glory to his Word, which sayes, <hi>Hee is with vs</hi> in trouble, and alwaies at hand to helpe vs in all our tribulation. <hi>Feare not, for I am with thee,</hi> saith the Lord to euery one that is in trouble. <note place="margin">Esay 43. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the confirmation of this difficult point, That God is with them that are in tribulation; mark what Christ saith, <hi>Iohn 16. 33. These things haue I spoken, that in mee yee might


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8297:13"/>
haue peace. In the world yee shall haue tribulation; But bee of good cheare, I haue ouercome the world.</hi> Againe, he sayes, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew 28. 20. Loe I am with you alwayes, euen vnto the end of the world:</hi> which wordes by <hi>Hieronym.</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> are vnderstood of Christs presence to all beleeuers vnto the worlds end. But the manner of his presence is spirituall: <hi>viz.</hi> He is present by his Spirit: of this Spirit it is that hee sayes, <hi>Iohn 14. 16. I will pray the Father, and hee shall giue you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for euer; Euen the Spirit of Truth, which dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</hi> Againe, <hi>Ioh. 16. 7. It is expedient for you that I goe away: for if I goe not away the Comforter will not come vnto you, but if I depart I will send him vnto you.</hi> By these places it is euident what kind of presence Christ promised to his Church and euery beleeuer vnto the worlds end; Euen the presence of his Spirit, which is the Comforter; and if any aske how Christ by his Spirit doth comfort beleeuers in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make them patient: I answere, three wayes. First, The Spirit teacheth them to apply vnto themselues, the precious promises of presence and assistance, as <hi>Esay 43. 2. When thou passest through the water, I will be with thee, Psalme 34. 7. The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him. Psa. 37. 5. Commit thy way vnto the Lord, trust also in him, and he will bring it to passe.</hi> These and many such promises doth the Spirit teach beleeuers to apply vnto their own soules, declaring also how God hath made good such promises from time to time, to al that trusted in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ by his Spirit helps beleeuers in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by powring into their hearts the gifts and graces of the Spirit, whereby they are made patient; as namely, joy, courage, patience, confidence, peace of conscience, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of supplication; yea, the Spirit helpes <hi>all our infirmities, and makes intercession vnto God for vs, Rom.</hi> 8. 26.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Spirit workes patience in vs, <hi>By bearing witnesse to our spirits that wee are the children of God; if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then heires, heires of God, and ioynt heires with Christ: so that if wee suffer with him, we shall also be glorified together:


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8297:13"/>
Rom.</hi> 8. 16. These be strong comforts, able to make any man patient: wherefore, if we loue our soules, let vs now, whiles wee haue time get these comforts about vs, that when we fall into any tribulation wee may haue comfort at hand. They that are of abilitie will alwayes haue in a readinesse hot waters, and cordialls against qualmes and sudden fits. How much more ought we to be wise in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding against the qualmes of our soules, considering that wee are daily subiect to some tribulation or other? Now, the principall cordiall for the soule in all distresse, is the comfort of the Holy-ghost, which Chriss hath promised to all beleeuers. Let all beleeuers therefore, soundly stay their hearts in all tribulation vpon this Comforter, which as hee is inuincible in himselfe, so is he able to ouercome all euill whatsoeuer to which we are subiect. If this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter be with vs, wee need not feare what befalls vs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tribulation, or distresse, or persecution, or famine, or nakednesse, or perill, or sword, in all these we shall be more then conquerors. Yea, we need not feare pouertie, reproch, sicknesse, desolation, torment, death; this Comforter hath consolation in store, which will comfort vs in despight of all these euills in their greatest extreamitie.</p>
                  <p>Nature and Art can worke onely by meanes: But the Spirit, which is the Comforter of beleeuers in all tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can work with meanes, and without meanes, yea and against meanes: <hi>Psal. 112. 4. Vnto the vpright there ariseth light in darknesse.</hi> I may adde ioy in sorrow, peace in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, abundance in want, life in death.</p>
                  <p>VVhen any beleeuer is called out by God to be tried by tribulation, the Spirit forthwith either furnishes him with sufficient strength, or abates the strength of the affliction: as we see in <hi>Ioseph, Moses,</hi> the three children, the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs in all ages. Let vs therfore, hearing these things out of the Word of Truth, labor daily to find them verified in our selues, that we may be patient in tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                  <p>Now followes the latter clause of the fourth Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>viz.</hi> That God in all tribulation will giue a seasonable


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8297:14"/>
and gracious issue. If their were no end of tribulation, it were in vaine to perswade to patience. But nothing is more often mentioned in Scripture then an end of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Psal. 34. 19. Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of all. Ioh. 16. 20. Yee shall be sorrowfull, but your sorrow shalbe turned into ioy.</hi> How often doth <hi>Dauid</hi> confesse that the Lord deliuered him out of all his tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Ob.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Dauid</hi> and others complain that it is very long before the Lord helps them; and the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint doe many in these dayes take vp, insomuch that they begin to faint vnder the burden of sicknesse, want, disgrace, &amp;c. before they be deliuered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This is true, the Lord sometimes deferres long before he helpes vs in tribulation; but he doth it in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if we had eyes to see it. To some he defers to grant their suit, that he may make them more earnest in prayer, which is an exercise wherein he greatly delights.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He deferres some, to make them more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taste the benefits when it comes, whereas if it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently granted, it would be quickly forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God delaies to send help in trouble, to put vs in mind how we haue put off from day to day to turn to him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Most commonly God prolongs the time of our tribulation, because it hath not fully accomplished the worke for which he sent it. Our vaine imaginations are not cast downe; our rebellious lusts are not mortified; our minds are not humbled; our compassion towardes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in affliction is not stirred vp; our hearts are not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from this world: wherefore if the hand of God at any time be vpon thee, presently enter into examination with thy selfe, and deale impartially with thy soule, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy selfe mightily, if thou expect deliuerance: For God delights not in thy tribulation, but delayes only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou art prepared for deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> I haue examined all my wayes, and humbled my selfe greatly, and beene very earnest in prayer long, and yet I see no end of trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8297:14"/>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Perhaps thou dost make too much hast, whereas the course which God prescribes, is to wait patiently the Lords leisure. <hi>Hab. 2. 4. The vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speake and not lye: Though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</hi> The thing to be obserued hence is, that no man must indent with God concerning the time of deliuerance, but must patiently indure the Lords leasure and pleasure. The best meanes to hasten reliefe in tribulation is, to throw thy selfe downe before God, saying, Here I am Lord; doe with mee what thou wilt; I am content to wait thy leasure, and to tarry vntill thou in thy wisdome seest it fit to release mee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> I see no meanes of redresse, though I tarry neuer so long, I am in great want, and debt, and weaknesse, and haue many to relieue, and haue no friends left.</p>
                  <p>Marke what the Spirit saith, <hi>Psal. 37. 3. Trust in the Lord, and be doing good; so shalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</hi> Againe, vers. 25. <hi>I haue beene young and now am old, yet neuer saw I the righteous forsaken.</hi> Remember moreouer, how the Lord prouided for the widdow of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta, 1 King.</hi> 17. His hand is not now shortned.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if thou keepe faith and a good conscience, and resoluest that thou wilt not vse any indirect meanes to helpe thy selfe or thine; but depend vpon God, thou shalt be sure with poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be receiued into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen when thou dyest; this will make amends for thy tribulation.</p>
                  <p>But, me thinks, I heare some <hi>Rachel</hi> complaining, that she hath lost a gracious sonne, and can haue no more; yea, as worthy an husband as the world can yeeld, how should she bepatient? <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Thou hast not lost that which God hath found. 2. God hath giuen thee his Sonne to bee thy husband, will not this make amends for thy sonne and thy husband? Is not he better-then ten sons and husbands.</p>
                  <p>In a word, let thy tribulation be what it may; let there be neuer so many impediments, neuer so strong aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, neuer so weake meanes: Nay, let thy case be desperate


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8297:15"/>
in the eye of man, yet if thou canst beleeue and wait, the Lord will surely in good time send thee helpe from his holy place, as hee hath done to all Saints which did put their trust in him. How can it bee otherwise; seeing his Name is still wonderful, his Power alsufficient, his wisdome infinite, his Truth infallible, his Loue immutable, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise &amp; Grace as large as euer, &amp; our Mediator Iesus Christ making intercession for vs, the same for euer? <hi>Dauid, Ps.</hi> 37. 37. bids vs, <hi>marke the perfect man, &amp; behold the vpright: for the end of that man is peace.</hi> And it is worth the marking also, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 16, 17. No man stood with mee, notwithstanding the Lord stood with mee and strengthened mee, and I was deliuered out of the mouth of the Lyon, and the Lord will deliuer mee from euery euill worke, and will preserue mee vnto his heauenly Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon what ground doth <hi>Paul</hi> speake this? surely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he beleeued. So then, if wee beleeue Gods promises made in the Word, wee also may say as boldly as he, <hi>The Lord will deliuer vs from euery euill worke, and will preserue vs vnto his heauenly Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then all our tribulation comes from the Lord, and he deales with vs most wisely and louingly; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sends any tribulation, but for some good end; as namely, his owne glory, the example of our weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or our owne good, in trying, purging, quickning vs, and heaping more glory vpon vs: And lastly, seeing hee is with vs in all tribulation, and helpes vs to beare it, and hath promised to giue a gracious issue; wee shall shew our selues to be very vnreasonable men, if we wil not from hence forth set our selues to be patient in tribulation.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with <hi>S. Iames 5. 10. Take my brethren, the Prophets, who haue spoken in the name of the Lord, for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of suffering affliction and of patience. Behold wee count them happy which inaure: Yee haue heard of the patience of Iob, and haue seene the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pittifull, and of tender mercy.</hi> Wherefore whatsoeuer your tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be, <hi>Be yee also patient</hi> vnto the comming of the Lord. To whom be glory for euer and euer.</p>
