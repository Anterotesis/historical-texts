         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:6409:6"/>
found a faire Trée, whoſe ſpreding bowes ſhadowed the place, where I layd me down of purpoſe to heare more of thoſe pleaſant notes: but as <hi>Cyllemus</hi> mery pipe, brought <hi>Ergus</hi> to a nodding nappe, ſo I think thoſe Hermonical ſoundes yelded mée the lyke: For I was no ſoner layde, but <hi>Morpheus</hi> immediatly aſſayled mée with a ſtraunge &amp; troubleſome dreame, for to my thinking I heard the ſodaine ſound of Trumpettes, Droms, &amp; Phifes, &amp; muſing with my ſelfe, what it might meane, I might ſée diuerſe bands both of Horſemen &amp; footemen being armed, which in very comely order, with auncientes braue diſplayd, came marching toward mée, and when they were come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where I aboad, putting themſelues in troupe one by the aſſent of all the reſt, vttred theſe wordes folowing: Although of this our ſodaine repaire vnto thée, thou haddeſt no intelligence, yet ſom part of the cauſe wée are aſſured thou knoweſt verye well, which ſhould make me to bée ſo much the ſhorter in that which I haue to ſay: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know this, we haue by our general aſſents apointed thée as our truſty friend, wylling thée with al ſpeede to prepare thée in maner of a meſſenger to the mighty court of <hi>Mars</hi>:

            <p>Thus when I had heard the ſum of their pretence, I aunſwered as followeth: If I were as ſufficient to diſcharge my ſelfe of that credite, whiche you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte vnto mée, as I fele my ſelfe wylling and readye to the vttermoſt of my power to pleaſure the ſimplyeſt of this noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as the hope that you haue in mée ſhould not bée fruſtrate, ſo I ſhoulde not bée dryuen to ſéeke excuſes, as nowe I am forced, requeſting your pardons herein: Fyrſt, becauſe I knowe there bée many whoſe experience wyll much better ſerue to ſatiſfye your requeſtes, than I knowe my owne to bée of, and there bée ſome that I knowe would accuſe mée of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce or preſumption, if it were knowne that I ſhould attempt in any ſuch matter, but in eſpeciallye when I conſider my owne inſufficiencye, it vtterlye diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth mée: But I rather thinke your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb facs="tcp:6409:7"/>
ſhoulde bée executed by ſome famous Oratour, or ſome excellent Rethoriſian which ſhoulde not bée vnfurniſhed with pleaſaunt tearmes, or ſuch a one as could tell a learned tale as occaſion dyd ſerue, and not by ſuch as I knowe my ſelfe to bée, who is able to ſaye no more than what you haue already taught mée: Wherefore I truſt you wyl except theſe as reaſonable &amp; lawful excuſes, and not as any ſurmiſed ſhifts, whereby to auoyde that ſeruice whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I knowe my ſelfe to bée vnworthy of.</p>
            <p>When I had made this anſwere after a lytle conference had amongſt them ſelues, thy replied in this manner.</p>
            <p>As wée thinke thée ſufficient ynough to performe any thing that wée haue yet deſired, ſo wée are not come hyther eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thée beſt able of any other to ſatiſfye our requeſt: but wée preſuming to haue found thée as wylling to haue vſed thy dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, at our deſires, as wée were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deſire thée, gaue vs the more occaſion to preſſe thus much vpon thée, and where thou ſayeſt there bée ſome that woulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thée of ignoraunce or preſumption, if thou ſhouldeſt yelde to our requeſtes, wée

aſſure thée there be as many others that might Iuſtly accuſe thée of folly yf for the reprochfull tauntes of Momiſhe mates, thou ſhouldeſt omit any thing that tendeth vppon good or commendable occaſion, but what nicite hath nowe ouertaken thée, that thou wouldeſt perſwade vs to ſende ſome Oratoure or ſuch lyke, and that we muſt nowe vſe ſuch eloquence to preferre our cauſes: thou muſt conſider we woulde neither ſend the to <hi>Pallas</hi> nor yet to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> nor yet to any other captious wight that will haue greater regarde to the termes, then he hath to the tale, for who is ſo ſcrupilouſe that will looke for elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to come from ſouldiers or to thinke that they muſte paynt out their matters with any curiouſe philed phrace, vnleſſe it be ſome curiouſe philed foole, which kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not what appertayneth to a ſouldier, but to driue thée oute of theſe doubtes wée haue framed a ſupplication to <hi>Mars,</hi> wher in wee haue included the whole ſircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of oure pretence the which in oure behalfes thou ſhalt preſent, receyuing thy anſwere without vſing many words: thus minding to vſe no farther perſwatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of
<pb facs="tcp:6409:8"/>
incouragement if this that we haue ſayd be not ſufficient we leaue the reſt to thy owne diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Yes ſurely ſayd I, it is ynough and youre wordes hath ſo throughly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me that euen now I remayne at youre pleaſures redy preſt to aunſwere the ſum of your pretence, as far as my abilitie will any wayes ſerue me, yet crauing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of ſuch as be beter experimented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it rather procéedeth from a deſier to do wel, then of any preſumtuoſe minde.

            <p>Well then we minde no lenger to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the but woulde rather wiſhe the to make as great ſpéede as conueniently thou mayeſt: we haue no more to ſaye but we deſier the ſacred Gods to farther thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and thus till oure next méeting we leaue thée.</p>
            <p>Then putting them ſelues agayne in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, too my farewell, certayne voll of ſhot diſcharged in hope of my good ſpéede.</p>
            <p>Thus they marched awaye againe in ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:6409:9"/>
gallant ſort, that who had ſéen them might well haue déemed (though their eſtimaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were impaired,) yet their noble and valliant harts was no whitte diminiſhed: But ſodainly as they were vaniſhed from my ſyght, I began to bethinke mée of my vndertake, attempt, which when I had well conſidered, I curſed my owne follye that would ſo raſhlye condiſcende to take in hande, I knewe not what: for neyther wyſt I where <hi>Marſes</hi> Court ſhoulde bée, neyther knew I by what deuiſe I might get thyther, the remembraunce whereof brought mée almoſt to a kinde of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how I might proſecute, or by what meanes I might performe my promiſe: but when I had called to minde the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gods, who commonly bée aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtaunt to all diſtreſſed wightes: I began ſomwhat to comfort my ſelfe in hope, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe to finde ſome fauour vſyng this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticion as followeth, If the humble ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of wretched wights, may any thing preuayle before you, the celeſtiall Gods vouchſafe moſt humblye than I beſéeche you, that my pytyfull plaintes might ſo moue you to helpe mée in this diſtreſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:6409:9"/>
that through your mighty powers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence deuine: I might yet in the ende bring my attempt to ſome happy effect.</p>
            <p>But as I continued in this contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion I might beholde one ſtanding by mée clothed all in white, holding in his hande a rodde, which ſéemed all of maſſye Golde, by which ſigne I dyd knowe it to bée <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> who in this wyſe ſayde vnto mée.</p>
            <p>The Gods hath liſtened to thy prayers, and in ſome part yelded to thy requeſt: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſe therefore and with ſpéede prepare thy ſelfe to followe mée, with that me thought on both my ſhoulders there were ſodainly growne a payre of winges of maruailous bigneſſe, and as I perceiued my guyde ſoftly to ſoare awaye, I aſſayde with my ſelfe howe I coulde followe, whiche mée thought I could doe euen at pleaſure, and as well as though I had beene practiſed in flying many a daye before, and after wée had thus flyed a whyle togeather, I looked about, and I might vnderneath mée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde Cityes, Townes, Caſtelles, Wooddes, diuerſe Hylles, and Valleys, wherein I tooke great pleaſure and delight and muche reioyſed with my ſelfe to ſée
<pb facs="tcp:6409:10"/>
theſe newe and vnaquainted thinges but with in ſhorte ſpace we were ſo mounted that I had cleane loſte the ſight: of altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which was belowe and then I might perceiue a merueilouſe, huge and ſumti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe Caſtell, ſtanding on a pleſaunt plotte directly ouer againſte vs, toward the which my guide began to bend his courſe and I following hym till we were come in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to it, where vpon a very fayre gréene we ſtayde oure ſelues,<note place="margin">Marcial exerciſes.</note> and as I ſtoode ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing aboute I might perceiue greate rowts of people that iſhewed out and in at the gates and almoſte on euery parte of this caſtel they were vſing many exerſiſes ſome were running at the tilte, others at the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others were puſhing with the pike, ſom were throwing of the dartes, ſome were exerciſing the Caliuer in manner of ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe, and many were on horſebacke, the one hauing the other in chace,</p>
            <p>Theſe ſightes made mée greatly to muſe, but my guide I thinke of purpoſe to cut mée from my farther imagination, ſayde: Loe,<note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Mars his Court.</note> here quod he the Court of <hi>Mars,</hi> where thou mayſt beholde thoſe bleſſed wightes, who ſpent theyr paſſed dayes in defence of

<pb facs="tcp:6409:11"/>
they are beſet with an infinite number of Auncients: In the which as I do geſſe, the Armes of diuerſe Countreys be diſplaid: But on the one part of the Caſtle, I maye beholde diuerſe Auncientes, bearing the Armes of Englande, they bée lykewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with a great number of others, al bearing Saint <hi>Georges</hi> Croſſe, yet in them the Armes of noble men and Gentlemen, &amp; amongſt them many which my ſelfe dyd partlye knowe, nowe it ſéemeth vnto mée, thoſe Auncientes ſhould pertayne to ſuch as were valliaunt Princes, couragious Captaines, and expert Souldiours, and that their Armes and coullors bée there diſplayed, in ſigne of their immortal fame, and that as well of the inferiour Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as of the moſt mightye Prince.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt rightly deamed ſayd the God, and lyke as thou ſéeſt their Armes and coullours aduaunced in the toppes of the Towers, ſo their noble actes and valliant Conqueſtes bée liuelye deſcribed on euery wall within that Princelye Pallace, to their perpetuall remembrance: But now with ſpéede prepare thy ſelfe to finyſhe thy pretence? beholde the place where thou

            <p>I wyſt not then howe to requite the curteſey of the God, nor yet what reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I might vſe at my departure, in the ende with a homelye manner of geuing thankes, I tooke my leaue directing my courſe towardes this glorious Court, and as I ſoftlye paſſed gaſing here and there, I might perceyue a great company of Gentlemen all brauely mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, who for their diſports were running at the King: amongſt whome there were ſome that I my ſelfe had very wel known and perfectlye againe had called to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce as I ſawe them ryde: The firſt of them was Captaine Dercy, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right honourable Lord Dercy, whoſe ſouldiour I ſometime was at New Hauen, where the Gods aſpecting his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſition bereft vs of this noble Gentleman, although to our griefe and ſorrowe yet to his continuall comfort and conſolation, where hée now hath reſydence amongſt the moſt renowned wightes.</p>

but al next to the entry into the Hall, there was curiouſly deſcribed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victorious actes of the moſt renowned Prince, King Henrye the eyght, howe he diſcomfited the whole power of France at the time of the ſéege of <hi>Turwin,</hi> when as he retayned the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> with all his reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue: who came to the campe wearing, a red Croſſe as one of the Kinges ſouldiers and after howe the towne was taken and left all raſed: then ſawe I <hi>Turnay</hi> ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the King, and of many a noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit done before the ſtrong and forcable towne of Bullein and howe it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken by this noble Prince.</p>
            <p>Theſe with a nomber of other hiſtories were there ſo liuelye diſplayed all in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magery of pure goulde ſo curiouſly ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miled as they rather ſeemed to be euen nowe a doing then the monumentes of thinges, that were done and paſte. And as I was determined to haue gone into the hall, I hearde a greate noyſe of trumpets, ſownding in manner as they vſe to doe at triumphes: and as I looked towarde the gate, I might behoulde a goodly perſonage that was entering, who for hys Ieſture

            <p>Why, what art thou quod he, or how long haſt thou béene here a Courtier, that doeſt not yet know the noble Captaine Audley, whoſe proueſſe and valiaunce, as it hath made him famous to euery inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo hée is lykewiſe honoured of each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned wight.</p>

            <p>Well quod hée, if that bée thy want, the beſt aduiſe that I can geue is this, that if thy cauſe require any haſte, it were good thou madeſt ſpéede to the place where thou mighteſt haue quicke diſpatch,<note place="margin">Mars <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

            <p>In the middeſt of this Hall there ſtoode a Wagon, the which was called the Chariot of deadlye debate, there was painted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it many tragicall diſcourſes, and ſundry Ciuyll diſſencions: I might ſée the great controuerſy betwéene <hi>Iulius Caeſer</hi> &amp;

               <p>A Captayn ought firſt to teach his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, how to kepe the order of aray, and to inſtruct them, that they may know how to march, to learne them to vnderſtand the ſounds of Drums, and Trompets, wherby they are commaunded what they ought to do, and bicauſe it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth of ordinary, that when men be redye to ioyne in fight, they come to gither with great ſhoutes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, by reaſon wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of the Captaynes, may not many tymes be hard, nor vnderſtand: it is therfore requiſit to make them to obey to ſignes, as by caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his armes a broad, when he wold haue them to march wider, by bringing his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to gither, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue them to march cloſe, by holding vp his hand, when he would haue them to ſtand ſtill, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him ſelfe towardes them, if he would haue them turne, and thus to inſtruct them

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6409:57"/>The ſecond ſort be thoſe that be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye called Coaſters, and bée ſuche as hath little ſkill in the vſe of Inſtruments, but their helpe is onlye by knowyng of the Land where they happen to fall, or elſe ſometyme by ſounding of the Depth, or by knowing what ground they haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the place wher they ſound, &amp; ſuch other lyke, as experyence hath taughte them, ſo that where there is occaſion of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at the Sea, ther muſt reſpect be had to the place when the ſeruice ſhould be done, and thereafter to make the choice of the Maiſter.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as Engliſh men are not greately troubled with Warres, on the Sea, but only vpon theyr own Coaſts, the laſt ſorte of Maryners are therefore thought moſte requiſite to bée appoynted for Mayſters, the reaſon is, bycauſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is inuironed with <hi>Holand, Sealand,</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> on the one ſyde, and with <hi>Ireland</hi> on the other ſyde, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the Chanyell is ſo narowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene Land and Land, that it is a great chaunce that a Shippe being betwéene eyther of theſe places, ſhould not once

within xxiiii. houres fall, eyther with the one, or with the other, and then the perfect coaſter that can ryghtly deſerne to make &amp; know the lande, is for many occaſions the méeteſt man to ſerue in theſe afayres: and bicauſe the Maiſters charge is eſpecially to kéepe the Ship in good ſecuritie when ſtormes and tempeſtes happen to fall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ther is here no Sea rome to try it out, but muſt ſéeke ſome place to herbour themſelues, as wynde &amp; weather will geue them leaue, I haue therfore briefly ſhewed how to make choyce of ſuch a one as might be moſt fyt to aunſwer the purpoſe.</p>

               <p>An other cauſe why I would refuſe ſuche for Souldiers is this, becauſe the order of ſeruice in theſe daies conſiſteth much in the quickneſſe, nimbleneſſe and redineſſe in Souldiers and this celerytie is not to be found in Huſbandmen, or laboryng men.</p>
               <p>Furthermore they are vtterly voyde of one of the greateſt graces that to a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doth pertayne.</p>
               <p>Which is to be delightſome in the wearing of his apparell and in the keeping of his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture: for lyke as there was yet neuer any excelent Artificer whiche hath not had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard in the keepyng of ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as apertayneth to his facultie in a neat and decent manner, ſo queſtionleſſe he he wyll neuer proue to be good Souldier, that hath not delight in the keping of his fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niture, wherewith he is apoynted to ſerue in a braue and galant order.</p>
               <p>And in my opinion one of the greateſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes
<pb facs="tcp:6409:64"/>
that maye be vſed in the choyce of a Souldier in whome there hath bin had no maner of triall, is to haue conſideration in his order of apparell, for he that taketh not ſome felycitie in the wearynge of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in good order and faſhion, wil neuer take any pleaſure in the keepynge of his furniture, and to be ſhort wyll neuer proue to be a good Souldier, for what vnſéemlyer ſighte may there be when a Souldier ſhall come into the Féelde with his Armour all ruſtye, the ioyntes vnriueted, the Leather and Buckels all broken and tyed together with poynts, his Sworde halfe without a ſcabard, his Pyke head vnuayled, and ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the reſte, his Caliuer ſo verniſht with ruſt, that the Cocke wyll not play, and then his game wyll not goe, as they tearme it, his Morryan with one cheeck off, and an other one, or els hanginge a ſwaſhe lyke a Hogge new hunted, and although that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery band hath of ordinary Armorers, and other that be appoynted for the mendyng of any the premeſſes, yet the piniſhneſſe is ſuch, or rather the ſlouthfullneſſe of a many of lubbers ſo great, that they cannot vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to cary them where they might haue

ſhoote aboue ten ſcore, that .ii. hundred of the reſt, wyll ſhoote ſhorte of .ix. ſcore, and is not this a peece of aduantage thinkeſt thou? when euery Calyuer that is brought into the Feelde wyl carry a ſhot xviii. ſcore and, xx. ſcore, and euery Muſquet .xxiiii, and xxx. ſcore.</p>
               <p>Beſides this euery Buſhe, euery Hedge, euery Ditch, euery Tree, and almoſt euery Moalhil is a ſufficient ſafgarde for a ſhotte, where the Archer is little worſe, but on a playne, when the ſhotte wyll conuay them ſelues into euery couerte, that the Archer ſhall not ſee whereat to ſhoote, and yet hee himſelfe remayne a fayre marke for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or els can vſe no ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Now whether part hath the aduantage, I thinke may well be deemed, and whether weapon is of greateſt force, a man maye eaſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6409:67"/>But let it be that one thowſand Archers and one thowſande ſhot ſhould meete in the playne Feelde where no vantage were to be taken by the ground, &amp; admit they were ioyned in ſkirmiſh, within .viii. or .ix. ſcore where the Archer is able to ſhutte twice to the others once, wherby the Arrowes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming ſo thick amongſt them, wil ſo aſtone them that the contrarye part ſhall not well know where at to ſhoote.</p>

               <p>But thoſe that frame this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath little practiſe in the vſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuer, and leſſe experience in the order of a ſkyrmiſhe for if a thowſand Archers were brought into the Feelde I truſt all woulde not be brought to ſhootte at one inſtant for yf they were, ſome of them would ſhoote to ſmall a vayle, as he that hath experience can well ſay.</p>
               <p>And yet if there were no other aduantage to be vſed in ſkirmſhe, but who can ſhoote faſteſt he that is a ready ſhotte I dare ſay, would be loth that an Archer ſhould ſhoots aboue, viii. times to his .v.</p>
               <p>And this aduantage in often ſhootyng is not ſo great in the one but the difference is much more in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, conſideri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their force

               <p>But to ſhew thée what farther aduantage the ſhot hath of the Archer thou ſhalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that where the Archer may ſhoot both wide ſhort and gone, the other may ſhoott but wyde onely. But becauſe thou mayſt the better perceayue my meanynge thou muſt conſider that when the Archer ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any diſtance of grounde, the Arrowe commeth compaſſe of a great height, ſo that when it commeth where it ſhould indanger, which is, with in the compaſſe of mans height it falleth preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground and hath but as it were one lightyng place and paraduenture may come directly ouer one mans head and fall right at an other mans feet which ſtandeth but .iii, yeardes behind, where if it had falne but one foote ſhorter, it had indaungered the firſte ſo yf it had gone but one or two foo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

carried away within the compaſſe of mans height, whiche aduantage to ſuch as hath reaſon to decerne it arighte ſhall perceyue, that one ſhotte from the Muſquet or Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is of greater poſſibilytie to indaunger then fiue that ſhall come from the beſte Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that is brought into the Feelde.</p>

               <p>Nay not ſo neyther, was it any part of my pretence ſo abſolutlye to obiecte the Archer nor yet to make hym of ſo ſmall effect, but that his ſeruice is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not to be forborne, for ſo it mighte as well be ſayde what ſhould Horſemen do in the Feelde where the enemye hath picks to defende them againſt whom they coulde

And when I was come into the vpper Court, the beauty thereof, was not ſo far excéeding, but the Muſick which I hard in euery corner, was as ſwéete and delcta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: from thence I paſſed into a ſumptious Hall which was richly hanged with clothe of Arres work, wherein was wonderfully wrought many a famous Hiſtory, tending all to the aduancemente of the Goddes <hi>Venus,</hi> and of <hi>Cupid</hi> her ſonne, ſhewinge how it hath cauſed the ſtronge and myghty to become feeble and weake, the Cowarde and daſtarde, to be valyant and hardye, the wylde and ſauage to be humble and meek, the fierceſte and furyous to be gentyll and lowly, the wiſe and learned to be foolyſhe and fond: and not onely men that hath bin thus tranſformed, but euen the Goddes them ſelues, hath become ſubiecte &amp; thral, and conſtrained to obey to <hi>Venus</hi> and her lawes.</p>

            <p>This Docter, for that he was of counſell with the Lords of <hi>Chabry,</hi> in proces of time had ſo good credit both of the Lorde and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that oftentimes he entred into the cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of the Lady, her Lord being abſent, and woulde there conſult with her in her Bed, wherof the Lorde was nothing ſuſpicious, but it came that on a daye, (during the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lorde of <hi>Chabry</hi>) this Doctour came to viſyte and ſée this Madame, lying yet in her Bedde, where hée bent him ſelfe

Is it not, vnto me, great dammage?

This knaue hauing receiued a certayne ſum of money of this Doctor, aſſured him to make him a good accompt of that he hoped for: and he fayled not of this promiſe, for certen dayes after, they béeing on hunting, as the moſte part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruants were folowing the chaſe of the Hare, the poore young man reſting him ſelfe vpon a high rocke, from the which the going downe was very perillous, for the headlong ſteepeneſſe thereof vpon the one ſide.

After the funerals of this young man, ſéeing that all hir ſeruaunts began to ſuſpect of their priuie dealings, and doubted of their ouer muche familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſhe communicated and conferred with hir beloued Doctor, of the ende of all their enterpriſes, that is, howe they might bring it to paſſe, that they might ioyne togither in mariage: but <hi>Tolonio</hi> (béeing alreadie married to a wife as ſage and vertuous as he was vile and miſchéeuous) deliberated to make ſome ſecrete riddaunce of hir by death, how deare ſoeuer it coſt him.

This wicked and couetous Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor did this, not for any great or extreme loue he bare vnto hir, when he deſired ſo muche to marrie: for he knewe very well that commonly they are wont to intertene

and imbrace traytours, to ayde them with their diueliſhe and ſubtil inuentions: euen ſo <hi>Tolonio</hi> knowing that the Lady of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bry</hi> was riche and well monied, purpoſed (his wife béeing dead) to marrie hir, to haue the ſpoyle of hir goods, and then after (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture) to make hir to treade the ſame pathe, traced by ſo many murthers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the meanes bothe of the one and of the other: Neuertheleſſe he did not yet knowe which way to perfourme his wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deſire. O wicked and vnbrideled coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, how haſt thou depraued and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched the ſpirites of men at this day? Truely the father is not well aſſured of his ſonne, the neighbour dothe feare the ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and deceipts of his neighbour. And the Prince oftentimes is in daunger of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, enuironed and compaſſed on euery ſide with his garde and miniſters: for the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe deſire to haue, blindeth ſo rightly the ſences of man, that he betrayeth his Lorde to enriche him ſelfe: and he to the ſame end dothe ſell his friende, another aduaunceth the death of him, for whoſe life he oughte continually to pray. And the thing is come to ſuche diſorder, that euen the ſacred or
<pb facs="tcp:6409:91"/>
holy thinges them ſelues, haue felte the poyſon and venime of this curſed beaſt, the whiche howe farre foorth ſhe extendeth hir forces, ſo muche dothe this worlde become more miſcheous, and men more trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſloyall. Now to returne againe to our bloudy Lawyer, whiche did nothing but as it were buylde caſtles in the ayre vpon the deliberation taken in the death of hys wife, for he held (as they ſay) the wolfe by the eares, not knowing howe to leaue him, nor yet with what aſſurance to holde him, without the danger and perill of hys perſon. Firſte he deliberated to aſſay by poyſon to ende hir daies, but that way ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto hym verie daungerous. Then he caſte in hys mynde to make hir to bée murdered by hym whiche had before by his commaundement committed the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the perſon of the Sonne of the L. of <hi>Chabry,</hi> but that way lyked him not, for the chaſt dame ſeldome or neuer wente out of hir own houſe. Finally ledde by his owne fooliſhe appetyte, and lefte in the handes of the deuill, he determined to vſe none other meanes for this exployte, but
<pb facs="tcp:6409:91"/>
his owne proper handes. And therfore one night being in bed with his wife, wrything a table napkin with force about hir necke, ſtrangled hir, and as ſhe was vpon the ende and laſte gaſpe of hir life, the varlet, (thinking to make his matter good) made an outcrye, ſaying to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that came in, that the rewme falling into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throte of his wife, choked hir, and brought hir to that poynte that ſhe was paſt remedie of life, the which thing was eaſilie credited and beléeued of them that came in, and had paſſed without further queſtion or accompte to be made of it, but that the father of this miſerable deceaſſed came to this crye, the whiche the nighte before hadde ſupped wyth his daughter, leauing hir as whole and ſounde, and in as good caſe as euer ſhee had been in all hir lyfe before. Nowe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beholding the vyſage and throote of hys myſerable Daughter, perceyued by and by that hee hadde ended hyr dayes by violente deathe, and that the Rewme that hadde chooked hyr, was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the handes of hyr Huſbande or of ſome other by his appoyntment: whiche
<pb facs="tcp:6409:92"/>
he perceyued by the blackneſſe and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about hir face and throte. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe diſſembling this anger, and couering his mourning, he purpoſed to aduenge him ſelfe in ſuch ſorte, that he would make him an example to all murtherers of their chaſt and honeſt wiues. And the better to attayn his purpoſe, he ſayde vnto <hi>Tolonio,</hi> My ſonne, I pray thée take order for the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of hir Obſequies and Funerals, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the demerites of bothe our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in the meane time I will go into the Towne, minding to make quicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and to ayde you in any thing that ſhall be requiſite. The Aduocate occupying him ſelfe about the pompe and preparation of the Funerals of his wife, his father in lawe halfe tranſported with dolour and griefe, went to ſéeke out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> criminall Iudge of the Towne, whome he prayed to come to ſée the moſte deteſtable facte that man could imagine to thinke, and of whiche he would haue compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he were not more cruell than <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> whiche for his fierce and cruell nature was ſurnamed the common enimie of mankind. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, aſwell to be readie (as his office
<pb facs="tcp:6409:92"/>
required) to render to euery man iuſtice, as to ſée what newe thing that ſhoulde be, whereof he had made to him relation, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, accompanied with a troupe of Sargeants and neighbours to backe him, and arriued at the houſe of <hi>Tolonio,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering out of meaſure, ſéeing the dead body in that order, and yet more maruelled, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the father of the deceaſſed to vſe to him theſe or ſuche like words: Syr, if this preſent ſpectacle be not ſtraunge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, or if the teares of a ſorrowfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſing his child ſo miſchieuouſly, moue you not to compaſſion, I ſuppoſe that all impunitie of vice and ſinne hathe place on your behalfe. I knowe neuertheleſſe, that at the firſt bluſhe, you will thinke ſtraunge of that I pretende to ſay vnto you, but the thing beeing well and exactly vnderſtoode, you ſhall be made certayne of my vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of the iniquitie of him, whiche hath ſo gréeuouſly wounded my heart, that I feare it will cauſe my death, the whiche I woulde rather haue wiſhed a thouſande folde, than to ſee this lamentable and pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tragedie vpon my daughter, whome, I ſay, hathe bin trayterouſly ſlayne in hir

bedde by the deteſtable murtherer whiche you ſée, and whom amongſt all other I had choſen for the loyall ſpouſe and huſband of my daughter, and the ſucceſſor in time to come of the goods that God hath giuen me: You ſée ſir the euident ſignes &amp; open marks howe ſhe hath bin ſtrangled, and it is well knowen that ſhe layde hir downe as ſound and mery as any of vs. Alas ſyr haue pitie on my deſolate houſe, venge with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſworde of Iuſtice the iniurie done to my daughter, and the heartbreake that afflicteth the ſoule of the father: puniſhe with extremitie the moſt miſchéeuous deede that euer was done in this countrey, to ſée ſo ſtraunge and barbarous crueltie of a huſbande, a man of ſuch qualitie and knowledge, yea the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande of one of the moſt vertuous Dames that mighte be founde, and neuertheleſſe without iuſt occaſion hath murthered hir as vniuſtly as he is miſchieuous and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. Alas ſi, the onely hope I haue, is that euen the Gods wil make you to know the wicked acts of this vngracious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and thervpon to extend iuſtice, haue letted me to venge the wrong that I aſſure my ſelfe to haue receiued of this homicide. And wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:6409:93"/>
to continue his talke further, his tung fayling he began to weepe, in ſuch ſort that the Iudge moued to pitie, ſayde vnto the Doctor: You heare that which your father in Law ſayth agaynſt you, neuertheleſſe I ſee you not anſwere one poynt of thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations that he hath laid before you. But the infamous and adulterous murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, iudged by the teſtimonie of his owne wycked conſcience, and condemned by the memorie of his filthy and abhominable factes paſte, coulde not expreſſe nor vtter one onely worde to refute and reproue the accuſation layde before hym by hys Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Lawe. The Iudge hauing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled as muche as was poſſible of thys, knowing the Doctor to bée a man verye Eloquente, prompte, and readie in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, doubted exceedingly of his cace: &amp; thus pondering and weying the matter within him ſelfe, he immediately deſired the iudgements of diuers expert and well learned Phiſitions and Surgeons, whiche all ſayde that the deceaſſed was dead by the violence of ſome one that had ſtrangled hir. Then the Iudge layde handes on the louer of the Lady of <hi>Chabry,</hi> and ſente

the which hearing the day of his deathe to approch, bathed in teares, knowledging his ſinne, and earneſtly repenting him of hys faultes, knéeling down vpon the earth, and addreſſing his blubbered eies vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, began to ſpeake in this ſort: Ah cruel fate, that from ſo highe degrée of honor and reputation, am nowe in one moment fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the depthe of infamie &amp; perpetuall ſhame. O what a notable example maye they take in me, that put their confidence in the ſubtiltie of their iudgements and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne prudence? what a looking glaſſe is offered to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> put neceſſitie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fortune? what a liuely picture am I, to aduertiſe ſecrete ſinners to acknowledge their faults, ſeeing that at the end the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liuers (althogh they haue long enioyed the contentments of their cruell appetites) they ſhall yet at the laſt be diſcouered with their iniquities, leauing (as I doo) their renowme defaced, &amp; their life (which finally ſhall ende) ignomious, the memorie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall be left to the poſteritie.

moſt miſchieuous &amp; moſte curſed creature that euer nature brought foorth. This his oration thus ended, he was led to the place of execution, where he ended his wretched life, to the great contentment of his father in lawe, and all the dames of the countrey, ſauing that miſchieuous &amp; miſerable dame the Lady of <hi>Chabry,</hi> which knowing that diligent inquiſition was made of the place wherevnto ſhe was retired, and that they went about by al meanes to recouer hir, to the ende to do iuſtice on hir, not knowing hir ſelfe ſufficiently aſſured in <hi>Poget,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take the way to <hi>Genes</hi>: and ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken and tranſported hir baggage, tooke his iourney, accompanied with a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, who robbed hir of that ſhe had: after béeing in theſe extremities, ſhe addreſſed hir ſelfe to an honeſt widdowe, where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring hir extreme neceſſitie, thys good widdowe receyued hir very beningly, and perceyuing hir by hir demeanours to be ſome Gentlewoman, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto hir hir daughters in gouernment.

ruled a great troupe of ſeruantes &amp; maids, was now conſtrayned to obey vnto ſuche a one, which was muche inferior to hir: and agayne ſhée which in hir young yeares had béen delicately and with great care nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; brought vp, now drawing vpon the end of hir days, ſhe ſuffred perpetual exile, ſubiect to the pleaſure of another, preſt and ready (as ſhe did in déede) to die out of hir country, &amp; to receyue ſepulcher in another place, then in the Monument &amp; tombe of hir Progenitors. This is then the ende of the vnhoneſt loue of theſe laciuious adultrers: beholde the frutes of a trée ſo deteſtable &amp; pernitious.

               <pb facs="tcp:6409:96"/>This Hiſtory thus finiſhed, my thought was very ſtraunge, but in ſpecially to be told in <hi>Venus</hi> Court, which te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſo much to the deprauation of her Lawes, wherfore I aſked of Lady <hi>Countenance,</hi> what he ſhould be that had vſed ſuch lauiſh ſpeache: who aunſwered, that it was one <hi>Bandelio,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> not far vnlyke in condicions, to the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times vſed by words to inuay againſte that which actually he ſo much frequented, ſo ther be many which with ſharp and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words, wil outwardly ſeme to reproue ſuch as yelde themſelues to loue, and yet in their déedes ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo earneſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of <hi>Venus</hi> and her Lawes, as they worthely demerite to be ſhryned Saints. But aboue all theſe deuiſes, I had a ſpeciall regard to the bewti of the Chamber which was wonderful to behold. In the middle of the Roofe ther was artificially wrought, a knot of maſſy gold, in maner foure ſquare, and in the middeſt of this knot was placed a ſtone of a marueilous bigneſſe, whoſe brightnes did ſo excede, that it daſeled my eyes, I was not able to behould it in euery ſquare, ther was likewiſe ſet a rich <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raud,</hi>

from the which there iſſued forthe a Vine, in maner of a fret, which ſpreading all the Chamber, as was wonderfull to be holde, the braunches and leaues were all of pure Golde, curiouſly Enameled, in ſtede of Grapes, the <hi>Rubyes</hi> ther did ſhine which were correſpondent to the reſidew of the worke, the hangings wer al of Arras, very richly wrought.

            <p>Hauing paſſed this Chamber, we came into a Gallery, which in curioſitie, or work<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manſhip, in euery reſpect, was as far exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reſt, as <hi>Phebus</hi> Rayes, of light, excedeth euery other Starre, in the vpper ende wherof, ther were many worthy Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, whoſe bewty might welbe compared to the place.
