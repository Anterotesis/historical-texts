            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>You haue heer alleadged ſundrie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to haue cauſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to take the Hollanders partes, it is reaſon then that If ſo bee I cannot allow them for ſufficient reaſons, I prooue them not ſo to bee, which by your patience &amp; permiſsion, I think I ſhalbe able to do.</p>
               <p>The firſt point is about their beeing oppreſſed and wronged by the King of <hi>Spayn,</hi> and in danger to bee broght vnder the ſeueritie of a Spaniſh inquiſition.</p>
               <p>That theſe people lyued in obedience of <hi>King Phillip the ſecond</hi> of <hi>Spayn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as did all the other inhabitants of the ſeuenteen Netherland Prouinces, acknowledging him as their true &amp; lawfull Soueraigne Lord, as they had acknowledged his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceters before him from whome hee ſucceſsyuely inherited thoſe countries, no man can make anie doubt or queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, The queſtion then is whether this King
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13336:7"/>
when he came to the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theſe countries, did impoſe vpon the people anie preſſures more then his former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters had donne, but who is able to ſhew that he did? The ſayd King beeing then in as full and quiet poſſeſsion of all thoſe countries as euer anie of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters had bin, &amp; departing from thence towards <hi>Spayn</hi> in the yeare 1559. hee left none of his Netherland ſubiects for anie cauſe of innouation, in anie thing, anie whit diſguſted, but in as great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie as euer they had bin, Hee left behind him in thoſe countries no Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Gouernours nor Soldiers, but gaue the particular gouernments to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the countrie it ſelf, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Gouernment of them all, vnto his naturall ſiſter the Ducheſſe of <hi>Parma,</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame countrie borne, what wrong in anie reſpect was heer donne them? who complayned of anie wrong? why was not the good peace and reciprocall loue between this King
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13336:7"/>
and his Netherland ſubiects continued? who began the breach? what actions of innouation cauſed it? proceeded it from this Prince or from the Netherland people?</p>

The blame that the King of <hi>Spayn</hi> heerin deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, is, that hee was ſo much ouer ſhot that when hee heard of their breaking down of Alters, &amp; Images in Churches, of their robbing and carying thence of ſiluer Chalices, patrens, cruets, candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, lamps, &amp; reliquaries, with the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie, and whatſoeuer they might make monie of, euen to the verie belles in the ſteeples, he had not comended it to be wel donne, and ſent them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes for ſo dooing, &amp; ſo haue let them runne on eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the taking of the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix out of the Churche, and hanging it

ſeeking out of ſome other meaning, if this had bin requiſite themſelues had known it beſt, &amp; could beſt haue bin the interpreters, &amp; ſo without all doubt would haue bin, if the intention of Chriſte had bin ſuch, for neuer would they haue letten all enſuying Chriſtians of the world as well of the Greek as of the Latin Churche and all others, haue run on in the belieuing his woordes as they were ſpoken, vntill hee ſhould ſend new teachers into the world to interpreet his meaning fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares after they were ſpoken, which cannot ſtand with the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and goodnes of God, But to the contrarie that no ſuch interpretation was by God intended, is cleerly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to all the world, by the confuſion which hee hath permitted to bee among the interpreters, the one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting his woordes one way, the other another way, &amp; ſo contrarie &amp; diſcorda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that no reconciliation can bring them

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Red-ſcarf.</speaker>
               <p>I haue alredie told you that I am no diuine, and I had not thought to haue bin by you put to defend matter of religion, but ſeeing you haue again put mee to it, and that you think you haue put mee down about it. If I cannot recouer my ſelf I ſuppoſe you wil triumphe and trample vpon mee. True it is that Chriſte inſtituted and celebrated this B. Sacrament vpon a table, and not vpon an Altar, and Proteſtants do alſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their communion vpon a table,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13336:29"/>
wherein they ſhew themſelues to teach and controlle their Patriarche Luther, who celebrated his communion vpon an Altar, as all his trueſt followes in <hi>Germanie</hi> continew to do, as alſo their anceters the Huſſytes of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and yet did both Huſſe and Luther, aſſure them ſelues to haue penetrated as farre into the woord as Caluinian-Proteſtants, and Anabaptiſts can aſſure themſelues to do, no Chriſtians in the world vſing tables in ſteed of Altars but onelie they, nor none denying the real preſence of Chriſtein that Sacrament but they, and their dependants.</p>
               <p>But now as touching your Proteſtants celebrating vpon a table, to the end you may diſcouer how truely they imitate Chriſte I muſt diſcouer vnto you a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trick of fraud of theirs (if I may bee ſo bold as call it ſo) which is, that they make a ſhew of exactly imitating Chriſte his manner of dooing, by the vſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles &amp; not Altars, to deceaue the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13336:30"/>
multitude, but they deny the veritie of Chriſte his woordes in the principalle matter of faith which vnto this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is belonging, which is no pettie peece of cooſinage, and moſte farre from the true imitation of Chriſte, ſeeing faith and belief importeth more then a ſhew of obſeruing his manner of dooing in the onely vſe of a table.</p>
               <p>The cauſe and reaſon why Chriſte ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated on a table, and not vpon an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, was becauſe hee had ſupped at the ſame table, &amp; after hee had ſupped he there celebrated this Sacrament, having purpoſely referred it for the laſt and moſte principall actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hee would performe in the preſence of his diſciples before his paſsion.</p>
               <p>But if Proteſtants would profeſſe herein to follow Chriſte ptecyſely, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt they not celebrate their communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon howſ-tables, in Churches, ſeeing Chriſte did not ſo, but vpon howſ-tables in priuate howſes, &amp; in paued parlers of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:13336:30"/>
ſuch howſes. It muſt alſo bee at night &amp; after ſupper, at which ſupper they muſt haue eaten a roaſted Lamb.</p>
               <p>There muſt alſo bee neither more nor leſſe then thirteene perſons at the table, and theſe muſt bee all men, for Chriſte had not one woman preſent at his celebration.</p>
               <p>There muſt neither Ghoſpel nor Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle bee red, for when Chriſte celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they were not written, Geneua ſonges muſt not thear bee ſung, but the Hymne (if Proteſtant reformation can produce it) muſt bee repeated, which was ſayd before hee and his diſciples roſe from the table.</p>
               <p>But it now appeereth that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, make a ſhew of imitating Chriſte onlie in the vſe of a howſ-table, and omitt all the reſt, which is but an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by peece meal, taking and leaving, what they liſt, at their own pleaſures And I dare confidently avouch, that if anie Sermon-maker in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13336:31"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> ſhould in his pulpit vrge the vſe of all theſe omitted thinges, for the more exact following of Chriſt, wherein muſt alſo bee compryſed his girding himſelf with a towel and his waſhing his communicants feet, hee ſhould bee exactly puniſhed for his labor, and thus may you ſee what is become of your making a howſ-table a Churche-table.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tawney-ſcarf.</speaker>
               <p>But ſay you what you can, you cannot deny but Chriſte vſed a table and not an Altar, and therefore wee imitate Chriſt more them you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Red-ſcarf.</speaker>
               <p>You make a ſhew to imitate Chriſte, and it is but in the onlie vſe of a table, which is as it were but a couer to hyde your deuiall of the veritie of the chiefeſt matter of faith, and why do you not imitate the reſt which heere I haue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned as wel as onlie the table, ſeing you ſhould better imitate Chriſte in his whole manner of dooing then in a parte
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13336:31"/>
thereof? or can you ſhew mee where you were appointed to imitate him in the vſe of a howſ-table, and not in the reſt, nor in the Sacrament of Baptiſme as wel as in this one thing of his ſupper, Chriſt was baptiſed in a riuer, why baptiſe you not alſo in riuers, vpon what warrant vſe you Fontes in Churches more then Altars.</p>
               <p>But now muſt I go further with you ſeeing you haue put mee to it, and tel you of another Communion fraud, and I pray you note it.

ſaying <hi>Do this,</hi> they had power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie giuen them to do afterward as Chriſt there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did, that is, to take bread to bleſſe it, to pronounce his ſacred woords ouer it, thereby to make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his bodie, and to adminiſter it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others as hee had adminiſtred it vnto them, and to do or ſacrifiſe this, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of him, for if this later precept had not bin giuen the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Sacrament had not bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued by the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſors, but had onlie bin there at that tyme perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſt &amp; ſo haue ceaſſed.

And why might hee not more directly and cleerly haue ſayd at the firſt. Take and eat this bread in remembrance of mee, or as a ſigne or figure of my bodie, this had bin better fitting for the forming of a Proteſtant communion, if hee had intended it, But Proteſtants to come now ſo long after, to make Chriſte a ſayer and an vnſayer, to bee hild vnpowrable to performe ſo much as he ſayd, or to haue ſpoken friuolouſly and to no purpoſe,

               <p>This practiſe of confeſsion of ſinnes albeit to the eares of new teachers it ſeemeth harſh, yet was it put in practiſe, by the holie friend of Chriſt, <hi>S.

               <p>All theſe, how different ſoeuer from ours, &amp; from one another, do as earneſtly pretend reſtauration of the ancient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Apoſtles tyme, as they for their lyues can do, In which pretence both of theires and of ours, I haue ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13336:42"/>
throughly penetrated, that I haue fully diſcerned the Idlenes thereof, for no one of them all can carrie the matter away with anie proofs or reaſons pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it ſelf, which none of the reſt can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not make his vſe of aſwell as it.</p>
               <p>That there were in the primityue Churche ſomanie different religions as now pretend to reſtore the ſame, who can belieue? That anie one is the reſtorer thereof, how ſhal it bee known which it is? ſeeing none can anie way make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf appere to be the ſame before others, If hee wil ſay that hee wil prooue it by the woord of God, how can hee make his proof appeer to others, to bee more cleere then their lyk proofs to him?</p>
               <p>When I conſider how our Puritanes do heer in <hi>England</hi> ween themſelues to bee the onlie Scripture fellowes of the world, I cannot but laugh with my ſelf to imagine how they would bee taken down with other ſcripture laddes that I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13336:43"/>
haue met withal in my travailes in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi> among Arrians, Trinitiſts, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Morauian-Anabaptiſts, Holland-Anabaptiſts, and others of pettier ſectes, that at the woord, would make but poor ſnakes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I heard a Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preacher at <hi>Augusta</hi> tel his auditorie that to deal with a Caluiniſt (inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or Puritanes) the beſt way was to take Gods woord and greaſe him wel with that about the ſnowt, telling him ſtill that Chriſte at his laſt ſupper, ſayd, <hi>Take and eat this is my bodie,</hi> &amp;c. Not ſuffring him by anie of his Caluiniſtical ſhifts, to ſlip from theſe wordes, ſo may wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude quoth hee, that either the Caluiniſt muſt make Chriſte a lyer, or bee a lyer himſelf.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Francford</hi> I heard an Anabaptiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of a Caluiniſt, what Scripture hee had for the Chriſtening of children, the Caluiniſt would haue gon about to deduce it by conſequence, away with your conſequenting quoth the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13336:43"/>
for if conſequences may bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I wil heare the Papiſts ſpeak before you, you are the verie cooſeners of the world, you brag and boaſt of profeſsion of Scripture, and when you are put to it then forſooth you are farre enough to ſeek, and not in this matter onlie of Chriſtning of Children, but of more matters beſydes, If I would put you to it, and did not ſpare you for pittie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are turnd without book alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
               <p>I could alleage vnto you ſundrie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the reſolutenes of Huſſytes, Lutherans, Anabaptiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others in their ſeuerall religions, which is ſuch that none of our ſermon-makers heer in England can anie whit go beyond them, I haue heard ſomanie of their different pulpit cryes, of the light of the Ghoſpel, of the pure woord of God, of inward illumination of ſpirit, of ſealing it with their blood and ſuch lyke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, general to all, &amp; as dulie claymed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13336:44"/>
by the one ſorte as by the other, that good experience hath taught mee to know ſuch pretenſions heer at home to bee as idle fopperies as I haue found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in other countries abroade, ſerving onlie to lead away fooles, that ſee no further then the length of their noſes.</p>
               <p>If ſuch as heer do keep the greateſt coyl in their pulpit-crying of their light of the Ghoſpel, and pure woord of God (as thogh without all contradiction they were the onlie men lyving vnder the cope of heauen that had it) would but dare to appeer among theſe other ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſortes of profeſſors of other lightes of the Ghoſpel, and other puritie of the woord, and bee vrged if they will bee belieued before all the world beſydes, to ſet down to the manifeſt view of all men, ſuch proofs and reaſons, for their aſſurednes of having the truthe, as all the reſt ſhall not bee able in the verie lyke manner to produce for theirs.</p>
               <p>Good Lord how would then our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:13336:44"/>
pulpit boaſters bee puzled, and what pouertie would then their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ghoſpel bee broght vnto? truſt mee there could nothing in this caſe bee better fitting for them the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelues back agayn into invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibillitie (if they haue reſerued the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il) for thereby might they ſaue themſelues from becoming (by beeing pointed at) the obiects of the ſporte of all the others.</p>
               <p>And thuſmuch (with deſyre of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) dare I further anouche, that I do not know, anie forreyn countrie vpon earth, wherein in anie ſorte the name of Chriſtianitie is profeſſed, where the religion of England in the iudgment of the Learned of anie of theſe whatſoeuer, is fullie and wholie allowed for good, &amp; not in one principall point or other, gainſayed &amp; contradicted.</p>
               <p>And whereas manie heer in <hi>England</hi> do ſtand verie much vpon the reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their Foxian, Martirs, as thogh
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13336:45"/>
their ſufferance for their Caluiniſtical cauſe were a marvelous, great argument of the goodnes thereof, but which of the other new pretenders cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Martirs alſo? Huſytes and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans are not without ſtore of them, and both thinking themſelues to bee much wronged by M. Fox. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites in beeing robbed by him of their Patriarche <hi>Iohn Huſse,</hi> and the Lutherans by beeing robbed by him in lyke ſorte, of theire much eſteemed martir, fryer <hi>Barnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Anabaptiſts their number farre exceedeth thoſe of M. Fox, and perhaps ten for one. They that liſt to make the calculation may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare thoſe which they haue ſet down in their book of Martirs, entituled, <hi>The Sacrifice of the Lord,</hi> with the number of thoſe that are in M.
