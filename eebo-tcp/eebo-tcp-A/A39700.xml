            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE Deſervedly Honoured Charles Duncomb, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am bold to preſent you with the Life of the Great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whom Pagans Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have extolled above the Princes his Predeceſſors, and whom the Fathers of the Church have propoſed for an Example to Chriſtian Princes, who ought to purſue his Steps.</p>
            <p>This Hiſtory, Sir, includes great Events, and one may collect from hence Inſtructions of ſingular Importance. You will obſerve herein, on one ſide <hi>Barbarians</hi> repulſed to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bounds; Rebels brought overby Swetneſs, or reduc'd to obedience by Force; Tyrants rewarded for their Cruelty and Perfidiouſneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:54793:3"/>
and the Empire thrice eſtabliſhed by the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> On the other ſide Hereſy pulled down, Idolatry confounded, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of the Age reformed, and the Church, after an Oppreſſion of ſeveral Reigns, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its former Liberty, by the Edicts of this wiſe and pious Emperor.</p>
            <p>You will obſerve here, Sir, the Spirit and Character of a Prince, who tempers his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by his Goodneſs; who never ſeparates the Intereſts of Religion from thoſe of the State; who knows how to give Laws to Men, and to ſubmit himſelf to thoſe of God; who triumphs over his Enemies, as much by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Faith and Prayers, as of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and his Arms, and who unites in his Perſon, Valor and Piety, the Grandeur of the Age, and a Chriſtian Moderation.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, Sir, but you will admire, the different Vertues, that he practiſed in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Conditions of his Life. He ſerved Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, as ſoon as his Age would permit him to bear Arms. Scarce had he ſerved any time in the Armies, but he was found capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:54793:3"/>
of commanding them. The Reputation which he gained in great Employments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him the Envy and Diſgrace of even thoſe, who ought to have protected him: but he ſupported his adverſe Fortune without Weakneſs, as he enjoyed his Proſperity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Pride. He came to the Empire at a time, when there was not only a Neceſſity to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, but to re-eſtabliſh it; and his firſt cares extended to the making his Subjects happy. He was a lover of Peace, and feared leſs to ſuffer an injuſtice, than to commit one. He put an end to ſeveral Wars through his Valor, and undertook not one through Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. He was always more inclined to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, than to puniſh; and having once aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned himſelf to his Anger, he expiated by a public Pennance the Fault, which he had committed rather by the Perſwaſion of his Mniſters, than by a Depravation of Mind.</p>
            <p>This long Retinue of glittering Actions might induce you to believe, Sir, that I ſend you the Panegyric of this Emperor, and not his Hiſtory; but you will ſee, that I don't ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
<pb facs="tcp:54793:4"/>
his Vertues, nor yet diſſemble his Faults: and that without exceeding thoſe bounds which are preſeribed me, I expoſe the actions, which are advanced as real truths, founded upon the Teſtimony of ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and not as Idea's of Perfection, that are only imaginary.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed, that the manner of Writing were anſwerable to the Dignity of the Subject. But I hope, Sir, that you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe what is wanting in the one, and that you will approve of the choice which is made of the other. As for me, I pretend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Glory of having brought in the execution of my Deſign, all the Care and Exactneſs I am capable of: Happy, if my Labors ſhall become acceptable to You, whoſe extraordinary Merits have engaged me to take the Liberty of preſenting you with this piece, which may ſerve to divert you ſometimes, after the Fatigues of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently known, Sir, that your endowments are excellent, that your thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:54793:4"/>
are equally ſtrong and ſublime, that you have not leſs of Delicacy, than Penetration and Vivacity, and that your Anſwers are as juſt and agreeable, as ready and deciſive. All theſe advantages of Mind, that ſhine in you, in a peculiar manner are ſupported by a noble Air, a greatneſs of Soul, and a Thouſand Vertues which diſtinguiſh you ſo advantagiouſly in your Country.</p>
            <p>Theſe eminent Qualities don't render you inacceſſible to thoſe, who are inferior to you; and far from diſcouraging my approach to you, they have ſuggeſted to me the Deſign of giving you this Teſtimony of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Reſpect, with which I am,</p>

THE LIFE OF <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> BOOK I.</head>
            <p n="2">II. THE Empire began to fall from that State of Grandeur and Power wherein <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had fixed it by his Piety and victorious Arms. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> two of his Sons, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one the Eaſt, the other the Weſt; but as they enjoyed not the great qualities of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo were they neither beloved of their Subjects, nor feared of their Enemies like him; and they had much ado to ſuſtain a part of that burden, which he himſelf had born with ſo much glory.</p>
            <p>It was about the ninth year of their Reign, when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was born at <hi>Italica,</hi> a little City of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the banks of the River <hi>Betis.</hi> He was of a very Noble Family, and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the race of <hi>Trajan,</hi> whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54793:7"/>
very deſirous to reſemble. His Father's name was <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Thermantia,</hi> both endowed with all the vertues that were agreeable to their Sex. He ſoon made appear an admirable nature, and he was educated with abundance of care. He had for his Tutor, one <hi>Anatolius,</hi> a learned man, that deſpiſed Riches, but forgot nothing for his advancement to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. This Philoſopher taught him the firſt principles of humane Sciences; and foreſeeing that they would ſoon rob him of his Scholar to ſend him to the War, he made haſte to frame his <hi>Genius,</hi> and rendered him in a little time ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to judge of the merit and works of learned men. He made it his principal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to inſpire him with good and generous Sentiments, by obſerving to him in Hiſtory thoſe Examples, which he ought to pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e; and gave him the firſt impreſſions of honour and probity, which ſince ruled all the actions of his Life. Scarce was <hi>Theodoſius</hi> paſt his Infancy, but his Father, who by his valor and his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was advanced to the chief employments of war, reſolved to take him along with him to the firſt expedition, that ſhould be attempted againſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. In the mean while the Empire in a little ſpace of time had undergone ſeveral revolutions! <hi>Conſtance</hi> had miſerably periſhed by the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Tyrant <hi>Magnentius: Conſtantius</hi> his Brother was dead in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> vexed at the ill ſucceſs of thoſe wars he had as ill ſuſtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Perſians. Julian</hi> his Succeſſor being inconſiderately engaged in the conqueſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54793:7"/>
had been killed in battel. And <hi>Jovian,</hi> a valiant and religious Prince, after having reigned eight months, came to dye ſuddenly in his bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtifled with the ſmoke of Coals, which had been kindled in his Chamber, in order to make it dry.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Troops, which were then in <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> advanced as far as <hi>Nicaea,</hi> and without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leiſure to pretenders to make their factions, the Army aſſembled to elect a new Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> was propoſed; and altho he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and there was ſome reaſon to fear his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere and inflexible humor, he was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding unanimouſly choſen. He was born at <hi>Cibalis</hi> in <hi>Pannonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratian</hi> his Father had raiſed himſelf by his vertue above his birth, and of a ſimple Soldier was become General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies. It is reported that he was ſo ſtrong, that five men <note place="margin">Aure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Be it as it will, he fell as ſuddenly as he was raiſed; and the ſame <hi>Constantius</hi> who had loaded him with honors and poſſeſſions, deprived him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being much diſturbed that he had received in his houſe the Tyrant <hi>Magnentius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valentinian</hi> having found the fortune of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruined, was obliged to labor himſelf to the advancement of his own. He paſſed through all the degrees of warfare, and acquitted himſelf of thoſe employments which he had, with ſo much courage and prudence, that the Soldiers ſaw him proſper without envy, and were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54793:8"/>
to ſay of him, that he deſerved much more than was conferred upon him. <hi>Jovian</hi> had made him Captain of his ſecond Troop of Guards, and left him at <hi>Ancyra,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Galatia,</hi> to command there.</p>
            <p>It was there they deputed to him, to give him advice of his election. He departed forthwith, and came to the Army the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February.</hi> He would not appear the next day, becauſe 'twas the day of Leap-year, which an ancient ſuperſtition made paſs for unlucky amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> The day following, the Army being aſſembled in the morning, he came to the Camp, and was conducted with ceremony to the Tribunal, which was prepared for him. He was inveſted with the Purple and the Crown, and proclaimed Emperor in the accuſtomed forms. After he had enjoyed for ſome time the pleaſure of the military ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, he was for making an Oration to the Army: but ſcarce had he opened his mouth, but there aroſe a great noiſe amongſt the Troops. Whether it was a Cabal of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Officers, or nothing elſe but a whimſey of the Soldiers, they cried from all parts, he muſt have a Collegue. It ſeemed either that they repented of the choice they had made, or that they had a mind to impoſe Laws upon him, whom they had elected for Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valentinian</hi> obſerved this tumult without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; and regarding firſt on one ſide, then on the other with a ſevere and threatning behavior, he made a ſign with his hand, that he would ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54793:8"/>
As ſoon as there was a ſilence made, he turn'd himſelf towards thoſe that had appeared to him the moſt warm; and after he had called them mutinous and ſeditious, <hi>Companions,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>to give me the Empire was at your Diſpoſal; but ſince I have received it, it depends upon me to judge of the neceſſities of the State, and 'tis your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obey me.</hi> He pronounced theſe words with ſo much aſſurance, that all the World was ſilent, and remained in that reſpect which was due. Then ſmoothing himſelf a little, he gave the Army thanks for the honour they had done him, and aſſured them that he would chuſe a Collegue, when it ſhould be convenient; but that he would precipitate nothing in an affair of that importance. He deſcended from his Tribunal, encircled with Eagles and Colours; and went quite through the Camp, marching fiercely in the midſt of a crowd of Officers, who ranked themſelves about him, the better to court his favour.</p>
            <p>Some days after, whether it was to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the neceſſity of Affairs, or that he had reſolved to ſatisfy the Troops; or that he had a mind to ſucceed more dexterouſly in the deſign he had to aſſociate his Brother <hi>Valens</hi> to the Empire, he aſſembled together the chief Officers of the Army, and asked their advice concerning the Choice he was about to make. <hi>Degalaïfe,</hi> General of the Horſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him with freedom: <hi>If you love but your own Family, my Lord, you have a Brother; If you</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ammian. lib. <hi>26.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>love the State, chuſe one that is able to aſſist you in the government of it.</hi> The Emperor was touched at this Anſwer, but he diſſembled his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54793:9"/>
and reſolved to do himſelf by Authority, what the Soldiers would hardly have done by Complaiſance.</p>
            <p n="5">V. He parted then from <hi>Nicaea</hi> in haſte, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the firſt of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where he made <hi>Valens</hi> Great Maſter of the Horſe, and General of the Armies of the Empire. He raiſed him to theſe Dignities, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him inſenſibly to aſcend to a greater. But being come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he kept no longer any meaſure. He carried his Brother into the Suburbs of the City, and without troubling himſelf about the conſent of the Army, or the forms of Election, he made him to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> without having before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him <hi>Caeſar;</hi> which thing had not as yet been practiſed. He put the Diadem upon his Head, and inveſted him with the Imperial Robes; and, to conclude the Ceremony, he carried him in the ſame Chariot along with him. <hi>Valens</hi> had not one quality that might attract him the eſteem, or friendſhip of the People; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ſwarthy Complexion, his Eyes ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſomething of rude and deſpicable in all his perſon, he had an irregular mind, which joined to an inſupportable preſumption, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ignorance: ſo his Election was no further approved, than as they durſt not oppoſe it. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> himſelf did not diſſemble his deſects, and held him in ſo great a dependance, that one would have ſaid he had made him his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and not his Collegue.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The Empire was then in a deplorable condition: it ſeemed that all the barbarous
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54793:9"/>
Nations were combined together at the ſame time, to ranſack and deſtroy all the Provinces of their Neighborhood. The <hi>Germans</hi> made a horrid waſte in <hi>Gaul.</hi> The <hi>Sarmats</hi> and the <hi>Quades</hi> were entred into <hi>Pannonia.</hi> The <hi>Picts</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ammian. lib. <hi>26.</hi>
               </note>and <hi>Saxons</hi> diſturbed the Peace of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Moors</hi> made Incurſions in <hi>Africk.</hi> The <hi>Goths</hi> came to pillage <hi>Thrace,</hi> even to the very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his ancient Pretenſions upon <hi>Armenia,</hi> and threatned to break the Peace he had but juſt concluded with the <hi>Romans.</hi> It was to be feared too, leſt theſe diſorders ſhould continue under two Emperors, whereof one had not ſweetneſs enough to gain the People, the other neither capacity enough, nor reſolution, to bring affairs to an end with his Enemies.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The buſineſs of Religion was as much embroiled, as that of the Empire. The Reign of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had been a time of continual perſecution againſt the Church. This Prince had ſpared no endeavors to extirpate the Faith of the <hi>Nicaean</hi> Council, and to eſtabliſh the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy of <hi>Arrius. Jovian</hi> was not content to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Church, he had uſed all his efforts to deſtroy it; and after having ſolemnly abjured the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein he had lived near twenty years, he undertook to reſtore the adoration of falſe Gods, and to renew the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Superſtitions. <hi>Jovian</hi> his Succeſſor being deſirous to remedy theſe diſorders, proteſted to the Soldiers, who choſe him Emperor, <hi>That he would not accept of the Empire, but upon condition they would all prove Chriſtians like him;</hi> and they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54793:10"/>
unanimouſly cryed, <hi>They either were, or did deſign to be.</hi> A little while after he recalled the exil'd Biſhops, and favoured the Catholicks; blaming the reſt, but yet referring them to the judgment of their Conſcience, without being willing to enter into the bottom of different Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks.</p>
            <p>It was believed that <hi>Valentinian</hi> would carry his Piety farther, as well becauſe he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hot, and went to his ends without much conduct; as alſo, that he had formerly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt with abundance of zeal. The buſineſs was thus; <hi>Julian,</hi> after his Apoſtaſy, went one day to the Temple of Fortune to offer Sacrifices there, according to his uſual cuſtom. He was accompanied with a crowd of Courtiers, whereof the greateſt part diſpoſed themſelves, through Policy, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Prince. <hi>Valentinian</hi> marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in the quality of Captain of his Guards. As they were upon entring the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, one of the Miniſters of the Sacrifice, whoſe buſineſs was to attend them there, with an intent to purify them, caſt water upon them which was conſecrated to Idols. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and thoſe of his Retinue, received the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony with reſpect. But <hi>Valentinian</hi> being ſenſible of ſome drops of this water upon his left hand, and diſcerning more upon his cloaths, ſtruck the Man rudely that came to throw it, in preſence of the Emperor, then ſhook his hand, and tore off that part of his garment which had been ſprinkled. <hi>Julian,</hi> offended at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to his Gods and him, expelled him his Court, and baniſhed him to <hi>Meliſina</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54793:10"/>
His Brother <hi>Valens</hi> follewed him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring rather to be degraded from his Arms, and to renounce his Fortune, than to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Faith.</p>
            <p>The remembrance of this bold Confeſſion filled not a few with hopes, that the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would highly re-eſtabliſh Religion. But they were deceived herein; for <hi>Valentinian</hi> was more remiſs thereupon than could be imagined, and protected the Catholicks without diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Arrians. Valens</hi> on the other ſide ſo far abandoned himſelf to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>Such was the diſpoſition of the Empire, when the two Emperors divided it amongſt themſelves. <hi>Valentinian</hi> choſe the Weſtern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces with all <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and left thoſe of the Eaſt to his Brother. They came together as far as <hi>Naiſſe,</hi> where they ſhared the Armies, and the chief Commanders, and at laſt parted at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> the one for <hi>Milan,</hi> the other to return to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Valentinian</hi> immediately applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to examine the condition of thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that lay moſt expoſed to the Inſults of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians.</hi> He paſſed into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and fought the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who had made an Incurſion therein with a great Army. After their defeat, he departed from <hi>Amiens</hi> to go to <hi>Treves.</hi> There he was in hopes to enjoy in peace the advantage of his late Victory, when he received advice from ſeveral places, that all <hi>England</hi> was ranſack'd and waſted by the Enemy; that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> had made a deſcent therein on that ſide
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54793:11"/>
neareſt <hi>Gaul;</hi> that the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> made a deſtruction to the very heart of the Country; that they had killed the Governor, and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the General of the Army; and that if things were not ſuddenly remedied, the Empire would infallibly loſe one of its faireſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. This News aſtoniſhed the Emperor, and occaſioned to him great diſturbances. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the Father of him whoſe Hiſtory we write, to paſs into that Iſland with Troops that were advanced that way, judging him alone capable of reſtoring to a better ſtate an Affair which appeared deſperate. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> departed in haſte, and took his Son with him, that he might learn the Trade of War. He rende vouz d at <hi>Bologne</hi> the Army that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined for him, and croſſing the Sea with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, which ſeemed to foretel the Event, he advanced towards <hi>London,</hi> and ſearched for the Enemies to give them Battel. He routed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Parties which he found rambling through the Country. He took away their Men, their Cattel, and all the reſt of the Booty which they drag'd along, and made a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all places round about, that every one ſhould come to ſee and repoſſeſs his own, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving but a little part of the Booty for thoſe Soldiers who were moſt fatigued. His chiefeſt care was ſtill to eaſe the People, and his firſt Inſtructions to his Son were Examples of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Juſtice; neceſſary Vertues, but rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to Men of War. After theſe firſt Succeſſes, he entred <hi>London,</hi> and encouraged
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54793:11"/>
the City, who already acknowledged him for her Deliverer.</p>
            <p>As he had to do with Enemies who diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves, and rallied at all moments to ſurprize him; he reſolved to baffle them at their own game, and to weaken them by little Skirmiſhes, being unable to engage them to a Fight. Whereupon he took the Field, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf of advantageous Poſts, divided his Army into ſeveral Bodies, and falling without delay upon one or t'other of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who had their ſeparate Intereſts, and who came rather with a deſign to pillage than to fight, he defeated them entirely, and eſtabliſhed ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in City and Country. In all theſe Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he made appear as much of Valor, as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; <note place="margin">Ammian. lib. <hi>28.</hi>
               </note>and 'tis reported of him, that he never commanded his Soldiers to an Attempt, but he firſt gave himſelf for an Example.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſhewed himſelf a worthy Son of this renowned Captain, and afforded in theſe firſt occaſions, marks of his future great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Maximus,</hi> by birth an <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> who took a pride in boaſting of his Deſcent from the Race of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſerved at the ſame time in the ſame Army. Theſe two young Men, who were one day to diſpute between them the Empire of the World, came to know one another, and ſignalized themſelves by Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Expedition. They were almoſt of the ſame age, their ſpirits, their courage were alike; and both enjoyed the ſame great paſſion to exalt themſelves by way of Arms; but they were different as to manners. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54793:12"/>
free, courteous, and generous; <hi>Maximus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, moroſe, and jealous of the deſert and reputation of another. The one was brave by vertue, the other ſo by fierceneſs; the one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to no more than the glory of ſerving Emperors, the other would gladly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to uſurp their place.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Scarce was this War concluded, but a Conſpiracy was found of no leſs danger. The Heads of which were arreſted, and condemned to death. But it was not judged convenient to put them to the queſtion, leſt there ſhould be too many Accomplices to puniſh, or their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ſhould revive thoſe Troubles, which were but juſt appeaſed. After which, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Court of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him his Son, who had been the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Labours. It was there that this young Lord made himſelf known to Prince <hi>Gratian,</hi> who, altho' a very Child, was already much inclined to favour Vertue and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The Joy which was entertained for the happy Succeſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, was ſoon diſturbed, by the News which was received of an Inſurrection of a part of <hi>Africk Firmus,</hi> one of the chief Lords of the Country, was Captain of the Rebellion. He was accus'd for having cauſed the Aſſaſſination of one of his Brothers. The <hi>Roman</hi> Governor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had attempted to deſtroy him; he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported himſelf by his Friends, and Reputation. They wrote to the Court, the one his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54793:12"/>
and Complaints, the other his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Valentinian</hi> was of a humor ſevere enough; but there were ſome convenient moments, when he ſuffered himſelf to be eaſily wrought upon. In the greateſt neceſſities of Affairs he had been careful to eaſe the People, but not ſo vigilant upon thoſe, that governed them: and altho' he was, of his own temper, inexorable for the ſlendereſt Faults, yet he would not ſo much as hear Complaints relating to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; whether it was that he thought to hurt his own Authority by leſſening theirs, even when they abuſed it; or elſe, that according to his Politicks, it was neceſſary to treat the People with an extream Rigor.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. This was the occaſion of the Revolt of <hi>Firmus.</hi> He had Advice, that they had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Letters at Court; that thoſe of his Enemy were lookt upon; that the Miniſters were won, and the Prince prepoſſeſſed. As he ſaw himſelf upon the point of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, he had recourſe to Arms. He raiſed the People, that were even impatient at the Violences and Rapines of their Governor, took on himſelf the Crown, and was proclaimed King. He took the Field forthwith, conſumed all that made reſiſtance, ſurprized the City of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> which he abandoned to his Troops, (leſt Fire and Sword ſhould be omitted) and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngroſs'd his Army with a great number of <hi>Moors,</hi> who came in multitudes to fight under his Banner. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had Orders to depart with his Son in haſte, in order to oppoſe the Rebels. He embarked with the Troops that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54793:13"/>
were deſigned him, and deſcended upon the Coaſt of <hi>Africk.</hi> There having met the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Province, he learnt of him the poſture of Affairs; and after having ſoftly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him for the Diſturbances he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he ſent him to give Orders for the ſecurity of Places, and to viſit the Garriſons. In the mean time he advanced as far as the City of <hi>Setifi,</hi> where he ſent to <hi>Firmus</hi> to enjoin him to lay down his Arms, and to return to his Duty, and that he ſhould take his choice either of Peace, or War. Whilſt he expected his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he conſidered how to manage his Troops, who were not accuſtomed to the heats of thoſe Climats, and to prevent the Tyrant, who was no leſs formidable by his Artifice and Cunning, than for his Arms and Force.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Firmus</hi> was at preſent uncertain of the Choice he was to make. A little while after he ſent Deputies to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to repreſent to him, that he had taken up Arms through Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and not through Ambition; that he aimed not at the Empire, but a particular Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who abuſed the Emperor's Authority; that he had not pretended to revolt, but to defend himſelf; that he might have Juſtice done him, or at leaſt his Life preſerved, and he would abandon his Reſentments, and disband his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> promiſed him his Pardon, if his return was cordial and ſincere, and ordered him to ſend Hoſtages. In the mean time he viſited the Coaſt, made his Legions aſſemble, joined to them ſome Troops of the Country, and commanded all his Officers to obſerve an exact
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54793:13"/>
Diſcipline, ſaying, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Soldiers ought not to ſubſist but upon the Expence of their Enemies, and that they were no better than Rebels, when they incommoded the Citizens:</hi> which attracted to him the affection of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firmus</hi> was of a Family that was numerous and powerful, by reaſon of the Lands which it poſſeſſed, and by its alliance with the principal Lords amongſt the <hi>Moors. Maſcizel,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuca</hi> his Brothers, marched with two great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of an Army; and <hi>Cyria</hi> his Siſter, a Lady of great courage, aſſiſted them with Men and Money, and raiſed by her Intrigues all <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">XV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> foreſeeing that it would be difficult to oppoſe ſo many Forces, if he ſhould give them time to join, advanced by great Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies towards <hi>Maſcizel,</hi> and preſented him Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. The <hi>Moors</hi> accepted of it, and vigorouſly ſuſtained the firſt charge of the Legions: but at length they were broken; the Vanguard cut in pieces, and the reſt ſaved themſelves in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> made himſelf Maſter of the Field, and took ſome important places for his ſecurity, where he made great proviſions of Neceſſaries: and as he went to advance further in the Country, he had advice that <hi>Maſcizel</hi> was returning with the <hi>Moors</hi> which he had rallied, and ſome freſh Troops which he had received. He joined him in a little ſpace of time, fought him, routed his whole Army, and preſſed upon him ſo briskly, that he ſcarce left him opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity enough to ſave himſelf.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54793:14"/>
XVI. The Rebels were in a conſternation at the loſs of theſe two Battels; and <hi>Firmus</hi> not knowing whom to addreſs himſelf to, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome Biſhops, whom he entreated to repair to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and to obtain of him a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his Rebellion upon any condition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Theſe Deputies were received with Honour; and upon the favourable Anſwer they brought back, <hi>Firmus</hi> himſelf departed with a ſmall Attendance, and came to the Camp of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> where this General attended him without his Tent. The Legions were under Arms with their Enſigns diſplayed, and every Soldier at the firſt noiſe of the arrival of the Captain of the Rebels, had redoubled his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firmus</hi> alighted from his Horſe, as ſoon as he perceived <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> and approaching him with a profound Reſpect, he proſtrated himſelf at his Feet to the very ground, and asked him pardon for his offence, his tears in his eyes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accuſing his raſhneſs, ſometimes his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortuue, with all the marks of an unfeigned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> received his Submiſſions but coldly, and after a long Conference which they had together, the Accommodation was concluded. The Conditions were, that <hi>Firmus</hi> ſhould furniſh Proviſions for the Army; that he ſhould leave ſome of his Relations for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages; that he ſhould releaſe all the Priſoners he had made ſince the Troubles; that he ſhould reſtore to the City of <hi>Icoſium</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and all that he had taken upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Empire; and after that he ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54793:14"/>
licentiate his Troops, and enter into the Emperor's Favor.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. <hi>Firmus</hi> returned well ſatisfied, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in leſs than two days the greateſt part of the Treaty. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> feeing ſuch fair diſpoſitions to a Peace, marched towards <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> to repair the Ruines of that City which had been burnt in the beginning of the Wars. He received in his way a deputation from the <hi>Maziques,</hi> a People of <hi>Africk,</hi> who had unſeaſonably joined with the Rebels, and came to ask Pardon for their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but his Anſwer to them was no more, than that he knew how to forgive his Enemies, but that he could not endure Traytors; and ſo ſent them away<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> reſolved to uſe all the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of War againſt the Traytors. He marched with an incredible diligence towards <hi>Tagavia,</hi> where he ſurprized a party of the revolted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, whom he deliver'd to the vengeance of the Soldiers, in order to make them learn to fear what he made them exerciſe againſt the culpable. The Tribune was executed, after his hand cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54793:15"/>
other Officers were beheaded, and all the reſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as they deſerved. This irritated General beſieged, a few days after, a Fortreſs where the moſt ſeditious of the <hi>Moors</hi> were retired. He took it by Storm, put the whole Gariſon to the Sword, and razed the Walls to the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He preſently turned upon the Coaſt of <hi>Tangier,</hi> where the <hi>Maziques</hi> were aſſembled, and after having defeated them ſeveral times, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them that Pardon which he had refuſed before.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. At laſt the heat of War having engaged him in the Enemy's Country further than he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, <hi>Cyria,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Firmus,</hi> ſuddenly cauſed an Inſurrection of the whole Province. All the People put themſelves in a poſture of Battel, as if the Signal had been given, and marched againſt the <hi>Romans. Theodoſius,</hi> who had then but a little Foot, with a Body of 3500 Horſe, and who ſaw this innumerable crowd of Enemies, was ſome time in ſuſpenſe, whether he ſhould hazard a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, or retire. The ſhame of yielding to thoſe Enemies ſo many times overcome, and the fear of diſgracing the Arms of the Empire, determined him to fight. But after having conſidered the condition of Affairs, he judged that it was better to want the obtaining of one Battel, than to loſe the advantage of all the reſt which he had gained. So he retired, always poſſeſſing himſelf of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Poſts, for fear of a ſurprize; but the Enemies perſued him obſtinately, cut off all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and reduced him to the neceſſity of expoſing himſelf to an unequal Combat in order to ſave himſelf.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54793:15"/>
XX. Hazard kept off the danger, for the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziques,</hi> whom he had juſt fubdued, were obliged to furniſh him with Troops, and they performed it. Some <hi>Roman</hi> Squadrons advanced before to conduct them to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> not knowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he was in. The <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Couriers diſcerned this Succor at a diſtance, and returned full ſpeed to give the Alarm to their Camp, as if entire Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were approaching to diſengage the General. They that kept the paſſages abandoned them, and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> taking the advantage of the moment, and gaining the Defiles, went to encamp under the City of <hi>Taves,</hi> where he ſecured his Army in the beginning of the month of <hi>February;</hi> from thence he obſerved the Enemy, and laboured to diſunite them by ſecret Negotiations, till he might be able to reduce them by force.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. In the mean time he diſpatched his Son to the Emperor <hi>Valentinian,</hi> to give him an account of the ſtate of the <hi>African</hi> Troubles, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure new Troops, in order to the entire deſtruction of the rebellious Party. The young <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was received at Court with all the conſideration that his Fathers Services and his own deſerved. <hi>Gratian</hi> was extremely glad to ſee him again, and from this time he conceived an eſteem for him, which was ſince known to the whole World.</p>
            <p>He was a Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom was ſcarce accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed thirteen years, who was already very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and who made great advances in the ſtudy of Learning under <hi>Auſonius</hi> his Tutor, one of the fineſt Genius's of his Age. He won the affection of the People by his ſweet and obliging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and it was judged from thence that he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54793:16"/>
would have the good qualities of his Father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his defects. He had been declared <hi>Auguſtus</hi> not long ſince in a conjuncture preſſing enough.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <note place="margin">Ammian. l.</note> XXII. <hi>Valentinian</hi> was fallen into a diſtemper, whereof it was not expected that he would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Every one deſtined him a Succeſſor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his fancy, as if the Empire had been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly vacant: The <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Officers, that were of credit in the Army, caſt their eyes upon <hi>Julian,</hi> firſt Secretary of State, cruel, and violent. Others made their Intreagues for <hi>Severus,</hi> Collonel of the Foot, who was not a whit more moderate than <hi>Julian.</hi> The Emperor being cured, contrary to all appearance, reflected upon the danger he had run, and reſolved to break all theſe Cabals, to aſſociate his Son to the Empire. He ſounded the inclinations of the Soldiers; and as he was aſſured of their intentions, he ordered the Army to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in a ſpacious plain, where he came in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with his whole Court. He aſcended upon his Tribunal, taking his Son by the hand, whom he had brought expreſly for the purpoſe; and after he had ſhown him to the Troops, he prayed them to conſent to the reſolution he had taken to ſhare the Empire with him.</p>
            <p>He repreſented to them that he did not pretend to uſe his own Rights any further, than as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould think them reaſonable, and that he would always have more regard to the Intereſts of the State, than to thoſe of his Family; that he preſented to them his Son, that was brought up amongſt them, and deſtined to fight with them for the defence of the Empire; that indeed he was a Child, that had neither ſtrength nor experience, but who appeared ſo well born, that it was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54793:16"/>
he would be no diſhonor to them; that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himſelf already to the ſtudy of Sciences, and to all ſorts of noble Exerciſes, to the end that he might be pleaſing to them, and know how to diſtinguiſh perſons of merit; that he would ſoon put him in a condition to march with them under the Standards of the Empire, without fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the incommodity of Seaſons, or the fatigues of War; that he would recommend to him above all things the obſervance of the publick good, as his own, and to prefer the State above his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>At theſe words, the Soldiers, tranſported with joy, interrupted him, and ſtrove who ſhould be loudeſt in proclaiming <hi>Gratian, Augustus,</hi> by clatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Arms, and ſound of Trumpets. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror encouraged by theſe Acclamations inveſted his Son with the Imperial Habits, then he kiſſed him, and with a gravity mixed with joy and tenderneſs, <q>Behold your ſelf, My Son, ſaid he to him, inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Purple of Emperors. I was deſirous of doing you this favour, and our Companions, whom you ſee here preſent, have agreed thereto. Endeavor to make your ſelf able to eaſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt your Father, and your Uncle, whoſe Collegue you commence, from this time: Diſpoſe your ſelf to remain under Arms with the patience of a ſimple Soldier; and to paſs over the <hi>Danube</hi> and <hi>Rhine</hi> frozen, at the head of the Foot: ſpare not, if 'tis convenient, your blood and life for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom you govern: Eſteem nothing below you that has any reference to the ſafety or glory of the Empire. This is the principal Advice I can give you here. The greateſt employment of my Reign hereafter, ſhall be to inſtruct you how to reign. Then turning himſelf towards the Troops,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54793:17"/>
As for you, ſaid he, ſupport the Honor of the Empire by your Arms, continue to aſſiſt us in our Wars; and preſerve to this young Emperor, whom I refer to your cares and affection, an inviolable fidelity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon aroſe another mighty Shout: <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraxus</hi> Secretary of State cried out, that <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> and his Son deſerved yet more. The whole Army renewed their Acclamations, and every one preſſed forward to view this Auguſt Youth at a nearer diſtance: whoſe Eyes were lively and ſparkling, his Face agreeable, his Behavior ſweet and noble; and a certain modeſt Majeſty, without Pride, drew him the Love and Admiration of all that beheld him. This Prince, from this time, was the Delight of the People, and his Vertues encreaſed with his Age.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>Valentinian</hi> was then upon the point of entring <hi>Germany</hi> with a puiſſant Army, to tame that wild and troubleſom Nation, that always kept the Frontiers of the Empire in alarm. His Son he took with him, and carried him beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> in the Enemies Country, to accuſtom him betimes to the fatigues and even dangers of War. This Expedition was an important one, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror undertook it of himſelf, and went there to command in perſon. Wherefore he made choice of his beſt Troops, and all his Officers of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Empire. He ordered the young <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to follow him, and obſerved in him ſo much Valor and Prudence in the divers Events of this War, that he judged him capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Armies in chief, and reſolved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him. The ſudden irruption of the <hi>Quades</hi> ſoon furniſhed him with an occaſion, to the great
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54793:17"/>
ſatisfaction of <hi>Gratian,</hi> who already intereſſed himſelf much in the fortune of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who loved glory, and was always meditating upon ſome great deſign, that might tend to his Honor, and the Advantage of the Public, attempted to make a Cauſey be continued from the Springs of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to its very mouth in the Sea. He made himſelf a draught of the Forts he would have erected on both ſides of the River, according to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the places; and having perceived that the Waters inſenſibly ruined a Fortreſs which he had built upon the <hi>Neckar,</hi> he turned the Courſe of the River by a Channel which he cauſed to be made, by force of Labour and Silver: He had a mind to fortify the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> like thoſe of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to ſerve as two Barriers to oppoſe the barbarous Nations, and to render the Empire inacceſſible to them. He ſent Orders to <hi>Equitius,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Illyrium,</hi> to paſs into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Quades,</hi> and there to erect a Cittadel, where he might hold a conſiderable Garriſon.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. The <hi>Quades</hi> lived peaceably then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their King in <hi>Moravia;</hi> and as they had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to uſurp the Lands of their Neighbors, they thought themſelves under no neceſſity to mind their own. It was formerly a puiſſant, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like People; but they had degenerated from their ancient Valor, and languiſhed for ſome time in a Lazineſs, which rendred them almoſt deſpicable. <hi>Equitius</hi> preparing himſelf to execute the Orders of the Emperor, the <hi>Quades</hi> remonſtrated to him ſoftly the injury that was done to them, and ſent Deputies to Court for to complain. <hi>Equitius</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time an anſwer was expected, gave
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54793:18"/>
Orders for the works to ceaſe, for fear of exciting Diſturbances: but <hi>Maximin,</hi> a man cruel and active, accuſed him of Negligence and Cowardiſe, and charged himſelf with the Commiſſion. He went upon the place, and ordered the continuance of the Forts which were begun, without asking the conſent of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have granted, rather than have brought a war upon themſelves. <hi>Gabinius</hi> their King went to find him, and repreſented to him modeſtly, that it was an inſult committed upon them without reaſon; that it was but juſt to let a peaceable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion live in Peace, that diſturbed not that of others; that they had no longer the Ambition of Conqueſt, but that ſtill there remained with them that of being Maſters in their own Country; that they left the Grandeur and Glory of ſubduing the World, to thoſe who were ſpurred on thereto; that as for them, they eſteemed themſelves happy enough in their freedom; In a word, that they asked no Favor, but begg'd that they might have no Injuſtice done them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maximin</hi> made an appearance of being affected with the reaſons of this Prince; and for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Friendſhip, invited him with ſome of his Retinue to a great Feaſt, where he cauſed him to be inhumanly murdered. The People, after having lamented for ſome time the death of their King, took up Arms to revenge it. Deſpair was to them in the place of Courage; and the <hi>Sarmats</hi> being joyned to them, they paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> together, and diſperſed themſelves in the Country, burning the Villages, and deſtroying all they met in their way. The Princeſs <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> Daughter of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> who had been betrothed to <hi>Gratian,</hi> was coming then from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54793:18"/>
the Eaſtern Court, to that of the Weſt, and was taking ſome refreſhment at a Country Houſe. Her Train was pillaged, ſome of her Servants taken, and ſhe herſelf had fallen into the hands of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> if <hi>Meſſala,</hi> who had been ſent to receive her, had not clapt her into a Chariot they met by accident, and brought her full ſpeed to <hi>Sirmium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Probus</hi> the <hi>Praefectus Pretorio,</hi> a fearful man, and little uſed to War, was in the City, and prepared his Horſes to make his eſcape in the night. They endeavoured to make him underſtand, that the Danger was not ſo great as he imagined, that his flight would diſcourage the Citizens, and that he would anſwer for all the miſchances, that ſhould happen to the Princeſs. At laſt, he recovered himſelf a little from his fright, and gave orders to repair the Fortifications, forthwith, and to get diſpatched from the Neighboring Garriſons ſome Companies of Archers, to defend the place in caſe of a Siege.</p>
            <p>The Enemies were contented to keep the Field. There was ſent againſt them two of the beſt Legions of the Empire, who would, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, have given them a defeat: but they fell out about Pretenſions, and Diſputes of Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and the <hi>Sarmats</hi> having forced them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately into their quarters, cut them in pieces one after another. The young <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was ſent to ſtop the courſe of theſe diſorders; and that he might act with more Authority, he was advanced to the Government of <hi>Moeſia,</hi> and the command of the Troops of that Province.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. He parted without delay; and after having obſerved the poſture of affairs, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54793:19"/>
a conſiderable body of an Army. His firſt application was to eſtabliſh an exact Diſcipline amongſt his Troops, and to chaſe out of the Country a remainder of rambling and disbanded <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who pillaged it with Impunity. He put ſome to death, and contented himſelf with having expelled the reſt out of the Limits of the Empire. Aſter which, having information, that the <hi>Sarmats</hi> appeared upon the Frontier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that their Army was enlarged by a multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in League with them, he reſolved not only to oppoſe their Paſſage, but likewiſe to draw them to a fight. The Enemies, who confided in their numbers, divided themſelves into ſeveral bodies, to make irruptions through divers places: But <hi>Theodoſius</hi> beat them in every encounter; and after having obliged them to re-unite themſelves, he went to attack them in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

that this Army without a Captain was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and retreated in diſorder, he took the field, defeated one part of them, and obliged the reſt to lay down their Arms.

fix them to their duty, was to afford them no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, and to reduce them to conſider their own proper ſafety, rather than the defence of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; that it was neceſſary for the Inconveniencies which they received to be much greater than the Advantages they were promiſed, and that <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſhould make himſelf more formidable, than <hi>Firmus</hi> had made himſelf beloved.</p>

            <p>Altho this Nation, poor and fearful, was not in a condition to defend it ſelf, they put all to Fire and Sword that they could meet with, both in City and Country, without diſtinction of Age or Sex. The greateſt part of the Inhabitants ſaved themſelves in the Mountains, being amazed to ſee amongſt them <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles, and an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in perſon; and regarding at a diſtance their Cities ſmoaking, and their Habitations reduced to Aſhes, they lamented the Deſtruction of their Neighbors, and the Deſolation of their Country. <hi>Valentinian</hi> a few days after changed his mind; and whither it was that he wanted proviſions, or that the ſeaſon was too far advanced; or whether he was aſham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

cried out that he was very unhappy in having to treat with ſuch a ſort of People; and reproached them with their inſolence and perfidiouſneſs.

his anger, which had occaſioned ſo many deaths, was at laſt the cauſe of his own.</p>
            <p>Many ſaid in his favor, that he had endeavoured to overcome his temper, but could not; that this exceſſive ſeverity was not becoming an Emperor, but had been very uſeful to the Empire; that in ordering the firſt Eunuch of the Palace to be burnt alive for having injured a Widow, he had thereby ſaved all Widows and Orphans from oppreſſion; that as to the reſt, he enjoyed more Vertues than Defects; that he had ſpared the goods of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Ammian. l. <hi>20.</hi>

            <p>The Biſhops upon this aſſemble with the reſt of the Clergy to proceed to an Election, and the People whoſe agreement was required, were called thereto.

His preſence made all the controverſies ceaſe, and the Aſſembly being re-united on a ſudden, as by a divine inſpiration, demanded <hi>Ambroſe</hi> for their Paſtor.

Notwithſtanding all his reaſons, and his reſiſtance, the People would conduct him to the Epiſcopal Throne, to which God had deſigned him, he was ordered Guards for fear he ſhould eſcape, and a Requeſt <note place="margin">Paulin. in vita Ambr.</note>preferred to the Emperor to beg his conſent to this Election.</p>
            <p>The Emperor moſt willingly agreed to it, and gave Orders that he ſhould be forthwith baptized, and conſecrated 8 days after.

            <p>This Prince replied to him wiſely, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his advice in good part; that he knew him him of a long time for an upright Man and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſſimulation, or flattery; that in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of him for his Biſhop, he had well fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, that he choſe to himſelf a Judge incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his life; that he had not ceaſed to confirm his Election, judging that one could not give too much Authority to a good Man; that he might uſe then his ordinary liberty; that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by a holy ſeverity the irregularities of the Court; and that he ſhould not fear to advertiſe even him of his miſtakes, and to apply thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which he ſhould judge convenient accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Prudence, and the Maxims of the Law of God.</p>

The death of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Father, and the diſgrace of his Son arrived in this time, by the jealouſy of the Miniſters of the Empire, and the Intrigues of the Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi> who could not endure thoſe whom he thought worthy to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him. This hatred was founded upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and Horoſcopes which he thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, and yet would endeavour to avoid them.</p>
            <p>He was a Prince who had many defects, and whoſe good qualities were extinguiſhed by the bad. Sometimes he took Reſolutions good enough, but he often wanted the force or capacity to execute them. He ſtopt the Ambition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of the Grandees, but it was almoſt always in their oppreſſion. He might have enjoyed the glory of being a good Friend, if he had known how to chuſe his friendſhips. He did not charge the Provinces with Taxes, but he ruined the beſt houſes of the Empire, and would regain upon the confiſcations of particulars, what he loſt in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the publick Impoſts. As ſoon as any one was accuſed before him to be rich, 'twas ſufficient to prove him guilty; and without putting himſelf to the trouble of diſcerning truth from falſhood, he never ceaſed to puniſh when it would prove to his advantage. He was always ready to give long Audiences to Flatterers, and was tired when they began to juſtify themſelves; which gave occaſion for Oppreſſions and Calumnies.</p>
            <p n="38">XXXVIII. There had been divers Attempts made againſt him ſince his Reign, which made him fearful and ſuſpitious. Some corrupted Courtiers made their advantage by this infirmity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54793:25"/>
and perſuaded him at every turn, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd ſome great danger; ſome to get themſelves eſteemed, and to render themſelves neceſſary; others to get rid of their Enemies without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by accuſing them of diſaffection to the Prince. All the Intrigues of Court rowled upon none but falſe Reports, and imaginary Attempts. Matters were come to that point, that it was a Crime to explicate a Prediction, or to ſpeak of the Succeſſor of <hi>Valens;</hi> this eaſineſs to believe and fear all things, was the occaſion of the loſs of ſeveral great Men, and particularly that of old <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>

He was put to the Rack, which he ſoon endured with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy enough; but when he found himſelf ſtill preſſed with Torments, he cryed out that he had things to tell of more importance than thoſe he was examined for, and which had relation to the perſon of the Prince. He was permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his breath, and as he was encouraged to ſpeak, he declared that there had been lately held a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Cabal, wherein by Witchcrafts and deteſtable Preſages, they had learnt the Deſtiny of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and the Name of him who was to ſucceed him in the Empire. He went ſo far as to name thoſe who were aſſiſtant in it; they were arreſted upon the ſpot, and durſt not deny a thing, whoſe circumſtances were already known.</p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX. It was an Intrigue of ſome perſons
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54793:26"/>
of Quality, and ſeveral <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers, who were aſſociated to know what ſhould happen after the Emperor's death. The Averſion which they had for the Chriſtian Religion, and the deſire of <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>6.</hi>

               </note>ſeeing theirs eſtabliſhed, gave them this Curioſity. They were in hopes the Oracle would name ſome of their Party; they had already before-hand caſt their eyes upon <hi>Theodorus,</hi> one of the Secretaries of <hi>Valens,</hi> of a very noble Family amongſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> eſteemed for his Probity, his Parts and Courage, who lived in the quality of a mighty Lord, and in a tumultuous Court was beloved of all the World, beſides that he kept up in his actions and diſcourſes a generous liberty. Theſe great qualities made him to be lookt upon as a perſon capable of reſtoring the worſhip of the Gods, to which he was very much diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Philoſophers being poſſeſſed by this thought, aſſembled privately together in one of their houſes. There they made a Trivet of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel Branches reſembling that of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated it with Imprecations, and extraordinary Ceremonies. They put over it a Baſon compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of different metals, about which they ranked the four and twenty Letters of the Alphabet at an equal diſtance. The moſt expert Magician of the Company, being covered with a linnen cloth, and bearing in his hands ſome Vervein, went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and began his Invocations, bowing his head ſometimes on one ſide, then on the other.

               </note>was ſuddenly obſerved to move the Ring to leap and agitate inſenſibly, and at length to fall here and there upon thoſe Letters it ſeemed to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54793:26"/>
have choſen. Theſe Letters being thus touched, left their places, and went ſucceſſively to rank themſelves upon the Table; one would have ſaid that an inviſible hand had thus collected them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: they compoſed Anſwers in heroick Verſes, which all the Aſſiſtants diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.</p>
            <p n="40">XL. The firſt thing that the Oracle informed them, was that their Curioſity ſhould coſt them all their Lives, and that the Emperor ſhould ſoon after die at <hi>Mimas</hi> of a horrible kind of death: then they were for knowing the Name of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. The inchanted Ring continuing to jump upon the Letters, collected theſe two Syllables The-o: the d came preſently to join them. Whereupon one of the Aſſiſtants interrupted the Charm, and cryed out, <hi>That their wiſhes were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and that it was the Orders of Deſtiny that</hi> Theodorus <hi>ſhould reign after</hi> Valens. They asked no further; and without conſidering the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that the Oracle had foretold them, as 'tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to believe eaſily what one wiſhes to come to paſs, they all expected the accompliſhment of the deſtiny of <hi>Theodorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">XLI. As ſoon as the Affair had been thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered at <hi>Antioch, Valens</hi> knowing that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for ſome domeſtick Affairs, ſent Guards thither to take him, and to bring him ſafe: which was done. He was examined, and he replied that he had no ſhare in this Intrigue; that ſince he came to know it, he had a deſign to reveal it to the Emperor, but that he was aſſured it was nothing elſe but a Philoſophical Curioſity; that it was a hideous Crime to attempt the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54793:27"/>
of the Empire, but that it was lawful to expect from Deſtiny, whoſe Orders were inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; that as for him, he had neither enterprized, nor depended any thing thereupon. Letters were produced to him, by which he was convicted of having flattered himſelf with the Prediction, and conſulted his Friend about the time, and means of putting it into execution.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. The Emperor cauſed his Head to be taken off, and commanded an enquiry after all his Accomplices, and to exterminate all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that ſince the Empire of <hi>Julian</hi> made open profeſſion of Magick. It was repreſented to him, that all the Priſons were already full of perſons convicted, or ſuſpect, and that ſome favour would be moſt juſt in the number: but he was offended with this Remonſtrance, and gave Orders for all to be put to death indifferently without other form of Proceſs. This cruel Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was executed, the Innocents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the Guilty, ſome periſhed by the Sword, others by Fire, many were torn in pieces by the Rack; above all, they burned the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians with their Books, and no one durſt appear in a Gown throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> leſt the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Habit ſhould make them go for <note place="margin">Ammian. l. <hi>31.</hi>
               </note>Philoſophers. There was nothing to be ſeen in <hi>Antioch</hi> but Blood diffuſed, Houſes conſumed, and Fires kindled; which rendred the Emperor ſo odious, that they made throughout the City this publick Imprecation againſt him, <hi>That</hi> Valens <hi>might himſelf one day be burnt alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which was moſt deplorable herein, was, that they made a ſoveraign judgment upon ſimple Suſpicions, without entring into any manner of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54793:27"/>
diſcuſſion. A Lady was condemned to dye, for boaſting that ſhe was recoved of a Quartan Ague <note place="margin">Ammian. l. <hi>29.</hi>
               </note>by pronouncing certain words. The Eſtate of a Great Lord was confiſcated, for having got the Nativity of one of his Children calculated. A Rich Burgeſs was executed, becauſe there was found amongſt his papers the figure of one of his Brothers, named <hi>Valence.</hi> A young man was put to death, for having affirmed himſelf to be cured of a diſtemper in the Bath, by carrying his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers one after another to his Stomach, and naming the vowels ſo many times.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. As great paſſions are not only criminal, but alſo ridiculous: <hi>Valens</hi> imagined to himſelf, that he could deſtroy this fatal Emperor, which the Oracle had expreſſed but by halves; not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is a Divine Providence, that laughs at humane fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſights, and that a Tyrant never killed his Succeſſor. He attempted to deſtroy all Perſons of Quality, whoſe names began by the two ſyllables ſuſpected, and made ſo exact an <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>
               </note>enquiry, that many to preſerve themſelves, were obliged to quit their names, and to take others not ſo dangerous,</p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. The <hi>THEODOSI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi>'s had acquired too much reputation to eſcape the perſecutions of a Prince, ſo cruel and ſuſpicious. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Father was ſtill in <hi>Africa,</hi> where <hi>Valentinian</hi> had eſteemed him neceſſary for the repoſe of the Province. After he had extinguiſhed the fire of Rebellion, he had informed the Court of the miſery of the People, and made high complaints of the <hi>Roman</hi> Count, who had conſumed them by his avarice and inhumane dealings. He had
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54793:28"/>
rigorouſly puniſhed ſome of his Accomplices, and feared not to publiſh the intelligences of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor with ſome intereſſed Miniſters, who made an advantage of his concuſſions, and protected him near the Emperor. This firmneſs of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had procured him the hatred of thoſe powerful men, who ſtuck cloſe to the Prince after having abuſed him, and who affording themſelves the freedom of committing things unjuſt, would debar others of that of diſcovering them, and making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
            <p>The Emperor <hi>Valens</hi> was contented to entertain theſe enmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under-hand, without daring to attempt any thing in the life time of <hi>Valentinian;</hi> but after his death, he kept no meaſures any longer, and took the ſame aſcendant over his Nephews, that his Brother had formerly taken over him. He gained the Miniſters of <hi>Gratian,</hi> already prepoſſeſſed by their Jealouſies. He joyned with the Empreſs <hi>Juſtine,</hi> an <hi>Arrian,</hi> as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as himſelf, and made ſo good a uſe of the favourable conjuncture of theſe new Reigns, that mixing the Intereſts of the State with thoſe of Religion, and the Paſſions of others with his own, he brought <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to his trial. He was arreſted in <hi>Carthage;</hi> and whether he was accuſed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Africk,</hi> or had other crimes ſuppoſed againſt him, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die in thoſe very places, where he had triumphed a little before.</p>
            <p n="45">XLV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſeeing himſelf oppreſſed by envy, employed the remaining part of his time in thoughts of his Salvation. He received Baptiſm, which through the evil cuſtom of that time he had deferred, and died innocent before God, as he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54793:28"/>
had lived without reproach, and with Glory before <note place="margin">Oroſ. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi>

As he was no leſs to be feared for his vertues than his Father, he would infallibly have run the ſame fortune with him; but he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Ambroſ. in fun. Theod.</note>all his employments, and fled forthwith into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he ſheltered himſelf from the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Valens,</hi> who upon the ſubject of ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was not of a humor to leave a crime imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Altho the Emperor <hi>Gratian</hi> was at an age to apply himſelf to buſineſs, and was acquainted with the diſgrace of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whoſe deſerts he knew, he left him in his Exile; and whether it was that he feared to diſpleaſe his Uncle, or that he had not the force to expreſs the paſſions of his Miniſters, or elſe that things were concealed from his knowledge; and he would not put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the trouble of examining them himſelf, he abandoned the two greateſt Captains of the Empire to the oppreſſion and violence of their Enemies. Thus the beſt Princes, by a ſoft Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or criminal Lazineſs, become oftentimes as dangerous as the bad.</p>
            <p n="46">XLVI. <hi>Thoodoſius</hi> paſſed ſome years in <hi>Spain,</hi> uſing this exile as a time of repoſe, and living obſcurely with ſome of his Relations and Friends, till ſuch time as the affairs of the Empire were embroiled in ſuch a manner, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to run to him, as the only man capable to eſtabliſh them. I think my ſelf obliged to recite here a little at large all theſe troubles, as well to give an account of the ſtate of the Eaſtern Empire, and make the courſe of this Hiſtory the more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,

as to ſhew the methods which God made uſe of to chaſtiſe the Emperor <hi>Valens,</hi> and to fix <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in his place.</p>
            <p n="47">XLVII. Of all thoſe barbarous people, that went out in multitudes from the Northern parts, and drove one another to the very banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> there was none more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire than the <hi>Goths.</hi> They inhabited originally a part of that wild and barren Country, which lies between the Northern Ocean and the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. Being weary of a place ſo unfruitful, and puſhed on by their natural fierceneſs, they deſcended as far as the adjacent parts of the River <hi>Viſtule,</hi> above three hundred years before the birth of Jeſus Chriſt. There being encreaſed by a crowd of <hi>Vandals</hi> whom they had ſubdued, and finding themſelves too much ſtraitned, they extending their limits upon the Neighbouring States, and advanced ſince as far as the <hi>Palus Meotis,</hi> under the conduct of King <hi>Filimer,</hi> forcing all they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred in their paſſage. The reſiſtance which they found in this place conſtrained them to turn their courſe to another ſide, and to paſs at length after many windings into the Country of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Getes,</hi> where they remained ſome time in peace. The correſpondence which they had there with people, that were more human and polite than they, having made them loſe a little of their groſsneſs, they impoſed Laws upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and divided into two Nations under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders worthy to govern them. They that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the moſt Eaſtern parts were called <hi>Oſtrogoths,</hi> or Eaſtern <hi>Goths,</hi> and acknowledged for their Kings the Princes of the Royal Family of the

            <p>Theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were then no otherwiſe ſeparated from the Provinces of the Empire than by the <hi>Danube,</hi> made oftentimes irruptions into <hi>Thrace, Illyrium,</hi> and <hi>Pannonia;</hi> notwithſtanding as they made War in diſorder, they were almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beaten, and made no progreſs.

XLVIII.

A People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and till then encloſed between the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the frozen Sea, went out of their own Country, and diſperſed themſelves like a Torrent into all the adjoining Provinces.</p>

At the noiſe of this formidable march, all the <hi>Goths</hi> run to their Arms. <hi>Athanaric,</hi> who was the moſt expoſed, collected all his Troops, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced himſelf towards the Banks of the River <hi>Danaſt,</hi> in order to diſpute the Enemies paſſage. <note place="margin">Ammian ibid.</note>He ſent in the mean time ſeveral Parties above twenty Leagues beyond, to obſerve them, and to bring him the News.

            <p>The Governor being advertiſed of this diſorder, was not much diſturbed at it; and as he was

touched at the diſcourſe of this Philoſopher, and diminiſhed a little of that falſe zeal of Religion which had poſſeſſed him entirely.

            <p n="55">LV. This Affair wonderfully diſturbed him, becauſe he had already many Adverſaries upon his hands. The <hi>Saraſins</hi> were the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.

Altho ſhe was an Ally of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they began to trouble her, and thought they might with ſafety provoke a Nation, that was governed only by a Woman.

She broke the Alliance then her Husband had contracted with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, took the Field with a puiſſant Army, and rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Paleſtine, Phoenicia,</hi> and that part of <hi>Egypt</hi> which is between the <hi>Nile,</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> preſented himſelf often to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her paſſages, but he was always beaten, and loſt the beſt part of his Troops. He muſt have recourſe to the Count <hi>Victor,</hi> General of the Eaſtern Armies. This General advanced with a great Body of Horſe and Foot, and ſlighting the Governor who came to join him, he ordered him to ſtand aſide, and to leave him the honour of a Victory which he could not obtain himſelf. With this aſſurance he approached, gave Battel, and loſt it; his whole Army was defeated, and himſelf had

            <p n="56">LVI. At the ſame time the <hi>Perſians</hi> required the Emperor to abandon <hi>Armenia,</hi> which was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <note place="margin">Ammian. l. <hi>30.</hi>
               </note>of perpetual War between the two Nations.

            <p n="57">LVII. There was no leſs occaſion to fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Empire, than without. The Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tired with the Tyranny of the Governors, and the perſecution of the Catholicks, were upon the point to riſe. <hi>Valens,</hi> who was afraid of being overwhelmed, diſpatched Couriers to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Gratian</hi> his Nephew for aſſiſtance, and made haſte to ſatisfy the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Saraſins,</hi> that he might have only the <hi>Goths</hi> upon his hands, and might collect all his Troops into a Body.</p>
            <p>He gave immediate Orders to Count <hi>Victor</hi> to go and find Queen <hi>Mauvia,</hi> and to conclude a Peace with her upon any Conditions whatſoever. This Negotiation was more fortunate than War; for the Queen, who had as much Wiſdom as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, ſtopt the courſe of her Victories, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with having reduced an Emperor to fear her. <hi>Victor</hi> of his ſide managed the humor of that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54793:34"/>
Princeſs with ſo much ingenuity, running upon her admirable qualities, and making it an honour to be overcome by her, that in a few days ſhe granted him a Peace, and even beſtowed her Daughter upon him in marriage. Nevertheleſs, as ſhe was zealous for the Chriſtian Religion, which ſhe had but lately embraced, ſhe would not conſent to ſign the Treaty, before he had engaged to let her have for a Biſhop one of her own Subjects, called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who lived in the reputation of holineſs in the <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>38.</hi>
               </note>ſolitudes of <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Condition appeared very agreeable, and the Treaty was concluded and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted almoſt at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Victor</hi> had Orders to paſs into <hi>Perſia,</hi> in order to terminate as well as he could the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns, and to bring along with him thoſe Legions which were in <hi>Armenia,</hi> as ſoon as there ſhould be a Peace determined. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror relaxed much from his Pretenſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to an Accommodation, which would have been ſcandalous, without a real neceſſity; it was even convenient to bear with ſome infracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Treaty, whereof it was not a time to complain, and to diſſemble an Affair which was not at that juncture the moſt preſſing. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing more than to ſatisfy the People, which was done by repealing the exiled Biſhops, and letting every one live in the exerciſe of his Religion without diſturbance.</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. <hi>Valens</hi> then thought his Affairs to be in a good poſture, and was preparing to go from <hi>Antioch,</hi> when he received advice that <hi>Trajan,</hi> who commanded the Legions of <hi>Armenia,</hi> had attack'd the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> that he had put them to the Rout, and chaſed them to the very Streights of

Mount <hi>Haemus;</hi> that he had gained the Defiles upon them, and had kept them encloſed for ſome time; but that hunger and deſpair having made them perform extraordinary things, he had been conſtrained to retire, and to abandon to them the paſſages. A little while after he learnt that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> had joined <hi>Ricomer,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Prince, that was ſent from the Weſt with ſome auxiliary Troops; that theſe two Captains had approached the Camp of the <hi>Goths,</hi> with a deſign to force them in their Trenches if it were poſſible, or elſe to fall upon the Rear-guard if they decamped in diſorder, as they were uſed to do; that after they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one another for a long time, they came to handy blows; that the Fight had laſted from morning till night; and that the number of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> having at laſt prevailed over the Valor of the <hi>Romans, Trajan</hi> had made his Retreat as a Soldier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Ricomer</hi> was returned to the Weſt, in order to bring a more conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was ſo much the more diſturbed at this News, in that he learnt that a great many Officers were ſlain, and that the <hi>Goths</hi> ſecurely made Irruptions to the very Suburbs of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> He diſpatched a Body of Horſe to <hi>Trajan,</hi> that he might keep the Field all the reſt of Autumn.</p>
            <p n="59">LIX. In the mean time <hi>Gratian,</hi> in the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience he was in to relieve his Uncle, had made the greateſt part of his Army paſs towards <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and prepared himſelf to march in the midſt of Winter to be in the Eaſt at the opening of the Campagne. He left <hi>Merobaudes</hi> King of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> to ſecure it; and knowing that the deſtiny
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54793:35"/>
of Princes is in the hands of God, and that they ought to expect Victory rather from their Piety, than the Number or Courage of their Soldiers, he <note place="margin">Ambroſ. de Fide ad Grat.</note>had entreated St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to compoſe for him a little Treatiſe of the True Faith, which he might read during his Expedition.</p>
            <p n="60">LX. But as he was upon the point of parting, the <hi>Germans</hi> thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For all they were above forty thouſand men, this young Emperor ſhewed nothing of amazement; he made the Troops march, which he had retained in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and recalled thoſe which <note place="margin">Ammian. l. <hi>31.</hi>
               </note>he had ſent towards <hi>Pannonia.</hi> He advanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of them, and encountring the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my about <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> he attack'd them ſo ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and with ſo much reſolution, that he gave them an entire defeat. There remained upon the place five and thirty thouſand, all their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and their King himſelf being killed <hi>Gratian</hi> perſued thoſe that fled to the very Woods and Mountains, and compelled the whole Nation humbly to requeſt a Peace, and to give as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages all the young men of the Country, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he reinforced his Army. That being done, he gave orders, and march'd by great journeys to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Pannonia,</hi> notwithſtanding he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incommoded with an intermitting Fever.</p>
            <p n="61">LXI. <hi>Valens</hi> on his ſide went very ſlowly to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and gave out orders to his General Officers, who met him upon the Road. <hi>Trajan</hi> came before him, to give him an account of the condition of thoſe Troops he commanded. As
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54793:35"/>
ſoon as he appeared, the Emperor fell into a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and charging him with the loſs of the laſt <note place="margin">Theodoret. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi>
               </note>Fight, reproached him outragiouſly for his ſmall Conduct and Valor. <hi>Trajan</hi> heard theſe Reproaches without being moved; and as he was a perſon of great Piety, he replied to the Emperor, <hi>If we are overcome, my Lord, 'tis you that obſtruct our Conquest. You make War with God himſelf, and God aſſiſts the</hi> Barbarians <hi>who are at War with you. 'Tis he that gives Victory to thoſe who fight in his Name, and takes it away from thoſe who are his declared Enemies. You will acknowledge that you are ſo, if you conſider what the Biſhops are, whom you have baniſhed from their Churches, and thoſe you have advanced in their places.</hi> The Emperor being offended at this diſcourſe, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to flie out; but <hi>Arintheus</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of his Army, made him underſtand, that he had very ſenſibly touched a Man of Courage; that the zeal of Religion had made him ſpeak; and that it was convenient to pardon this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, which was perhaps but too well grounded. <hi>Valens</hi> was a little pacified, and was contented with depriving <hi>Trajan</hi> of his charge of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Foot, which he had exerciſed with much Reputation.</p>
            <p n="62">LXII. At laſt the Emperor arrived at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> towards the end of <hi>May,</hi> with part of his <note place="margin">Socrat. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>38.</hi>
               </note>Army. The <hi>Goths</hi> continued their Courſes to the very gates of the City, and to ranſack the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as before. As for him he kept himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, whether it was that he durſt not undertake any thing before he had received News from <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> or that he had a mind to chaſtiſe the City by Soldiers who conſumed it within, and the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> who pillaged it without; for he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54793:36"/>
to it, ſince it had taken the Tyrant <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>'s part againſt him. Whereupon they began to murmur, and talk openly that the Emperor held intelligence with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and delivered his Subjects to them; inſomuch that one day when he aſſiſted at ſome Horſe-courſes, they cryed out on all ſides, <hi>Let us fall to our Arms, and go out and</hi>

            <p>He retired to <hi>Melanthias,</hi> a Pleaſure-houſe of the Emperors, ſome few miles from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> There, as he got his Troops together, he received Letters from <hi>Gratian,</hi> which purported to him the defeat of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and aſſured him of his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den arrival with his victorious Army. In effect, he was upon march with his Horſe, and came to <hi>Sirmium</hi> to attend his Foot and Equipage. On the other ſide, the Count <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> who kept the Field with 2000 choice Men, had ſurprized ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and made a great ſlaughter of <hi>Goths</hi> near <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="63">LXIII. In the mean time King <hi>Fritigern</hi> judging that it was neceſſary to come to a Battel, ceaſed his pillages and waſting of the Countrey, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his ſcattered Men to come and join the groſs of the Army, as well to prevent their falling into the Ambuſcades of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as to accuſtom them to the diſcipline of the Camp.

After having delivered the Church from its Oppreſſion, it was neceſſary to conſider of means in order to ſave the State. <hi>Valens</hi> died without Children, and the young <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who had the Title and Quality of Emperor, was not yet of an age to exerciſe the functions of it; ſo <hi>Gratian</hi> alone was charged with all the cares of the Empire. He ſaw at the ſame time the <hi>Goths</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and other barbarous Nations rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make an irruption into the Lands of the Empire. Being unable himſelf to ſuffice the whole, or to know where his preſence would be moſt neceſſary, he ſearcht for a man that was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to aſſiſt him in his wars, and to command in the Eaſt in his abſence. He caſt his Eyes upon <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whoſe Valor and Wiſdom he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; and whether he had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to aſſociate him to the Empire, or only

            <p n="75">LXXV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was then in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he was retired, as we have already ſaid, to avoid the Perſecution of <hi>Valens,</hi> and the Envy of thoſe Courtiers, who could not diſpence with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, nor his Merit. He lived in his retreat without complaining either of Emperors, or his Fortune. Sometimes he was at the City amongſt his fellow Citizens, compoſing the differences of ſome, aſſiſting others in their neceſſities, obliging <note place="margin">Pacat. in Panegyr.</note>all the world, and preferring himſelf to no one; ſometimes in the Country, where he manured himſelf his Gardens, and addicted himſelf, with ſatisfaction to all the cares of Husbandry. Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this advantage of his diſgrace, he learnt to gain the Friendſhip of the People, and accuſtomed himſelf ſo well, to all the Offices of a civil life, that he retained the ſweetneſs and modeſty of a private perſon, even when he was raiſed to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Dignity. He was in this condition when he received <hi>Gratian</hi>'s Letters; he put his domeſtic affairs in order, and departed a few days after.</p>

They made their approaches tumultuouſly, and gave ſeveral aſſaults; but it was with ſo much precipitation and diſorder, that they were always repulſed and loſt their beſt Troops. They had won ſome Soldiers of the Gariſon, who were to

At laſt being incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded with the rains that fell ſeveral days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pelted with the Artillery of the beſieged, and diſcouraged with the tediouſneſs of the Siege, they paſſed as far as the Precincts of <hi>Perinthus,</hi> where they hoped to find a more conſiderable booty.</p>

He diſperſed them in the Cities of his Governments, and inſtructed them, according to the Orders he had received from Court. Many
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54793:42"/>
of them were already of an age to carry Arms, and notwithſtanding the care which was taken to conceal from them the Victory of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they came to underſtand the News.</p>
            <p>Then returning to their nature, they concerted amongſt themſelves how to ſeize upon certain Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to put thoſe Gariſons to the Sword who ſhould not be upon their guard. Thoſe that were together, advertiſed their Companions ſecretly, and the Conſpiracy was ſuddenly to take effect. <hi>Julius</hi> had advice of it, and was reſolved to prevent them.

            <p>The day was appointed for this diſtribution. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> hoping to take the advantage of the Money, and Favors which were to be allowed them, and to render their Rebellion more eaſy and ſecure, were ſoftned a little. They came to the Cities whoſe Gariſons were under-hand rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; and as they were aſſembled in the great Streets, ſome Troops that were lodged in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Houſes, fell upon them with their Swords, and ſlew the greateſt part: the reſt thinking to ſave themſelves by the croſs-ways, were knocked down with ſtones by the Citizens.</p>
            <p>They did not ſo much as ſpare thoſe who were not of an age to do an injury, and by an inhumane Prudence <hi>Julius</hi> delivered theſe Provinces from the danger they were in. The affair was manag'd with ſo much dexterity, and orders given and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54793:43"/>
ſo opportunely, that this Maſſacre the ſame day went throughout the Eaſt, without the <hi>Goths</hi> conceiving the leaſt ſuſpition of it, or the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of one's eſcaping.</p>
            <p n="80">LXXX. Things were in this condition, when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Sirmium. Gratian</hi> receiv'd him ſo much the more favourably, inaſmuch as he was aſhamed of having baniſht him his Court, and that he was upon entruſting him with the moſt important affair of the Empire.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> marched forthwith towards <hi>Thrace,</hi> where the Enemies were aſſembled in a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. He knew that ſeveral Companies of <hi>Alains, Huns,</hi> and <hi>Taifals,</hi> had joined them ſince their laſt Victory, and that they were of opinion to have reduced the Emperor to dare no further to appear in Field. But he learnt at the ſame time that their beſt Soldiers were disbanded, that the chief Officers were divided amongſt themſelves; that <hi>Fritigern</hi> was no longer Maſter of them, and that there was neither Order nor Diſcipline amongſt ſuch a heap of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were come to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them in their Pillage, and not to fight.</p>
            <p n="81">LXXXI. Then he advanced with much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and having encountred the Enemy, he gave them Battel, ſlew the greateſt part, obliged the reſt to repaſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> and went himſelf to carry the News of this defeat to Court. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54793:43"/>
with an extream diligence to give the Emperor an account of his Victory, it appeared immediately incredible.</p>
            <p>His Rivals durſt accuſe him of having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and of having fled himſelf; and <hi>Gratian</hi> being aſtoniſhed, was at a ſtand how to employ his Faith. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> entreated him to ſend his Accuſers upon the place, to the end they might examine the truth, and give a teſtimony of it themſelves. The Emperor, to ſatisfy his preſſing Solicitations, charged perſons of degree and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to go forthwith and learn the particulars of this Action, and to return with a clear Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to him.</p>
            <p n="82">LXXXII. The ſame Hiſtorian reports, that it was in this time that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſaw in a Dream a Biſhop, who put a Crown upon his head, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted him with the Imperial Robes; and that one of his intimate Friends, to whom he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this Viſion, aſſured him that it was a certain Preſage of that Grandeur to which God would advance him.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop who appeared to him, was ſince known for <hi>Meletius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> This holy Prelate, by vertue of the laſt Edict of <hi>Gratian,</hi> was then returned to his Church, after a baniſhment of ſeveral years. The Confeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt were ſeen to paſs through the whole Empire, ſome followed by a Troop of Infidels whom they had converted, others delivered from their Chains, and bearing ſtill upon their Bodies the glorious marks of the Torments which they had endured. They transferr'd even with honour the Relicks of thoſe who died in their Exile.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54793:44"/>
The greateſt part were received with abundance of Joy by the People, whoſe Conduct and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection they came to reſume. But as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, notwithſtanding all his Piety, had not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough to make himſelf obeyed, there were ſome, who by the Cabals of Hereticks, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went more Misfortunes in this time of Peace, than they had endured in the time of Perſecution. Many obſerving their Sees to be ſupplied with <hi>Arrians,</hi> offered to ſhare with them the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Flock, upon condition they would reunite themſelves to the Catholick Faith and Communion. Others were even ready to yield up their Dignity entire, in order to eſtabliſh the Peace and Unity of the Church.</p>
            <p n="82">LXXXII. Amongſt ſo many holy Biſhops, it ſeemed that God had made choice of the moſt renowned, to give <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the firſt hopes of the glory to which he deſigned him. This Preſage was ſuddenly accompliſhed. For <hi>Gratian</hi> having learnt that the People who inhabited along the <hi>Rhine</hi> were entred into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and moreover find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf as it were encompaſſed with an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were diſperſed in the Provinces of the Eaſt, reſolved to aſſociate <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> to the Empire. He conſidered that he muſt be unable himſelf alone to oppoſe ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; that a Lieutenant diſcharged him but of a part of his Cares; that it was convenient to have a Collegue, who ſhould have his Wars apart, and ſhould defend the State, as his own proper inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that it would be more for his Reputation and Glory, to give one of his Empires voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than to retain it with diſturbance; and that he was happy in the poſſeſſion of any thing, whereby
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54793:44"/>
to recompenſe a great merit in the eſtabliſhment of his own repoſe.</p>
            <p n="84">LXXXIV. The Friendſhip and eſteem which he had entertained for <hi>Theodoſius</hi> from his Infancy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined him ſtill more; and the impatience which he had to go and relieve <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he was educated, preſſed him to declare his deſign. But it was proper to attend the confirmation of the laſt Victory of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to the end that his Rivals might themſelves be obliged to approve his Election, after having ſuffered the confuſion which their Calumny deſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Claudian. Pacat. in Paneg.</note> This choice was ſo much the more glorious to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> inaſmuch as he had not lookt after it. He was even modeſt enough to refuſe this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when <hi>Gratian</hi> offer'd it to him; and this refuſal was attended with ſo many marks of Moderation and Sincerity, that it was eaſie to judge it was no vain ceremony, but a real wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which made him regard, as a difficult and hazardous employment, this Dignity, wherein is ſought for the moſt part nothing, but the repoſe and pleaſure of commanding.</p>
            <p n="85">LXXXV. About this time <hi>Auſonius</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Conſul, altho abſent, and regardleſs of factions to procure this honour. <hi>Gratian,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having advantag'd himſelf by his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, loſt no occaſion of teſtifying to him his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. He raiſed him to the charge of <hi>Queſtor,</hi> and a little after to that of <hi>Praefectus Praetorio;</hi> at length he declared him Conſul, and forgot nothing that he could imagine to be moſt obliging, and moſt honourable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54793:45"/>
He gave him for a Colleague <hi>Olibrius Gallus,</hi> a young man of a very noble and ancient Family: and as people were curious to know which of the two he named firſt; to favour <hi>Auſonius,</hi> without offending the other, he anſwered that he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to determine their rank, not by Birth, but Age, and the antiquity of their Praefecture. After that, he diſpatched forthwith a Courier to <hi>Auſonius,</hi> to give him advice of his nomination to the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <note place="margin">Auſon. in grat. act.</note>and wrote to him in theſe terms; <q>As I conſidered ſome time ſince to create Conſuls for this year, I invoked the aſſiſtance of God, as you know I am accuſtomed to do in every thing I undertake, and as I know it conformable to your deſire. I was of opinion, that I was obliged to nominate you firſt Conſul, and that God required of me this acknowledgment for the good inſtructions I have received from you. I render to you then what is your due; and knowing that one can never acquit himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Father, nor towards his Maſter, I confeſs that I ſtill owe you what I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render you.</q> To the end that nothing might be wanting to the favour which he had done, he accompanied this Letter with a Preſent, and ſent him a very glorious Robe, wherein was embroidered in Gold the figure of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> his Father-in-Law. And <hi>Auſonius</hi> on his ſide employ'd all the force and delicacy of his Genius to make in Verſe and Proſe, the Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riek of his Auguſt Benefactor.</p>
            <p n="86">LXXXVI. A few days after this action of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s, thoſe who were ſent to the Army arrived, and reported that the defeat of the <hi>Goths</hi> had been

At this name the Troops interrupted him, and teſtifyed their Joy by long applauſes. <hi>Gratian</hi> continued his diſcourſe, and after having made the Encomium of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> he gave him the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Aur.

Then the Soldiers who had heretofore eſteemed him worthy of the Empire, redoubled their acclamation; and the Officers came in multitudes to Salute the new Emperor, who being but of the Age of three and thirty years, and joyning to the ſtrength and vigour of his Age, a great experience, and conſummated Wiſdom, cauſed them to hope for the entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratian</hi> gave him for his Diviſion <hi>Thrace,</hi> and all the Provinces that <hi>Valens</hi> had poſſeſſed. He <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note>added thereto that <hi>Eaſtern</hi> part of <hi>Illyrium,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> was Capital, taking off from the Empire of the Weſt, that Province, which lay expoſed to the courſes of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and which neither he becauſe of his Remoteneſs, nor his Brother <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by reaſon of his inferior Age, could defend. A few days after this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the two Emperors parted. <hi>Gratian</hi> took the Road of <hi>Gaul</hi> to go and chaſe the <hi>Germans,</hi> who plundered it; and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> marched towards <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica</hi> to rendezvous his Army there, in order to renew a war againſt a formidable multitude of <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The noiſe was ſoon diſperſed, that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was Emperor, and that he advanced with a part of the Weſtern Army, which <hi>Gratian</hi> had enforced him with. The People, whom the Unhappineſs of the laſt Wars, and Rigor of the late Reign,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54793:48"/>
had extreamly caſt down, began to breath again. The Troops, which the Enemies had kept cloſe in their Gariſons, took heart, and made Incurſions in the Country; and the Officers, who ſaved themſelves from the laſt defeat, and had got themſelves into ſtrong places, were ready to appear at the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to collect the ſcattered remains of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, in order to conduct them to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius.</hi> All the Cities diſpoſed their Deputations; and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which <hi>Valens</hi> had ſworn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy at his return from the war, was glad to be under the dominion of a Prince, who deſerved their love; and was capable to protect them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in the mean time arrived at <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica;</hi> where reſorted immediately from all the Provinces of the Empire, thoſe whoſe Rank or Duty called them to Court, and thoſe who came to render an account of the public Affairs, or to ſollicite their particular ones. There he began to do all the Functions of a great Emperor, diſperſing his Orders every where, receiving Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Merit with Honor, and the reſt with Goodneſs; giving Audiences at every hour, and rendering Juſtice indifferently to all his Subjects; refuſing nothing that he could reaſonably grant; adding to his favors an obliging way of doing them, and ſweetning refuſals by expreſſions of good will. So they who obtained their demands <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>were ſatisfied; and they who could not, returned at leaſt with comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The care he took for the ſatisfaction and repoſe of the People, did not hinder him from giving all convenient orders for preparations of war. The Chief Officers were already near his Perſon, the Infantry came out of their Gariſons,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54793:49"/>
and the whole Army rendezvous'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring. Altho it was not conſiderable in number, it was ſo in courage, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence it repoſed in its Emperor. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> then took the field, and advanced by great Journeys towards <hi>Thrace.</hi> The <hi>Barbarians</hi> were divided into ſeveral bodies, and without applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſiege of any place, wherein they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſucceeded; they pillaged all the Country with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition. They were armed after the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> manner ſince the defeat of <hi>Valens: Fritigern,</hi> had taught them to rally, and to obſerve ſome Diſcipline, their Army encreaſed every day with an infinite number of their Companions, whom the noiſe of Victory, and the hopes of a great Booty drew from all parts. Thus they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. But they had ſcarce any Captains. <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern,</hi> whom they had refuſed to obey, had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them. As ſoon as they gave themſelves to pillage, they no longer obſerved any order; and this multitude, that came to joyn them, ſerved but to encreaſe the confuſion, and to cauſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions amongſt them for the ſharing of the Prizes they had made.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> entred into <hi>Thrace:</hi> He defeated immediately ſome Parties of the Enemy, who were ſeparated from the body of the Army; and having learnt of the Priſoners the place, where was encamped the greateſt part of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> he thought he might eaſily ſubdue them, if he could ſurprize them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before they were advertiſed of his March. He commanded <hi>Modarius,</hi> Prince <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>of the Blood Royal of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who was in the Service of the Emperors, and by his fidelity and valor had deſerved the firſt employments in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54793:49"/>
their Armies, to advance with ſome Horſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obſerve the Enemy, whilſt he marched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf withthe utmoſt diligence.</p>
            <p>A few days after, <hi>Modarius</hi> returned, and gave <hi>Theodoſius</hi> notice, that the Enemy was not far off; that they were encamped in Plains, commanded by Aſcents, which it would be eaſy to poſſeſs; that their Camp was defended but by one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment of ſome Chariots ill placed, which might be forced without any difficulty; that there was a great number of men, but few Soldiers; that in all likelihood they would not quit a Poſt, where they found all ſorts of commodity to ſubſiſt on; and in a word not ſuſpicious of any thing, but thinking the Emperor at a great diſtance from them, they might be oppreſſed, before they would be in a condition to defend themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Emperor was extreamly pleaſed to hear this News, and ſent back <hi>Modarius</hi> with a great Detachment, to ſeize upon thoſe Poſts he ſhould judge neceſſary, whether to prevent the <hi>Goths</hi> from being informed, or to fight them with advantage if they were diſpoſed for battle. Pretty near the Camp, and almoſt in proſpect of the Enemy, there was a little Hill which extended a good way, and towards the middle of its brow left a ſpace of land compact, and large enough to lodge a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of Troops. <hi>Modarius</hi> in the night conveyed his there, without being diſcovered. He poſſeſſed himſelf of all the paſſages, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Goths,</hi> without fear or caution we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e aſleep in the Plain; he expected with impatience the arrival of the Emperor to charge them. At day-break <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being arrived, viewed himſelf the place, and forthwith diſpoſed himſelf for an onſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> He commanded the Soldiers to quit their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54793:50"/>
heavy Arms, and to keep nothing but the Sword and Buckler. He gave orders to the Captains to extend the ranks, to leave nothing behind them, and to make the Army appear more numerous. He exhorted them all to fight with courage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obliging themſelves too much to the accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forms of warfare, in an affair whoſe event de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended as much upon haſte, as upon order.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The <hi>Goths</hi> in the mean time were in great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility; ſome were juſt come into the Camp load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with booty; others were gone to make incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Country, and to gather up the remains of the other days Pillage. Many fatigued with the courſes they had made in the Night, were lain down here and there, and the moſt part buried in Wine, flept in peace, in the midſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they had heaped up. Their Captains, men of little experience and power, notwithſtanding the advice they had received of the appearance of <hi>Roman</hi> Troops, could not be perſwaded that they would come to attack them. Even thoſe that had ſeen them, took them not for the entire Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but for a party come out of the adjacent places, who did not deſerve to have Arms taken up againſt them, and who would ſoon encloſe themſelves in Garriſons.</p>
            <p>They were in this condition, when they heard the noiſe of the Trumpets, and crys of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which was the Signal of the onſet. <hi>Moda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> deſcended from the hill with the Foot which he commanded, enlarging his batallions, as he advanced in the Plain, and marched directly to the head of the Camp. <hi>Promotius,</hi> one of the Lieutenant-Generals of the Emperor, went to the Left with part of the Horſe; and the Emperour
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54793:50"/>
with the reſt coaſting the hill to the Right, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Enemies to take them in the Flank. The <hi>Goths,</hi> who ſaw this Army pouring down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them on a ſudden, which their conſternation made them think innumerable, judged very well that their ruine was inevitable: Their Captains were ſenſible of their fault, when it was no longer time to repair it; terror and confuſion were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the whole Camp. Some running to their arms, loſt their lives before they were in a condition to diſpute them: Others to avoid the danger which they ſaw, met with another which they ſaw not, and found the enemies employed in every place. The number of thoſe that fled, hindred them from flying. In a few hours all theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> were either killed, or made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. They took their Wives and Children, and four thouſand Chariots, which ſerved to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them in their Marches. Thus all <hi>Thrace</hi> was once more delivered from the deſolation, to which thoſe foreign Nations had reduced it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The noiſe of this defeat being ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the <hi>Alains</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> who plundered the other Provinces, ſtopt ſhort, and made propoſals of Peace. They would have been glad to have revenged the death of their companions; but as <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>they knew the Emperour was coming to them, they ſubmitted to what he pleaſed, and ſigned a Treaty, which they deſigned to obſerve no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than the firſt occaſion they had to infringe it. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> of his ſide granted them more than they demanded; for he preferred an honeſt Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a glorious War; and did not think it proper to expoſe the few Troops he had to doubtful fights, againſt enemies who had overcome the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54793:51"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſuffered themſelves not always to be ſurprized.</p>
            <p>All things being thus regulated, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> viſited the places, reinforced the Garriſons, and gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the ſecurity and eaſe of thoſe Provinces, which were almoſt conſumed by War; then he took the Road of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> to paſs the Winter there, and to provide from thence for the moſt urgent neceſſities of the State. The Joy, which theſe firſt ſucceſſes of his Reign gave to him, was ſtill encreaſed by the News of <hi>Gratian</hi>'s being no leſs fortunate than himſelf; that having joined to his Troops, thoſe that were commanded by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robaudes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sozam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ib. Socrat. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>

            <p n="7">VII. As ſoon as he was diſcharged of the cares of war, he thought he ſhould be unworthy of the favors, which he had received from Heaven, and the protection which he expected from thence, if he made it not his utmoſt application to eſtabliſh the Catholic Faith, whereof he had made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all his Life. In order thereunto he reſolved to pull down the <hi>Arrians,</hi> which his Predeceſſors had ſet up, and which at that time filled the whole Eaſt with confuſion and diſorder. The attempt was difficult, and to ſucceed therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54793:51"/>
need of much Reſolution and Wiſdom, as well as an exemplary piety.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. This Sect aroſe under the Reign of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and occaſioned againſt the Church a ſort of Perſecution, more dangerous than that of the Tyrants, from which it was juſt freed. <hi>Arrius</hi> was the Author of it. He was born in that part of <hi>Libya,</hi> which is adjoyning to <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and went to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in hopes of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf known there, and to advance himſelf to the firſt charges of the Church. As he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> learned, and eloquent, with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Vertue, the Patriarchs of this City thought he might be ſerviceable to them, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſoon to Orders, others to Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry. But they ſoon obſerved that it was an unquiet, preſumptuous, and untractable Spirit, ready to ſide with the good or evil Party, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it ſuited with his Fortune, or his Pride. In his younger days he threw himſelf into the Schiſm of <hi>Meletius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lycopolis,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Thebais.</hi> He left it, and returned again. At laſt he reconciled himſelf with the Patriarch <hi>Achillas,</hi> and feigned to be his Friend, in order to become his Succeſſor. Then covering his Ambition with the veil of an affected Modeſty, winning ſome by a fawning behavior, deceiving others by an outward gravity and compoſedneſs, whilſt he aſpired ſecretly to the Biſhopric.</p>
            <p>But his hopes were fruſtrated. The See came to be vacant, and the merit of Saint <hi>Alexander</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the intreigues of <hi>Arrius.</hi> He was vexed at it; and the envy which poſſeſſed him, made him regard him as his Enemy, whom he ſhould have reſpected as his Father. He reſolved to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54793:52"/>
ruine him; and being unable to exclaim againſt his Life, which was very innocent, and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he attempted to aſſail his Doctrine, altho it was exceeding pure and wholeſom. He accuſed him, as of a Crime, for ſuſtaining, <hi>That Jeſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Chriſt was equal to his Father, eternal and immutable, as well as he, and had but one Eſſence:</hi> After having reproached him with this Truth, as a Hereſy, he propoſed himſelf his own Hereſy as a Truth; and began to publiſh, <hi>That the Son of God was but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That the word had been made out of nothing; that his nature was mutable, and changeable; that he was the Son of God but by Adoption, and that if he was called God, it was not to be underſtood that he was ſo by Nature, but only by Participation.</hi> As he was learned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and above all a dexterous Logician, he collected from the ſacred books all that might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor his Opinions, and wrapt up the queſtion in ſo many difficulties, and gave to his Error ſo much probability, that ſeveral went over to his Party. The Patriarch endeavoured to bring him over by his admonitions, his reaſons, and his threatnings; but finding that theſe ways of ſweetneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation ſerved but to encourage him the more, and give him more opportunity to divulge his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, he excommunicated him in a Council <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This blow aſtoniſhed him, but not pulled him down. He retired to <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> from whence he wrote to the Emperor; he went himſelf to find him, and in a little time got ſome Protectors and a great number of Diſciples, who fixed themſelves to him, ſome through the ſole love of Novelty, others through that falſe Compaſſion for a man oppreſſed, many were gained by his perſwaſions

and careſſes. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being informed that the Biſhops and People began to ſeparate, and that Synods were aſſembled of both Parties, was afraid of the conſequence of this diviſion. He wrote from <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which was at that time the uſual reſidence of the Eaſtern Emperors, a common let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to St. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arrius,</hi> to exhort them to reunite themſelves, and to agree upon a matter which appeared of little importance for the Faith, and which would diſturb the peace of the Church. <hi>Oſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cordova</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who was by chance near the Emperor, had orders to go into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to endeavour for an accommodation, and acquitted himſelf of his Commiſſion with much fidelity, but with little ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>To reduce this obſtinate Sect, and determine the point of Doctrine in diſpute, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come to an Univerſal Council, that ſhould eſtabliſh truth, and condemn the error by a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Judgment. <hi>Nice,</hi> one of the chief Cities of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> was choſen for the place of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; the Biſhops from all parts of the World were invited thither; they arrived there at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, to the number of threehundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf was there, to be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as Mediator of the Peace, and reunion of the Church. <hi>Arrius</hi> and his Partiſans were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; They were heard, convicted, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; and to take from the <hi>Arians</hi> all pretence of diſguiſing their error under ambiguous terms, they were obliged to make uſe of the word Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial in their Profeſſions of Faith, and to ſign the conſubſtantiality of the word. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſince this time, was as a certain mark, which diſtinguiſhed Catholics from thoſe who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54793:53"/>
were not ſo, or were, but not ſincerely; and the Fathers of the Council inſerted it in their Creed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arius</hi> and the Biſhops who protected him, after many difficulties feigned to ſubmit themſelves to the deciſions of the Council, and to avoid the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they were threatned with, publicly abjured their Hereſy. But they abandoned not their enterprize, and expected a favorable Seaſon to diſperſe again abroad the poiſon, which they had been forced to ſhut up in their hearts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they drew to their Party thoſe who might aſſiſt them with their Credit, or their Favour. They made their ſubmiſſion to be thought ſincere by the Emperor, in order to the more eaſy abuſing of his goodneſs; and whilſt they revered in appearance the Faith of <hi>Nice,</hi> they ſought to ruine by calumnys and falſe imputations, thoſe who were defenders of it. At length by the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the chief of their Party, by the credit of the Princeſs <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> the Emperors Siſter, and by reiterated proteſtations of fidelity and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they came to be conſidered as Orthodox.</p>

               <hi>Arius</hi> himſelf, being brought as it were in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph by his Friends, to be received in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> if he had not ſuddenly departed an unquiet and criminal Life, by a terrible and ſhameful Death.</p>
            <p>Altho theſe Heretics were for the moſt part paſſionate and ſeditious Spirits, yet they durſt not riſe, and diſturb openly the peace of the Church, as long as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> ruled the Empire; for although he had ſometimes a little too much eaſineſs, yet he had much zeal for Religion, and as it was not impoſſible to ſurprize him, ſo it was dangerous if he perceived himſelf to be ſo. Thus

they were obliged to be cautious of this Prince, who might be ignorant of the truth, but who was not able to ſuffer an injuſtice. But when they ſaw themſelves fortified by the Authority of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> his Son, and Succeſſor, they kept no longer any bounds. They not only publiſhed their falſe Doctrine, but they oppreſſed even thoſe who had the courage to oppoſe them. Their inſolence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as far as to chaſe the moſt holy Prelates from the firſt Sees of the Eaſt, to proſcribe even the Patriarchs, and to take away the liberty of <note place="margin">Athan. ad Sol. <hi>p. 831.</hi>

            <p>Upon the firſt noiſe of this renewing of the War, Couriers were ſuddenly diſpatched to the Emperor <hi>Gratian,</hi> to give him advice of the danger wherein <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was; and to ſollicit him to ſend with expedition a conſiderable relief towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi> Some Officers of the Army, with what Troops they could aſſemble, in the mean time op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the enemies, and diſputed the paſſes with them. But the number of theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing continually, they made themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters every where. As ſoon as they had received the ſuccours they expected, they plundered the frontiers, and threw themſelves into <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Macedon. Theodoſius</hi> made his Army march that way, and went there himſelf, as ſoon as his health would permit him. After he had ſent to view the enemies, notwithſtanding he was ſo inferior in number, he advanced with a deſign to fight them; but he was prevented, and whatſoever cautions he had taken, he ſaw himſelf on a ſudden betrayed by the <hi>Goths,</hi> whom he had retained in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>This Prince, after the concluſion of the Treaty of the preceding year, conſidering the weakneſs of the Empire at that time, and judging that he could
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54793:58"/>
 not improve it without the aſſiſtance of thoſe very people, who had occaſioned its decay, made it to be proclaimed in their Camps, that he deſired to live with them in good intelligence, and that he would receive all thoſe who would come into his Armies. Theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> came in multitudes to inroll themſelves in the ſervice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had obliged themſelves before by execrable Oaths to take all occaſions of doing them harm, in making an appearance of ſerving them. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> thought he had engaged them to him by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes and liberalities: notwithſtanding being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leſt their number ſhould prevail, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exceeded that of his own Troops, he made ſeveral detachments of them. He ſent a party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Hormiſaas,</hi> a <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> by Original, Son of a Captain of that name, who aſſiſted in the War of <hi>Julian</hi> againſt the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> He deſtributed the reſt in places, where <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>there was a <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſon, with orders to the Governours to obſerve them. The War being come unlook'd for, thoſe who ſeemed to be moſt faithful, were made choice of, and compoſed a Body to ſerve in the Field. Theſe being reſolved to accompliſh their Oath, and becoming more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to their Country-men, as they approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, gave them information of all that paſſed in the Emperors Army, and promiſed to joyn with them, if they would come to aſſault him by night in his Camp.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. The <hi>Goths,</hi> upon this advice, prepared themſelves for battel, and began to march. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> on his ſide being advertized of their deſign, intrenched himſelf, put his men in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, viſited the quarters, particularly that of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54793:58"/>
ſtrangers, whom he found more gay and pleaſant  than the reſt, and more diſpoſed in appearance to defend themſelves well; and after having kindled fires throughout the Camp, and given all neceſſary orders, he attended the Enemy. The Night ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and the <hi>Barbarians</hi> taking the advantage of their number, and dividing themſelves into ſeveral bodies, whereof each was almoſt equal to the whole Army of the Emperor, extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Plain in tolerable order, and came with fearful crys to thunder upon all ſides almoſt at the ſame time; but they found every where more reſiſtance than they had imagined, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed with great lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of theirs. The ſtrength of the attack fell upon the Emperors Quarter, which they knew either by the ſignal that the Traytors had given them, or by the great number of fires, which they themſelves had obſerved. They hoped to overwhelm this Prince, or at leaſt to hold him employed there, whilſt they laid a ſnare for him on another ſide. They gave ſeveral charges, but they loſt ſo many men, that they were at length diſheartened.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſaw things in this condition, when there aroſe a great noiſe towards the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Strangers, which made him apprehend ſome diſorder. He learnt at the ſame time, that the <hi>Goths</hi> of his Army had joyned the Enemies, and that he would be encloſed, if he was not cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of himſelf. He detached immediately ſome Squadrons to ſeize upon certain Poſts, which might ſecure his retreat; and as he knew that a party of the Legions were at handy blows with theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, he ordered his Cavalry to advance in haſte, which ſell upon them ſo briskly and ſo opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54793:59"/>
and withal made ſo great a ſlaughter of them, that there remained but few, who received no Recompence for their Rebellion. Thoſe that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them, had well nigh the ſame Fortune. But at length the <hi>Romans</hi> could not make ſuch great efforts without much loſs; and the <hi>Goths,</hi> whoſe number continually encreaſed, had forced the Trenches in ſeveral places. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> before he came to be overwhelmed by the multitude, rallied his weakened Troops, who began for the moſt part to give way. He charged himſelf with the care of making his Retreat, amuſing the Enemies by detachments made on purpoſe, turning head from time to time to aſſault thoſe who purſued him in diſorder, till he had gained the advanced Poſts, which his men were poſſeſſed of, and had ſecured the remains of his Army.</p>
            <p>This battel might have proved entirely fatal to the Empire, if the <hi>Goths</hi> had known how to reap the advantage of their Victory; but they disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves immediately. Thoſe who had fought leaſt, were the ſirſt that run to plunder; and thoſe who purſued the Enemy, were afraid of loſing their part of the booty, and returned ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Camp. Thus a retreat was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty. <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Macedon</hi> in the mean time remained expoſed to the inſults and pillages of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who ravaged the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and left the Cities undiſturbed, becauſe the Emperor had thrown ſome Troops therein, and they were in hopes of drawing from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable contributions. After they had ruined all this Country, as if their Avarice and Revenge had been ſatisfied, they began to lament ſo many brave Soldiers, whom they had loſt in battel, and their Victory appeared to them not ſo great as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54793:59"/>
They found themſelves in ſmall number; and thought the Emperor was every hour at their backs to aſſault them.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. In the mean while <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who was retired towards <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> formed a body of Troops ſufficient to oppoſe their progreſs. He had received in his way ſome Recruits. A Party of the Legions of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which he had ſent for, came to joyn him, and he was in a condition to take the field again in a few days, when <hi>Rusticus</hi> arrived from the Weſtern Provinces, to ſatisfy him of the concernment of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and his whole Court for his indiſpoſition, and their joy for his recovery. The Journey of this Officer had been tedious, becauſe he had paſſed through <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſtopt at <hi>Rome</hi> to receive Baptiſm. There he had received new orders, and came with Letters from Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Gratian.</hi> The firſt wrote to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to thank him for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection he gave the Catholics, and to beg of him to eſtabliſh in the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhop, with whom might be preſerved Peace and Communion. The ſecond gave him advice, that he ſent him a conſiderable aſſiſtance; that he would have conducted them himſelf, if the affairs of the Empire would have ſuffered him; but that he had pickt out his choiceſt Troops, and his beſt Captains to command them; that they were upon March, and had orders to repair with ſpeed to the confines of the two Empires, where they might know the courſe they were to take.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was wonderfully pleaſed to learn this news; and a little while after, he was informed, that the Auxillary Troops were arrived upon the Frontires of <hi>Illyrium. Baudon</hi> and <hi>Arbogastes,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:54793:60"/>
 Frenchmen by birth, Captains of great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, very affectionate to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the profeſſion of War, who were the chief of this expedition, ſent two of their principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to Court, to know what they were to do. The Emperor diſpatched to them forthwith Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of credit and intelligence, to acquaint them with the poſture of affairs, and to get them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards <hi>Macedon,</hi> where he was reſolved to come and join them. Upon which theſe two Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals advanced by great journeys, and happily fell upon ſome Parties of the Enemy, whom they cut in pieces. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> at the ſame time began his March.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Then there aroſe a conſternation in the Army of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who believed that they were going to be overwhelmed, and that all the Forces of the Eaſt and Weſt were united in order to fall upon them. The preſence of the Emperor, the approach of two great Captains, the defeat of ſome of their Party, all aſtoniſhed them. They aſſembled together, and fearing to be ſurprized in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> where two Armies came to thunder upon them, they fled into <hi>Thrace.</hi> But being unable to ſubſiſt there by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they had made the preceding years, and not queſtioning but they ſhould be purſued, they ſent Deputies to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> humbly to ſue for Peace.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Albeit they were as yet in a ſtate of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they conſented to be treated as if ſubdued; and offered to retire into their own Country, or to ſerve the Empire; promiſing to accompliſh faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all the conditions that ſhould be laid upon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54793:60"/>
them. The affair was put under deliberation. <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>  and <hi>Arbogastes,</hi> who were near the Emperor, adviſed the extirpation of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him that they were irreconcileable Enemies to the Empire; that they ſued for Peace, only when they were uncapable of making War; that the <hi>Danube</hi> was a Barrier, which they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed themſelves to leap over; that their paſt infidelity ought to ſerve as a caution for the future, and that it was for his repoſe, and that of the State, to deſtroy a Nation always diſturbing to the Emperors, whether in ſerving them, or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war againſt them.</p>
            <p>Others ſuſtained on the contrary, that it was better to prefer a certain Peace before an uncertain Victory; that it was not humane to reject the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of the Enemy, nor ſafe to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their deſpair; that they would be more quiet on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> when they ſhould be forced to repaſs it; that it was not Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the preſent Conjunctures to neglect the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this Nation, and that it would be an eaſy matter to be cautious of their Treaſons. In a word, that the Empire was a Body grown feeble by the long Wars, and could not poſſibly recover itſelf, but by Intervals of Peace.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> praiſed the reſolution of the firſt, and followed the counſel of the ſecond. He granted the <hi>Barbarians</hi> a Peace. The Conditions were, that they ſhould lay down their Arms, and ſwear never to reſume them up againſt the Empire; that they ſhould ſend the Chief of their Captains in Hoſtage; that they ſhould immediately leave the Provinces of the Empire, whoſe Frontiers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54793:61"/>
they ſhould defend againſt other People; that they ſhould furniſh out a certain number of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Troops, to be diſtributed into all the Bodies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; and that the Emperor ſhould alſo protect them, and look upon them as his Friends, and his Allies. The <hi>Goths</hi> accepted theſe Conditions, and began to execute the Treaty in reality.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. In the mean time, the Ordinance of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> in favour of the Catholick Faith, had been publiſhed in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where it had produced very different effects. Thoſe who profeſſed the Faith of <hi>Nice,</hi> took courage, and united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more ſtrictly with <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> whom they regarded as their Paſtor. They run in greater throngs to his Sermons, and urged him often to make uſe of the Authority of the Prince, and to demand of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the Churches which they had uſurped: But as the Edict did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly bear this reſtitution, and that it was not yet time to touch that Point, the Saint moderated their Zeal, and exhorted them to attend the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's concluſion of what he had begun.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of the Officers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the City, who favoured the Hereticks before, were of opinion that they ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves to the time, and reſpect the Religion of the Prince. But the <hi>Arrians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed their reſentments in every Encounter. The news of the Baptiſm of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had much alarmed them. They gloried in the honour of baptizing the Emperors of the Eaſt till now; and as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it had been a right of Preſcription for the time to come, they complained that <hi>Aſcole</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred this Sacrament to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54793:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> had adminiſtred to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Euzoïus</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Endoxius</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Valens.</hi> They well foreſaw the conſequences of this Action.</p>
            <p>But afterwards when they heard publiſhed a Law, which diſgraced them and condemned them, they were like furious perſons; they complained highly that they were diſhonoured without a cauſe, and fell upon <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> who without making uſe of the advantages of the time, and the protection of the Prince, oppoſed to their Violences nothing but Remonſtrances and Prayers. They proceeded to that exceſs of fury, that they maſſacred at Noon-day a reverend old Man, who was juſt returned from Exile, where he had been ſent under the Reign of <hi>Valens</hi> for the defence of the Faith. After which they obſerved no Bounds, abuſing the Catholicks, to deprive them of all hopes of being reſtored, and riſing up againſt the Magiſtrates, to terrify the Emperor; and to make him fear a general Revolt, if he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ruine a Party which his Predeceſſors had ſo firmly eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was informed of theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and wiſely diſſembled, till he was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to rectify them. He preſſed the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to execute the Treaty, and to repaſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> which they performed in a little time. Then he disbanded the Auxiliaries, after having diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rewards to the Officers and Soldiers, as if they had fought. He gave ſo many marks of eſteem and good will to the two Generals, that they returned with the ſole regret of not finding an opportunity to expoſe their lives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>All things being thus compoſed, this Prince gave orders for the fortifying of the Frontier places, gave Quarters of refreſhment to his Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he incorporated thoſe choſen Troops, which the <hi>Goths</hi> had furniſhed him with; and after he had ſecured the adjacent Provinces from the inſults of the Enemy, he took the Road of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> As he foreſaw he ſhould have to do with obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſeditious Spirits, he thought it proper to march with a part of his Troops, and upon the twenty fourth day of <hi>November</hi> he was received in <note place="margin">Idat.

            <p n="22">XXII. As the affair of Religion was the moſt conſiderable, and ought perhaps to be regulated one of the firſt, it was expected what the Succeſs would be. The two Parties, as it happens for the moſt part in diviſions, obſerving all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prince, to draw from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures upon their Intereſts. The <hi>Arrians</hi> ſeeing him appear with ſo much grandeur, whoſe Laws they had deſpiſed, expected to be uſed as they deſerved. Altho' they were afraid to come near him, yet they could not diſpence themſelves from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

going to ſee him, becauſe they compoſed the  Body of the Clergy, and beſides it was of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to them to diſcover what was ſuſpected to have been reſolved againſt them. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror received them with honour, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to enter into any diſcuſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, anſwered to their Civilities, as he had done to thoſe of others.</p>
            <p>The Catholicks, who were deſirous to ſee them humbled, were offended at the good entertainment they had received. Altho' they were aſſured of the good intentions of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> they queſtioned his having the force to execute them. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed openly, that he had made no diſtinction <note place="margin">Greg. Naz: Carm. de vita ſua.</note>between Catholicks and <hi>Arrians;</hi> that he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Hereticks in ſparing them; that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſchiefs of the Church could not be cured, but by violent applications; that it was ſtrange, that wicked Emperors ſhould be ſo fervent in maintaining Impiety, and that the good ſhould be ſo ſlow and circumſpect in keeping up the truth. <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. ibid.</note>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> himſelf complained of this conduct; but he was convinced at length that this Prince managed himſelf very prudently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in matter of Faith, ſweetneſs and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance is the moſt effectual means to bring over the minds of People, and that the buſineſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to perſuade, and not to command.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> without ſeeming much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at theſe Controverſies, ſtay'd for a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time to execute his deſign. He judged that to re-eſtabliſh the Orthodox Faith, it was moſt proper to begin with <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was the common place of the Eaſt and Weſt and as it were the Center, where the extremities of the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54793:63"/>
 world re-unite, and from whence the Faith would afterwards eaſily communicate itſelf to all the parts of the Empire. But the Enterprize was not without difficulty. This City had been founded by a Catholick Emperor, and inſtructed in the Faith by two of the holy Biſhops of that Age. It had not long enjoyed the fruits of the Peace, which that Prince had there maintained, nor of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which thoſe Prelats had given there. The Emperors being turned <hi>Arrians</hi> at the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Paſtors who were already ſo, and the temporal Authority uniting with the ſpiritual for the deſtroying of the Faith, there hapned in a little time a wonderful Revolution. The Clergy followed the Doctrine of the Archbiſhops, the Court framing itſelf to the Religion of the Prince, and the People was drawn by the example of both. Thoſe who perſiſted in the ancient Faith were contented to bewail in private, or elſe were diſperſed by the Perſecutions.</p>
            <p>During theſe Troubles, divers Sects were eſtabliſhed in this Capital of the Empire, where every Novelty found always Partiſans.

            <p n="24">XXIV. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> after he had ſedulouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed himſelf in all theſe things, judged it high time to make himſelf appear. He went in Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, accompanied with all his Court, to the <hi>Anaſtaſy,</hi> where all the Catholicks being aſſembled, received him with extraordinary Joy and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. <hi>Gregory</hi> advancing to ſalute him, the <note place="margin">Greg. Naz.

He aſſiſted at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Divine Myſteries; and when they were concluded, he had a pretty long Conference
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54793:64"/>
 with the Biſhop. He diſcovered to him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he had to uſe his Authority againſt the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and to reſtore the Catholicks to their ancient Rights.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Saint reports, that he ſpoke to him in theſe terms, or to the like effect:</hi> God makes uſe of us, my Father, to eſtabliſh you in this Church. 'Tis a Reward that is due to your Vertue, and your Labours. The whole City is diſorder'd, and pretends either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. ibid.</note>my Orders, or to make me conſent to leave it in its poſſeſſion. But nothing ought to diſcourage a Prince that ſuſtains ſo pious a Cauſe. The undertaking appears impoſſible to many, till ſuch time as I ſhall have performed it. I go to work with the aſſiſtance of Heaven. I cannot make a better uſe of my power, than to employ it in the ſervice of God, from whom I hold it, nor do any thing of greater advantage for one of the principal Churches of the world, than to prefer to it ſuch a Paſtor as you.</p>
            <p>Gregory <hi>replied to the Emperor,</hi> That the reſolution which he had taken to maintain Religion, was worthy of him; that all good Men had expected to be happy under his Reign; that he was unqueſtionably deſigned to repair the faults of his Predeceſſors; that God would bleſs his Intentions, ſince he had none but just ones; and that after having fixed the Empire in peace, there remained no more than to fix the Church likewiſe therein.</p>
            <p>As to the honour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> would do him, he returned him thanks in terms full of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and humility, repreſenting to him, That he demanded no other recompence for his ſervices, if he had been happy enough to render any to the Church, than to be ſent back to his ſolitude of <hi>Arianze,</hi> from whence he had been drawn; that he was not fit for the ſociety of the Grandees of the Age; that whatſoever affection he entertained for his Flock, he would from henceforth abandon
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54793:64"/>
it without trouble, ſince he left it under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection  of ſo pious an Emperor; that he entreated ſo much the more inſtantly the permiſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, <note place="margin">

            <p n="25">XXV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being returned to his Palace, and knowing the perplexity wherein the <hi>Arrians</hi> were, ſent the ſame day to demand of <hi>Demophilus</hi> their Biſhop, if he would embrace the Faith of <note place="margin">Socrat. ib.

               <hi>Nice,</hi> and reunite the People in one Body. This Heretick anſwered, that he could not change his opinion, nor conſent to an accommodation. Then the Prince commanded him, that ſince he refuſed to ſide with the truth, and that he perſiſted in his inclination to harbor a diviſion in the Metropolis of the Empire, to abandon without delay all the Churches of the City, and to reſtore them to the Catholicks, as they had enjoyed them under the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. <hi>Demophilus</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at a Command ſo rough, and unexpected, was ſome time uncapable of ſpeaking; and returned at laſt no other Anſwer, than that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the People with the Emperor's pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he was thinking how to elude this Order, either by artificial Requeſts, or by affected delays, or elſe by an open Rebellion. But having conſidered the difficulty of reſiſting Power, and impoſing upon an enlightned Prince, that was reſolved not to relax upon this Point, he aſſembled the People in the Church, and riſing up in the midſt of them, expoſed to them the Command he had received. After which he ſaid to them,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54793:65"/>
 that being unwilling to ſubſcribe to the deciſions of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and unable to oppoſe the Authority of the Emperor, he was reduced to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">

            <p n="26">XXVI. The Hereticks were ſo affected at the words of <hi>Demophilus,</hi> that they put the whole City in emotion. Some taking up Arms ran to the Churches in order to ſeize upon them; others went in a tumult to the gate of the Palace, to implore the Emperors mercy; ſome of them inveſted the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and threatned to revenge the retreat of their aſſociates upon the Biſhop of the Catholics. The places and the ſtreets were full of women, children, and old men bathed in tears. There <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. Carm. devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>There remained nothing more, but to inſtall <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum,</hi> and he would be preſent at this action. He went to take him in the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> and carried him himſelf, as it were in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, in the midſt of his Guards to the Church, where a thankſgiving was ſolemnly rendred to God. The prayers being ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the greateſt part of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54793:65"/>
People lifting up their Voices, wiſhed a thouſand  bleſſings to the Emperor, and entreated him, as a complement of favours, to give them <hi>Gregory</hi> for their Biſhop. The Saint ſuffering impatiently the heat, which tranſported them, and being unable to make himſelf heard by reaſon of his weakneſs, prayed him that was ſeated near him, to ſpeak to them from him, that they ſhould ceaſe to cry ſo; that they were aſſembled to adore the Trinity, and not to chuſe a Biſhop; and that upon a day ſo happy as that, their only buſineſs was to praiſe and glorify God.</p>
            <p>The People received this correction with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and teſtified by their applauſes how much they were affected with the modeſty of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. The Emperor himſelf gave him great commendations, and put him in poſſeſſion not only of the Churches, but alſo of the Epiſcopal Houſe, and all the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues. Thus this grand affair was determined, by the cares and reſolution of <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> As he had very expreſly <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. ib.</note>commanded the Officers of his Troops to hinder Sedition without committing any Violence; all this tumult was appeaſed with ſo much order, that, there was but one ſingle Sword drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of the moſt zealous <hi>Arrians.</hi> It was an extream joy to the Emperor, to have diſpoſſeſſed the Hereticks, without the price of any of their blood, of thoſe Churches which they had procured by the death of ſo many venerable Perſons.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he thus weakned in the Eaſt the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Party, he learnt with pleaſure, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Juſtine,</hi> Mother of the young <hi>Valentinian,</hi> vainly endeavored to eſtabliſh them at <hi>Milan;</hi> that the See of <hi>Sirmium</hi> being vacant, ſhe had made a Journey thither on purpoſe to inſtall a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54793:66"/>
 of her Sect; but that Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> whoſe place it was to preſide at this Election, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the ſtroak; that <hi>Gratian</hi> being importuned by the ſollicitations of this Princeſs, had granted her a Church of the Catholics, but that after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known the conſequence of the gift he had made, he reſtored it to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in whoſe right alone was the diſpoſal of it, and that there was reaſon to hope, that this Hereſy would loſe much of its Credit and Pride.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. After that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had ſo happily executed what he undertook for the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Religion he carefully applied himſelf to the affairs of the Empire. He began by regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Souldiery. He created ſeveral Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>Generals, to whom he allowed great Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he augmented the number of the Officers in Companies, knowing that there is nothing of more force to Armies, and contributes more to diſcipline. He made great preſents to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> who had ſerved him, and forgot nothing that might win them to his ſervice, giving to ſome employments which fixed them near his Perſon, marrying others of them into the richeſt Families of Court or City, and diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them thus from the Intereſt of their Country.</p>
            <p>This Policy preſerved him from the Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, which <hi>Eriulphus</hi> and <hi>Fravitas,</hi> two of the chief Captains of the <hi>Goths,</hi> prepared for him. Whether they had been choſen for Hoſtages, or had commanded that body of Troops which their Nation provided, or elſe had voluntarily inrolled themſeves in the Emperor's ſervice, they were come with a deſign to take their opportunity, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54793:66"/>
encourage their men to a revolt. The Emperor  retained them in his Court, and loaded them with Riches and Honors. <hi>Fravitas</hi> becoming amorous of a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, he made her eſpouſe him, and <note place="margin">Eynap. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>engaged him ſo well to the Empire's Party by this marriage, and by his favors, that he ſince ſerved with an exact fidelity in all its Wars, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at length to be advanced to the Conſulſhip under the reign of <hi>Arcadius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. This Captain forgetting his former reſolutions, and applying himſelf by gratitude to the ſervice of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> endeavoured to win over <hi>Eriulphus,</hi> and repreſented to him ſeveral times that it was for his Intereſt and Honor to give himſelf up entirely to a Prince, of whom he had received ſo many Favours, and might ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more. But <hi>Eriulphus,</hi> who had conceived an irreconcilable hatred againſt the Emperor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted always in his deſign, and defended himſelf upon what he was obliged by Oath. There aroſe betwixt them upon this occaſion a great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, which remained a long time concealed. <hi>Fravitas,</hi> hoping that <hi>Eriulphus</hi> would render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at length, and judging that it was not ſafe to defer it; moreover ſeeing that he was not in a condition yet to do any harm, was contented to obſerve him, in order to break his meaſures.</p>

 proceeding. But <hi>Eriulphus</hi> going out to animate his men, <hi>Fravitas</hi> purſued him forthwith in order to prevent him, and having joyned him pretty near the Palace, paſſed his Sword through his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and killed him. It was not difficult for him to prove the ill intentions of the dead, becauſe he knew his accomplices; and he ſince juſtified his fidelity through the whole conduct of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was no leſs careful to regulate the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Empire. He made choice of qualified perſons for the Magiſtrates; and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them Probity and Juſtice; he made Laws, and made them to be obſerved.

 in the midſt of all his Court.

            <p>Be it as it will, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> having finiſhed this City, which he loved as his own work, ſpared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for its ornament and grandeur. He built therein a Capital, a Cirque, an Amphitheater, Squares, Piazza's, and other publick Edifices, in imitation of thoſe at <hi>Rome.</hi> He took from the nobleſt Cities of the Eaſt what was moſt valuable and curious for the embeliſhment of this. He ordered the Remains of the entire works of the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be brought thither; above all the Obelisk of <hi>Thebes,</hi> which was not conveyed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54793:71"/>
without abundance of difficulty. He compoſed  a Senate after that of <hi>Rome.</hi> He drew from all parts of the World, Men excellent in Sciences and Arts, for whom he had erected Colledges and particular Houſes in divers quarters, and aſſigned them conſiderable Penſions. He appointed Funds for the ſubſiſtence of the Citizens, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Buildings. He founded Churches and Academies, and perfected the deſign he had to make a City equal, and even ſuperior to the ancient <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Emperors had not been leſs careful towards the beautifying of <hi>Conſtantinople.

            <p>
               <hi>Athanaric</hi> admired all theſe things. He could not ſufficiently behold the Port filled with Veſſels from all the Nations of the World, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of People retained by the conveniency of

            <p n="38">XXXVIII. <hi>Athanaric</hi> began to loſe the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his misfortunes, and there was reaſon to hope that he might embrace the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which he had heretofore cruelly perſecuted. But as in an advanced Age his Paſſions were yet lively, the grief which his misfortune had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned him having already weakned him, the joy of ſeeing himſelf ſo honourably treated ſeized upon him, and made ſuch an impreſſion upon his vitals, that he fell ſick, and dyed 15 days after his arrival at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Emperor, who had rendred him all the offices of a good Friend, was much afflicted at his death; becauſe he loved him, and was in hopes to have made uſe of him one day to reduce the whole Nation to a firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant alliance with the Empire.

            <p n="39">XXXIX. This goodneſs of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had a greater influence than he could expect upon the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54793:72"/>
minds of the <hi>Goths.</hi> For beſides that <hi>Athanaric,</hi>  before he died, called about his Bed all the Captains that had attended him, and had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them the obligations they were under to preſerve an inviolable Fidelity to the Emperor during the whole courſe of their Lives, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in their own Countrey, when they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither, all the Favors which they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; they were themſelves extremely affected with the Civilities of the <hi>Romans. Theodoſius</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to them very honourable Poſts in his Armies; but they excuſed themſelves, ſaying, <hi>That they would be ne're the leſs united to him, and that they went to ſerve him with more advantage in their own Countrey;</hi> which they executed afterwards, by guarding the paſſages of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and hindring the <hi>Romans</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted on their ſide. Thus the Sweetneſs of Princes oftentimes produces greater Effects than their Power, and the People, who are won by kindneſs, are uſually more firm in their Duty, than thoſe who are conquered by Arms.</p>
            <p n="40">XL. After ſo happy a Succeſs, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſeeing that the Laws he had made in favor of Religion, had ſtopt the diſorders, but not re-united mens ſpirits, reſolved to call together an Univerſal Council, after the example of <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> whoſe Piety he made a Glory in following. From his coming to the Empire, he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <note place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. 8.</note>this thought, becauſe he judged that it was the moſt ſecure, and ready means to determine with ſweetneſs, as he deſired, the Eccleſiaſtical differences. But for the execution of it, he had ſtaid till it war fixed in Peace, and to render this Aſſembly more authentick, he had projected to hold it in the Capital of his Empire. He would
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54793:73"/>
 be there himſelf, in order to diſpoſe all Parties to an agreement, and to maintain by his Authority what ſhould be decided by the conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As ſoon as he put the Catholics in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Churches of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he thought that the Council might aſſemble there, with leſs trouble, and more dignity. He wrote then to all the Biſhops of the Eaſt, to invite them to come to this Imperial City, in order to confirm the Faith of <hi>Nice,</hi> to eſtabliſh a Biſhop therein, and to conſtitute neceſſary Laws towards the ſtrengthning of the Peace of the Church, and the Re-union of his Subjects upon the points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="41">XLI. Of all the Hereticks he called to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil none but the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> becauſe they were <note place="margin">Socrat l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> Greg. Naz. Orat. <hi>44.</hi>

Theſe reaſons had made the Emperor believe, that it was no hard matter to reduce them. They came to the number of Thirty ſix, the moſt part Biſhops of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> the chief of which were <hi>Eleuſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cizycus,</hi> and <hi>Marcian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lampſacus.</hi> This Prince exhorted them himſelf to acknowledge their fault, and repreſented to them that it was time to return to the Faith, and Communion of the Church; that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to it in the deputation they had formerly ſent to Pope <hi>Liberius;</hi> and that a little time before, they made no ſcruple of communicating with the <note place="margin">Socrat. ib.

               <hi>Arrians,</hi> than the Orthodox Men. This anſwer  obliged the Emperor to chaſe them away, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the condeſcention he had had for them.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. All orders were given for the ſubſiſtence, and lodging of the Biſhops; and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was no leſs magnificent in relation to this Council, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had been to that of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Biſhops came from all parts of the Eaſt in haſte, and arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the number of a Hundred and fifty, in the time that had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them. As the laſt Reigns had been times of Perſecution, there were many of theſe Prelates who had compoſed excellent Works againſt the Hereticks, or had ſuffered Exile and Torments for the Defence of the Faith. Never had the Church ſeen more Saints, and Confeſſors aſſembled. They were come with Joy once more to give their Votes for the truth, under an Emperor who had as much zeal to eſtabliſh Religion, as others had to confound it.</p>
            <p>But there were alſo many, who, during the late Reign, were entred into Biſhopricks, or had <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. Carm. de vi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ta ſua.

 XLIII. <hi>Meletius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over this Aſſembly. The Emperor had a paſſionate deſire to ſee him, as well upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the reputation of Sanctity, which this Prelate had got throughout the Eaſt, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had appeared to him in a Viſion, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him the Purple in one hand, and the Crown in t'other. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had always honored him from that time, even before he knew him; and had often ſent him conſiderable Sums, to aſſiſt the Poor of his Dioceſs, and to finiſh the Church which he caus'd to be built in honor of St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylas,</hi> beyond the River <hi>Orontes.</hi> As ſoon as the Biſhops were arrived, they went all together to ſalute the Emperor; who being willing to try, if he could diſtinguiſh <hi>Meletius</hi> from amongſt the reſt, forbid that he ſhould be ſhewn to him. He had fixed in his imagination ſo ſtrong an Idea of his Face, that as ſoon as he perceived him, he obſerved him of himſelf, and affirmed him to be the ſame he had ſeen in a Viſion. He advanced towards him with an impatience full of reſpect, and tenderneſs. He embraced him in a particular manner, and kiſſed his eyes, his head, his breaſt, and above all his hand, which had crowned him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, and rendered to him thoſe honors, which no body was jealous of, becauſe every one eſteemed him worthy of them. Then he behaved himſelf with much civility to the other Biſhops, <note place="margin">Theodor. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>and entreated them as his Fathers to endeavor with all their power to anſwer the end, for which they were aſſembled.</p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. The opening of the Council being made with much ſolemnity, they agreed upon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54793:74"/>
beginning with what related to the Church of  <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Altho this affair was not the moſt important, notwithſtanding it appeared the moſt preſſing, becauſe <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was much concerned therein, and that it was convenient to ſupply with a Perſon of great merit, a See, whoſe Rights and Dignity were preſumed to be augmented. <hi>Maximus</hi> had not deſiſted from his pretenſion: but his Ordination was ſo contrary to the Laws and Eccleſiaſtical Forms, that the Council had declared that he was not Biſhop, and could not exerciſe the Functions thereof. Thoſe, who had protected him, were blamed, and thoſe whom he <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>
               </note>had ordained were degraded, and judged unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of holding any rank amongſt the Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianzum</hi> had been choſen by the Suffrages of the People, and the Authority of the Emperor; he was without a See; that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was vacant. He had been charged with the care of this Church, and went under the Title of it. Thus this Election <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> have paſſed for legitimate. But <hi>Gregory,</hi> who lived without Ambition, would attempt nothing contrary to <note place="margin">Greg. Naz. Orat. <hi>27.</hi>
               </note>Diſciplines, did not think himſelf engaged to a charge which he had not accepted. He alledged that a Prelate without a Title could not take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a vacant Church, unleſs authorized by a Council; and that the irregular conduct which had been held in reference to him, gave occaſion for ambitious Ptelates to ſeize upon the vacant Sees, for the People to eſtabliſh them in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner, and for Metropolitans to diſpoſſeſs them out of humane conſiderations.</p>

But for all they found miſtakes in their Elections, they did not ceaſe to honour their perſons; and it was agreed on both ſides, that <hi>Meletius</hi> had been worthy of the See of <hi>Antioch,</hi> if he had not been advanced thereto by the <hi>Arians,</hi> and that <hi>Paulinus</hi> had merited to have been ordained Biſhop, if it had been of another Church than that of <hi>Antioch.</hi>

            <p>But the young Men ſuſtained on the other ſide, that it was not fitting for the Succeſſion of an Epiſcopacy to be interrupted in ſo holy a Man as <hi>Meletius;</hi> that <hi>Paulinus</hi> was the Creature of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus;</hi> that he had been ordained by a Biſhop of the Weſt, who had neither the Priviledge nor Commiſſion to do it, and that ſo the Eaſtern Church could not acknowledge him without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring itſelf.</p>

LVI. There remained nothing more, than to  make the Emperor agree to his deſign. He went to find him, and after having beg'd of him to eſtabliſh Peace in the Council, and to retain by his Authority thoſe whom the fear of God did not retain, he petitioned him for his permiſſion to retire. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who was not uſed to be entreated for ſuch Favors, was ſurprized at his Requeſt, and endeavored by ſtrong Conſiderations to ſtop him; he would even interpoſe himſelf to maintain him in his Dignity. But the Archbiſhop repreſented to him, that it was not for ſo juſt and pious an Emperor as he, to prefer the Intereſts of a private Man to thoſe of the whole Church; and that as for him, he thought himſelf obliged to make this ſacrifice of his See, at a time when his old Age and Infirmities left him ſcarce any ſtrength to aſſiſt his Flock, otherwiſe than by his Prayers and Wiſhes.</p>
            <p n="57">LVII. After having procured the Emperor's conſent, he aſſembled the People in his Cathedral, and pronounced, in preſence of all the Fathers of the Council, that laſt and celebrated Sermon, where he rendred an account of his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Greg.

He repreſented the ſtate of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> how the Faith had been revived in his time, how it was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, what he had done and ſuffered upon that ſubject. He explained the Doctrine which he had preach'd, and truſting to his innocence, after the example of <hi>Samuel</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he took his Auditors for Witneſſes of his diſintereſſedneſs, and the care he had taken, after having declared the Goſpel to them, to be encloſed within himſelf,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54793:82"/>
 and to preſerve the purity of his Prieſthood. He expoſed in a few words the principal cauſes of his Retirement, which were the Conteſts he ſaw raiſed in the Church, and the importunate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which were made him of treating the Hereticks with too much Civility, and of keeping nothing in his Retinue, his Table, or his Perſon, <note place="margin">

            <p>In a word, after having exhorted the People to retain the Faith which he had taught them, the Hereticks to be converted, the Courtiers to be reclaimed, the Biſhops to reunite and quit their Sees like him, if they might thereby contribute towards a Peace; after having wiſhed for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor a worthy Man, who without wanting Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Condeſcention, might have the Courage to procure Enemies for the ſake of Juſtice: he took leave of each of his Churches, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of his dear <hi>Anaſtaſy,</hi> then of all the Societies and Orders of the City. He beg'd of them to remember him, and his labors, for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no other recompence, than the permiſſion of retiring. Inſtead of the uſual Applauſes, there was heard nothing but Lamentations and Groans during this diſcourſe: every one retired to his houſe drowned in tears; and the Archbiſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved to compaſſion, but notwithſtanding inflexible in his reſolution, went to enjoy the pleaſures of that ſolitude which he had always ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly loved.</p>

            <p>Nevertheleſs without diſcovering himſelf to him, he pray'd him to accompany him to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to whom he preſented him with a mighty character. Afterwards he recommended <hi>Nectari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to him in ſecret, and was very urgent with him to give him his Vote, and to write his name with the reſt.

            <p n="60">LX. The Emperour, having demanded a few days after the memorial of the Biſhops, examined it attentively; and after having viewed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed the names of thoſe who were propoſed to ſucceed <hi>Gregory,</hi> he ſtopt at that of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> who was the leaſt expected.

who would not imitate him. <hi>Nectarius,</hi> whom  <hi>Diodorus</hi> had entreated to defer his journey till then, had advice of this news, and could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. The greateſt part of the Fathers of the Council were aſtoniſhed at this choice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of one another, who this <hi>Nectarius</hi> was? from whence he came? and what was his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? But when they underſtood that he had not led a life pure enough to deſerve to be thus raiſed on a ſudden to the Prieſthood, and moreover that he was not yet baptized, they imagined that the Emperour had been ſurprized, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Although there was nothing more juſt than this remonſtaance, the Emperor had remarked ſo many Paſſions and Cabals in thoſe, who offered it, that he thought ſince they had chaſed away the other Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, they had a mind to exclude this alſo, in order to put one of their own party in the place.

As he had ſcarce any acquaintance with Eccleſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His life, after his ordination was exemplary, and his Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Orthodox: but he had ſo much eaſineſs and indulgence for all the World, and ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference for Diſcipline, that the <hi>Arians</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably prevailed over him, if the Emperour, to repair the fault he had committed, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them, and taken upon himſelf the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and force, that was wanting to this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop.</p>
            <p n="63">LXIII. This affair being thus determined, they began to think upon the concluſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

Edicts in favour of Religion; and to cloſe up the  Council by ſome ceremony of note, he made to be tranſported to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the body of <hi>Paul,</hi>

            <p>Thus concluded towards the end of <hi>July</hi> this Council, which the Eaſt acknowledged for oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical, and which the Pope St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſince put in the number of the four, which he revered as the four Goſpels.

            <p>This moderation, which he ſhewed, did not ceaſe to be very ſevere: for beſides that he kept them four days negotiating, at a time when they <note place="margin">Ammian. lib. <hi>25.</hi>

            <p>Theſe two Generals marched with the Legions towards the frontier, taking always advantageous Poſts for the Inſantry, which made all the ſtrength of their Army. There they kept themſelves cloſe, and even gave way on purpoſe, when they ſaw the enemy approach, leſt they ſhould be accuſed of being the firſt in the infringement of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But at length, the <hi>Perſians</hi> being come on to force them, in the conſideration that they fled through cowardize, and not prudence, there was a neceſſity of coming to a cloſe engagement.

            <p>In the mean time, thoſe who had an eye upon the affairs of <hi>Armenia,</hi> wrote to the Emperour, that it was convenient to ſend thither another King; that all was in diſorder; that <hi>Para</hi> miſuſed his Subjects; and that he would oblige them by his pride to throw themſelves into the arms of the King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> which would be of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in relation to the Empire. <hi>Valens</hi> having ſent to deſire his company, under pretence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with him upon the preſent affairs, left him at <hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> without ſaying any thing to him; and gave him a good number of Officers, in appearance to ſerve him, but in reality to guard him.

               </gap>y; and diſſembling all the ſubjects he had to complain of the Emperour, he continued in that fidelity he had ſworn to the Empire.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who commanded in <hi>Armenia</hi> and the adjacent Provinces, fearing leſt he ſhould give up his Kingdom to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> wrote againſt him to the Court, and accuſed him of holding private intelligence with the Enemy; of having put to death two of his Miniſters, that were affectionate to his ſervice, and the Intereſts of the Empire; and above all, of medling with enchantments and Magick. Several teſtified that he had a ſecret to transform Men, or to conſume them by incurable languors: Thoſe who purſued him, to excuſe their ill ſucceſs, affirmed that he had bewitched their eyes. <hi>Valens,</hi> who was credulous and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful, and apprehended nothing ſo much as to periſh by Inchantments, gave ſecret Orders, that they ſhould either by force or artifice deliver him from ſo dangerous a man: which was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution not long after at a Feaſt, where this young Prince was inhumanely murdered.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54793:88"/>
and replied, That he kept up to the ancient  Treaties, and would innovate nothing.</p>
            <p>After ſeveral ſhifts and turnings they came to menaces, and a little time after they prepared on both ſides for War. <hi>Valens</hi> levied forces in the Country of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and reſolved to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Perſia</hi> with three Bodies of an Army at the beginning of the Spring. <hi>Sapor</hi> ſollicited his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for aſſiſtance, and aſſembled a great Army. He even prevented the <hi>Romans,</hi> and threw himſelf upon ſome neighbouring Provinces, which they had newly won. The revolt of the <hi>Goths</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about that time, it was convenient to ſuffer all things from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and to make Peace with them upon conditions little honourable, but neceſſary.</p>

               </note>the Eaſtern Biſhops being called a ſecond time by the Emperor, arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> The moſt part of thoſe who were preſent there the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came again, and thoſe who could not go out of their Provinces, gave their Conſents by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Power to act in their Names.

               <hi>As ſoon as theſe Prelates were arrived,</hi> Theodoſius <hi>communicated to them the Propoſal of the</hi> Italian <hi>Biſhops, and deſired their advice upon the general Synod, which they had a mind to have held at</hi> Rome. <hi>They made anſwer,</hi> That they did not refuſe to contribute towards a confirmation of the Faith, and the reunion of the Church; but they pray'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there was no ſuch urgent occaſion to oblige them to go ſo far; That whilſt the Weſt rejoiced in a profound Peace, the Eaſt had been agitated with cruel Tempeſts; and that after theſe Perſecutions, the Churches ſtood in need of the preſence of their Paſtors; That beſides they had not the conſent of their Brothers, but for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that there was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time to conſult them upon the ſubject of that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They made the ſame Reply to thoſe who had invited them to this Council. They added a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, whereby they acknowledged the Trinity, and the Incarnation; and after having rendred them an account of the election of <hi>Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and that of <hi>Flavian,</hi> they deſired them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

They alſo deputed three Biſhops of their Body to thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> to teſtify their deſires to ſee them, and to aſſure them of their inclinations for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their zeal for the Faith. The Emperor obſerving under theſe demonſtrations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Religion, abundance of coldneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference in their minds, received their Excuſes, and thought it convenient to hinder an Aſſembly that would be compoſed of two Parties already formed, and which in all appearance would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nothing but diſturbances, like thoſe he had ſeen at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with ſo much diſpleaſure.

The cares of her Regency extended no further than to the obtaining of a Biſhop of her own Party, or to the depriving the Catholicks of a Church. She diſtributed her favours to thoſe, who obliged her with a compliance to her paſſions, and ſhe could not imagine that the State could have other Enemies, than thoſe who oppoſed her error. All things were to be feared under an infant Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in whom were imprinted ill apprehenſions of things, and under a Heretic Empreſs, who was more ſedulous for the advancement of her Sect, than ſor the peace and ſecurity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>

The Majeſty of the Prince, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, their ſurprize, the approaching ruine of their Sects, the ſhame of having ſo ill defended their Cauſes, cauſed trouble and confuſion in their minds.

To accompliſh the deſtruction of theſe Hereſies, the Emperor immediately ſent out an Ordinance, whereby he prohibited Hereticks to aſſemble together, to inſtruct the People either in City or Countrey, to be poſſeſſed of any building that ſhould have any manner of likeneſs to a Church, in a word to ſay or do any thing in private or publick, that was contrary to the Catholic Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; permitting all the good Men of his Empire
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54793:104"/>
to unite themſelves in order to the chaſing from  civil ſociety all thoſe who ſhould dare to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this Ordinance. He likewiſe enjoined all Officers and Magiſtrates to oblige the <hi>Arians</hi> to confine themſelves within their Cities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, leſt by a too free communication with the People, they ſhould diſperſe abroad their veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Principles. And to be aſſured of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Edicts, he ordered the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of thoſe Cities, wherein the <hi>Arians</hi> ſhould hold any Congregation, to be moſt ſeverely puniſhed, and the houſes, wherein they ſhould be caught, confiſcated.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. There was need of an Authority like his, to repreſs a Sect ſo rebellious, ſo extenſive, and ſo imperious. But notwithſtanding all his vigor, he ſtill retained much goodneſs. He terrified the <note place="margin">Sozom l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note>Hereticks, without ordaining any Puniſhments for them. He kept them in obedience, without exacting forced Converſions; and leaving to God the affecting their hearts by his grace, he contented himſelf to humble them, by the little eſteem he made of them, or to attract them by the favors which he ſhewed to all thoſe who returned to his communion, and never came to threatnings, till he had practiſed all the ways of ſweetneſs.</p>
            <p>This candid Behavior oftentimes diſturbed the Catholicks, who, by an inconſiderate zeal, were always for extirpating their Enemies. It gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a wiſe Remonſtrance, which was made to him by <hi>Amphilochus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Iconium.

 them by very preſſing Conſiderations to hearken to a reunion. The Conducts he had with them, and the Civilities which he ſhewed them, gave a diſturbance to ſeveral holy Biſhops, who did not pierce into his deſigns. They were afraid of his being ſurprized by thoſe artificial Men, who knew how to diſguiſe their malice, and did not want Intrigues and Cabals in Court.

            <p n="29">XXIX. <hi>Symmachus</hi> at that time held the firſt Rank in the Senate. His Quality, his Eloquence, his Employments, and the reputation of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, rendred him very conſiderable to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. But whether it was out of a ſtrong prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for the worſhip of falſe Gods, or out of a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54793:106"/>
 vain deſire to ſupport a decaying Religion, and to govern in the Party, he became not only trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom in occaſions, but alſo unfaithful to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. He honoured them more or leſs, according as they ſpared, or oppreſſed the Idols. All the Edicts againſt the Pagans appeared to him Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and all the publick Calamities paſſed in his mind for vengeances of incenſed Heaven.</p>
            <p>This Man always ready for new Intrigues of Complaint, or to preſent Petitions for the ſervice of his Gods, ſuppoſing that the Famine, and the other misfortunes of the Empire, were divine Puniſhments, made up an eloquent Requeſt, which he ſent to the Emperor <hi>Valentinian.</hi> He entreated him, in the quality of Prefect of the City, and in the Name of all the Senate, to re-eſtabliſh the Religion of <hi>Rome;</hi> to have regard to cuſtom, and to the antiquity of a reaſonable belief; to leave to this People accuſtomed to their liberty, the uſe of their Conſciences at leaſt; to re-eſtabliſh the <note place="margin">Symmach. relat: ad Imp.</note>Altar of Victory, that Goddeſs, who had never forſook the <hi>Romans</hi> in their military Expeditions; to retain the name of her, if he did not fear her power, and to be willing at leaſt to diſſemble, after the example of ſome of his Predeceſſors, what he had reſolved not to permit.</p>
            <p>He introduced <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> all bathed in tears, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanded of her Emperors that Worſhip where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe had grown old, under which ſhe had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all the World. He remonſtrated as he went along, that it was too late to correct her; That if he was unwilling to acknowledge her Gods, he ſhould leave them at leaſt in repoſe; That it was credible, that all breathing the ſame Air, and being covered with the ſame Heaven, they adored in the bottom the ſame thing; That there were divers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54793:106"/>
Philoſophies, and that it was of no importance  by what method they obtained the truth, provided they arrived there.</p>
            <p>He added, That it was ſtrange that magnificent Princes ſhould reform what covetous Princes had eſtabliſhed; That the Royal Treaſury, inſtead of being filled with the Spoils of the Enemy, was enlarged by the retrenched Penſions of the Prieſts and Veſtals, who made Vows for the Proſperity of the Empire; That the Famine, and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Misfortunes, proceeded neither from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Stars, nor the rigor of Winters, nor the droughts of Summers, but from the wrath of God, who took away Neceſſaries from all thoſe People who deprived their Miniſters thereof.</p>
            <p>He concluded by the Examples of the laſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; and exhorted <hi>Valentinian</hi> to leave Men the liberty which his Father of happy memory had permitted, and to conſider that <hi>Gratian</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had followed the counſels of others, and did not know of his diſobliging the Senate, when he attempted that change in Religion. He preſſed the Council to determine ſuddenly thereupon, as if he had had meaſures to take upon the Anſwer which was to be received, as well to terrify the Court, as to give them no opportunity of conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>XXX. The requeſt of</hi> Symmachus, <hi>mixed with reſpect and boldneſs, preſently aſtoniſhed the young</hi> Valentinian. <hi>He feared all things, and had ſtill before his eyes the bloody image of</hi> Gratian <hi>aſſaſſinated by his own proper friends. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who governed, conſidered her ſecurity, more than her Religion; and the reaſon of State was going to determine her againſt Juſtice and Piety. St.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>had information of it, and oppoſing his lively and generous exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the bold entreaties of the Gentiles, he wrote forthwith to</hi> Valentinian, <hi>and repreſented to him;</hi> That there was but one God, whom Emperors were obliged to obey, as well as the leaſt of their Subjects; That it was to renounce his Faith, to conſent to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane worſhip; That the revenues of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Priests having been confiſcated, it would not be to restore them <note place="margin">Ambroſ.

            <p>
               <hi>It was about two years ſince the</hi> Pagans <hi>had preſented a like Requeſt in the name of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Senate; but it was afterwards diſcovered, that</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:54793:107"/>
               <hi>it was nothing but a Cabal of ſome Senators, who abuſed the name of their Society, whereof the greateſt part diſapproved of this action, and put into the hands of Pope</hi> Damaſus <hi>an act of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt the Requeſt. St.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>did not ceaſe to alledge this example, to leſſen the fear he might conceive of the Senate. He made him at length apprehend the vigour and zeal of the Biſhops, and ſaid to him with his uſual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> What will you reply to a Biſhop, who ſhall tell you, the Church hath nothing to do with your preſents, ſince you make them to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods?

Has not he expreſſed to you in his Goſpel, that one cannot ſerve two Maſters? The Chriſtian Virgins have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and you afford them to the Veſtals. And do you think that the Prieſts pray for you, who prefer the prayers of Gentiles before theirs? will you caſt your ſelf upon your minority for an excuſe?

            <p n="31">XXXI. In fine, he conjured him to decide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereupon, without knowing the opinion of the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who ought to be inſtead of a Father to him, and whom he had been uſed to conſult in affairs of importance.

               </note>wherein he finds himſelf of taking his precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to illuſtrate this affair he ſearcht the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of reaſoning, leaving <hi>Symmachus</hi> all the glory

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>384</label> of eloquence and politeneſs, becauſe 'tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Pagan</hi> wits to dazzle the mind by colours as falſe as their Idols, and to ſay great things, being unable to expreſs what's true. He makes <hi>Rome</hi> ſpeak, and declare with much grace and gravity, <hi>That ſhe has ſubdued the World by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of her VVarriors, and not hy the adoration of her Gods; That ſhe doth not bluſh at her alteration, ſince ſhe corects herſelf; That ſhe doth not ground the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Religion upon years, but upon manners; That ſhe had rather hear the will of God by the word of God, than by the intrails of murdered animals. That no body can ſpeak better of God, than God himſelf; and that thoſe men, who were not ſufficiently enlightned to know themſelves, could never arrive at the knowledge of their Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards he mocks at the Requeſt of <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and repreſents that there is this difference between the Gentiles and the Chriſtians, that the one entreat the Emperors to reſtore Peace to their Gods, and the others beg of Jeſus Chriſt to grant Peace to the Emperors; That the one could not diſpenſe with the leaſt retrenchment of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues without complaint, and the others deprive themſelves of their poſſeſſions, and reſign their lives with ſatisfaction; That the Veſtals wanted Priviledges and Penſions, as if they were unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being chaſte for nothing; whereas the Chriſtian Virgins content themſelves with a courſe Vail, which hides their Face, and renouncing for ever their Riches as well as their Pleaſures, they find all the reward of Vertue in Vertue it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Then he remonſtrated, that they were much to blame for attributing all the misfortunes of the State, to the retrenchment of the penſions of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54793:108"/>
Prieſts and Veſtals; That if their Gods revenge  rhemſelves upon the whole Empire, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which was done to ſome particulars, they are unjuſt, and the vengeance is worſe than the crime; That it is a long time ſince their Temples were deprived of all their priviledges, and hitherto they have not minded to ſend down revenge; That nothing had been done for their pacification, and yet the Fields were covered with an abundant Harveſt, and that the Plenty was univerſal. In a word, he laughed at the precipitation which they teſtified for the Altar of Victory, which was but a name and a ſucceſs of battels; and he exhorts <hi>Valentinian</hi> to conſider in this occaſion what he owed his Faith, and the remembrance of his Brother.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. This affair having being examined in tha Emperors Council, altho this Court managed it ſelf rather by conſiderations of policy, than by rulys of piety, it ſubmitted to the reaſons which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had alledged. The reſpect which they had for <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> whoſe ſentiments they were not ignorant of, prevailed over the fear which they conceived of the Tyrant <hi>Maximus,</hi> and it was judged better to afflict a ſmall number of Senators, than to offend all the good men of the Empire. <hi>Inſomuch that</hi> Symmachus <hi>carried away nothing but the glory of having exerciſed his Eloquence, and well enough defended his bad cauſe:</hi> which gave occaſion for a Poet of that time to ſay, <hi>That Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory muſt be a Goddeſs very blind, or very ungrateful, ſince ſhe had abandoned her Defender to aſſiſt her Enemy.</hi>

            <p n="33">XXXIII. If the ſingle name of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſtopt in the Weſt the bold pretenſions of Idolaters, his

            <p>This humility did but augment the eſteem which the Emperor had for her, and gave her every day more influence upon the ſpirit of this Prince.

 had Orders at the ſame time to take with him as many Soldiers as he would, and put himſelf in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them.</p>
            <p n="56">LVI. The noiſe being then diſperſed about the City, that Soldiers were ſent to ſeize upon the Churches, and to kill the Archbiſhop, if he made any difficulty of reſigning them into their hands, the People run from all Parts, and encloſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the Cathedral, being reſolved to defend both Church and Paſtor to the laſt drop <note place="margin">S.

            <p>
               <hi>They had paſſed ſome days and nights in this condition, when the Tribunes inveſted the Church with their Soldiers, and ſummoned the Archbiſhop by vertue of the laſt Edict to reſign it to them, offering him, as an act of mercy, the liberty of retiring with thoſe who had a mind to follow him. The holy Prelate anſwered to them,</hi> That they might oppreſs him in his Church, but that he would never leave it voluntarily; That if they came to queſtion his Revenues, or even the Funds of the Church, he would diſpenſe with that violence; but as for the inheritance of Jeſus Chriſt, he would preſerve it to the expence of his own Life; That indeed he had for Arms nothing but Lamentations, Tears, and Prayer; but that if he could not reſiſt, however he would not fly; That he ſaw well how far the power of the Emperor might extend, but that he knew alſo how far the patience and conſtancy of a Biſhop, who little eſteemed the loſs of his Life, provided he retained for God that fidelity which he owed to him, ought to extend alſo.</p>

               <hi>left him his Cathedral, and was contented to have a Church in the Suburbs, which was called</hi> the Portian Baſilick; <hi>That ſince the Prince was pleaſed to relax on his ſide, it was convenient, for the advantage of Peace, that he relaxed alſo; That furthermore, he counſelled him as a Friend to ſatisfy the Court, and even to do it ſpeedily.</hi> The People prevented the Reply, and unanimouſly cryed, purſuant to the intentions of their Paſtor, <hi>That there was no Compoſition to be had thereupon; That the Catholicks ſhould be left the Churches which belonged to them.</hi> The Governor then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of ſucceeding, and went his way, to give his Maſter an account of the unhappy effect of his Negotiation.</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. It was then that the malice, ſhame and anger of the Empreſs was manifeſted. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the Officers of the Guards to march with their Companies, and render themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Portian</hi> Church. They went there to execute their Orders; the People run in Arms to oppoſe them. It was the morning of Palm-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> after having preached, was going to begin Maſs, when he received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. He did not ceaſe to celebrate the Sacred Myſteries; and having learnt in the time of the Offering, that an <hi>Arian</hi> Prieſt was fallen
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54793:117"/>
 into the hands of the Citizens, and run the hazard of being torn in pieces, he ſent his Prieſts and his Deacons to ſave his life. Then diſſolving into tears, he beg'd of God to grant his People peace, and offered him his own life ſeveral times, for the ſafety of thoſe who perſecuted them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time all the City was in a terrible <note place="margin">Ambr. ib.</note>confuſion. There was nothing to be ſeen but Soldiers and Citizens armed, the one for the Prince, the other for Religion. The Magiſtrates to appeaſe this tumult, filled the Priſons with a great number of Tradeſmen, and condemned to heavy puniſhments thoſe who ſeemed to be moſt warm. But theſe corrections, inſtead of putting a ſtop to this diſordered populace, did nothing but incenſe it. There went ſome Counts, ſome Captains of the Guards, and <hi>Gothick</hi> Officers to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in order to adviſe him not to retain the People, and to put an end to this diſturbance, ſince the Emperor demanded of him nothing more, than a Church of the Suburbs, and that it was fit he ſhould be Maſter in his own Empire. The Holy Archbiſhop anſwered to them, <hi>That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had no right upon the houſe of God; That he was ready to give up to him the ſmall poſſeſſions he had left; That as for the Church, it was a crime for a Biſhop to reſign it, and a ſacriledge for a Prieſt to ſeize upon it;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ambr. ib.</note>
               <hi>That for the reſt, he was ſo far from exciting the People, that he restrained them, and exhorted them to defend themſelves but with tears and prayer; but that if they had been once in a fury, it appertained to God alone to pacify them.</hi> Theſe Officers had nothing to reply to him, and retired much improved by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. The Archbiſhop went to viſit a Church called the <hi>Ancient Baſilick;</hi> and after having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted the Inhabitants of that Quarter, he retired
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54793:117"/>
to his own houſe, and would never permit himſelf  to be attended or guarded.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Empreſs reſolved to go the next day with the Emperor to take poſſeſſion her ſelf of the <hi>Ancient Baſilick.</hi> She ſent ſome Soldiers there to ſeize upon it, and to ſet up the Imperial Canopy therein. They came in haſte to inform the holy Prelate that this Church was loſt, and that they heard the miſerable crys of thoſe who were within, who implored his aſſiſtance, and that it would be convenient for him to go in perſon to oppoſe this Uſurpation. But he replied, <hi>That God would look after it; That as for him, he would not oppoſe force to force, nor turn the Temple of the Lord into a Field of Battle. He reſolved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to make uſe of ſpiritual Arms, and that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which his Ministry allowed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In effect, being entred into his Cathedral, where an infinite number of People attended him, he ſolemnly excommunicated all the Soldiers that had the Inſolence to ſeize upon the Churches. They, who had inveſted the Cathedral, having received notice of it, went in by couples, proteſting that they entred not as Enemies, but as Brothers; and that they came to pray, and not to fight. St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> received them, and began his Sermon upon the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> which had been juſt read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they, who had poſſeſſed themſelves of the ancient Baſilick, were ſcarce got in, but ſtruck with an inward remorſe, they deputed ſome of their Officers to the Emperor, to tell him, <hi>That they had executed his Orders; That they attended him at the Church, in order to ſerve him there according to their Charge, if he communicated with the Catholicks; but that if he was of the</hi> Arian <hi>Party,</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54793:118"/>
               <hi>their Conſciences obliged them to go and find the Biſhop Ambroſe.</hi> This unexpected Blow alarmed the Palace; it was neceſſary to take down the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and to renounce the Enterprize.</p>
            <p n="59">
               <hi>LIX. The Emperor was ſtill much more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, when the chief Officers of the Empire, and the principal Lords of the Court came in a Body moſt humbly to entreat him, in the Name of the whole Army, to go to Church in thoſe days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, to the end that the People being a witneſs of his Piety, and the purity of his Faith, might be ſecured from all their fears. This deputation vexed him ſo much, that he anſwered to them angrily,</hi> I ſee well that I am here but the ſhadow of an Emperor, and that ye are. Men, who would deliver me up to your Biſhop every time he ſhall give Orders for it. <hi>In the anger he was in, he ſent upon the ſpot one of his Secretaries to St.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>to ask him,</hi> If he was reſolved to reſiſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately the Orders of his Maſter? And if he pretended to uſurp the Empire as a Tyrant, to the end that he might prepare War againſt him? <hi>The Saint anſwered to it wiſely,</hi> That he had ſuſtained the Rights of the Church, without deviating from the Reſpect which was owing to the Emperor; That he reverenced his Power, but that he envied it not; That he had nothing further to do, than to ask <hi>Maximus,</hi> If <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was the Tyrant of the Emperor <hi>Valentinian?</hi> That Biſhops were never known to be Tyrants, but it had often hapned that they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Perſecutions of Tyrants. Calligonus <hi>the Eunuch, Great Chamberlain, had a mind to make a Droll of it; and, to pleaſe his Maſter, he ſent to tell the Archbiſhop,</hi> That he ſhould ceaſe to be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient and rebellious, if not, he would come himſelf to behead him in his own houſe. <hi>The Archbiſhop made</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:54793:118"/>
               <hi>anſwer to him,</hi> That he would receive the Blow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out  being amazed; That they ſhould have both where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to be content, the one to ſuffer what Biſhops have <note place="margin">Ambr. ep. <hi>33.</hi> ad Marcell.</note>been uſed to ſuffer for the ſake of God, the other to do what Eunuchs ordinarily do for the pleaſure of Men.</p>
            <p n="60">LX. At length the Perſecution ceaſed, when it appeared moſt warm. <hi>Valentinian</hi> began to be ſenſible, <hi>That his Authority was abuſed. The City in diſorder, the Court diſpleaſed, the Army reſolved to live in the Communion of the Archbiſhop, the viſible Protection of Heaven upon the Catholicks, the dangerous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which might proceed from the Paſſion of</hi> Juſtine, <hi>if he perſiſted in following her.</hi> All theſe Reaſons obliged him to reſtore things to their firſt poſture, and to recall the Soldiers who had inveſted the Churches. At this happy news of Peace, the whole City was tranſported with joy. The People left their Arms. Every one ran to Church, not to guard it again, but to render thanks therein. Some went to kiſs the Altars they had defended, others ſung Pſalms and ſpiritual Songs. They congratulated one another for their conſtancy, and caſting themſelves at the feet of their Archbiſhop, made for him a ſort of Religious Triumph by their Acclamations, and their Prayers for his Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. The Archbiſhop being affected with a Joy altogether ſpiritual and modeſt, referred to God all thoſe Praiſes which were given to him; and by his lively, moving Exhortations, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his People to lead a life conformable to the Faith which they had ſo couragiouſly defended.</p>
            <p>The Empreſs alone remained obdurate, and employed the blackeſt and moſt execrable methods to deſtroy the Saint, demonſtrating thereby how far extend the Paſſions of a powerful, incenſed

 entruſted him with the deſign he had to declare War againſt <hi>Maximus,</hi> and deſigned him for the command of the Army.</p>
            <p n="66">LXVI. Of all theſe <hi>Grotungues,</hi> who took part in his Troops, he picked out the moſt couragious, and beſt made; and to ſecure them more firmly to his ſervice, he made a Promiſe to them of double Pay, preſented each of them with a golden Collar, and aſſigned them quarters in <hi>Scythia</hi> the leſs, about the City of <hi>Tomes.</hi> As they had been accuſtomed to live without much Diſcipline, they over run the Country licentiouſly, and were even incommodious to the City. <hi>Gerontius,</hi> who was the Governor, prohibited them entrance therein, and threatned them to come out with all his Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and put them all to the Sword; but they deſpiſed his Threats. Then this daring and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Man aſſembled his Officers and moſt ancient Soldiers, and expoſed to them the deſign he had to ſet upon theſe ſtrangers; but they refuſed all to follow him, ſome by Prudence, others by Cowardice.</p>
            <p n="67">LXVII. When he ſaw himſelf to be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, he took his Armies, gets on Horſeback, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſome of his own Men, and went to defy this multitude. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> laughed at his temerity, and were contented to detach ſome of theirs againſt him. <hi>Gerontius</hi> run upon the firſt that advanced with Sword in hand.

ſhoulder, and threw him from his Horſe ſtark  dead. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> admired at the force of this Man, and were in a conſternation at the Blow he had made. <hi>Gerontius,</hi> after he had got rid of one, attacked the reſt, and thoſe of his Retinue fought with the ſame vigor as himſelf: But what Exploits ſoever they performed, they could not long reſiſt a great number; and their Preſumption had been puniſhed, if ſome Officers of the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who were upon the walls of the City, and ſaw their Commander in danger, had not ſpeedily repaired to his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="68">LXVIII. Theſe having ſtir'd up the reſt by their Example, they no more regarded in the Enterprize of the Governor the violence and paſſion of a private Man, but the glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name, and the common intereſt of their Nation.

            <p>Upon this Accuſation <hi>Theodoſius</hi> having order'd his confinement, commanded a ſevere exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Affair; and altho' in the end <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontius</hi> juſtified himſelf, and he was glad not to loſe a Man of courage, capable of the firſt employment of War, yet he did not ceaſe to retain him in Priſon, and to threaten him with death, as well to teach other Governors moderation, as to ſatisfy a barbarous Nation, who had complained, of the violence of this Man.</p>

He retired immediately towards the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, where he embarked with the Empreſs his Mother, and ſailed towards <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> in order to go and implore the aſſiſtance of <hi>Theodoſius.

LXXV. Then <hi>Maximus</hi> ſeeing that all things  ſubmitted to his Fortune, ſtopt, and commanded the Officers of his Army to make the Troops live in order, to the end that he might win the affection of thoſe People, whoſe weakneſs he had a ſenſe of. The firſt thing he did, was to ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to prevent <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and to remonſtrate to him, <hi>That he was not entred into</hi> Italy <hi>with a deſign to uſurp the Empire, but to confirm the Catholick Religion therein, which was going fairly to be ruined.</hi> He wrote the ſame thing to Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> and ſent him word, <hi>That his deſire was abſolutely to preſerve the purity of Faith, without ſuffering any ſingle Hereſy.</hi> To gain the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he reſtored the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which <hi>Gratian</hi> had aboliſhed, and gave them <note place="margin">Ambr. ep. <hi>29.</hi>

            <p n="76">LXXVI.

               <hi>told this young Prince,</hi> That to remedy his misfortune, it was neceſſary for him to take away the Cauſe; That the War he had declared to Jeſus Chriſt, had occaſioned that of <hi>Maximus;</hi> That if he had not God on his ſide, all the Forces of the Empire would be of no other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than to render his loſs the more obſerveable; That he ought to confide more in the juſtice of his Cauſe, than in the number and valor of his Soldiers; That Victory had always followed the great <hi>Valentinian</hi> his Father, becauſe he had confeſſed the Faith, and God protected him; That his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle <hi>Valens</hi> on the other ſide, after he had ſupported an Error, perſecuted the Biſhops, and maſſacred the Saints, had been defeated, and burnt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through his Impiety, than his Enemies Foroe or Art; That he ſhould make his peace with God, and reſume the Faith he had deſerted, if he had a mind that the Succors, which were prepared for him, ſhould have all the ſucceſs which might be expected from them.</p>
            <p n="77">LXXVII. This Remonſtrance affected the mind of this young Emperor, whom his Misfortunes had already made to return to himſelf, and fixed him inviolably to the belief of the Catholick Church. <hi>Juſtine,</hi> to whom this Admonition was addreſſed more than to her Son, diſſembled her diſpleaſure, and making an appearance of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her Hereſy, encouraged <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to War by her Tears and Prayers.

As he had reſolved to take the Field at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning  of the Spring with a powerful Army, he was obliged to impoſe a new Tribute to ſupply the charges of the War, whether it was that the People found it exceſſive, or that the Officers, who had a Commiſſion to levy it, exacted it with too much Rigor; ſeveral Cities murmured at it, but the Inhabitants of <hi>Antioch</hi> paſſed from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring to Sedition.

            <p>As ſoon as the Emperor underſtood this News, his diſpleaſure was ſo much the greater, as it was <note place="margin">Aurel. vict. in Theod.</note>juſt.

Altho' it was convenient to chaſtiſe the inſolence of this People, yet there was exceſs in the anger of the Prince, who involved in the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the innocent and the guilty.

            <p>The Commiſſioners found things in this poſture at their arrival. They forbid immediately all the Citizens the Theater, and <hi>Circus,</hi> and prohibited them the publick Baths. They deprived the City

            <p>After they had remained whole days at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Palace, to ſollicit the Judges, they lay down all night at the Priſon gates, ready to give up their Lives and Liberties for the ſafety of their Brethren. Sometimes they embraced the knees of the Magiſtrates, ſometimes they ſpoke to them with authority from God.</p>
            <p>One amongſt them, by name <hi>Macedonius,</hi> a plain man, and without any experience of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54793:127"/>
 world, but of eminent piety, meeting two of the Judges in the midſt of the City, commanded them to alight from Horſeback. Theſe Officers, who ſaw nothing in his Habit, or Perſon, that might afford him any authority, grew angry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt him: but when they had learnt what was the Sanctity of this Solitary man, they quitted their Horſes, embraced him, and asked him pardon. Then this old man, filled with a divine Wiſdom, raiſing his voice, ſaid to them, <hi>Go, my Friends, and make this remonstrance to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror from me. You are an Emperor, but ſtill you are a man. You command Men, that are the Images of God. Fear the Anger of the Creator, if you destroy the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You are ſo offended at the overthrowing of your Images, ſhall God be leſs when you have thrown down his?

            <p>The other Solitaries were not leſs couragious. They went to find the Magiſtrates, and begg'd of them to pronounce a favorable judgment, and to abſolve the Criminals. As they could receive no

Don't imbrue your Sword in blood. As great as the inſolence of this City has been, it doth not exceed the mercy of the Emperor.</hi> In a word, they entred the Palace, juſt as they were going to pronounce the ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation againſt thoſe who had been convicted of the Crime. They conjured the Judges to grant them ſome few days of delay, and to expect new orders from the Court. They offered themſelves to go and find the Prince, and to appeaſe him by their Tears and Prayers, and were ſo prevalent as to obtain what they demanded.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners the Emperor had ſent, being touched with the generous ſentiments of theſe Solitaries, prayed them to give their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances in writing, and promiſed to carry them themſelves to their Maſter; which they performed a few days after. The affair being in this poſture, theſe admirable men immediately returned to their Caves and Cells, and the ſame Charity which induced them to leave them, ſhut them up cloſe again.</p>

 Shame, and Trouble. He remained there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking, and kept his eyes fixed upon the ground as full of Sorrow and Confuſion, as if he had been culpable, and begg'd a pardon for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Some alſo add, that he made the Children of the Emperors Muſic ſing the doleful Pſalms, which <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>7.</hi> Hiſt. Eccleſ. c. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note>the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> made uſe of in her public Prayers to expreſs her affliction; and that theſe ſad and languiſhing Airs ſoftned the Soul of the Prince, and moved him ſo effectually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, that he ſteeped the Cup he had in his hands with his own tears. But beſides the little probability of this circumſtance, St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> who has written all the particulars of this Hiſtory, would not have failed to have been informed of it, and to have inſerted it in his Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be it as it will, this Archbiſhop inſenſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the mind of</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>and endeavored to affect him by his Sighs and Tears before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to perſwade him by his reaſons. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror drew near to him, and ſaid to him with a great deal of moderation,</hi> That he had great reaſons <note place="margin">Chryſ. hom. <hi>20.</hi> ad pop.

LXXXIII. He began his diſcourſe by a ſincere  acknowledgment of the crime, which thoſe of <hi>Antioch</hi> had committed, confeſſing that there was no puniſhment ſufficient to atone it. After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aggravated their ingratitude, by comparing it with the extream goodneſs of the Emperor, he repreſented to him that the greater the injury was, the more glorious would be the favor, which he ſhould afford thoſe Criminals. He propoſed to him the example of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who being preſſed by his Courtiers to revenge himſelf upon ſome factious men, who had disfigured one of his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues by force of Stones, did nothing but paſs his hand over his face, and anſwered to them ſmiling, that he did not feel himſelf hurt. He ſet before his eyes his own Clemency, and made him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one of his Laws, by which, after he had given orders for the opening of Priſons, and pardoning Offenders in the time of the Solemnity of <hi>Easter,</hi> he adds this remarkable expreſſion: <hi>Would to God I could even revive the dead too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He made appear to him, that in this occaſion there was not only concerned the Preſervation of</hi> Antioch, <hi>but even the Honor of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> The <hi>Jews, ſaid he,</hi> the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> themſelves, amongſt whom the noiſe of this accident is diſperſed, have all their eyes upon you, and expect the ſentence you are going to pronounce. If you pardon the culpable, they will glorify the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s God, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you, and will ſay one to another, That this Religion is a powerful one; which gives a Bridle to the wrath of Emperors, and retains Soveraigns in a Moderation of mind, which we our ſelves do not enjoy; and the God of the Chriſtians is great, ſince he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:54793:129"/>
 After this reflection, to take from the mind of the Prince the politic conſiderations of an ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if he left ſo great a crime unpuniſhed, he repreſented to him, that he did not pardon thro' ſoftneſs of temper, or incapacity to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but through Goodneſs and Religion; and that the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> was more chaſtiſed by its terrors and remorſe, than if it had been deſtroyed by ſword or fire. In a word, he proteſted to him that he would return no more to <hi>Antioch,</hi> till it had regained the favor of the Emperor, and concluded his diſcourſe in mixing Reſpect and Entreaties with the Threatnings of the Judgment of God.</p>
            <p n="84">LXXXIV. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was unable to reſiſt the force of this diſcourſe. He had much ado to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his tears, and diſſembling his emotion as much as poſſibly he could, he ſaid theſe few words to the Patriarch: <q>If Jeſus Chriſt notwithſtanding his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head has been willing to pardon thoſe men that crucified him, ought I to make a ſcruple of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning my Subjects, that have offended me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The affair of <hi>Antioch</hi> being thus happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the return of its Archbiſhop was a kind of a triumph. The public place was ſtrowed with flowers; illuminations were ſeen every where; they covered all the way he was to paſs with odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous Herbs; and every one touched with the Emperor's mercy, made wiſhes and prayers for him, and for proſperity to his Arms.</p>
            <p n="86">LXXXVI. About this time <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> at the ſollicitation of one of his Kinſmen, was urgent with the Widow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For all he had purſued all kind of methods to make himſelf beloved, he could not ſucceed in his undertaking. He had recourſe to the Emperor, and begg'd the aſſiſtance of his credit with <hi>Olympias. Theodoſius</hi> being very ſenſible to all that related to his Family, and moreover being perſwaded that his Protection and the Honor of his Alliance, would affect this young Widow, propoſed this Marriage to her; but he could not prevail. She anſwered with a great deal of modeſty and generoſity all together: <hi>That ſhe</hi>

               <hi>would always receive with a very profound reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Emperor would do her the honor to propoſe to her; but ſhe begg'd of him to permit her to live without engagement: That if Heaven had been pleaſed with her marriage ſtate, it would not have deprived her of her Husband; and that ſince God had broken her Bonds, ſhe was reſolved to give herſelf to no one but him, and to live only in order to pleaſe him, and to ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="87">LXXXVII. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did not think it a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing to reduce her by Authority to accept of the party, which he propoſed to her. But as it is

the misfortune of Sovereigns to be ſubject not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly  to their own Paſſions, but alſo to thoſe of other men, he ſuffered himſelf to be prepoſſeſſed againſt her.

She was not permitted even the liberty of having any communication with the Biſhops, nor to enter in the Church, to the end that feeling all the inconveniencies of Poverty and Slavery, and enjoying no ſort of comfort, ſhe might be obliged to conſent to the Marriage, which ſhe had refuſed. But ſhe could not be moved by a uſage ſo unjuſt and violent. She ſuffered it not only with patience, but even with joy; and after having rendred thanks to God for it, ſhe wrote to the Emperor in theſe terms. <hi>You have acted, Sir, in relation to your moſt humble Servant, not only as an Emperor, but alſo as a Biſhop; ſince you have freed me from the care of my temporal concerns, and the fear of</hi>

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the preſence of the Emperor, who encouraged his Troops, the Valor and Prudence of the Officers, the Chearfulneſs and Courage of the Soldiers, who thought the Enemy durſt not hold the Field, made them believe that nothing was impoſſible to them.</p>
            <p>The Emperor made good uſe of the heat and confidence which he obſerved in his Troops, and marching at their head with an extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he appeared hard by <hi>Siſcia,</hi> and was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as ready to paſs the River, as the Enemies to defend it. He caſt a terror into their whole Camp, and at the ſame time made the paſſage of the River to be attempted in ſeveral places. <hi>Maximus,</hi> who by a ſtrange blindneſs had believ'd <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to have been ſtill at a good diſtance, was preſently ſurprized. He endeavoured to encourage his Legions, made them advance according to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſuppoſed that if they could ſuſtain theſe firſt efforts, it would be eaſy for him afterwards to keep them in good heart. In the mean time <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who was advanced upon the Bank to obſerve the poſture of the Enemies, knowing by their motions, and their confuſion, that they were diſordered, would moſt willingly have gone to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54793:134"/>

Then ſeeing the fatal moment that might termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate this War, and fearing to let ſlip an occaſion of conquering, which perhaps Fortune would not offer any more, he made Fords to be ſearcht for, and prepared Bridges with an incredible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p n="95">XCV. As he was in this inquietude, <hi>Arbogaſtes</hi> brought to him ſome Officers of his Nation, who offered to paſs the River.

Every one prepared himſelf in the night; and at break of day the Emperor gave orders to aſſault the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who appeared already to be agreed upon a defence. The Fight began with much vehemence on both ſides. On the one, the deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, the glory of having already overcome, and the pleaſure of ſerving a Prince, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſervices which were rendred to him; on the other, the hope of plundering all <hi>Italy,</hi> and the fear of being puniſhed, ſtir'd up the Combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.

He had a mind to make ſome reſiſtance: but his Soldiers ſeeing his loſs inevitable, opened the gates to the beſiegers, and altogether ſiezing on his Perſon, pulled him from his Throne, where he was diſtributing money to ſome <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, who had attended him; and after having

deprived him of all the Ornaments of his Dignity  put him into the hands of the Conqueror.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did not abuſe his Victory. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more concerned at the misfortune of this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than incenſed at his Crimes. He reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his perfidiouſneſs in a behaviour, that argued more of compaſſion than of anger; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the juſtice of God's deciſions, and the inconſtancy of humane greatneſs, he was going to crown his victory by an act of Chriſtian Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, in pardoning his Priſoner. But as he turned his head to conceal that emotion of Pity which appeared upon his face, the Soldiers ſnatcht him from his mercy, and having drawn him out of his Tent, made him to be bèheaded in ſight of the whole Army. <hi>Andragatius</hi> being adviſed a little while after of this news, and deſpairing of <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s pardon for the murderer of <hi>Gratian,</hi> choſe rather to throw himſelf headlong into the Sea, than to fall into his hands.</p>

            <p>After ſome reſidence which the Emperor made at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> to refreſh himſelf after the fatigues of war, and to give neceſſary orders for the ſecurity and peace of the Empire, he paſſed to <hi>Milan,</hi> where he publiſhed an Edict, by which he annulled <note place="margin">Leg. <hi>7.</hi> d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> infirmand. his quae ſub Tyran.</note>all the Ordinances of <hi>Maximus,</hi> requiring that the memory thereof might be entirely aboliſhed.

            <p n="105">CV. This Altar ſince the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, had been an original of Conteſts. It

            <p>THE Empire, ſince the defeat of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> had enjoyed a profound Peace, and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> re-eſtabliſhed at leiſure the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Weſt, before he repaſſed to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> when he received the news of the Sedition hapned at <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> The occaſion of it had been inconſiderable; but the conſequences were ſo great, that they make one of the principal parts of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Botheric</hi> Governor of <hi>Illyrium,</hi> and Lieutenant General of the Emperor's Armies, had received Orders to continue in his Government with the <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>7.</hi> 5. <hi>15.</hi>

They celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, during ſeveral days, publick Sports with an extraordinary magnificence.</p>
            <p>A Coachman of <hi>Botheric</hi> got herein a mighty reputation, and appeared ſo dexterous and expert <note place="margin">Sozom.</note>in managing Horſes, and conducting Chariots in the <hi>Circus,</hi> that the People could not ſufficiently obſerve and commend him.

They who had undertaken to obtain it, being unable to affect the humor of the Governor by their humble Petitions, the People run in crowds to the Palace, and made new Solicitations: But <hi>Botheric</hi> would not relax in an Affair, wherein was concerned not only the Diſcipline of his Family, but alſo the Authority of his Charge; for which they ſeemed not to have a ſufficient reſpect. Then the moſt ſeditious
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54793:146"/>
 of them began to murmur; and taking this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal for an injuſtice done to them, they demanded the liberty of the Priſoner, not only as a Favor, but as a Neceſſity. All the City was inſenſibly in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some made to the Priſon-gates, in order to force them open; others drove away by force of ſtones the Magiſtrates, who endeavoured to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them; and as there is nothing whereof the Rabble is not capable, when they are once hot, they broke open the gates of the Palace, diſperſed the Guards who were there, and killed <hi>Botheric</hi> himſelf, who came before them to endeavor to appeaſe them.</p>
            <p n="2">II.

            <p n="3">III. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was of a hot and paſſionate tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and eaſily permitted himſelf to be tranſported to anger againſt thoſe who had offended him; but

               </gap> theſe occaſions; and whether he was aſhamed of yielding to his Paſſion, or that he deſired to repair his fault, or elſe believed that the anger of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was ſevere enough to ſupport, he oftentimes pardoned Criminals, thro' the ſingle Reaſons of having reproved them too roughly. But he had, as the moſt part of good Princes, a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thoſe whom he ſuppoſed to be his Friends, and who gave life to his Paſſions, and concealed their own under appearances of the publick good. Thus he let himſelf be ſometimes ſurprized; and altho' his intentions were to do well, he was capable of committing things that were faulty.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Reſolution then being taken of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an example of ſeverity upon this City, the Affair was propoſed in Council, where it was unanimouſly agreed, <hi>That Troops ſhould be ſent to</hi>

               </note>Theſſalonica, <hi>and all thoſe ſeditious People put to the Sword.</hi> The deliberation was held ſecret. They diſpatched Orders neceſſary for the execution, and in the Crime, which was going to be committed, they fear'd nothing but St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s coming to be informed of it. The Officers, who were charged <note place="margin">Ruffin. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>18.</hi>
               </note>with this bloody Commiſſion, acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all the Policy and Cruelty which had been recommended to them. They amuſed, by certain preparations of courſes, and publick ſports, this People, who ought rather to have expected
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54793:147"/>
Puniſhment, than Sights; and having drawn a  very great number of them to the <hi>Circus,</hi> they gave the Signal which had been agreed upon amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Then were ſeen to run from all ſides Soldiers, who betook themſelves, with Arms in their hands, to the Streets, Houſes, and eſpecially the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> where the People were aſſembled. There they <note place="margin">Sozom. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>
               </note>put all to the Sword, without any diſtinction of Age, Sex and Quality. The firſt that was met with, was the firſt ſacrificed. The innocent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the guilty, even ſtrangers, who had no ſhare in the Crime, were involved in the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and the Soldiers hot in murder, ſought no longer to chaſtiſe a Crime, but to ſatisfy their brutal Fury.</p>
            <p>It was in this occaſion that one of the richeſt Merchants of the City, obſerving his Family ready to undergo the fatal Maſſacre, caſt himſelf at the feet of theſe Murderers, in vain endeavoured to move them, by his tears and his entreaties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured them to take his poſſeſſions and his own life, for that of two Children, who were equally dear to him. Then, as if they had been touched with ſome pity, they replied to him, <hi>That the number of the dead inſerted in their Commiſſion, was not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; That they could diſpoſe but of a ſingle Pardon, and bid him chuſe, with haſte, which of the two he would have preſerved.</hi> But this miſerable Father being reduced to the ſad neceſſity of delivering one for the ſafety of the other, and not determining ſoon enough upon this choice purſuant to the humor of theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they could no longer bear with <note place="margin">Paulin. in vit.

            <p>
               <hi>He declared to him afterwards,</hi> That the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, the eſteem and reſpect he retains for him in his heart, will not hinder him from purſuing the Orders of the Church, and from refuſing to offer in his preſence the Divine Sacrifice, till he had ſatisfied God; That more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he wrote this to him with his own hand, to the end that he might reflect upon it in his own perſon; That he ſhould rather chuſe to win the Favors of his Emperor by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54793:149"/>
 an honest Complaiſance, than to diſturb him by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Admonitions; but when the Cauſe of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, he is obliged to ſacrifice his Inclination to his Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word, he exhorts him to accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Sin himſelf, and concludes by theſe words full of the renderneſs of a Father:</hi> Would to God, my Lord, that I had rather believed my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, than the experience I have had of your Goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when I imagined to my ſelf, that I have ſo often ſeen you pardon, and return from your diſpleaſure, I confided too much in your cuſtom; you have been poſſeſſed, and I have not provented what I ought to have fear'd, and what I was ſcarce able to foreſee.

            <p n="6">VI. The Emperor having received this Letter, was touched at ſo free, and ſo prudent a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance.

VII. As ſoon as he was arrived there, his  thoughts were wholly taken up about giving ſome teſtimonies of his Piety, in order to take away the evil impreſſions which he had afforded of himſelf. To that end he would go to the Cathedral to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at the publick Prayers, and to partake of the holy Myſteries. The Archbiſhop was informed of it, and leaving the Quire of the Church where he was, went beyond the Porch to attend him. As ſoon as he ſaw him appear, he advanced ſome ſteps towards him, and ſaid to him with that Authority which the character and ſanctity of his life allow'd him:</p>

               </note> It is to be believed, O Emperor, that you do not yet comprehend the enormity of your Crime, ſince you dare preſent your ſelf here. Perhaps that poſſeſſed of the greatneſs of your Dignity, you hide your Infirmities to your ſelf, and that your Pride intoxicates your Reaſon. Conſider that you are of a frail nature, that you were drawn out of a little dust, as other men, and that you will return to dust as well as they. Let not your ſelf be dazled with the ſplendor of that Purple which covers an infirm and mortal Body. Thoſe whom you command are of the ſame nature with your ſelf, and you ſerve with them the ſame God, who is the Maſter of Subjects and Sovereigns. How then do you attempt to enter into his Temple? Will you dare to extend your hands yet ſtained with the innocent Blood you have ſpilt, to take the Sacred Body of Jeſus Christ? Will you dare to receive his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Blood in that mouth, which in the exceſs of your Anger has cauſed ſo many Murders? Retire then, and don't add a new Crime to that which you have already committed: receive rather with ſubmiſſion the Sentence I pronounce upon earth, and which Jeſus Chriſt approves

               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being ſenſibly affected at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, remained ſome time with dejected eyes in ſilence: after which he replied to the Archbiſhop, <hi>That he acknowledged his Crime, but that he hoped God would have regard to his infirmity;</hi> and as he alledg'd the example of <hi>David,</hi> who had committed a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide and an Adultery both together, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop anſwered to him, <hi>You have imitated him in his Sin, imitate him alſo in his Repertance.</hi> Then this Prince, who was perfectly inſtructed in the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of Religion, and the Authority of the Church, inſtead of being offended at this reſiſtance, lookt upon it as a wholſom remedy for an evil, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of which he had not till then diſcerned.

Quality, who in all probability, through a devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion  of but little ſubſtance, had raiſed herſelf to the degree of Deaconeſs, made a confeſſion of all her paſt life to a Penitentiary, who impoſed on her, as an expiation of her faults, extraordinary Faſts and Prayers. As ſhe was obliged to be a long time at Church in order to acquit her ſelf of the ſatisfactions which had been preſcribed her, She had an opportunity of ſeeing and converſing often with a young Deacon, in whom ſhe had repoſed too much confidence. Theſe entertainments very ſerious at the beginning, degenerated on both ſides into no very decent familiarities, and this ſpiritual correſpondence became at length a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal paſſion.

They preſently diſcovered the crime, which ſome perſons had already ſuſpected; the noiſe was diſperſed throughout the City.

            <p>There were two ſorts of abuſes crept in amongſt them. Some, in their youth, through an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient deſire to diſtinguiſh themſelves by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, cut off their hair, and introduced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Church: from hence proceeded oftentimes ſcandal; always danger. Others, by an indiſcreet liberality, were ſpurr'd on to give their poſſeſſions to the Churches and Hoſpitals, and often ruined their families to ſatisfie the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riece of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to redreſs theſe abuſes, ordained that no Widow ſhould be received into the rank of Deaconeſs, who was not ſixty years old, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Precept of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> and prohibited thoſe who were received to give away, under <note place="margin">Leg. <hi>27.</hi> de Epiſc.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54793:155"/>
to the prejudice of their Children or Relations,  nor to leave them by Will to the Clergy, to the Poor, or to the Churches.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of his Ordinance was generally approved of; but it was remonſtrated to him, <hi>That it was not just to obſtruct the good intentions of dying Widows, and to ſtop one of the chief Springs of Charity; That it was to encroach upon the Liberty of the Church, and even the Priviledges of the Poor, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the Patrimonies and Alms of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and that Religion was already but too much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Charity grown too cold, without confining them ſtill by Laws injurious to both.</hi> The Emperor, who was never aſhamed to recant, when it was eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to him that he was under a miſtake, received this Remonſtrance ſo well, that two months after he publiſhed at <hi>Verona</hi> a revocation of this Law. He commanded it to be taken out of all Regiſters, to the end that no Pleader might alledge it, and no Magiſtrate make uſe thereof in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

 her Wit, for the extraordinary Adventures which hapned to her, and the Teſtimonies ſhe gave of her Faith, and of her Zeal for Religion.</p>
            <p>Her Obſequies were very magnificent. <hi>Arcadius</hi> a little while after cauſed a Pillar to be erected in the great place of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> near the Church, whereon he ordered to be fixed the Statue of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in ſilver, with Inſcriptions and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his laſt Victories, with an intention that this work might be an eternal Monument both of the glory of the Father, and the piety of the Son.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. At laſt <hi>Theodoſius</hi> reſolved upon returning into the Eaſt, and upon going to enjoy himſelf amongſt his own People the ſatisfactions of that Peace which he had eſtabliſhed through the whole Empire. He had paſſed near three years in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had employed them in ſetting thoſe Provinces in order, and inſtructing the young <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whom he loved as his own Son. Obſerving the credit that <hi>Symmachus</hi> enjoyed in the Senate, he had honoured him with the dignity of Conſul, and had forgot nothing which might oblige that factious Man, who gave motion to Affairs, and was at the head of a Party. He had made at the ſame time very ſevere Edicts againſt the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſe Gods, ſhewing by this conduct that he did no injury to the merit of thoſe perſons whoſe Religion he condemned. After that he departed, leaving the Weſtern Empire in peace, and the Emperor well inſtructed in the Art of reigning.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. He had already made part of his Army march, in order to chaſtiſe, as they paſſed, ſome <hi>Barbarians</hi> who were got together to diſturb the

It was at firſt rather a Troop of Robbers, than a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Militia: but the number of them being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the defeat of <hi>Maximus</hi>'s Army, they <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>obſerved ſome order, and made an irruption into <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Macedon.</hi> Their licentiouſneſs aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the little reſiſtance which they found, and in a little time they ravaged the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. As ſoon as they had learnt that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was returning with his Army, they retired into Foreſts that were encompaſſed with Lakes, and came out no more in a Body: they contented themſelves to make incurſions during night, and bid themſelves with their Booty as ſoon as day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. One would have ſaid, that they were rather <hi>Spectres</hi> than Men, and every one complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their robbing, without being able to force them in their Retreat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being arrived at <hi>Theſſalonica;</hi> detached a Party of his Infantry to advance towards the Marſhes, under the conduct of <hi>Tima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He happily diſcovered what he had a mind to know; for being entred into a little Country-houſe, to refreſh himſelf after a long courſe, he there perceived a Man, whoſe wild aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and confuſed behavior, gave him ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition. <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4</hi>

               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:54793:157"/>
 He ſecretly enquired who he was, and from whence he came: but being unable to learn any thing in particular of this unknown, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his People to ſeize upon him. He would examine him himſelf; but he could obtain no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, neither by threats, nor civility, till ſuch time as being preſſed by the torments they made him undergo, he confeſſed that he was the Spy of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians;</hi> that he was us'd to run over the Country all day, to give them notice of the Booty they might ſei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Emperour departed immediately to go and <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>joyn his Camp, marched the next day with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Troops, and made this body of <hi>Barbarians</hi> to be ſo vigorouſly attacked, that in ſpite of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of places, and the reſiſtance which they made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he forced them in their Marſhes. There was a great number of them killed; ſome were taken, and puniſhed for examples; the reſt were purſued from morning to night. <hi>Timaſius</hi> ſeeing the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fatigued, pray'd the Emperor to take a little reſt, and to afford ſome to thoſe who attended him. They ſounded a retreat, they encamped in an adjacent plain; every one was permitted to rejoice, as after a victory; and in the confidence they were, they were not extreamly mindful of the guard and diſcipline of the Camp.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Barbarians</hi> being rallied, and having advice by ſome of their own men, who had ſaved themſelves from the Camp, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Troops were in, came by favour of the night, and made a great ravage, before they were

diſcerned. At length, they who were leaſt ſleepy  having alarmed all ſides, every one put himſelf in a poſture of defence. They run to the Tent of the Emperour, who was riſen at the firſt noiſe he had heard. There was a fight in the very Camp, whoſe ſucceſs had been uncertain, if this Prince had not encouraged his men by his own example; and if <hi>Promotus,</hi> one of his Lieutenant Generals, who was not far off, had not happily arrived with ſome S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had reſolved to go in perſon to purſue them, in order to deliver his people from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies they received from them. But <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motus</hi> repreſented to him, That they were not Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies worthy to ſtop a great Emperour; That he ſhould reſerve himſelf for conſiderable expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leave to one of his Lieutenants the care of terminating an affair, where there was ſome fatigue to undergo, and no reputation to acquire. He took upon himſelf this commiſſion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it ſo faithfully, that he ſhut up thoſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> in their Foreſts, and made ſo great a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, that there was not a ſingle man eſcaped.</p>
            <p>The Emperour in the mean time continued his journey. All the people went to meet him with an extraordinary affection, and every entrance that he made into Cities was a Triumph. He arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the ninth day of <hi>November,</hi> more glorious by the marks of love which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his Subjects, than by the victories he had obtained over his Enemies. His Son <hi>Arcadius</hi> came to receive him, and all the Bodies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire teſtified to him with an emulation the joy which they entertained for his happy return.</p>

His firſt applications were to return thanks to God for all the proſperities of his Reign, to viſit the magnificent Church he had built in honour of St. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and to get conveyed thither from a Town near <hi>Calcedon</hi> the relicks of the ſame Saint, with abundance of Solemnity. He informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the poſture of the Church affairs; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learnt that <hi>Eunomius</hi> had held aſſemblies in the City, and publiſhed ſome of his errors, he made him to be expelled <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered likewiſe the expulſion of all Hereticks out of the neighbouring Cities, in order to take away <note place="margin">Leg. <hi>20.</hi> de Haeret.

            <p>After having thus regulated what concerned Religion, he applied himſelf to know the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the State, and to eaſe the Provinces which had been burdened; being willing to remit in Peace, thoſe tributes which the ſole neceſſity of War had obliged him to impoſe.

            <p>Some Perſons of Quality were accuſed of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining ſome deſign to deprive him of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

and all this multitude of <hi>Barbarians</hi> was going  to be entirely defeated. <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> who from an Eminence diſcovered the Rout of his Men, and ſaw his loſs inevitable, if <hi>Eugenius</hi> came to fall upon him with his <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, had recourſe to God in this extremity, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, he made this Prayer, <hi>Thou knoweſt, O my God, that I have undertaken this War in the Name of thy</hi>

               <hi>Son Jeſus Christ: If my intentions are not ſo pure as I thought they were, let me periſh: If thou approveſt the juſtice of my Cauſe, and the confidence I repoſe in thee, aſſiſt me, and don't permit the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to ſay, Where is the God of the Chriſtians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had no ſooner finiſhed theſe words, but he deſcends into the Plain with the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom he excited by his Piety and his Courage, and advances to ſnatch from the Enemies a Victory which they thought ſecure. In the mean time <hi>Bacurius</hi> gave marks of an extraordinary Fidelity and Valor; for after having rallied thoſe that fled, and put himſelf at their head with his <hi>Iberians,</hi> he ſuſtain'd all the burden of the Fight, keeping off all the Darts of the Enemy, who charged him on all <note place="margin">Ruffin. ib.</note>ſides, and putting a ſtop to their Fury, till ſuch time as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was arrived.</p>
            <p n="52">LII. Then the fight began afreſh. Both parties uſed their efforts to overcome; the one fluſhed with their former ſucceſs, the others encouraged by the preſence of the Emperour. They attacked, they oppoſed without fearing danger, without drawing back of either ſide. But what attempt ſoever <hi>Theodoſius</hi> could make, he could never gain any advantage over <hi>Arbogaſtes,</hi> who maintained himſelf by his valour, by his conduct, and by the number and courage of his Troops. At laſt the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54793:174"/>
 night put an end to the Battel, and each was obliged to retire to his Camp. The loſs was not conſiderable on the ſide of <hi>Eugenius;</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> loſt ſeveral Officers, and particularly the brave <hi>Bacurius,</hi> who, after having ſeveral times diſperſed the Enemies, and bore through their Squadrons with Sword in hand, fatigued with the labour of <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi> Ruffin. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi>

He did not ſo much as doubt, but that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had ſaved himſelf by favor of the night with the reſidue of his Troops. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> on his ſide having regained his Camp upon the Mountain, called together the chief Officers of his Army, and held a Council of war. <note place="margin">Theodor. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Timaſius</hi> and <hi>Stilicon</hi> were of opinion to yield to the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to provide immediately for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Retreat. They repreſented, That after the loſs which had been ſuſtained, it was neceſſary to think alone of re-eſtabliſhing himſelf; That it was enough to have been conquered; That it was wiſdom to take care of being entirely defeated; That it was to ſacrifice the remainders of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to expoſe it to the hazard of a ſecond Battle; and that it would be a piece of raſhneſs to pretend with a ſmall number of diſheartened Soldiers, to force an Enemy who confided in their multitude and valor; and who had lately obtained ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54793:174"/>
an advantage; That it were better to  incloſe himſelf in the ſtrong places of the Empire, in order to aſſemble new Troops during the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to take the Field in the beginning of the Spring, and renew the War with equal Forces.</p>
            <p>The Emperor rejected their Counſel, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them with ſome indignation, <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>that the Croſs of Jeſus Christ, which appears in my Colors, ſhould fly before the Statues of</hi> Hercules <hi>and</hi> Jupiter, <hi>which are born amongſt the Enſigns of the Enemy!</hi> Theſe words ſpoken with an holy confidence, inſpired his Captains with that reſolution he deſired. He gave neceſſary orders for the morrow, and retired into a Chappel near the place where he was encamped, in order to paſs the reſt of the night in Prayer.</p>
            <p n="54">LIV. It is reported that having fallen aſleep towards morning, he ſaw in a Dream two Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers <note place="margin">Ib. c. <hi>42.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This news being diſperſed through the whole Army, revived the courage of the Soldiers; and as there is no ſtronger confidence, than that which is grounded upon Religion, they demanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a battle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They imagined that they ſaw all the Heaven armed for their defence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, not a doubtful fight, but an aſſured Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> took advantage of this ardor, and made them forthwith deſcend into the Plain.</p>

There was therein three Patriarchs, <hi>Nectarius</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople, Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Flavian</hi> of <hi>Antioch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gregory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Niſſa, Amphilochus</hi> of <hi>Iconium, Paul</hi> of <hi>Heraclea, Dioſcorus</hi> of <hi>Helenopolis,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other famous Prelates were of the firſt that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there. The Principal of the Nobility and Clergy wirh an infinite number of People reſorted thither, ſome to honour this Feſtival, others to court this Favourite, many to ſatisfy their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>This ceremony was performed in the month of <hi>September.</hi> The Church was hung with admirable Tapeſtry; thè Altar ſhined with Gold and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stones. The Conſecration was done with all the Order and Magnificence imaginable. After the Offices were over, they proceeded with the ſame Pomp to the Baptiſm of <hi>Ruffin.</hi> The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Nectarius</hi> adminiſtred it to him, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Evagrius</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who had been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to come from <hi>Egypt</hi> with the Solitary <hi>Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

            <p n="67">LXVII. The Biſhops repaſſed the Sea along with him, and reaſſembled at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>September,</hi> to decide the difference between <hi>Agapius</hi> and <hi>Gabadius</hi> concerning the Pretenſions which both had to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Boſtres.</hi> It was in this Synod, that it was decreed that a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">Zonar.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Prelates who were then at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> took part in the publick Joy, and after having ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in preſence of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and all his Court, the ſacred myſteries in a Thankſgiving for the Victory, which the Emperor had obtained upon the Tyrants, they retired into their reſpective Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes, to acquaint their People with the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works of God, and the Protection which he had given the Empire.</p>

            <p>He departed from <hi>Aquileia</hi> with theſe inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and came to <hi>Milan</hi> in order to a more quiet application to his conſcience under the direction of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was gone a day before him, and to receive there more commodiouſly his Sons

               <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> whom he had ſent for  from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Scarce was he arrived there, but he found himſelf weaker, and more indiſpoſed <note place="margin">Socrat.

Yet he did not relax any thing of his uſual cares, aſſiſting at all his Councils, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf the complaints of the People, ſigning the acts of grace which he had afforded his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, labouring to re-eſtabliſh that order, which <hi>Eugenius</hi> had diſturbed throughout the Weſt, and believing himſelf obliged to act after this manner to the utmoſt extremity, and to ſacrifice ſtill the ſmall remains of life to the good and repoſe of his Empire.</p>
            <p n="71">LXXI. The young Emperors found him in this condition, when they arrived at <hi>Milan;</hi> and <note place="margin">Paulin. in vit. Ambr.</note>the joy of ſeeing their Father again was ſoon moderated, by the affliction which they had to ſee him aſſaulted by a moral Dropſy. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> would receive them in the Church, where he had cauſed himſelf to be conveyed in order to partake of the Sacrament, which a nicety of conſcience and a profound reſpect had made him defer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of till then.

               <hi>to the Affairs of the Church, the Empire, and his Family. He aſſembled in his Chamber the Deputies of the Senate, and the Lords of his Court, who were yet Pagans, and remonſtrated to them,</hi> That he retained in dying but the ſingle regret of ſeeing them ſtill Idolaters; That he wondred how ſuch wiſe and underſtanding Men ſhould not apprehend their Error, or ſhould rather chuſe to follow Cuſtom, than Truth; That the defeat of <hi>Eugenius</hi> was a convincing proof of the vanity of their Oracles, and the impotency <note place="margin">Oroſ. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>36.</hi>
               </note>of their Gods; That theſe Gods had been Men of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and irregular Lives, and that it was unreaſonable to adore them, ſince their Power was not to be feared, nor their Actions worthy of imitation; That they ſhould permit themſelves to be influenced by the force of Truth, by the example of the first Magiſtrates of the Empire, and alſo by the last affections of their dying Emperor, who for ſome time interrupted the thoughts of his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to put them in mind of theirs; That indeed his great deſire had been to extirpate, during his Reign, all falſe Religions, and to make all his Subjects faithful Servants of Jeſus Christ; That God had not eſteemed him worthy of this Favor, but that he hoped his Children would be more ſucceſsful than he, and would compleat what he had begun.</p>
            <p n="73">
               <hi>LXXIII. After having diſmiſſed the Senators, he made his laſt Will, wherein he ordered,</hi> That <note place="margin">Ambroſ. in fun.

by their Prayers, or their Labours; and recommending to  his Succeſſors the eaſing of the Provinces, without enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Treaſury with the ſubſtance of the Poor, and <note place="margin">Claudian. in Conſ.

            </p>
            <p>He joined to this Act of Goodneſs, an Act of Generoſity and Mercy. He had granted a general Pardon to all the Rebels who were returned to their Obedience. He meant that they ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed in their Eſtates and Dignities, and ſhould reſume in the Court the ſame Rank which they held therein before their Rebellion. But as he had not time to execute all his intentions, he was afraid leſt after his death the new Emperors, by the evil counſel of their Friends, ſhould ſtop the courſe of thoſe Reconciliations which remain'd to come. He confirmed then by a Law, which he cauſed to be inſerted in his Will, the Amneſty which he had already publiſhed, eſtabliſhing his <note place="margin">Ambr. in fun. Theod.</note>hopes in the mercy of God, upon that he himſelf ſhewed his Enemies. He enjoined his Children religiouſly to obſerve this Order, and left them Examples and Commands deſerving of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperor.</p>
            <p n="74">
               <hi>LXXIV. He divided the Empire between thoſe two Princes, giving the Eaſt to</hi> Arcadius, <hi>and to</hi> Honorius <hi>the Weſt. He recommended to them, above all things,</hi> a Piety towards God, and a zeal for Religion. <hi>He made them recollect what he had often ſaid to them,</hi> That they ſhould diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their Subjects, more by Wiſdom and Virtue, <note place="margin">Ambroſ. in fun.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:54793:183"/>
 That one did not deſerve to command Men, if one had not learnt to obey God; That they ought to found the felicity of their Reigns, not upon the prudence of their Councels, nor upon the force of their Arms, but upon their fidelity to God, and the care which they ſhould take of his Church; That this was the original of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of Peace, and of all the Proſperity of Sovereigns. <hi>Then turning himſelf towards St.</hi> Ambroſe <hi>who was preſent,</hi> Theſe, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> are the Truths which you have learnt me, and which I my ſelf have experienced; 'tis your part to make them paſs in my Family, and to inſtruct, according to your cuſtom, theſe young Emperors whom I leave to you. <hi>The holy Archbiſhop made anſwer to him,</hi> That he would be mindful of their Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hoped that God would give to the Children that tractable heart and eaſie temper, which he had given to the Father.</p>
            <p n="75">LXXV. After that, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> declared <hi>Stilicon</hi> Tutor of his Son <hi>Honorius,</hi> and Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Armies of the two Empires, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him likewiſe his two Children. He thought himſelf obliged to teſtify this confidence to a Man, who had very faithfully ſerved him in the moſt important Affairs of his Reign, and who had the honour to marry the Princeſs <hi>Serena</hi> his Neece. <hi>Stilicon</hi> was a great Soldier, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Stateſman; wiſe in the counſel, bold in the execution, expert in managing the minds of People; fit to diſcover happy moments, and to <note place="margin">Claudian.</note>make uſe of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether in Treaties or Battels; dexterous in finding out the Intereſts of the Grandees of the Empire, and piercing into the deſigns of Foreign Nations; beloved of the Troops, capable of ſupporting the burden of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of forming a young Emperor in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

of Peace and War, and diverting troubles by his Wiſdom, or putting a ſtop to them by his Courage and his Valor.</p>
            <p>Theſe great Qualities rendred him worthy of the choice which <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had made of him, till being engaged by the jealouſies of <hi>Ruffin,</hi> and his own ambition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="76">LXXVI. Since the Emperor's arrival at <hi>Milan,</hi> this City had diſpoſed itſelf to prepare a ſtately Triumph for him, and to celebrate by all kind of Rejoycings a Victory, which had made him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of the two Empires. His indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had retarded the publick Sports, which made the chief part of this Feſtival. But at length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſetled his Affairs, he found himſelf much eaſed; and whether he was unwilling that the City ſhould make in vain ſo conſiderable an Expence, or whether he had a deſign to comfor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the People, by ſhewing himſelf once more in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he gave notice to the Magiſtrates, that he would be at the <hi>Circus</hi> on the morrow to receive the honour which they intended for him.

            <p>At laſt the holy Archbiſhop directs himſelf to the young Emperor, who was attentive to him, and who melted into tears.

He was like him, of a tall Stature, had a handſom Head, his Aſpect great and noble, the turn and features of his Face were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and all his Body well proportioned.</p>
            <p>As for the qualities of the Soul, he poſſeſſed all the perfections of that Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had none of his defects. He was, like him, gracious, juſt, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, merciful, and always ready to aſſiſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. He communicated himſelf to his Courtiers, and was only diſtinguiſhed from them by the Purple wherewith he was inveſted. His Civility for the Grandees of his Court, and his Eſteem for Perſons of Merit and Virtue, obtained him the friendſhip of both. He loved free and ſincere Minds, and admired all thoſe who excelled in Letters, or in the noble Arts, provided he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in them neither Affectation nor Malice. All who deſerved to partake of his Bounties, felt the effects thereof. He made great Preſents, and made them with greatneſs. He took pleaſure in divulging to the leaſt Offices which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from private Men in his firſt Fortune, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing to teſtify his Acknowledgment to them. Ambition did not make him attempt to conquer the Provinces of his Neighbors, but he knew how to puniſh them who uſurped his own, or thoſe of his Collegues. Thus did he procure himſelf no Enemies during his Reign, but he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed thoſe who became ſo. He was well enough verſed in Learning, and made uſe thereof
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54793:186"/>
 out affectation. The reading of Hiſtorys was not uſeleſs to him, and he applied himſelf to form his manners upon the Vertues of great Princes, who had preceded him. He deteſted often in publick the pride, the cruelty, the ambition and tyranny of <hi>Cinna, Marius, Sylla,</hi> and their followers, in order to impoſe upon himſelf a happy neceſſity of purſuing a conduct oppoſed to that, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; above all he was a declared Enemy of Traytors, and ungrateful men.</p>
            <p>One may tax him with being carried fometimes to Paſſion, but it muſt be a great occaſion, beſides that he was ſoon appeaſed. His acceſs was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and eaſy; and what is extraordinary amongſt Great Men, his Proſperities and his Victories, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of puffing him up, or corrupting him, did but render him the more gentle, and obliging. He took care to furniſh thoſe Provinces, which the war had ruined, with Proviſions in abundance, and he reſtored out of his own mony conſiderable Sums, which the Tyrants had extorted from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men. In War, he always marched at the head of his Armies, expoſing himſelf to danger, and ſharing all fatigues with the meaneſt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>He was chaſt, and by ſevere Laws he aboliſhed thoſe cuſtoms that were contrary to decency and modeſty. Altho he was of a conſtitution nice enough, yet he maintained his health by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exerciſe, and diet. It was nevertheleſs one of his ſatisfactions to entertain his Friends at Table, and to improve Friendſhip by all kind of decent rejoycings. In theſe particular Feaſts, where he conſulted rather neatneſs and politeneſs, than luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and profuſion, he enjoyed the pleaſures of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and revealed himſelf with a reaſonable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54793:186"/>
which afforded confidence, without  leſſening the reſpect which was owing to him. His principal diverſions were converſation and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he had a mind to recreate himſelf after the cares of buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Never did Prince live ſo well in his Family. He honoured his Uncle as his Father. After the death of his Brother, he was as careful of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as of his own. He advanced to Employ, ments thoſe, who ſtuck to his Service, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a Father to all his Relations. Thus after he had regulated in the day the affairs of the Empire, and given Laws to the whole World, he ſhut himſelf up with joy in his Family, where by his cares, his affections, and his goodneſs, he made appear to his own People that he was as good a Friend, as good a Relation, as good a Maſter, as good a Husband, and as good a Father, as he was a Wiſe and Powerful Emperor.</p>
            <p>This is the Character, which is left us of the Great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> by <hi>Pagan</hi> Authors who were his Contemporaries, altho prejudiced againſt him for the intereſts of their Religion. The Philoſopher <note place="margin">Themiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Orat. <hi>5.</hi> Symm. l. <hi>2.</hi> Ep. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> and <hi>Symmachus</hi> himſelf, that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of Paganiſm, acknowledge ſincerely, that the Vertues of this Prince exceed all the Praiſes which have been conferred upon him. There is none but the Hiſtorian <hi>Zozimus,</hi> who by premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated falſhoods ſeeks to diſcredit thoſe Chriſtian Emperors, who have deſtroyed the worſhip of Idols. He diſguiſes the truth according to his Caprice and his Paſſion, and endeavours to make vices of all the Vertues of this Emperor. He calls his liberalities profuſions, his moderation lazineſs, his friendly barquets diſſolutions, and that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſweet life he led in peace, a ſoft and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54793:187"/>
 one. He is notwithſtanding obliged by force of truth to confeſs, that in time of war there <note place="margin">Zoz. l. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note>was an extraordinary change of manners in him; that he forgot on a ſudden his amuſements and his pleaſures, to take the cares and vertues that were neceſſary to the ſafety of the Empire; and that of an infirm and ſenſual Emperor, there was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a valiant and laborious Prince, by a kind of prodigy.</p>
            <p>Not but that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had his failings. His tranſports of anger, his eaſineſs to believe thoſe in whom he repoſed ſome confidence, and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in favour of thoſe whom he had choſen for his principal friends, are ſtains that would a little obſcure the life of this Emperor, if they were not confounded in an infinite number of glittering actions, or effaced by a ſevere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The Holy Fathers who knew him beſt, could not be tired with commending his Piety. St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> have left Encomiums of him in ſeveral places of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
