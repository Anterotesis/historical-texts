            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER from Scotland: Written Occasionally upon the SPEECH made by a Noble Peer of this Realm.</head>
            <byline>By a better <hi>Protestant</hi> than the Author of it, (though a Servant to His <hi>R. H.</hi>)</byline>
            <p>I Have heard much of the sad state and condition we are in, and I am convinced of it, since I see such Reflections made with impunity upon the Kings Person and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I shall say little to the President of our <hi>Henry</hi> the IV, unbridled Violence, and mean Condescensions, are the unhappy necessities of an Usurper; but a good and a lawful King is obliged to maintain His Own Prerogative, as well as the Rights of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But is it possible, that the supposed Author of the Printed Speech, should already forget, how lately the King (after a great Retrenchment of His Family) did at once, and (as it is said) by his Lordships advice, change almost His whole Council? and yet the People (or those that still make use of their Names) never were, nor will yet be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I will not put his Lordship in mind of the Court Ladies, since he doth not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he spoke of them: But unless he make himself a <hi>Samuel,</hi> I do not know what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he has to examine <hi>Saul,</hi> about the bleating of the Cattel? I cannot believe his Lordship could have the heart, to sacrifice the fairest of them; his Lordship may read in the same place, that <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice</hi>; but if a Sacrifice must be made, <hi>It is not to the People, but to God and Iustice.</hi> I would fain understand what is meant by the People? For now every man calls himself the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when one man calls for one Thing, and another for Something, directly opposite, both cry out, that if This, or That be not done, the People is betray'd; that is to say, they will endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them so. But the People in this Speech, hath a strange Dialect, such as I hope no <hi>Englishman</hi> understands; <hi>Must,</hi> was never the language of a good Subject, nor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission the part of a King; (<hi>We must, &amp;c.</hi> and no new Converts,) I am sorry, that with all our Zeal, we are so unkind to <hi>Proselytes,</hi> we had a greater value for them not long since; for though <hi>L. B.</hi> was accused of the Plot, his Conversion secured him without a Pardon, though either his Lordship was deeply guilty, or the Kings Evidence grosly perjured. Till the Author discover who he means by <hi>Sempronia,</hi> I shall not tell him who I believe to be as bad as <hi>Catiline.</hi> But it is prodigious, that while we are frighted with Bug-bears of invisible Dispensations from the Pope, his Lordship with his Arbitrary <hi>Must,</hi> should dispence at once, with the Law of God, as to the Queen; with the Law of Nations, as to Foreign Ministers; with the Laws of Hospitality, as to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and all that part of the Oath of Allegiance, that concerns the Heir of the Crown, which is equally binding with the rest, to all whose suspected honesty cannot accept of such an Arbitrary Dispensation. His Lordship seems much concerned to hear of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain between the King and the House of Commons; and so am I, for things are too ripe for mischief, when Subjects are permitted to capitulate with their Soveraign. The Kings Subjects (by His permission) have made Capitulations with Foreign Princes; but his Lordship would not have the King so far trusted, as that His own Subjects may Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with him, because as his Lordship says, he has so often deceived (that hard word) <hi>the People.</hi> And I beg leave to use the same expression of His <hi>Majesties</hi> patience, which his Lordship uses of his little care of his Person, That no Story affords a parallel of him. The actings of the Duke are indeed admirable to all, but incomprehensible to such as have not the true Principles of Loyalty rooted in them. But his Lordship (who in <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104307:2"/>
time was much better acquainted with what pass'd at <hi>London,</hi> then at <hi>Bruxels</hi>) avers, That the Duke had an early aim at the Crown, before the Kings Restauration; this is a high Charge, and ought to be better proved than by a bare assertion: Hath his Lordship any Letters to produce from His <hi>Royal Highness</hi> to Himself, or any other chief <hi>Minister of the Vsurpers?</hi> or to what Crown could the Duke pretend, when they had robbed the King of His own? The Duke can shew undeniable proofs of his Allegiance, even in those days; For what could an exiled Prince do more, than leave the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and Pensions that he had abroad, and all the advantages that his Birth, his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and his Reputation promised him, to follow the Fortune, and the Wants of His <hi>Majesty?</hi> But how will his Lordship make out, that after the Match with a <hi>Portugal</hi> Lady, (for that is the only Title his Lordship allows the Queen) the Duke and his Party made Proclamation to the World, that We were like to have no Children, and he must be the Certain Heir: where is the World? and where is the Proclamation? He says the Duke took his Seat in Parliament, as Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; but his Lordship knows, that the Seat on the Right Hand of the State, was, and is reserved for the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Duke took that on the Left Hand; the Printed Pictures of the House of Peers, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Tryal of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> shew, that this is no Innovation; and His <hi>Royal Highness</hi> had the same Seat, when the King his Father called the Parliament at <hi>Oxford.</hi> He urges, that the Duke had his Guards about him, upon the same Floor with the King, and so the King was every Night in his Power: It was a timerous ambition that lost so many opportunities. But what an Impudence is this? The Duke never had Guards; they are the Kings, the King pays them, they wait in their turn upon the King, and have but the Name of the Duke, as the Foot-Regiments have of Colonel <hi>Russel,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Craven</hi>; so the Duke was every Night in the Kings Power. Next he fires his greatest Guns, <hi>The Duke is plainly the Head of the Plot</hi>; By whose evidence? Long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke was named, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> declared to the Lords, that he had no more to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse; if he accuse him now, and <hi>Oates</hi> be divided against <hi>Oates,</hi> how can his Testimony stand good? <hi>Bedloe</hi> said as much; and here appears no Evidence, where the greatest would be little enough I say nothing of a <hi>Presbyterian Plot</hi>; but (with his Lordships leave) what has been, may be. The Calling, the Proroguing, and the Dissolving of Parliaments, are so absolutely in the King, that they ought to be Riddles to a Subject. When the Duke was Commanded to leave the Kingdom, I appeal to all the World, how readily, how Submissively he obeyed; and comparing his immediate Obedience, with the obstinate Refusal of others, who still stay in opposition to the Kings Command, let any Impartial man of Sense decide, which has shewed most Loyalty and Duty. His Lordship and his Party (for he says, <hi>We</hi>) expect every hour, that the Court should joyn with the Duke, against them; But I find, <hi>the Court</hi> is as hard a Word, as <hi>the People,</hi> and as boldly, and as odly used; If by that Word, he means the King, all his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Rhetorick will scarce perswade us, that the King should Conspire with the Duke, against His own Crown, and His own Life; If not, what can the Court do without the King, and against the Nation? Besides, his Lordship has too many Friends among the Courtiers, to suspect them; and the Duke has met with too much Ingratitude, to trust them. His Lordship avers as truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the King has declared the Duke to be Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; as, That His <hi>Royal Highness</hi> is now raising men in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that whole Council, that whole Kingdom, will disprove Him; And by the apparent falshood of his Assertion, let all men judge of the Truth of the rest. If the Arms, the Garrisons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be in such hands as the King thinks safe, We are safe too; But if not, it concerns His <hi>Mujesty</hi> to secure them, since his Lordship declares, the King is to be trusted with nothing, till he has Resigned himself Himself to his Lordship, and his Party, and is wholly theirs; and yet then too, He must trust their good Nature, and Surrender upon Discretion; They will allow Him no other Terms, no, not to be Himself, and have His Senses, unless they can fright Him out of them. <hi>I will yet charitably hope, that the pretended Author is abused; It concerns him to vindicate himself, by wishing, as I do, That the true Author may have the same Fate, that his Speech had, by Order of the House of Peers.</hi>
