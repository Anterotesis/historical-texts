            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>My Reverend Father,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know very well, that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath not written his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> with a deſign to explain to men the Secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but I do alſo know, that being inſpired by God, as he was,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64939:3"/>
he could ſay nothing about the production of the World, which is not true. And therefore I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, that to find the Principles of Natural Philoſophy infallible, they are not to be ſought but in that Hiſtory which He hath given us of the Creation of the World; or at leaſt, that we ought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem falſe whatever is ſaid of Nature, when it cannot be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with all the Circumſtances of this Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Do not wonder therefore that I ſo often refer you to <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and that I lay ſo much weight upon the Principles of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> Moſt of his Tenets are ſo conform to what <hi>Moſes</hi> hath ſaid, that it ſeems, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Philoſopher only by the Reading of this Prophet. But that you may the more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how great an agreement
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64939:3"/>
there is between that Sacred Writing and his Philoſophy, I intend to expound unto you the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> literally; and you'l ſee, that in doing ſo, I ſhall diſcourſe to you almoſt the ſame things which I told you laſt, when I explained to you the Principles of M. <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The only difference you'l find is, that M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> writeth things more particularly, and with a deſign to make them known what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth like an Hiſtorian, who diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of Nature only ſo far as was needful to make us admire the power of the Author thereof. Thus the one ſpeaketh only of the principal things, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dives more into particulars; and yet all theſe particulars are clearly nothing elſe but a more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64939:4"/>
ample explication, and a Sequel of thoſe main things which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> hath recited in ſo conciſe, ſo bold, and ſo true a manner.</p>
                  <p>I told you the other day, that M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in the beginning of his Principles uſeth much reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew, <hi>That</hi> there is a God: <hi>That</hi> all what is, is only by him: <hi>That</hi> he begun this great piece of Workmanſhip, which we call the World, by creating Bodies: <hi>That</hi> from that time he moved them, and that he ſtill continues to move them. I alſo told you, that among ſo many differences, which the <hi>Figures</hi> may make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bodies, M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> takes notice of three principal ones; that he ſhews, there is a very great Number, of ſuch as are round like little Balls; others, ſubtil enough to fill the ſpaces left by theſe Balls between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64939:4"/>
and others again, whoſe irregular Figures do ſo entangle them one with another, that they may compoſe the greater Maſſes.</p>
                  <p>I added, that examining the ſeveral changes, which the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the Aggregate of all theſe Bodies may have ſuffered ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſheweth, that there may have been formed many Maſſes of different big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, of a figure approaching to that of the Earth; above which he ſheweth, that there was to remain a number of particles, ſome like thoſe which compoſe the <hi>Water,</hi> and others like thoſe which compoſe the <hi>Fire:</hi> That this Aggregate of Earth, Water, and Air, was to be mixed, and ſurrounded with an almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of thoſe little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies made in the form of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,</hi> and with theſe other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64939:5"/>
ones that were to fill up their Intervalls. And that, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> repeats often, that God entertains in a continual motion this ſubtile matter, which elſe could not be moved.</p>
                  <p>Now all this, if you mark it, is nothing elſe, than to deſcribe Philoſophically and exactly (for the making out of the leaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it) the ſame won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which <hi>Moſes</hi> hath deſcribed Hiſtorically in theſe few Lines; <hi>God created in the beginning Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. Now the Earth was void, and brought forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe it was covered with deep waters; Darkneſs was upon the face of this Abyſs, and the Lord moved a ſubtil matter upon the Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that ſhall well examine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64939:5"/>
what the <hi>Prophet</hi> hath ſaid, will find that 'tis the ſame thing which the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> hath endeavoured to explain.</p>

                     <head>The FIRST DAY.</head>
                     <p>IF we ſhall follow the one in the progreſs of his Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the other in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of his Hiſtory; we may judge, that it is of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath learned, that the <hi>Light</hi> was made before the Sun; at leaſt it will appear, that this place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which for ſo many ages hath perplexed mens ſpirits, is found happily cleared, according to the Letter, by the Principles of M. <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64939:6"/>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> having ſhewed that the Earth was infertile becauſe of the Waters encompaſſing it, and the Celeſtial matter uſeleſs, becauſe the motions of it were not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; he goes on to ſhew, that God, who does nothing in vain, began, for the ordering of all theſe things, with the Creation of <hi>Light:</hi> He expreſſeth himſelf magnificently, as he is wont to do; and maketh the Almighty ſpeak on this occaſion in ſuch a manner, which is capable all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to perſwade, that it is the Lord himſelf that made him ſpeak thus.</p>
                     <p>Behold his Expreſſions; <hi>And God ſaid, Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi> He adds, That God ſaw, his work was good; that he divided the Light from the Darkneſs; and that he gave the name of <hi>Day</hi> to the Light,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64939:6"/>
and the name of <hi>Night</hi> to Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</p>
                     <p>There is no man of good ſenſe, who ſees not, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> having declared, that in the beginning God created Heaven &amp; Earth, &amp; that certain Bodies, ſubtil enough to be called Spirits, were carried to and fro, does ſignifie, that all the Bodies were already created; and that God did maintain from that time in the whole maſs of matter as much motion, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in it now; and that what he hath made in all the following ſix dayes, was only to put thoſe Bodies in order, and to regulate all their motions.</p>
                     <p>So that, if ſpeaking like an Hiſtorian, <hi>Moſes</hi> hath marked out the firſt day of this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Contrivance by the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Light, this ſignifies only to us, that God diſpoſed the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64939:7"/>
as they ought to be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this wonderful effect; which was ſufficient for an Hiſtorian; but the Philoſopher was to make it out, how theſe Bodies were to be diſpoſed for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore chuſing from among all the Figures thoſe, which might be moſt proper for the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies which cauſe Light, and ſeeing that thoſe, which he had deſcribed as <hi>Globules,</hi> being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a certain manner, would be ſatisfactory to all that is known of the Rayes which are made by the Light; M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath ſuppoſed, that there were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divers <hi>Vortexes</hi> or <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> of theſe little round Bodies, and that many of them turning round about one and the ſame Center, a part of the matter, which fills up their Intervalls, was gathered towards the Center, whence it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64939:7"/>
did propel the <hi>Globules</hi> which ſurrounded it; ſo that this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the <hi>Globules</hi> made Light in all thoſe places, where was found a ſufficient conflux and heap of ſubtile matter.</p>
                     <p>But he adds, that as in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning there was not yet a great plenty of theſe more ſubtil parts in the Centers of the Whirlpools, the action, which preſſed the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules,</hi> did not reach far; ſo that the places, which its effect could not reach to, remained in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whilſt the other were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enlightned: which agreeth admirably with the effect, which <hi>Moſes</hi> aſcribeth to the firſt Word of the Lord, which did ſeparate the Light from the Darkneſs, from the time it began to form it: From thence alſo we may ſay, according to <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the Night was where the Darkneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64939:8"/>
had remained; and the Day, where the Light had begun.</p>
                     <p>You will obſerve, that by the Word <hi>Light,</hi> we are here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing elſe but that, which is the cauſe, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, called Luminous, excite in us the ſentiment,, which makes us perceive them, and not the ſentiment it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Men do often confound theſe two things, and 'tis certainly from thence that all the doubts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that are met with on this Subject. But me thinks, that in what <hi>Moſes</hi> hath written of Light, 'tis evident, that he would only ſpeak of what is found on the part of the Bodies, and not of the Effect which it produceth in ſuch Subjects as are capable to have the ſenſe of it; ſince it is certain, according to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that when that, which is called Light,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64939:8"/>
was created, there was yet none of the other Creatures which are eſteemed capable to perceive it.</p>
                     <p>I deſire you to obſerve by the by another thing, which is; That this ſentiment, which we have from Luminous Bodies, is in ſuch a manner on the part of our Soul, and hath ſuch a neceſſary reſpect to the motion of certain parts of our Brain, that very often, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the excitation of the nerves of our Eyes by any Luminous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we have the ſenſe of Light. Thus in Dreams, the fortuitous courſe of the Spirits moving thoſe parts of our Brain, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation whereof is deſigned to excite in us that ſentiment, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us clearly ſee Objects that are not preſent: And by the ſame reaſon thoſe, who marching in a very obſcure place hurt their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64939:9"/>
head againſt the Wall, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſee a thouſand Fires; whence we are to conclude, that thoſe motions of the Brain which have nothing that reſembleth the thoughts which ariſe in the Soul on their occaſion, may be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other Bodies than thoſe we call Luminous. But it was very proper, not to give this name but to Bodies, whoſe figure and motion were ſo proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the fineneſs and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Eyes, that their nerves might be moved by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, and without danger to the other parts of our Body. Wherein, me thinks, M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath ſucceeded admirably well; it being not poſſible to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Luminous Bodies a fitter Figure than that which he hath given them, nor a motion more convenient, than that which he hath aſcribed to them.</p>

                        <hi>MOſes</hi> relating what paſſed the Second Day, for the formation of the Firmament, expreſſeth himſelf in theſe terms; <hi>God ſaid, let the Firmament be in the midſt of the Waters, and let it ſeparate the one from the other.</hi> He adds, that the Firmament was preſently made, and the Waters were ſeparated from the Waters, ſo that there were ſome of them above and ſome under the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he called <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To underſtand how the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſeparated one from the other by the formation of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, according to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> we ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64939:10"/>
need only to relate what he teacheth of the Waters and of the Firmament.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who have read what he hath written thereof, do know, that after he had conſidered all the effects of Water, he conceived that the particles, which compoſe it, muſt be ſmooth, long and pliant; and that by this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone he hath rendred a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all what is obſerved in Water, whether it be running, or whether it enlarge it ſelf in a Veſſel, or whether we ſee it in drops, or in the form of a Scum, or whether it riſe in Vapours, or whether, remaining without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it appear in Ice or Snow.</p>
                     <p>We know alſo, that he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that there hath been a great number of theſe particles very ſmooth and very pliant, mingled with other bodies, a great part
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64939:10"/>
of which had figures ſo embaraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that their Aggregate could form no other but hard Maſſes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We know, that he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth theſe laſt particles have been the matter of many Maſſes almoſt like the Earth; and foraſmuch as theſe Maſſes could not be very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid &amp; very hard, but by an extream preſſing of the Branchy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which compoſe them, it is evident, that the particles of water which were mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, were driven out of it, and that ſo the ſurfaces of thoſe great Maſſes were to be altogether co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with it.</p>
                     <p>This being ſuppoſed, it is now to be obſerved, that, according to M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> the formation of the Firmament is nothing elſe but a perfect diſpoſition and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all the Whirlpools, of which I have already ſpoken in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64939:11"/>
the Subject of Light: Their number is ſo great, and the ſpace they fill ſo vaſt, that the word <hi>Firmament,</hi> according to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt interpretation, ſignifieth a vaſt extenſion. There is nothing that deſerveth more this name, than their Aggregate. But as we ought to mark the time of the formation of every thing, only from the moment which giveth it its perfection; M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuppoſed, that the Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of all the whirlpools was not yet well ordered, when the Light began, nor their motion very free, doth mark the time of the formation of the Firmament, then only, when they were ſo well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, that the Ecliptick of the one anſwering to the Poles of the other, they began to move among themſelves with a motion altogether free, and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64939:11"/>
that not any one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Let from all thoſe, which encompaſſed it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis at this inſtant, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, the Maſſes, which were in the ſame <hi>Vortex,</hi> where the Earth was, began to be ſeparated from it by the matter of that <hi>Vortex,</hi> which inſinuated it ſelf betwixt them, and which kept them more or leſs diſtant from the Center, according to the difference of their groſsneſs or ſolidity. Now, as we have noted, that they were all covered with their Waters, and that the matter of the <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes</hi> (which, according to this Doctrine, is the matter of the Firmament) ſeparated them from the Earth, it was true to ſay, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſame Doctrine as well as that of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſevered from the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64939:12"/>
by the formation of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</p>
                     <p>Thus M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who ſeems always to follow <hi>Moſes,</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Waters ſo, that they are ſome above, and ſome under the Firmament. For we know, that what the Prophet calls in this place <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder,</hi> is the Earth we inhabit; and all that is ſevered from it by the Celeſtial matter, may be ſaid, in reſpect of us, to be above the Firmament.</p>
                     <p>I do not explain this more at large, nor do I examine, how well theſe different Conſervato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Waters, which M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> placeth in ſeveral parts of Heaven, do repreſent thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts, whence the Lord drew forth, at the time of his wrath, what ſerved to overwhelm the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I make reflection
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64939:12"/>
upon the Changes, which have happened to the Earth by this ſuper-abundance of Waters. This is perhaps the cauſe of the Clouds, Rains, and the firſt apparition of that admirable <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> which the Lord made uſe of to ſecure <hi>Noah</hi> againſt the apprehenſions of a new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, when he promiſed him to ſhut up for ever thoſe Cataracts, which he had opened for his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; but this would carry us too far.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Third</hi> Day <hi>Moſes</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that, the Waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Globe of the Earth, it was convenient to gather them together into certain places, to the end that the other parts thereof remaining diſcovered, the Earth might produce Herbs, Plants and Trees of all kinds. He ſaith, that the ſame word, which had operated the wonders of the precedent days, wrought that alſo. To which he adds, that what appeared dry, was called <hi>Earth,</hi> and the collection of the Waters, <hi>Sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is evident, that if the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64939:13"/>
Earth had remained perfectly round, the waters could not have been gathered into places, to leave others dry. We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe, that the ſame day, which ſaw the ſeparation of the Waters from the Earth, ſaw alſo the formation of the Hills, and that certain parts of the Earth being raiſed above others, left Vallies betwixt them for Beds to the waters, and Cavities under their Elevations, to receive a quantity of water, approaching to that which ſhould appear no more. 'Tis thus, that M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> explicateth the matter. He declareth alſo, how the Earth was enabled to produce herbs, plants and trees, and how the different Juices, which run within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Earth inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeveral Seeds, whoſe pores are adapted to their figure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64939:14"/>
I deſire you in this place to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith not, that God made any <hi>Soul</hi> for Plants; he only ſaith, that the Earth, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fertile by the word of the Lord, did produce them. But thoſe Philoſophers who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies had recourſe to Souls, when they would explicate the effects of certain Organical Bodies, of which they could not diſcover the Springs, have given one to every Plant. They have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it was impoſſible, to give an accompt of Vegetation without it. But M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> without adding any thing to the Scripture, where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of Plants, of their Seeds, of their increaſe and fruit without ſpeaking of any Soul, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, there needed none to be ſuppoſed to give a reaſon of their Nutrition; and he hath ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64939:14"/>
ſhewed, that Vegetation is performed by the local motion of the parts which come in afreſh, and by the fitneſs of their figure to the pores of that plant, which they are proper to increaſe, that I think I may aſſure, that there is none, how little ſoever accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Ratiocination, but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, after he hath exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what he ſaith on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that there remains not the leaſt probability to maintain, that Plants have Souls.</p>
                     <p>Yet you know, that there are yet ſome who will defend, that there are <hi>Vegetative</hi> Souls. But what, I pray, can authorize them? Not Reaſon ſurely. <hi>That</hi> tells us all, that things ought not to be multiplied without neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and ſince we do manifeſtly ſee, that Figure and Motion may be the entire cauſe of Vegetation,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64939:15"/>
we ought not to no purpoſe have recourſe to Souls. Nor can it be the Authority either of Man, or of the H. Scripture; for that of Man cannot be conſiderable againſt the evidence of natural Notions, and againſt the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which this Errour is convinced. As to that of Sacred Writ, it is manifeſt, that that is not on their ſide, and nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears there that may come near to what they would attribute to Plants, <hi>viz.</hi> a Vegetative Soul.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Fourth</hi> Word did form two great Luminaries in the Firmament, to divide perfectly the Day from the Night, and to mark the difference of Dayes, Seaſons and Years. The ſame Word formed alſo the Stars, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hiſtory of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> explaining this as a Naturaliſt, ſaith, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Vortexes,</hi> which had been formed of all the Celeſtial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having been adapted to one another, as was moſt convenient for the continuation of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there flowed ſo much of the moſt ſubtil matter towards
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64939:16"/>
the Center of each of them, by the preſſure of the <hi>Globules,</hi> which tended to recede from it, that at length each of the Whirlpools came to have in his middle ſo great a quantity of this matter, that it was able to propel the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules to the extremities' of the Whirlpool, and by this action to form ſuch Rays, as thoſe are, whoſe force makes us ſee the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sun.</p>
                     <p>He adds, that this ſubtil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, gathered at the Center of each <hi>Vortex,</hi> may have force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to thruſt the Globules of the Neighbouring <hi>Vortexes,</hi> and to make there its action ſenſible. So that, according to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, the ſhining collection of ſubtil matter, which was made in the Center of this <hi>Vortex</hi> wherein was the Earth, was, in reſpect of it, the greateſt Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,

that is, the <hi>Sun:</hi> Thoſe that were made in the other <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texes,</hi> were <hi>Stars;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of all the great Maſſes, which was found neareſt, and moſt diſpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel towards it the Light of the Sun, was the leſſer Luminary, that is, the <hi>Moon.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more of it; and 'tis ſo well known, that the difference of Dayes, Nights and Seaſons comes from the different ſituation, wherein the Earth, the Sun &amp; other Stars are found, that I ſhould be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to repeat here what M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath written on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Fifth</hi> Day God ſaid; <hi>Let the Waters produce the Moving Creature that hath a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, and Fowl that fly above the Earth.</hi> And the <hi>Sixth</hi> Day he ſaid, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the Living Creature after its kind, Cattel, and creeping things, and Beasts of the Earth.</hi> I do not add the reſt; for it is enough to ſay, that God would have it ſo, to let men know, that it was ſo.</p>
                     <p>This Place teaching us, that if it may be ſaid, that Fiſh and the other Brute Animals have Souls,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64939:17"/>
theſe Souls are produced by the Waters and the Earth; M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had reaſon to believe, that what is here called Soul, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but little Bodies ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to the Organs of Fiſhes and other Brutes, that they make them live, move and grow.</p>
                     <p>He hath admirably explained upon this Subject the Circulation of the Bloud; the manner <hi>how</hi> it is heated in the Heart; <hi>how</hi> it runs into the Arteries, whoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pores let out the particles, which their figure maketh fit for the nouriſhment of the Members; and <hi>how</hi> the fineſt parts of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves from the reſt, to go to the Brain, whence they are diſtributed into Muſcles, where they ſerve for the motion of the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>He doth give ſuch an accurate accompt of all theſe things only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64939:18"/>
by the figure and the motion of the little Bodies, and the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Organs, that there can remain no doubt of them. And that it may not ſeem a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what he ſaith of the heat of the Bloud, which he maketh the chief Spring of all thoſe Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, commonly called Vital and Animal, he proves, that they muſt neceſſarily be performed by Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, without the need of any Soul; adding to his Reaſons the example of certain Liquors, which are cold to the touch when they are aſunder, but grow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hot, even to a degree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition, when they are blended together. As this efferveſcence happens to Liquors, which are not ſo much as ſuſpected to have Souls, M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath, me thinks, advanced nothing but what is rational, when he ſaith,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64939:18"/>
That the heat of the Bloud, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the diſpoſition and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the Organs, is able without a Soul to cauſe the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and motion of Brutes.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks alſo, that he had reaſon, ſince, what the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation</hi> calls a <hi>Living Soul,</hi> was produced by the Waters and the Earth, to believe, that this kind of Souls were only Bodies. And indeed there are ſo many places, whereby we may know, that this was the meaning of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that 'tis a wonder to me to find men ſtill doubting thereof.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould tire you to recite them all to you; let me only deſire you to reflect a little on <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. where you will plainly find what it is that enlivens Fleſh and Beaſts; <hi>The Soul of all Fleſh is in the Bloud.</hi> The ſame ſaith M. <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> But <hi>Deut. 12. 23. Moſes</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:64939:19"/>
expreſſeth himſelf yet more clearly, to make us underſtand, that Beaſts have no other Souls than the Bloud: <hi>Only be ſure that thou eat not the Bloud: for the Bloud is the Soul.</hi> And that it might be yet more underſtood, he adds; <hi>And therefore thou maiſt not eat the Soul, but ſhalt pour it upon the Earth as water.</hi> Is there not then all the reaſon in the world, that thoſe Souls, which the earth produceth, which may be eaten, and poured out upon the earth as water, ſhould be counted among Bodies?</p>
                     <p>I grant indeed, that the bloud, when it is heated, is exhaled in very ſubtil parts, and that theſe fine parts are thoſe, which do nouriſh and move. But how ſubtil ſoever they be, they are Bodies, and they have nothing more of ſpiritual in them, than
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64939:19"/>
flame, compoſed of parts yet more ſubtil, which yet never any man was ſo unadviſed as to call ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
                     <p>I wonder for my part, that thoſe who have given Souls to all that is nouriſh'd, have given none to a Flame, which converts into it all the bodies it lays hold on. And (what is more) I wonder, how men could come to attribute to Souls the cauſe of Nutrition and Motion, whereas we ſee nothing but Body that is capable to be moved, and that Nutrition is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an addition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Bodies. But without inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much upon Ratiocination, is it not viſible, that <hi>Moſes</hi> (who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be believed) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges no other thing for the cauſe of the motion and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of Beaſts, but the bloud? I think not, that any man, who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64939:20"/>
conſiders it, will contend about it any longer.</p>
                     <p>But that you may the better know the force of all theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which hitherto I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken according to the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation,</hi> and which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this verſion, leave no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, although the word <hi>Soul</hi> have been there employed; I ſhall now make uſe of a means, which wil prevail upon your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and better perſwade you than any other.</p>
                     <p>You know more than one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and among others you know the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not. I ſhall tell you then, that a while ago, reflecting on that place of Scripture, where is deſcribed the work of the Fifth, and that of the Sixth Day, there appeared to me ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the manner, in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64939:20"/>
which the formation of Brutes, and that of Man was made, that I believed, what word ſoever was uſed in the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> there muſt be uſed very differing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſaw, that the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſaid, that the Beaſts have a <hi>Living Soul,</hi> and that the ſame Tranſlation uſed the ſame word to ſignifie the <hi>Life</hi> of Man: But I found withal, that beſides that living Soul, which the <hi>Vulgar</hi> gives to Man, as it doth to Brutes, 'tis added, that Man was made to the Image of his Maker, whom I knew to be a pure Spirit. Whence I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſince this Reſemblance could not be drawn from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Creator having none, it muſt needs be taken from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a ſuperiour order, and, in a word, from the Spirit. To this I added, what the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64939:21"/>
ſpeaking of Man in the Second <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> Where I ſaw, that the Lord, who had made him a living Creature, as the Beaſts, had breathed into him ſomething which Beaſts had not, and which, me thought, ſhould be in him the Principle of a Life altogether different from theirs, and the cauſe of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous reſemblance, which he was to have with his Maker.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things did already ſway much with me for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Man; but believing that I might yet better diſcover the ſenſe of thoſe places, by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Interpretation of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> I conſulted Monſieur <hi>de Compiegne,</hi> who is known to be the ableſt we have in this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I prayed him to give me the Verſion of the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> and in

this Verſion I found the full proof of what I always thought, and of what M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had written on this Subject. For I ſaw, that in the place, which ſpeaks of the Production of Fiſhes and other Brutes, where the <hi>Vulgar</hi> ſaith, Let the Waters and the Earth bring forth <hi>Living Souls,</hi> my Interpreter ſaid, Let the Earth and the Water produce Living <hi>Individuals:</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with it a very good ſenſe, and expreſſeth the thing in a far more conceivable manner: For, it is very intelligible, that the Earth and Waters have produced living <hi>Individuals,</hi> that is, that they have been ſo fitted and diſpoſed by the Almighty hand of the Lord, as to form Organical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which being fit for Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Motion (in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts all the <hi>Life</hi> of Bodies) were
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64939:22"/>
to be called <hi>Living;</hi> but foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they could not be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without being quite deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were to be called <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſee in the place which ſpeaks of the formation of <hi>Man,</hi> that not only he was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Earth by the hands of the Lord, and that thereby he was become a <hi>Living Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,</hi> as Beaſts are; but above that, I ſee, that beſides this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual or Body Organick, which maketh him feed &amp; move like Beaſts, he hath received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, which my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter calls <hi>Mens,</hi> and which I call Spirit, or Thought.</p>
                     <p>So that, as there is nothing ſpoken of a Soul for Plants in the Vulgar (as I have already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) ſo there is neither in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> for Brutes. Neither is it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64939:22"/>
ſaid, that Brutes have <hi>Senſe,</hi> (which I alſo deſire you to note) but this only is ſaid, that they have Life and Motion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Life and this Motion do depend upon the diſpoſition and correſpondence of many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, the <hi>Diviſion</hi> of which would hinder the effect; <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie this Aggregate by one word, uſeth that of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>Individual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that, which we ought to conſider above all, is, what the ſame ſacred Writer ſo well decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; <hi>That</hi> Man hath a Body or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized as Brutes have, and <hi>that</hi> this Body liveth by the ſame Principles which give life to Brutes; <hi>that</hi> having ſaid, that the <hi>Individuum</hi> of every Beaſt was produced by the Waters and the Earth, he ſaith, that that of Man was alſo produced of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64939:23"/>
Earth. And to make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this duſt of the earth, which before was diviſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, was ſo diſpoſed that it became an <hi>Individual,</hi> as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the other living bodies; he expreſſeth himſelf by the ſame word he uſed ſpeaking of Beaſts; and at the ſame time adds, that the Lord inſpired into this living Individual, of which he would make a man, that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Thought.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſeems to me ſo ſtrong, that I think there can remain no more ſcruple about this point, <hi>viz.</hi> what we are to believe hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth of Brutes and of Man. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> hath given us clearly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Brutes live and move, becauſe the Bloud and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of their Organs maketh of each of them an Individual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64939:23"/>
Body, which remains fit for thoſe two effects, as long as that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance laſts: And why ſhould we attribute any other thing to them but this individual body, by which an accompt can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of their Life and Motion?</p>
                     <p>But then, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith not, that they have <hi>Senſe.</hi> Why ſhould we deviſe, that they have any? Or, at leaſt, what danger is there to aſſert, that they have none?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, this Man, inſpired by God, teacheth us, that the Brutes have nothing but what a Body may have, and that we have a body as they. But he adds, that we have beſides a <hi>Spirit;</hi> or, if you will, a Soul, which we know is alone capable of having ſenſe, of judging, of willing, and of all the other wayes of <hi>thinking.</hi> Why then ſhould we not aſſert, that the brute Animals have nothing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64939:24"/>
but Body, and that they have no ſentiment? And why ſhould we not affirm, that beſides a body, like unto that which they have, (which maketh us not reſemble our Maker) we have a Soul, which giveth us that admirable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to reſemble him as much as a Creature is capable to do?</p>
                     <p>If after all this you ſhall ſtill tell me, that the opinion of M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> is dangerous, in that it maketh Brutes live and move without a ſoul; I ſhall anſwer you, that then the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> is dangerous, foraſmuch as it teacheth us the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>But if, after you have ſeen, how well <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſeparate that in Man, which maketh him <hi>live</hi> and move, from that which maketh him <hi>think,</hi> you ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, how the Creed of S. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> which we read every day
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64939:24"/>
as the Symbol of our Faith, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Man,</hi> you'l ſee, that he ſaith, that the Fleſh, and the Rational Soul make all what he is: To which he adds, that, as theſe two ſubſtances, how different ſoever they be, conſtitute but one man; ſo God and Man make but one and the ſame Chriſt. But as in our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, whatever the Union of his two Natures be, to confound them ſo, as to attribute to the one what comes from the other; ſo there is alwayes great danger to confound in Man the two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which do compoſe him, and the Functions which depend from each of them.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that give to the Body ſentiment or other perceptions, which cannot belong but to the Soul, are ſubject to believe, that Man, as a Beaſt, hath nothing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64939:25"/>
but Body. On the other hand, thoſe who think, that the Soul is that which cauſeth Nutrition and Motion in Man, are liable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Beaſts, which feed and move, have a Soul as Man hath; and when there is no other difference betwixt Souls than that of <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> there is an Axiom, which ſaying, <hi>That more or leſs changeth not the Eſſence,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that Men will ſoon accuſtom themſelves to believe, that if all periſheth in Beaſts by death, there remains alſo nothing in Man, when he hath loſt his Life.</p>
                     <p>As for me, I doubt not at all, but what hath been ſaid of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative and Senſitive Souls, which are attributed to Plants and to Beaſts, hath made impious men believe, that thoſe which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men, may be of the ſame nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:64939:25"/>
If my Diſcourſe were not too prolix already, I could explain to you the moſt wonderful operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Brutes by the ſole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Organs, as all the operations of a Watch are made out to you by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of its parts; and ſhew you, that there is no difference betwixt Artificial and Natural Engines, but in this, that the Author of Nature is a far more excellent Artiſt than Men are, and that he hath known to apply ſuch parts to one another, as are much ſubtiler and much nimbler than thoſe are of which we commonly compoſe our Machines. I could alſe demonſtrate to you, that there is nothing known to us in Brutes, even in the <hi>Ape</hi> it ſelf, which may not be explicated from Bodies; and that in Man there are <hi>Thoughts,</hi> which all the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64939:26"/>
diverſities imaginable in Figures and Motions cannot give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of. But I ſhould exceed the Bounds I have preſcribed to my ſelf, and it ſufficeth me to have ſhewed you, that M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath alwayes followed <hi>Moſes,</hi> to make you aver, that his Philoſophy contains nothing dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Mean time I ſhall acknowledge, that the formation of the World according to M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> ſeems to have ſomething different from that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But when you ſhall have conſidered the Deſign of the Prophet, and alſo that of the Philoſopher, you will confeſs that this difference ought not to make us ſay, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from one another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> hath delivered the thing as 'twas done. He ſaith, that God created the Earth, the Waters,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64939:26"/>
the Celeſtial Parts, then the Light, and the reſt; ſo that, when the Sun was created, the Earth was already inriched with Fruits, and adorned with Flowers. Whereas M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> maketh the Sun the Cauſe, not only of the Fruits, and Flowers, but alſo of the gathering together of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the Earth. The ſame alſo maketh the Earth to have been formed a long time after the Sun, although the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture noteth, that it was created before.</p>
                     <p>But here we are to take notice of 2 things: The <hi>one</hi> is, that M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath ſaid himſelf, that his Hypotheſis was falſe in this, that he ſuppoſeth that the formation of each Being is made ſucceſſivly; aſſuring, that this way not being ſo proper for God, we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his Omnipotency hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64939:27"/>
put every thing in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect condition it could be in, from the firſt moment of its producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>other</hi> is, that M. <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was, like a Philoſopher, to explicate only the reaſon, why things are conſerved as they are, and the different effects we now admire in Nature. Now, as 'tis certain, that things are naturally conſerved by the ſame means which hath produced them; ſo it was neceſſary for to find, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Laws, which he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Nature follows to conſerve her ſelf, are true, that he ſhould examine, whether the ſame Laws could have diſpoſed it as now it is: And finding, that according to the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi> it ſelf, although the Sun was formed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Earth, it is yet by the Sun, that God conſerveth the Earth as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64939:27"/>
now it is, the heat thereof being cauſe of all the Productions and Changes therein; M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was to ſhew, that this ſame Sun could have put it into that ſtate we now find it in, if the great Creator had not put it there in an inſtant by his Omnipotent power.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in which M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, that the Sun hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Earth, is ſucceſſive, which he acknowledgeth (as I have already noted) to be not ſo ſutable to God in producing things: But however, as that which God doth in conſerving the World, is ſucceſſive, and muſt be ſo, that every thing may have a certain duration; it was proper for our Philoſopher to examine, whether the Principles which he laid down to give an
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64939:28"/>
accompt of the duration of all Natural Beings, could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them by ſucceſſion of time; which he hath done with an exactneſs, which ſeems to me incomparable. And ſo M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath therein done nothing, contrary to the Deſign of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> knew, that 'tis by the Sun that God conſerveth the Earth and the Natural Beings, thoſe at leaſt which are neareſt unto us; but leſt it ſhould be thought, that that Luminary was the cauſe of all, he would have us know, that <hi>Light,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends moſt of all from the Sun, was made before the Sun. And this was neceſſary to give notice of to thoſe who were to know theſe Wonders, that God hath wrought them all by his ſole will; and if he conſerveth them now
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64939:28"/>
with a kind of mutual Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, yet they do not owe their Being nor their Conſervation to one another, but to God alone.</p>
                     <p>M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> on his part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to explain that correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which God hath put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the things of Nature, and being to give an accompt by the Sun of all that is done in that part of the World which is moſt known to men, could not better declare to us, how well the Sun is fitted and diſpoſed by the Firſt Power to maintain the natural ſtate of all we ſee, than by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, following this ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the Sun could have in progreſs of time put our World into the condition 'tis in, if it had not been more proper to form all the Creatures in an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der altogether contrary to that, which was required by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64939:29"/>
that now is between them, and to produce each Being in a way, which might ſhew, that as the Author of the World had need of nothing to make all things, ſo he needed no time to bring forth any of the things we admire.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If you conſider, that that Wiſdom, which put the firſt Man into his moſt perfect ſtate from the firſt moment of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, did ſubject his Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the ſame Laws, from which he hath made to depend the formation of thoſe that are born of him, and that, for the right knowledge of the Nature of Man, it would be much more proper to examine the different Changes, which happen in the Seed from the time of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto the Birth of thoſe that are generated, than to examine
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64939:29"/>
the miraculous formation of him, whom Omnipotency finiſh'd in beginning him; you will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs find, that for the well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether what is taught of the Laws, which conſerve the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, be true, there is no better way, than to conſider, whether thoſe Laws could have produced the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I will not examine here, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what is commonly believed of the ſtability of the Earth, is better explicated by the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> than by thoſe which have preceded him.</p>
                     <p>Neither ſhall I examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more true than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; himſelf hath ſaid (as I have already noted) that it may be falſe. And certainly among an Infinity of ways, which God may uſe to make one and the ſame thing, it is difficult to aſſure,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64939:30"/>
which that is he hath taken actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. But me thinks, that Men have reaſon to be content, when they have found one of them, which can give an accompt of all the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the H. Scripture and the Church propoſe to us. M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath been ſo ſhy to advance any thing not conform to what <hi>they</hi> declare to us, that he hath expreſly ſubmitted to the one, what he ſeems to have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken out of the other.</p>
                     <p>Thus whoſoever ſhall read his Writings with the ſame Spirit, wherein he wrote them, will not be in any danger of being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and will be alwayes ready to acknowledge his Errors, as ſoon as thoſe that are to direct his Belief ſhall make him underſtand them. As for me, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if we ſhould condemn
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64939:30"/>
what M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten touching the manner in which the ſeveral Aſpects of the Sun &amp; the Earth are made, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on judging, it would not be a ſufficient ſtability for the Earth, to remain always at reſt in the midſt of all the Celeſtial matter, which is found between the Body of the Moon and it, we ſhould come to determine, that the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> makes all that matter run through in 1. year about the Sun, is contrary to what we ought to believe of the reſt of the Earth; his greateſt Followers, imitating his ſubmiſſion, would ſubmit themſelves firſt of all. For in ſhort, as they know by evident Demonſtrations, not only that 'tis God that is the Cauſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the leaſt portion of the Matter, but alſo that it is his Omnipotent hand which directs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64939:31"/>
ordereth it throughout; it would be much more eaſie for them than others, to conceieve, that the ſame Hand can direct the Motions of the Sun, and of all the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Matter about the Earth, ſo as it ſhould not receive the leaſt ſhaking from it.</p>
                     <p>For the reſt, I think I cannot repeat too often, that M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> hath not pretended, that his Hypotheſis was true in all, and hath even acknowledged, that it was not ſo in certain things. But once more, I eſteem, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, that it was allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Men to make ſuppoſitions, and that they were all receivable, ſo they did ſatisfie all the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and were not contrary to Religion.</p>
                     <p>You'l find in ſome of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he took much pains, when he was about to advance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64939:31"/>
certain Propoſitions, to know, whether they had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is by the Motives of this diſcreet apprehenſion, that he dedicated his Meditations to the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi> And in ſhort, it appears in his whole Conduct, that he would not for all the knowledge and Honour of the World, run the hazard of an <hi>Anathema.</hi> I muſt tell you alſo, that I think I know ſome of the beſt Wits, which are much addicted to his Tenets; and I know not one of them, that would not abandon them, if they had been condemned. I doubt, whether the ſame would be done by thoſe that follow <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> if his Opinions ſhould be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anew: I ſay <hi>anew,</hi> becauſe you know, that they have been ſo by the Laws, and even by a Council: And yet, although
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64939:32"/>
nothing have been changed ſince in the Canons about it, many think they may follow him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. My chief Deſign is not to blame <hi>Aristotle;</hi> I intend only to juſtifie M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and I think I have done it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, I am,</p>

Senſes repreſent to us, becauſe they do ordinarily deceive us: But whilſt he doubts of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the Objects of the Senſes, he cannot poſſibly doubt that he or that part of himſelf, we call <hi>Soul,</hi> which doubteth and thinketh, exiſts.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe <hi>Thinking</hi> alone maketh the Soul know its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe is convinced, that ſhe is a Subſtance, whoſe Eſſence or Nature is to <hi>Think,</hi> and nothing elſe; and conſequently that ſhe thinks alwayes. Whence it alſo follows, that the Soul is more aſſured of her Exiſtence, than of that of any other thing, and that ſhe knows her ſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other thing, ſince ſhe cannot diſcover any propriety of it, but ſhe muſt diſcover in her ſelf a new one, that is, the faculty or propriety to know it.</p>

If the Soul makes reflection upon the <hi>Idaea</hi>'s or Conceptions ſhe hath, ſhe will find one of them, which repreſents to her a Being infinitely perfect, which is <hi>God.</hi> And obſerving that this <hi>Idaea</hi> contains by repreſentation an Infinity of Perfections, ſhe will be conſtrained to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that this <hi>Idaea</hi> could not be in her, if this infinitely perfect Being, which ſhe repreſents, had not lodged it there, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that this Being, which is <hi>God,</hi> exiſts.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe this very ſame <hi>Idaea</hi> contains the external Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this infinitely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſhe repreſents, the Soul is obliged, by a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to avow, that Exiſtence belongs to the Eſſence of God, and by conſequence, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts neceſſarily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64939:36"/>
Laſtly, Foraſmuch as the Soul knows, that there is not any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for her to exiſt to day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe did exiſt yeſterday, ſhe is thence convinced, that ſhe needs to be conſerved: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Conſervation is nothing but a continual Production, ſhe muſt needs confeſs, that God, to whom alone belongs this Production, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and that 'tis in vain here to have recourſe to a progreſs <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum,</hi> becauſe the matter in queſtion is the <hi>preſent</hi> Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt cauſe of which muſt exiſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Idaea</hi> we have of God, whereby we apprehend him to be a Being ſoveraignly perfect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not complete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it comprehends not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly all that is intelligible of him, yet it is very clear, and very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, becauſe it clearly ſhews us
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64939:36"/>
his whole Nature; juſt as we ſay, that a man knows the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Triangle, when he knows a Superficies bounded by three Lines; although he do not know many of its Proprieties, which perhaps will never be all known to the beſt <hi>Geometers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being moſt aſſured, that there is a God, and his Nature being ſuch, that he cannot deceive us, we are certain, that we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver erre in things we know clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly. Wherefore having clear and diſtinct <hi>Idaea's</hi> of the Corporeal Nature, or of Subſtance in general, and alſo in particular of ſome Bodies which preſent themſelves dayly to our mind by the Senſes; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides, that we are not the Cauſes of thoſe <hi>Idaea's,</hi> ſince we often have them againſt our will; we muſt neceſſarily conclude,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64939:37"/>
that they are excited <hi>in</hi> us by ſenſible Beings that are <hi>without</hi> us and actually exiſt in the World; and that theſe Beings are really diſtinct from the Soul, becauſe that her Nature is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether different from theirs; whence it follows that ſhe is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the <hi>Idea's,</hi> which we have of things corporeal, are often different, we have cauſe to believe, that the Beings which produce them, are different alſo. And becauſe theſe <hi>Idaea's</hi> are ſometimes renewed, after they have ceaſed to be for ſome time, and that we have no reaſon to believe, that a thing which <hi>is</hi> once, ſhould be anihilated, we are obliged to hold that there are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which laſt even when they are not felt; and this is the only means we have to aſſure our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64939:37"/>
ſelves of the exiſtence of the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Duration</hi> of Senſible Beings.</p>
                     <p>We are not only aſſured of the Exiſtence of Bodies, but alſo, that there is one, which is more properly ours than all others, becauſe it accompanies us every where, and the Motions made therein excite ſome Thoughts in our Soul, and the Thoughts of our Soul produce reciprocally ſome Motions in the Body. Which convinceth us of the Union there is between the Soul and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which conſiſts not only in their mutual preſence, but in a true <hi>mode,</hi> which in its nature is ſuch, that we cannot comprehend it by our Underſtanding, nor by our Imagination; but we infer it only by the Experiments of the Senſes.</p>
                     <p>Our Errors proceed from the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64939:38"/>
ill uſe of our Freedom, in that our Will being in ſome manner of a vaſter extent than our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we do not contain <hi>that</hi> within the Bounds of <hi>this,</hi> but we either judge of things we do not clearly conceive, or we judge of them otherwiſe than we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. For it belongs to the Underſtanding alone, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or to repreſent Objects ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, whereas the Judgment and all other determination is an Act of the Will.</p>
                     <p>The chief perfection of Man conſiſts in the good uſe of his Freedom, and in never judging otherwiſe of things than he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them; which is ſo proper to every one, that even thoſe who have their Underſtanding leſs enlightened, may altogether poſſeſs this perfection, foraſmuch as 'tis alwayes in their power to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64939:38"/>
                        <hi>ſuſpend</hi> their Judgment, that is, to keep themſelves from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting or from denying a thing, of which they have not clear and diſtinct <hi>Idaea's:</hi> which is to be underſtood of thoſe only that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Inſtruction of the Mind;</hi> for very often we ought not to look for evidence in things which concern the <hi>Conduct of our Life,</hi> and leſs in thoſe which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to <hi>Religion,</hi> becauſe knowing evidently, that God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, and that there are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite things in him, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of our Spirit, his Authority ought to produce in us a certainty, which ſurpaſſeth that of the greateſt Evidence.</p>
                     <p>We may diſtinguiſh three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in each ſenſe. In the <hi>first,</hi> we are to conſider nothing but the Motion, which the external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do immediately cauſe in the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64939:39"/>
corporeal Organ; and 'tis this alone, we have common with Brutes. The <hi>ſecond</hi> contains all that reſults immediately in our Mind, becauſe it is united to the Corporeal Organ, mov'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by thoſe Objects: Such are the Sentiments of Heat, of Titil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is all we ought to refer to <hi>Senſe,</hi> if we will exactly diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> comprehends all the Judgments, which we have been accuſtom'd to make from our Infancy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things that are about us, upon the occaſion of the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that are made in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of our Senſes; and 'tis in theſe Judgments, that our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Errors do conſiſt; ſo that when we ſay that the certainty of our Underſtanding is greater than that of our Senſes, we mean
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64939:39"/>
nothing elſe, than that the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we form in a riper age, by reaſon of ſome new Obſervations we have made, are more certain than thoſe, we have formed from our Infancy, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on them.</p>

                     <p>IT cannot be ſaid, that the Precepts which are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught in Schools, are to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together rejected or deſpiſed, ſince they are eſtabliſhed upon very good Reaſons; nor that a great number of Queſtions, which are treated therein, and which at firſt ſight appear odd enough, are of no uſe.

the parts of the Matter, and which he ſtill conſerveth therein in <hi>the ſame</hi> quantity; for which cauſe he is called the <hi>Firſt Mover.</hi> The parts of the Matter, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they differ in Magnitude and Figure, are called the <hi>Second Cauſes</hi> of this ſame Motion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they communicate it mutually to one another, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, according as they have the power of it; and that is done following theſe Rules.</p>

                        <item>1. All Body which is moved and meets with another quieſcent Body in its way, if it propels it, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth to the ſame of its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in proportion to its Bulk.</item>
                        <item>2. When the Motion of a Body is made in a curve Line, each of its parts in particular tends always to continue its Motion in a ſtreight Line, and effectually continueth it,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64939:44"/>
if it can ſeparate it ſelf ſrom the rest.</item>
                        <item>3.

                        <item>4. When an hard Body falls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly upon another hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which it moveth not, the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction must be made in the ſame Line, in which the Incidence is made. And when an hard Body falleth obliquely upon another hard Body, which it moveth not, the Reflection muſt be made at equal Angles.</item>

5. When a Body paſſeth obliquely out of one <hi>Medium</hi> into another which it penetrateth more eaſily, it must be diverted by approaching to the Perpendicular: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it must be farther removed from the ſame, when it penetrateth the ſecond <hi>Medium</hi> more difficultly.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>There is no Motion differing from the <hi>Local,</hi> not even that which is called the Motion of <hi>Generation;</hi> whence it follows, that 'tis uſeleſs to admit <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms</hi> in Beings meerly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>
                     <p>Being aſſur'd, that God hath put into the Matter, of which the World is compoſed, a certain quantity of Local Motion, and that he alwayes conſerveth the ſame; we are alſo aſſur'd, that, although God had not produced the World all at once, it would
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64939:45"/>
have come to paſs by the Rules of Motion, we have laid down, that in the indefinite Extenſion of the Matter there would have been form'd a great number of <hi>Vortexe,</hi> or Whirl-pools, which would have continued to move of themſelves without the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of any <hi>Intelligence,</hi> and kept always the ſame Situation in reſpect to one another.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe evident, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of the Matter which compoſeth each <hi>Vortex,</hi> of what Figure ſoever you ſuppoſe them, muſt, in hitting one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have broken their Angles, until they were made near round, and ſo formed the Matter, which we call the <hi>Second Element.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Matter, that is come away from about the parts made round, muſt neceſſarily have acquired a Motion much ſwifter than that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64939:45"/>
of the ſaid round ones. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if you add, that thoſe parts being extreamly ſmall, their ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt make, that they can change their Figure every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to adapt themſelves to the Figure of the places where they are to paſs; you have that, we call the <hi>Firſt Element.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> and laſt <hi>Element</hi> is nothing elſe but the Surplus of the parts of the Matter, that are inſenſible, but yet groſſer than thoſe of the firſt and ſecond Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which having kept the entangling Figures they had in the beginning, have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, more eaſily to be joined ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny together, and to compoſe great Bodies, as the Planets, than to be made round.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſuperfluous to admit other Elements than theſe <hi>three,</hi> becauſe there are no other Bodies in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64939:46"/>
whole Univerſe, that are ſimple, that is, the Forms of which do not contain any Qualities, that are contrary.</p>
                     <p>From thence, that all the Matter of each <hi>Vortex</hi> turns round, &amp; ſtriveth to recede from the Center, it muſt come to paſs that the Matter of the <hi>ſecond</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement does recede farther from it, than that of the <hi>firſt;</hi> which conſequently muſt take up the ſpace which is at the Center of every <hi>Vortex:</hi> Whence ſtriving ſtill to recede, it thruſts from all ſides the <hi>ſecond</hi> Element; and adds to its force the impreſſion, which is requiſite to move the <hi>Optique Nerve,</hi> the Motion of which paſſing afterwards into the Brain, giveth the Soul occaſion to produce the Sentiment of <hi>Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Great</hi> Bodies that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64939:46"/>
were formed of the <hi>third</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are called <hi>Planets,</hi> they were to follow the Circular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond,</hi> and to range themſelves in each <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex</hi> the nearer to, or the farther from the Center, the more or leſs ſolidity they had; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more ſolid are actually gone farther from it, they alſo take up, in making a Revolution, ſo much the longer time, the greater their diſtance is from the Center.</p>
                     <p>But although the <hi>Planets</hi> do without reſiſtance follow the courſe of the Matter of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens which carrieth them about Circularly, yet we muſt not therefore ſay, that they move al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as ſwift; whence it comes to paſs that the Matter of the Heavens not being able to continue its courſe in the degree

                     <p>All the diverſities of Liquors conſiſt in the different ſizes and ſhapes of their parts.

                     <p>The <hi>Heat</hi> of hot Bodies conſiſts in the agitation of all their inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts about their own Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whence it follows, that the greater this agitation is, the ſtronger is the heat, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there can be nothing hotter than a Flame, there being nothing more agitated, as Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirms it. All the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Flames proceed from this, that the parts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them are more or leſs groſs,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64939:55"/>
and conſequently more or leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to agitate the Bodies, which are the Subject of their Action.

                        <hi>Colours</hi> in general are nothing elſe, but Light it ſelf modified by the Surface of the Bodies, we call colour'd. The <hi>White</hi> Colour particularly conſiſts in this, that the Superficies of the white Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is aſperated by innumerable ſmall Surfaces of an almoſt ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature, which are ſo placed, that ſome looking this way, and ſome that way, they yet reflect the Rays of Light falling on them, not towards one another, but outwards to our Eyes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Black</hi> conſiſts in this, that the Surface of the Black Body is aſperous after ſuch a manner, that it altogether deads the Rays of Light which fall upon it, and keeps them from reflecting back
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64939:57"/>
again to the Spectators eyes. All other Colours conſiſt in this, that the Superficies of the Bodies thus coloured are in ſuch a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, that the little Globes of the ſecond Element, which enter into the compoſition of the Rays, encountring them, do reflect, loſing a part of their direct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and acquiring in ſtead of it ſomewhat of a Circular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And 'tis alſo in the ſeveral proportions, to be met with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Motions, that all the ſeveral Colours do conſiſt: And becauſe theſe Proportions may be changed a thouſand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wayes, 'tis no wonder we ſee ſo many different Colours.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Humors</hi> which compoſe our Eyes, are contrived by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to determine the Rayes, that come from one and the ſame point

                     <p>THE form of <hi>Plants</hi> conſiſts in the particular texture of their Fibres, and in the ſize, ſhape, and diſpoſition of the parts which compoſe them: Whence do reſult in Plants ſuch Channels and Tubes, as are fit to receive thoſe Juices, which are proper for them, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Matter of the firſt and ſecond Element is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make thoſe Juices to run, to be variouſly agitated and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, to concoct and prepare them, that they may ſerve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral parts, for Matter to nouriſh the Wood, Pith, and Bark, and to produce
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64939:59"/>
Leaves, Flowers, and Fruits.</p>
                     <p>The Viciſſitude of Day and Night, of Winds warm and cold, dry and moiſt, contributeth much to cauſe the Juice, which from the Root of the Plant hath paſſed into the Bark, to be attenuated, to run with more force, to jelly and fix, and to run afreſh: As the viciſſitude of the Seaſons of the Year maketh, that this Juice runs more plenteouſly ſometimes to the Body and Branches, and ſometimes towards the Roots.</p>
                     <p>When this Juice is too copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it relaxeth the texture of the Fibres of Plants, and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates their natural Heat, which depends upon the quantity of the firſt Element, agitating that Juice, whoſe force ceaſeth, aſſoon as the Interſtices of the Fibres do conſiderably change their natural ſtate.</p>

If this Juice be in too ſmall a quantity, the Plant is dried up little by little; but if it be too copious, or if the ſhapes of its parts are very different from thoſe of the Pores of the Plant, it ſpoyles and deſtroyes the woof of the fibres in the Bark of the Roots, or maketh it degenerate into another Plant, eſpecially in its firſt riſe, by changing this ſame texture, and thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it fit to receive the Juice, by which that Plant is nouriſh'd, into which 'tis made to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Whence it is, that certain Seeds are infallibly corrupted, when they are caſt into certain Earths; and that others degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in them; as Wheat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produces Tares, or Barley, or Oats.</p>
                     <p>It is not at all neceſſary, that there ſhould be a <hi>Soul</hi> in Plants,

to cauſe the Juice, which ſerveth them for nouriſhment, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into all the parts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them, and to form Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Fruits; no more than there needs a Soul, to make Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors riſe to a conſiderable height in filtration, or in a little Tube of Glaſs, againſt their own weight, &amp; variouſly to fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves according to the diverſity of their parts, and of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels through which they run. Plants have their life potentially, or in the firſt act, as the Schools ſpeak, by the ſole contrivance and ſtructure of their parts; but they live actually when the Juice runs through their Pores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

For, they not being fixed to the Earth, as Plants are, to draw thence their nouriſhment, it was requiſite, that they ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to move to and fro, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their neceſſary food, and that they ſhould be compoſed ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially,

that the little particles, which exhale out of Bodies, or the Light which reſults thence, ſtriking certain Organs, might be able to determine them to purſue after that, which ſhould be convenient for them, &amp; to flee from, or to repel that, which ſhould be noxious to them.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as moſt of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that are obſerv'd in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, are accompanied in us with ſome knowledge, it hath been believed, that there was in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals a principle of knowledge, which is called the <hi>Senſitive Soul,</hi> that produced them; without conſidering, that the ſame Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are very often made in us without our Soul's contributing any thing to them, ſeeing ſhe doth not think on them, and that at times they are made againſt her will. And thoſe can hardly

diſabuſe themſelves, who do not know, <hi>that</hi> God hath put motion into Matter in general, <hi>that</hi> he hath contriv'd the Bodies of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals after a certain way, and that he hath eſtabliſh'd certain Rules of Motion. But thoſe, that have this knowledge, obſerving that they ſee nothing but Motion in brute Animals, they find the true cauſe of it in the general ſtate of the world, and the determination in the particular ſtructure of the the Body of Brutes, and they know by the Laws of the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks the neceſſity there is, it ſhould be done in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>What concerns the Nutrition of Animals; the Food, they have ſwallow'd, is digeſted and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Chyle in the Stomach by a gentle fermentation, which is wrought by the mixture made of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64939:62"/>
the Aliments, and Spittle, and the acid Juice, which is diſtill d into the Stomach, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the precedent Food. There is alſo made in the ſmall Inteſtines another fermentation, by the means of the Gall, and the Pancreatique Juice, which maketh the Chyle more fluid, and cauſeth the good to be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeparable from what is uſeleſs and groſs.</p>
                     <p>The Chyle is changed into Bloud in the Heart by a ſpecial fermentation, which is there made by the means of a Fire that ſhineth not, and of the ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bloud, which remains in the Heart; to which the mixture of the <hi>Lympha</hi> contributeth not a little, which comes from above, and that of the Gall, which comes from beneath, together with the Bloud, which is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64939:63"/>
by the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> into the right Ventricle of the Heart. The Ears of the Heart, (two Muſcles of an admirable ſtructure, which ſhews their uſe) do propel the Bloud in the Ventricles of the Heart, when this relaxeth or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth; and the Heart, cloſing it ſelf after the Bloud is ratified and fermented, thruſts it towards all the parts of the Body by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries (which then make the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called the <hi>Pulſe)</hi> for Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But what ſticks not to the parts, is carried from the Lungs to the Heart by the <hi>Venal Artery,</hi> and from the reſt of the Body by the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The moſt ſpirituous part of the Bloud is carried to the Brain, where the Spirits are ſeparated from it to ſerve for the functions, call'd <hi>Animal;</hi> whence flowing into the Nerves that paſs to the

Hence it is, that the impreſſions of the Objects can be tranſmitted into the Brain, and there change the diſpoſition of the extremities of the Nerves, that are diſtributed in certain Muſcles, and determine the Spirits to flow there, to make them ſwell, and to move the Members, to which theſe Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are fixed.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe there may be an infinite variety in the Impreſſions, made by the Objects upon the Senſes, there may alſo be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable variety in the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Spirits to flow into the Muſcles, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence an infinite variety in the Motions of Animals; and that the more, becauſe there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er variety of parts, and more

                     <p>There are five outward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and they all receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Objects by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or immediate contact.

                     <p>The <hi>Hearing</hi> hath for its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſmall Nerves, which end in the extremities of that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, we call the <hi>Tympanum</hi> or Drum.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There are three inward par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Senſes; that of <hi>Thirst,</hi> which hath its Seat in the Throat; that of <hi>Hunger,</hi> in the Stomach; that of the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> in the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The Senſe, called the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, hath its Seat in the Brain; and becauſe the Animal
