            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Addreſs at firſt may ſeem an Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Strain, but upon farther peruſal it will

of Age, in his Church, in her Favour gives

During His (or Her) Minority, <hi>Satan</hi>

But theſe Expiring, All the Kingdoms of the World Devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <pb facs="tcp:61150:3"/>
The Old <hi>Cedar</hi> and <hi>Vine</hi> being thus Lopt, the immediate

            <p>GOD having promiſed to make all things New,
is now performing of it: <hi>Empire</hi> and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi>
have finiſhed their Voyage, and are now
about to return from whence they firſt ſet out.
You have many things of great moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
You, but that of <hi>Time</hi> juſtly challenges a place amongſt
the firſt. The Sands of a New <hi>Aera</hi> are now running, the
laſt Glaſs of Time being turned: Empire has made us a
Viſit, and will ſtay ſome Time with us, and we ſhall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
out <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> to other Nations. We have long gone
by a corrupt Reckoning, but <hi>all things are to become New;
Time</hi> and our <hi>Coin</hi> ſeem to be joynt Petitioners and beg to
be Regulated together, that one may give Teſtimony to
the other? The Regulation is not only very Honourable
and Profitable, but very Feaſible; The <hi>Royal Society</hi> would
quickly perform it; And when is it more ſuitable, than
when a New Empire Commences? This Noble Work
would perpetuate your Memory <hi>till Time ſhould be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
It would alſo be very Profitable, for there might be
put what Price on the <hi>New Ephemeris</hi> You pleaſed; and
<pb facs="tcp:61150:4"/>
every Family throughout the Kingdom being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to take one, a vaſt Sum would be raiſed for the Kings
Uſe. To ſay it would be very Troubleſome, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
an Old Houſe was never pull'd down without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and duſt: When things are made New, and the Houſe
new Built, all the labour and trouble is compenſated. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
thought it worth his while to Correct it, and he took
not his Aim amiſs, for it has been a Faithful Regiſter of his
Fame: I could wiſh the King a Partner in the ſame Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
But whether the preſent Conjuncture will admit
of it or no, I can aſſure you it will not be long before it be
done: For there is a New <hi>Calendar</hi> Commenced in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
Chriſts Reign is actually Commenced. The Head
of the Image was in the Eaſt, the Feet are in the Weſt;
and <hi>Here</hi> the Stone firſt falls upon them; and this is the
Reaſon of all our preſent Confuſions; which will continue
till all the old Building is pulled down. <hi>Satan</hi> put his Metal
four times in the Fire, and 'tis yet but a Lump of Droſs: But
now the Son of God takes the work in hand, and has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

            <p>THe Four Monarchies are but a Copy of the Four Elements, and all th
Models of Power and Policy hitherto uſed, are no other but Tranſcript
of the Divine Operations in the firſt Creation; They anſwer one another
at Face does Face in a Glaſs: For as then the <hi>WORD</hi> by a <hi>Fiat</hi> ſpake the Four
Diſagreeing Elements into that Beauty and Order we ſee them in: So Now, the
ſame <hi>WORD</hi> (His Name is called <hi>The WORD OF GOD</hi>) comes to ſpeak
the <hi>Ataxy</hi> or Irregularities of the Four Monarchies into ſuch an Harmonious Frame
and Model that may Eccho to Nature, and keep time, as it were, with her, in all
her Divine and moſt Excellent Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>The Four preceding Monarchies were rather <hi>Heaps</hi> than <hi>Buildings:</hi> Men piling
up <hi>mollia cum duris, ſine pondere, habentia pondus;</hi> Things of a differing
nature together, ſo that nothing leſs could be expected than their downfal; the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilarity
and Diſproportion of parts, to ſuch a degree corroding and fretting the
whole ſubſtance, as at laſt to undermine the Foundation, and to tumble down the
whole Frame. But in this Monarchy or Conſiſtency, Bone comes to its Bone, and
Fleſh to its Fleſh, and all the Similar parts will be fitted and joyned together in ſuch a
due and wiſe Symmetry, that the Building will be as laſting as Nature her ſelf, of
which indeed it is but a Copy.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the Way, the Truth, and the Life; He is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The Son or
<hi>Word</hi> of God, the Right Reaſon and Beauty of the Creation: But Satan is the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Father of Lies, the Grand Patron of Injuſtice and Violence, the
Chief Author of Confuſion and Irregularity: Theſe two have been at continual
Was ſince the Creation: But at laſt the <hi>VVord</hi> gets the Victory, and the laſt
Battel introduces the quiet and peaceable Reign of the <hi>Millennium:</hi> The <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>
Commences before, <hi>viz.</hi> At the Expiration of the Whores Leaſe, when all
the Kingdoms of the World devolve on Chriſt; but there is no Quietneſs to the
State, though there is to his Church, till after the <hi>Great Battel;</hi> And Chriſt, as
all the other Monarchs have done, muſt Conquer the World before he can Enjoy it:
He finds it over-run with wild Beaſts, and his Flocks cannot feed quietly till He has
expelled them; He tells the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers He is Heir, but They reject and deſpiſe his
Title; They reſolve to continue on the Premiſes till They be thruſt off. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prepares for War: But after a clear differing manner from all the other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nths:
For <hi>They</hi> made War in <hi>Wickedneſs, He</hi> in <hi>Righteouſneſs; They</hi>
ſubdue it by Fire and Sword, <hi>He</hi> only by his Word: <hi>Their</hi> Followers were cloathed
in Steel, and had their Swords in thier <hi>Hands;</hi> but <hi>His</hi> only in Fine Linnen, with
their Swords in their <hi>Mouths; They</hi> Ride on <hi>Red</hi> Bloody Horſes; <hi>He</hi> and His
Followers on <hi>White</hi> ones: His whole <hi>Equipage</hi> ſufficiently declares what a ſort of
<pb facs="tcp:61150:5"/>
               <hi>War</hi> He deſigns to make, in all the Circumſtances thereof Intirely differing from
the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Satan</hi> thought himſelf of Ability to Rule in Gods Throne, but he has ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcovered his Inability; for he neither knew aright how to make Peace or War,
how to pull down, or build up. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> will inſtruct the World in better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.
The Text ſaith, <hi>In Righteouſneſs he doth Judge</hi> (miniſter Peace) <hi>and
make War:</hi> He uſes not his <hi>Power,</hi> but his <hi>Spirit;</hi> not his <hi>Sword,</hi> but his
<hi>Word:</hi> And by <hi>This</hi> way He ſubdues the World, and tumbles down <hi>Satan</hi> from
his Seat like Lightning, who by his ill Conduct had ſo miſerably ſcorch'd the
Earth.</p>
            <p>His way of Fighting is only Preaching, as the Sword in his Mouth doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonſtrate. He deſigns to reſtore his Goſpel by an Army of Predicators,
Cloathed in the white Linnen of an holy Life. By theſe he ferments and levens the
whole Earth, and pulls down all the Conſtitutions thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Millennium</hi> is the Manhood of the World, and all the preceding Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are but the Toſſings and Tumblings of Childhood and Youth. Chriſt alſo
being Adult, or come to his full Stature in his Body the Church, comes to claim the
Government thereof. But this State is rather an Hierarchy than a Monarchy;
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Bride</hi> through the whole Context being put in oppoſition to <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
and the <hi>Whore:</hi> And the Text ſaith, <hi>They ſhall reign as Prieſts,</hi> which
agrees very well with what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That his Kingdom was not of this
VVorld.</hi> And when thie Rough Work is over, She is to be Empreſs of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
and the <hi>Kings of the Earth are to bring their Glory and Honour into
her:</hi> As in the preceeding Monarchies They trampled upon her, caſting Dirt in her
Face, now they are her humble Servants, and bow down before her; and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

dependance on Him for their Titles and Soveraignties; He Giving and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Kingdoms of this World to whomſoever He pleaſes: And beſure He
will give no Power to thoſe that Affront her. And though there is no mention made of
any Kings Reigning with Chriſt during the <hi>Millennium,</hi> only the Saints; yet
without all doubt there is a Series of Good Kings running through the whole; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there would be none to bring their Glory into it. But this is certain, that good
and holy Men, the Members of the True Regenerate Church, have the greateſt
Title to the Priviledges of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> becauſe they are ſet in the Front of it,
and are ſaid to reign with Chriſt; and all other Powers are to hold their Empire
from the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Chief,</hi> as the Soveraign Spouſe. Since Empire has been ſo
fruitful in its firſt Voyage, we cannot ſuppoſe it abſolutely barren in the Second: But
its <hi>Children</hi> will be more Manſuete in their <hi>Return,</hi> participating of the Common
<hi>Renewed Nature,</hi> and ſo exerciſe their Power to the ſervice and good of Chriſt's

but in a Civil; for the Witneſſes were never <hi>In</hi> their Grave
and therefore cannot Riſe <hi>Out</hi> of them: This is a Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61150:6"/>
Demonſtration, if I can prove theſe <hi>Souls,</hi> &amp;c. to be the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi>
which from the preceding parts of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demonſtrated they are. This, <hi>The Souls,</hi> &amp;c. is nothing but
a long complex Name for a complex Body, <hi>viz.</hi> The New-Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Witneſſes, or Church Regenerate: They are the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Body of the <hi>Numerus Sigillatus,</hi> in Chap 7. who running
as it were under ground for 1260 miles, riſe up again in Chap.
14. and <hi>ſtand upon Mount Sion, having their Fathers Name written
in their Forehead,</hi> ſo are called <hi>Numerus Conſcriptus.</hi> And what
is this Name of their Father, but the diſtinct Character of their
Sufferings, which in their paſſage they underwent through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Age? This Name is the Characteriſtick by which they may
be known to be the true Heirs of the Promiſes; And therefore
being now concerted into a New Body, they bear them in their
Forehead, to ſhew their Legitimacy. Satan being overcome in
a <hi>Great Battel,</hi> who had uſurped upon their Rights, and palmed
upon the World a <hi>Whoriſh Church</hi> for many Ages, The Whore
being turned out of the Premiſes, the true Heireſs comes to
claim her Right; And that ſhe may be known to be the true
Heireſs, ſhe puts on her Mothers Clothes: But putting on her
Mothers Apparel, makes only an accidental, and not a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
alteration; there's no ſuch Virtue in theſe Garments as to
tranſubſtantiate the Daughter into the Mother. 'Tis our great
miſtake therefore to ſuppoſe theſe to be the Old Witneſſes riſen
from the Dead, in a literal ſence; they are only the New-riſen
Witneſſes wearing the Livery of the Old; and to ſhew that
they are their Legitimate Off-ſpring, they bear the true Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of their Sufferings in their Foreheads, which they have
ſuffered under the Uſurpation of the Whore in every Age ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively.
And theſe Marks confirm and ratifie their Claim,
and give then a <hi>Paſſo-porto</hi> to enter into the <hi>Millennium,</hi> which
is the promiſed Land of the Chriſtians. The Witneſſes before
ſtood in naked and unfiniſh'd Lines, in <hi>Chiar-oſcuro,</hi> as the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
call it: But here they receive their finiſhing Strokes, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61150:6"/>
ſtand all in their proper Colours, ranged in order ſucceſſively in
every Age, during the whole time of Satans Uſurpation, who
after his Firſt great Defeat in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Time, <hi>Lived Again,</hi>
and crept into Heaven in the Livery of the Church, transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf from a dark Angel into an Angel of Light.</p>
            <p>If what I have wrote be conſidered narrowly, 'twill be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
altogether as reaſonable to expect that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,
Reuben, Simeon, Levi,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould all riſe out of their Graves,
and return with their Succeſſors, the preſent ſurviving Jews,
into their own Countrey, as that the ſuffering Saints in all Ages
ſhould riſe out of their Graves, and reign Perſonally with Chriſt
in the <hi>Millennium.</hi> When we give perſons or things Names,
the Name is uſually adapted to the quality of the perſon or thing
denominated: So here, the Old Church being brought to Bed
of the New-riſen Witneſſes, they are baptized with a Name
which has reſpect to the Quality of their ſuffering Natures.
When the preſent Jews go into the promiſed Land, <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Reuben, Simeon, Levi,</hi> &amp;c. may be ſaid to go into
it, becauſe <hi>They</hi> go into it, who are their true and legitimate Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſping:
So if the true legitimate Off-ſpring of the Old Church,
the old ſuffering Saints or Witneſſes, enter into and enjoy the
Priviledges of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> they themſelves may be truly ſaid
to enter and enjoy it. <hi>The Souls,</hi> &amp;c. are but Patriarchal Names
of the Chriſtian ſuffering Tribes, and <hi>their Names in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi>
diſtinguiſhes them from the common Maſs, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
them into a Body or Nation; which Sealed Nation have
ſuffered as much amongſt the Gentiles, nay more, than the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews; and are and have been as much diſperſed
throughout the whole Gentile Body. Theſe are the Sheep of
another Fold, and tho' their Genealogies be not kept ſo ſtrict as
the Jews on Earth, ſo as to make them a diſtinct Nation, yet
'tis better and more exactly kept in Heaven, where their Names
are as well written, as the Name of their Fathers on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
here on Earth; And they may have as great Aſſurance of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61150:7"/>
entering and enjoying the Priviledges of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> tho' at
preſent ſcattered through the Gentile Body, as the more diſtinct
Body of Jews, of entering into the promiſed Land; For their
Covenant is ſure, having this Seal, <hi>The Lord knows who are his.</hi>
And when he makes up his Jewels, he gives a Copy, as it were,
of their Genealogies to the Angels, who going through the four
parts of the Earth, look for the Seal of their Sufferings in their
Forehead, and ſo pick up two of a Tribe, and one of a Family,
the whole making the Regenerate Church, or ſealed Nation;
which ſealed Nation enjoying the Priviledges of the <hi>Millennium,</hi>
as the true and legitimate Off-ſpring of the old ſuffering Church,
The old ſuffering Church, or Witneſſes themſelves, may truly
be ſaid to enjoy them, they enjoying them in their true Off-ſpring;
As well as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. may be ſaid to
go home to their own Countrey, their preſent ſurviving Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
and true Off-ſpring entering into the ſame. And tho' the
Text ſaith <hi>They,</hi> yet this word <hi>They,</hi> imports no more than St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>We,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>WE ſhall not all dye, but ſhall all be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
&amp;c. 'Tis plain that by <hi>We,</hi> he neither means himſelf, nor
thoſe he wrote to, but the Saints of the ſame Piece or Body, which
ſhould be alive at the time of the general Judgment. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
is eaſie. And tho' I could ſay much more, in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Head, in relation to the Conſequences, and many
Abſurdities, which would ariſe from a literal Reſurrection, yet
I will forbear, thinking what I have ſaid to be enough to convince
any reaſonable Man.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be enquired into, is the <hi>Nature of Chriſts
Reign,</hi> which I deny to be Perſonal, ſince he ſaid, when he was
leaving the World, <hi>And lo I am with you always to the end of the
World;</hi> which is plain and manifeſt muſt be meant in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi>
manner; that we ſhould have his influential, miniſterial, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
preſence, but not his perſonal. And in the end of the
<hi>Revelations, The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come;</hi> that is, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
all to drink of the Waters, in alluſion to the Prophet of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61150:7"/>
old; this plainly indicates that <hi>They</hi> were only in being at that
time; for had the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> been come, without all doubt he
would have invited the Gueſts himſelf, and not the <hi>Bride.</hi> 'Tis
plain He was come only in Spirit, but not in Perſon; for both
before and after this, in the ſame Chapter, he ſaith, <hi>Lo I come
quickly;</hi> which would never have been ſaid, had he been come
already: And all this muſt be underſtood at the near expiring
of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate, according to the common Rule of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
That he was come by his Spirit influencing the Bride
in the whole Conduct of her Adminiſtration, is very plain, ſince
the Text joyns the Spirit and Bride together, ſaying, <hi>The Spirit
and the Bride ſay, Come;</hi> but that he was perſonally come, there
is not the leaſt appearance at all. Further, It being plainly
proved that the Saints riſe not literally, His <hi>Coming</hi> and Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
muſt be of a piece with <hi>their Riſing,</hi> and therefore not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
His Coming muſt certainly be after a ſpiritual manner, as
is plainly hinted in that Text, <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified
is the Spirit:</hi> Which Spirit will firſt be poured out on his New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen
Witneſſes, or Church Regenerate, being his Body in the
Scripture phraſe.</p>
            <p>But to look a little farther into the Nature of Chriſts Reign,
I muſt, with ſubmiſſion, look firſt into the Nature of <hi>Satan's
Reign,</hi> who from the beginning of the Creation has uſurped
upon his Rights, and been his great Antagoniſt. Now I find
Satan got into his Temple, and ſat in, and defiled his Throne,
That is, in the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man; for 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Prince of this
World rules</hi> IN THE HEARTS <hi>of the Children of Diſobedience.</hi>
Now Chriſt comes and throws him out of his Throne and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and takes poſſeſſion of Mans Heart, influencing all his
Words, Thoughts and Actions, bringing every Thought into
captivity and to his obedience: And where ſhould the Remedy
come, but where the Diſeaſe is? Any Outward Application
would be like bruſhing a Mans Clothes to cure him of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
the Plaiſter ought to be where the Sore is. The Wiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61150:8"/>
Man ſaith, <hi>Out of the Heart proceed the Iſſues of Life:</hi> And a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
than <hi>Solomon</hi> told the Phariſees, That <hi>all Defilements proceeded
from within:</hi> The Inward Powers being purified and ſet to rights,
the Outward Powers fall in of courſe, and ſo the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
quickly recovers its Native Beauty: Therefore the firſt Act
of Soveraignty which Chriſt will exerciſe, will be to purifie the
Heart; there he begins his Reign of the <hi>Millennium.</hi> If he
ſhould come in Perſon, and be in the Air, accompanied with an
innumerable Company of Saints and Angels, as ſome imagine,
Alas, what would this ſight do? It would ſurprize us, and we
ſhould gape for a little while; but it would quickly wear off, for
we have the glorious Body of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and all
the Beauty of the Creation <hi>without us,</hi> but they have but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
over us; one ſmall Ray of God in the Heart, is more
than all the Outward Aypearances whatſoever. Satan therefore
being a cunning Adverſary, when he came to conquer the World,
obſerved the Heart to be the chief Poſt, and made his firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
upon it; and having conquered it, and placed his Black
Guards there, he quickly became Maſter of the whole World.
But Chriſt comes to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, to heal
where he has wounded, and to build up what he has pulled
down, and to raiſe the Creation out of that confuſion in which
Satan by a long Miſ-rule has put it: The firſt Act therefore of
his Reign, is to regain the Heart, and that being ſecured, all the
reſt come into due ſubjection. And this conſideration brings me
to my Text.</p>
            <p>There has been a continual War fince the Creation, berwixt
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Satan;</hi> but in this Book particular mention is made of
<hi>Three Great Battels,</hi> (if the laſt may be called one.) In the firſt
<hi>Satan</hi> is thrown out of Heaven, in the ſecond he is thrown out of
Heaven. Earth, taken Priſoner, and bound; and in the laſt he is
thrown into Hell: But this laſt is not ſo much a Battel, as a
Siege or Aſſault; <hi>Satan,</hi> in alluſion to <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> ſending ſome of
his Captains of Fifty to attack the Saints Camp, and Fire comes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61150:8"/>
own from Heaven, and deſtroys them all. At the <hi>Firſt</hi> Battel,
(or at leaſt at the Muſtering and Raiſing his Soldiers) Chriſt was

Chriſt's Wars are always of a two-fold Nature, by the
<hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sword;</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> firſt proclaims them, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires

the <hi>Word</hi> gets upon the white Horſe, and proclaims the War,
raiſing an Army of white-Linnen-Followers, which are his <hi>own
Peculiar Army;</hi> And theſe are nothing elſe but Preachers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
a New Diſpenſation, as is ſelf-evident by their <hi>Swords</hi>

are dipt in Blood, 'tis of the wicked Soldier's, and not of
he own drawing: Theſe I ſay march at firſt in the Van, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the War, and bid Defiance, and then draw off into the
Bear; then comes up the <hi>Sword</hi> or Lieutenant, or the Angel in

comes up the Word in the Rear, and compleats the Victory,
Preſelyting the reſt of the World by Preaching: for the Text

and is the Great Executioner; He levels the Mountains, and
forces open the City Gates, that the King of Glory may come
in; the <hi>VVord</hi> is nothing but the Word Preached (and not a

for a Thouſand Years: So <hi>All the World become the Kingdoms of the
ord and his Chriſt; who is King of Kings and Lord of Lords:</hi> The
whole Earth is his now, as well by Conqueſt, as by Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
all the Inhabitants of the Earth become his Vaſſals,
and lie Civilly dead before him.</p>
            <p>The whole Race of Mankind are All concluded under <hi>Death;</hi>
their Power and Dominion which is their Life, not only devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on him as of Right (the Uſurper being Expulſed) but alſo
by Conqueſt, by force being taken from them: Now the firſt
thing this Mighty Conqueror doth (as is the cuſtom of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors)
He has a reſpect to his own Truſty Followers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,

are plain words, as Truth always requires, and I hope eaſily to

words are not ſo much to be conſulted, as Perſpecuity: When
the Thouſand Years are ended, the Wicked Satannical defeated

This is the Firſt Reſurrection: 'Tis as plain as the Sun in the

that they will aſſiſt the Church in all her Adminiſtrations; and

the Church being free'd and delivered from the <hi>firſt,</hi>
this Deliverance may very well be called, <hi>The Firſt Reſurrection;</hi>
the Firſt Death, is Perſecution, Deprivation of Power, and

to be a ſharer in this Firſt Reſurrection, or to be admitted as a
Member into the Church Regenerate, on him the Second Death
ſhall have no power; that is, the Grave ſhall have no power

it may be underſtood in a Literal Sence, for whoever are

            <p>Now ſhould we enquire, How this Life of Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
now in Chriſts Poſſeſſion, ſhall be Shared? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are plain; the Text ſaith, <hi>And thou, O Tower of the Flock,
to Thee it ſhall come, even the firſt Dominion; the Kingdom ſhall come
to the Daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem: The reſt of the Flock, or other
Chriſtian Nations, ſhall have Siſter like ſhares; but She as the
<hi>Heireſs,</hi> and Eldeſt Daughter, ſhall have the firſt Dominion: But
it muſt not be forgot to be obſerved, That the Priviledges of
the <hi>Millennium,</hi> are rather Prieſtly than Kingly; and belong
more to the Bride, or the Church, then the State: for the Text
ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be Prieſts of God and of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, <hi>A Royal Prieſthood, a Peculiar People, Zealous of good
Works;</hi> and 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſhall bring their Glory
and Honour into the New Jeruſalem;</hi> of whoſe particular way
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61150:11"/>
and method of Adminiſtration, I could be very large, but this
ſheet will not give me leave: As to ſingle perſons, if they
would have any ſhare in this Life or Dominion of the <hi>Millennium,</hi>
they muſt get themſelves cloathed in the <hi>White Linnen of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi>
for the Text ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed and Holy are they that have part
in this Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. And as for Nations, They muſt firſt
help to kill the Bear, and then they may ſhare the Skin of his
<hi>Power:</hi> and ſure I am, at this moment the Ten Kings are juſt
in a readineſs to fall upon the Whore, to eat her fleſh, and burn
her with fire: the ſignal from Heaven is juſt ready to be given
them: <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome would willingly know, When the <hi>Millennium</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences:
I'll therefore tell them, It will begin with a <hi>Septenary-Day</hi>
of Years, <hi>known to the Lord</hi> (and to him that he ſhall reveag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it)
<hi>in which it ſhall be neither Day nor Night: but in the Evenin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
ſhall be Light:</hi> This <hi>Septenary-Day</hi> is betwixt <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,</hi>
or betwixt the Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, and the
pouring out of the Spirit from on High, which Inveſts them
with Power, and is the great confirmation of the New
Adminiſtration, or of Chriſts Reign: It <hi>really</hi> Commences at
<hi>Their</hi> Reſurrection; for Chriſt after his Reſurrection, ſaid, <hi>He
had received all Power both in Heaven and in Earth:</hi> but the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Power is not Ratified and Sealed till the <hi>Septenary Day</hi> is
ended, and that is at Pentecoſt, when the whole World will be
fully ſatisfied, and ſer to their ſeal that God is True: An Infant
for the firſt week, is in a ſtate betwixt Life and Death, as it were,
almoſt as much Vegetative as Animal; and that is the reaſon of
this dark day mentioned by the Prophet; for the Body and Life
of Chriſt, is the grand pattern of all things, both in Heaven and
in Earth; the Regenerate Church, or New Reſen Witneſſes,
are his Body, and they muſt be conformable to the Head:
whatever circumſtances attended the <hi>Single Birth</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
will of neceſſity attend the <hi>Complex Birth,</hi> or New Riſen Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
(<hi>Inter Iberos</hi>) in the <hi>VVeſt;</hi> this I could make out in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61150:11"/>
eaſt minute manner, but is not ſo much my preſent buſineſs:
further confirmation of this dark <hi>Septenary Day,</hi> is the Cutting
own the Tree of Monarchy; <hi>ſeven times</hi> paſſed over <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>er</hi>
before he would acknowledge (Lew is <hi>guarda ti</hi>) that the
God of Heaven was the only Soveraign Monarch, and diſpoſes
the Kingdoms of this World to whom he pleaſes: All this time,
Monarchy was as a Beaſt in its Infantile State, rather Animal
than Rational; during this <hi>Septenary Day,</hi> there are bands of Iron
and Braſs upon the Stumps of the Monarchical Tree, that it ſhall
not grow; the ſeed is ſome time hid in the ground before the
blade comes up: and theſe are the true reaſons of the Darkneſs
of our preſent day: <hi>But in the Evening it ſhall be Light:</hi> That is,
Men may think, that the Corn being hid, is dead; and that the
Tree of Monarchy being cut down, will not ſprout again; but
when they ſee the Blade Riſe up, and the Branches ſprout out,
they are then of another mind; this enlightens them and makes
them acknowledge, that this Darkneſs was only the common
effect of Nature, which conceives her Children in the dark; the
operations of the Womb, are always in the dark.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ask, Why ſhould Monarchy Expire in the
<hi>VVeſt,</hi> and there have a new Commencement, more than in any
other place? This is eaſily Anſwered; Empire is Fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
with the Sun, and muſt return with him; The whole
Earth ſeems to have as great a right and title to <hi>Power,</hi> as it has
to <hi>Light;</hi> The Sun never ſtops till it comes to the <hi>VVeſt,</hi> and
Empire accompanies him in all his Courſe: The <hi>Punicks,</hi> the
Sons of <hi>Cham,</hi> put in a Caveat, and would have ſtopp'd this
Traveller, inviting him to have lodg'd in <hi>Africa;</hi> but they might
as well have ſtopp'd the Sun, their Fathers Prophecy and Curſe
putting in a Bar, condemning them to perpetual Servility. The
Goſpel was publiſhed in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and is to be reſtored in the
<hi>VVeſt;</hi> otherwiſe the Sun goes down at Noon: There is to be
a <hi>Repaſſage,</hi> or Return, both of Empire and the Goſpel; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome Refreſhments, they will ſet out very gloriouſly, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61150:12"/>
will alſo have other Companions of a Royal Family, <hi>The Kings
of the Eaſt,</hi> I mean, who are to go back with them;The Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Gentiles being come, they are to return home: For
They both together, the Sheep of Both Folds, the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Twelve Tribes, will be concerned in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the pouring out of the Spirit at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> will be the
Sign for them to return, for this took their Power away in the
Eaſt, and was the Sign of Diſperſion, and it will give it them
again in the Weſt, and be the Sign of their Reverſion (and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
too.) The Blood reverts not till it comes to the <hi>Toes,</hi> and
the Stone fell on the <hi>Feet</hi> of the Image, and ſo goes on regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breaking to pieces all before it: When there is to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Renovation, the Extream Parts are the moſt proper to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in. But it may eaſily be diſcovered through the whole Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of <hi>this</hi> World, God in all his Methods has a reſpect to
<hi>Nature,</hi> which like himſelf is moſt perfect in all her Operations.
Now <hi>Nature</hi> circulates, the Light and the Blood circulates, and
ſo ought Empire and the Goſpel: So following Nature, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Err, and therefore do poſitively conclude that Empire and
the Goſpel will ſet, be cut down, and be dead as it were, and then
riſe again in the Weſt And whatſoever things were acted in
the Eaſt at the <hi>Publication</hi> of the Goſpel at the <hi>Natural Birth,</hi> are
to be re-acted in the Weſt at the <hi>Reſtoration of it</hi> at the <hi>Spiritual
Birth,</hi> the Birth of the Church Regenerate, or New-riſen Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
becauſe there ought to be a due Analogy betwixt the
Head and the Body. The Birth of the Infant-Church occaſions
one Day to be neither clear nor dark, but a ſort of <hi>Crepuſculum;</hi>
But the Evening of this Septenary Day is approaching, and the
Light ſhall break forth abundantly. I have in ſome private Letters
to Friends, prov'd from unconteſtable Arguments raiſed from the
true and genuine nature of Death and Reſurrection, That the
Witneſſes are already riſen, and that the whole World have
been miſtaken in the Nature and Quality of this great Truth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61150:12"/>
which I am able to make good againſt all the Learning in the

               </gap>niverſe, and deſign to do it in a little time publickly.</p>
            <p>I have little more to ſay as to the Subject of the <hi>Millennium</hi> at

be taken from them, <hi>all Power and Dominion belonging to Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> He that has Wiſdom, let him calculate: Eight Days
make up the Day of Circumciſion, but Seven Days of Weeks
betwixt the <hi>Paſcha</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have writ on this Subject is ſuited and adapted to the
economy of <hi>This</hi> World; and whoever calculates Prophecies,
if they do not firſt ſtate and calculate the Nature of <hi>This</hi> World,
and fit one to the other, they do but reckon without their Hoſt.
God takes particular care to ſuit all his Changes and Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the State of <hi>This</hi> World: And a literal Reſurrection
hears too many Abſurdities in the Front, to be conſiſtent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
Many have been the Miſtakes of Men about the <hi>Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eium;</hi>
And at preſent the ſubject lies under ſuch prejudices, that
it the very ſound of the Name, Men ſhrug up their Shoulders,
and throw it aſide, ſaying with the old Monks, <hi>Graecum eſt non
pareſt legi:</hi> But this is unmanly, and diſcovers their Ignorance,
Sloth, or Vice, more than any thing elſe: Men are unwilling to
vex themſelves by looking into a Doctrine which will turn the
World upſide down, and untwiſt all the Conſtitutions upon
Earth: This is a diſmal proſpect to thoſe that are at eaſe in their
Poſſeſſions, and had rather things ſhould run on in the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Account, than to have a New and Juſt Reckoning: But
ſince theſe things muſt of neceſſity come to paſs, (<hi>for Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
are not Poets Fables</hi>) they may as well fend off the Blow by
a due Proviſion, as to encreaſe their Misery by an unexpected
ſtroke. The Ark is open, and they may enter in if they pleaſe,
and prevent being deſtroyed by the Deluge. This Prophecy
now no more remains a ſealed Book; God has opened a door,
and no man ſhall ſhut it: This Myſtery which has been hid
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61150:13"/>
from Ages, is no more a Myſtery, being now clearly revealed;
and ſo it will ſtand to all Generations. <hi>Great and Marvellous are
thy Works, Lord God Almighty; Juſt and True are they Ways, thou
King of Saints: Who ſhall not fear and glorifie they Name, for Thou
only art Holy? All Men ſhall come and worſhip before Thee, for they
Works are made manifest.</hi>

               <head>Of the Death and Reſurrection of the

               <p>THe Death and Reſurrection of the Witneſſes, is a Truth
almoſt of as great Importance as the Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of our Saviour: They being the Counter-part of that
Great Scene: All the Empires in the World are intereſſed in
this Great Truth; 'Tis the Pole-Star by which they ought to
ſteer; and in not obſerving it, they run great hazard of ſplitting
their Veſſels: I therefore take the liberty of addreſſing my
Enquiry into this weighty Affair to our preſent Powers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
which may give them much Light in all their Counſels
and Conſultations. 'Tis well known what Alterations and
Changes the Birth of our Saviour made throughout the World,
how it overthrew all the then-exiſting Powers upon Earth, and
what Method there was uſed to do it: This is but the ſame
thing acted over again, in another part of the World; <hi>That, by
a ſimple Birth;</hi> and <hi>This,</hi> by a <hi>complex Birth:</hi> The ſame Methods
of Conqueſt will be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Nothing but <hi>Predication</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferation.</hi>
And we that live at ſo great a diſtance, for us to have
the <hi>ſame Scenes</hi> renewed, and the <hi>ſame Actions</hi> re-acted amongſt
us, is a ſingular kindneſs from Heaven: Hitherto we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
things upon Credit and Hearſay; But now we our ſelves
ſhall ſee with our Eyes, and hear with our Ears the wonderful
things of God: To have things brought to our own Home, is a
wonderful Condeſcention, for which we cannot be too thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Heaven: And ſince we know on what Rock the Eaſtern
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61150:13"/>
Nations ſplit; This is a Blazing Beacon for us, and we ſhall be
doubly guilty if we ſplit on the ſame. I cannot err in my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
ſo long as I take Chriſt along with me for my Guide:
For <hi>He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> The Grand Pattern of
all things in Heaven and in Earth. Theſe Witneſſes are his
Body, which ought to be conformable to their Head in all things.
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Now Chriſt is a Man, and to fulfil all
Righteouſneſs, He ought to be born again: But our <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s
will ſay, How can that be? He is in Heaven, and cannot enter
a ſecond time into the Womb of <hi>Mary:</hi> 'Tis true; but He has
a Body here below, his Church, which is himſelf; and this
may be renewed or born again, and ought to be ſo, before it
can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, or the <hi>Millennium,</hi> which
is a Shadow of it. We are to come from ſtrength to ſtrength,
from an imperfect Diſpenſation to a more perfect, until we come
to God in <hi>Zion.</hi> Chriſt Racks off his Truth from Veſſel to Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
till it be perfect Spirits, till Man becomes an Angel, whoſe
place he is to ſupply. Now what reaſon his Church has to be
purified and made clean, is plain; The Sun is coming to the
Tropick, her Lord is to make her a Viſit; and ſhe is but in a
filthy pickle to recive Him: In her long Voyage from the Eaſt,
ſhe has contracted a great many Pollutions, paſſing through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
polluted Cities and Countreys, over-whelmed with Superſtion
and Idolatry. There is the greateſt reaſon imaginable that ſhe
ſhould waſh her ſelf in the Waters of Purification, that being
found without Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, her Lord
may take delight to dwell with her.</p>
               <p>In the Scriptures there is mention made of <hi>The Times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
from the preſence oſ the Lord,</hi> and of the <hi>Time of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things;</hi> which can only be meant of an Accidental
Change, and not a Subſtantial, as ſome would have it. The
Times of Reſtitution are Accompliſhed by <hi>Changing all things
chengeable,</hi> by making every thing New, which can be Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61150:14"/>
or in the Scripture-phraſe, by <hi>SHAKING thoſe things which
can be SHAKEN, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAIN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now before I can well proceed further, I ought to divide the
things of this World into Two Claſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Changeable</hi> and
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable;</hi> and this will tell me, not only <hi>When</hi> God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
all things according to his Promiſe, but <hi>How;</hi> For his
Work will of neceſſity fall in the <hi>Changeable Claſs,</hi> as it has done in
every Diſpenſation hitherto. Chriſt in one place is ſaid to come
<hi>with</hi> the Clouds, which may very well be underſtood in the <hi>Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Claſs,</hi> in which all the Thunders and Tempeſts are formed;
But the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable Claſs</hi> is the Firmament, which is to <hi>Remain,</hi>
or not to be moved. And the Inſtruments He will uſe in <hi>changing
all things changeable,</hi> will be the Church Regenerate, or New-Riſen-Witneſſes;
and this by a New Predication, as Soldiers of
the <hi>WORD,</hi> with their Swords in their Mouth; Predication and
Vociferation are the only Artillery the <hi>Lamb</hi> uſes to beat down
the ſtrong holds of Satan. But as to Thoſe Two Claſſes, The
Immutable I divide into <hi>Seven</hi> Heads, and the Mutable into

               </list>
               <p>The World being at full Age, 'tis time it ſhould know its
own Conſtitution. And that the whole Oeconomy thereof is
comprehended under the above Two Claſſes, or Twelve Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
I think none that has had but a little converſe therein,
will deny me. Theſe therefore allowed me for Authentick, I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61150:15"/>
have ſome ground to ſtand upon. And if I can find a Body of
Men upon Earth, which have made theſe <hi>Five</hi> Changes; That
is, Whoſe <hi>Wills</hi> are changed, whoſe <hi>Opinions</hi> are changed; who
have made a ſober change in <hi>Eating, Drinking, Marrying, and Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. and who have made an abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
change in the <hi>Outward From</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
I ſay, If I can find ſuch a Body of Men in the whole
Chriſtian World, who have made all theſe Changes, I am in a
fair way of finding my <hi>New-Riſen-Witneſſes;</hi> for nothing elſe
can be changed. And this will extort a Confeſſion from me,
That God has fulfilled his Promiſes, of <hi>making all things new,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
changed all things that are changeable in this World. And
it makes not much to have things in their Perfection; if they
are truly begun, and ſtand upon <hi>Perfect New Foundations,</hi> 'tis
enough. Good old <hi>Simeon</hi> ſang the <hi>Nunc Dimittis,</hi> when he ſaw
Chriſt only an <hi>Infant:</hi> Men cannot ſuppoſe that things ſhould
receive their Commencement and Perfection all at once. And
the Nature and Progreſs of the Kingdom of Heaven, is all along
to be obſerved in our Enquiry: It ought not to be forgotten,
that 'tis compared to a <hi>Grain of Muſtard ſeed,</hi> to <hi>Leven,</hi> to a <hi>Stone
out of the Mountain,</hi> and to <hi>Waters</hi> that at firſt roſe no farther than
the <hi>Ancles;</hi> By all which the gradual Increaſe and Progreſſion
are plainly intimated. Chriſt, being a ſingle Man, was the <hi>Grain</hi>
of Muſtard-ſeed; He preached the Word, and empowered the
Diſciples, firſt the Twelve, then the Seventy, to preach the
ſame through the Towns and Villages; And in this nature, and
after this manner, His Goſpel by degrees was Publiſhed and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
throughout the World. This is the Pattern, and after
this manner the Goſpel will be Reſtored. One ſingle Man of
the New-Riſen-Witneſſes will firſt begin to Preach, and ſo will
be inſtrumental in Collecting and Raiſing a Body of Men, who
tho' ſimple and ignorant, yet by the Aſſiſtance and Power of the
Spirit of Life from God entering in them, will caſt themſelves
into ſuch an Exquiſite Mold and Conſtitution, that the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61150:15"/>
Polititians in the World ſhall not be able to contrive the
like. That the <hi>New-Riſen-Witneſſes</hi> will make their Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Progreſs into the World after this nature, I think there
is no Man will be ſo diſingenuous as to deny me: becauſe 'tis ſo
like Gods former Method, and becauſe there is a Neceſſity the
Body ſhould be conformable to the Head in all things. And
further, That theſe things ought to be ſo, 'tis unanſwerably
proved by Him <hi>that ſat upon the white Horſe, followed by Armies
cloathed in white Linnen, with their Swords in their Mouth, and
whoſe Name was called, The Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Divinity and Philoſophy in the World can make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe of an Army ſo Equipped, but an Army of New
Preachers ſent forth to Proſelite the World to the Doctrine of
the Reſtoration: To think that any old Model ſhould be pitched
upon for a Pattern, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He would make all things
New,</hi> is a very inconſiderate and ſenſleſs thought: There's no
properer way can poſſibly be contrived, then to Raiſe a New
Body of Men out of the maſs of the Whole, who may Leven the
whole Lump, and may be as a Pattern or Standard Lifted up for
the Reſt to Repair to: Nor is there a more proper way to raiſe
ſuch an Army, than by Beating up for Voluntiers, by a New
Predication: This is that <hi>Righteous Way</hi> that Chriſt has pitched
upon to make War in, in oppoſition to thoſe inadequate and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
ways</hi> of all the preceding Monarchies.</p>
               <p>I will therefore take it for granted that we have ſuch a Body of
Men amongſt us, who have practiſed the ſame Method, and have
<hi>changed all things changeable in this VVorld;</hi> and are a Body perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
New in Temporals and Spirituals, in their vvhole Riſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to the true and genuine Notion of a Reſurrection: And
I knovv not vvhy I may not call them the <hi>New-Riſen-Witneſſes,</hi>
ſince they have ſo fair and juſt a Title thereto. And ſince I have
given them this Title, I ought to deduce it regularly from the <hi>True
Race</hi> of the <hi>Old Ones,</hi> who can only give them a <hi>Juſt</hi> Claim. It
now therefore falls in my way to ſpeak ſomething of <hi>Them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61150:16"/>
                  <hi>By the</hi> Old Witneſſes, <hi>I underſtand, not</hi> Two Men, <hi>or</hi> Two Books
<hi>nor any ſingle</hi> Church <hi>in any particular Nation, but the Body of
true and faithful</hi> Chriſtians <hi>in all</hi> Christian Nations, <hi>bearing their
Teſtimony in all Ages, (during the 1260 Years Apoſtacy) againſt
the Myſtery of Iniquity, and the Uſurpation of the Whore of</hi>
Babylon, <hi>on their true Rights. Now the</hi> Text <hi>ſaith,</hi> When they
ſhall have finiſhed their Testimony, the Beaſt that aſcends out of the
Bottomleſs Pit ſhall make war againſt them, and overcome them, and
kill them, and their Bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreet of the Great City, which
ſpiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where alſo our Lord was crucified:
And they of the People, and Kindred, and Tongues, and Nations, ſhall
ſee their dead Bodies three Days and an half, and ſhall not ſuffer their
dead Bodies to be put in GRAVES: And they that dwell upon the Earth
ſhall rejoyce over them, and ſhall make merry, and ſhall ſend Gifts one
to another, becauſe theſe two Prophets tormented them that dwelt upon
the Earth. And after three Days and an half, the Spirit of life
from God entered into them, and they ſtood upon their Feet, and great
fear fell upon them that ſaw them. And they heard a great voice from
Heaven ſaying, Come up hither: And they aſcended up to Heaven in
a Cloud, and their Enemies beheld them: And the ſame hour there was
a great Earthquake, and the Tenth part of the City fell; and in the
Earthquake were ſlain of Men ſeven Thouſand, and the Remnant were
afrighted, and gave Glory to the God of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now though the Witneſſes are already Riſen; which the
more Judicious may eaſily diſcern, by the Characteriſticks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hinted, and ſo my labour of Proof might ſeem to be ſpared,
yet to ſatisfie others, and to make the Copy agree with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
I find my ſelf obliged to compare them one with the other
in the enſuing Explication: The Time of Harveſt (or of finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Teſtimony) to cut down the whole Earth being Come;
There are Two Angels with Sickles, One is commanded to cut
down the Harveſt, the other the Vintage: Now the Corn is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Ripe before the Grapes; and where ſhould the Angel
begin the Harveſt but in a Corn Countrey? We have <hi>only Corn
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61150:16"/>
England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Grapes are beyond Sea,
where the Vintage is to be gathered: 'Tis plain therefore, That
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Angel ſhould begin his Harveſt firſt in theſe parts: I think
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not mention when our Harveſt was Gathered in <hi>England,</hi>
there being now ſo many on the Premiſes who helped to get it
in By Harveſt, is meant <hi>Conſtitutions Civil and Eccleſiaſtical,</hi>
and a Reaping is a Cutting them down: Now 'Tis plain, they
have been all Cut down in <hi>England;</hi> as well the <hi>Vine</hi> of the
Church, as the <hi>Cedar</hi> of the State: Firſt Monarchy and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
were Cut down; then they Returned, and Cut down
the Republick and Presbytery, and all other Models growing
on that Stock: Theſe were but Pangs of a New Birth; and
though they now are both upon the Stage, and exiſt together,
yet 'tis but upon ſufferance; They are but Treſpaſſers upon the
Premiſes; The Promiſes, the Power and Government belongs to
the New Birth, the Heireſs, of which they are at preſent but
Guardians: An Infant that cannot go, muſt have ſome body to
look after it, and who more proper than its own Parents, the Old
Witneſſes? But they are certainly civilly extinct; Their Cutting
down, and being Reaped, is an undeniable Symbol of Rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Abolition: The Leaſe of Old Power being Expired, the
Head of Monarchy was Cut off, and the Head of Epiſcopacy too;
and the Head of the Republick and Presbytery (had they had
any) would have been cut off too; for Heaven deſigned to ſhew
ſome ſignal Tokens of Abolition; The Houſe of Power, and
Symbol of the Old Diſpenſation, was Burned; This was a true
Type of the laſt Conflagration, but more particularly of the
Expiration of the Old Diſpenſation: when the Harveſt is Cut
down, the Stubble is uſually Burned. A <hi>New Aera</hi> Commencing,
'twas fit there ſhould be <hi>New</hi> Habitations; and God himſelf
deſigning to Viſit the New Powers, 'twas fit a Purgation by Fire
ſhould be uſed. There was an Harveſt in our Saviours Time,
which was nothing elſe but a Cutting down all the Conſtitutions
of the World, as the effect has plainly declared: And this is the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61150:17"/>
                  <hi>Second</hi> Harveſt and will have the ſame effects; This Harveſt then
being firſt got in, in theſe Countreys, there was reſerved ſome of
the Good and Beſt Wheat for Seed, to be thrown into the Ground
to raiſe a New Crop. This has been done, and it comes up
Green and Kindly, and is in a very Hopeful and Flouriſhing
Condition; not Riſing <hi>BARE GRAIN,</hi> but with a <hi>New Body</hi> ſuch
as God has been pleaſed to give it; but of this more hereafter.
The Old Witneſſes obſerving the time of the Beaſts power Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring,
made an Attack upon the Whoriſh Retinue, and drove
them out of all Power and Dominion; This is <hi>THEIR
DEATH,</hi> and they ought to Dye firſt, the Time of their end
being Come; but This Retinue returns with New Vigor, and
again Aſſaults the Witneſſes, driving <hi>THEM</hi> out of all Power
and Dominion; This is the Witneſſes <hi>Death:</hi> and there is great
Inſulting and Rejoycing over them, becauſe they had Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them ſo much before; and many Gifts are ſent, and much
Rejoycing there is at their Re-ſettlement: but they who were
their Friends, prevailed ſo much that they ſhould not be Buryed,
in hopes they would Revive; the Text ſaith, <hi>They ſuffered them
not to be put in their Graves;</hi> this argues their Death was not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral,
and that the Tree was not pulled up by the Roots, only
cut off by the Stumps, that there might be a new Ingrafting;
They lie thus Civilly Dead, expulſed out of all Employment and
Power in the Streets of the Great City, which is Spiritually
called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where alſo our Lord was Crucified:
This City can by no means be meant <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſome would have
it, for it was never known that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called <hi>Rome,</hi> and
'tis plain <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is meant hereby. Now <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a
Friendly City belonging to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kindred and Nation, and ſo
ought this City in which his Body or Witneſſes are to be Slain;
and no City in the World can claim ſuch a Title as <hi>Lond n;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very ſhadow of it in a Line directly drawn, as alſo doth
anſwer the ſame in all other Reſpects of Kindred and Affinity to
the Witneſſes; and though it be the Chief Proteſtant City, yet
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61150:17"/>
in a Spiritual Sence (<hi>Rome</hi> almoſt in a Literal) it may be called

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> nothing hinders this: In this City therefore for
Three Days and a Half, They lie Thrown out of all Power Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal; and ſome of them were really and Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
caſt out into the Street; this was in the laſt Perſecution,
juſt before the Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Life from God entered into them, and they ſtood upon their
Feet, and Great Fear fell upon them which ſaw them: <hi>And they
leard a Great Voice from Heaven ſaying, Come up hither; and they
Aſcended up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their Enemies beheld them:</hi>
This was a grievous ſight to their Enemies; they had taken all
care imaginable, not only to kill them, but to keep them dead:
But their Death was their Victory, as of old their Saviours was;
for now they riſe again, to the Amazement of them all.</p>
               <p>Alas! Their care extended no farther than to the <hi>Old Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
with whom they had fought, and who had tormented them
ſo much: And when they ſee <hi>New Witneſſes</hi> ſtanding in the
Court of Heaven, they ſtand amazed, as if they had ſeen a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum:
<hi>Theſe</hi> we know, and <hi>Theſe</hi> we know, ſay they; But <hi>who
are Ye?</hi> Theſe New Enemies they never dream'd of: There's
no Feeing the Soldiers to ſay they are not riſen, for they are ſeen
of all the World. <hi>Theſe</hi> then, as ſoon as they appear, being the
Firſt Fruits of God and to the Lamb, all other old Fruit becomes
intollerable to Prophecy; A ſudden Hurricane ariſes: And the
Text ſaith, <hi>There was a great Earthquake, and the Tenth part of the
City ſell; and in the Earthquake was ſlain of Men Seven Thouſand.</hi>
It ſhould not be of <hi>Men,</hi> tho' this Verſion is ſo, this favours a
literal Death too much: Other Verſions have it, the <hi>Names</hi> of
Men, or Men of Note: The Latin Verſion is, <hi>Capita Hominum
Septies Mille;</hi> which rendred right is, <hi>The Heads or Principals of
Seven Thouſand Men:</hi> But the Greek is nearer to the point, being
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>The NAMES of Seven Thouſand Men;</hi>
being 'tis only a <hi>Name</hi> that is ſlain, it frees the Text from a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
interpretation: And every Name is a Captain, and has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61150:18"/>
him a Thouſand Men. Any one that conſults the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
will find theſe things true. <hi>And the reſt</hi> (but not theſe) <hi>were
afrighted, and gave glory to God.</hi> What a Diſturbance and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
there was, is well known; cauſed chiefly by the <hi>Seven
Patriarchs</hi> Falling; and by their Fall, <hi>Seven Thouſand of their
Party.</hi> Theſe repreſented the whole Body, as <hi>Julian</hi> the whole
Papal Conſtitution: And 'tis fit there ſhould be a Specimen of
all the Condemned and Rejected Powers, at the Riſing of the
Witneſſes, that they might be Triumphed over, and all Fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>The Reſt gave Glory to God;</hi> That is, they thanked God
for their Deliverance, tho' others repined and murmured. In
this curious Scene, the Wiſdom of God cannot be enough admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
As Idolatrous <hi>Julian</hi> of old, was ſuffered on purpoſe to make
a Three year and half's Parentheſis in the Chriſtian Empire, that
the Jews might build their <hi>Temple,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Epoche</hi> of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
might be the more Illuſtrious: So Papal <hi>Julian</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to make much the ſame intercalations, on purpoſe that
the <hi>Epoche</hi> of the New-Riſen-Witneſſes might be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicous.
There was none to reach them an hand, or to call them
to <hi>Heaven:</hi> So God made their greateſt Enemies to do it, even
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: And when he had done this, he had done the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
for which he was raiſed, and preſently flies away like a
Whirlwind, being intollerable to Prophecy: For though the
Lion and the Lamb <hi>may,</hi> the Whore and the Bride <hi>muſt not</hi> lie
down together: Theſe things I doubt not, but will be very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to many; eſpecially to thoſe who ſeek for Truth, with
a Reſolution not to Reject it when they have Found it. The
Scene lying ſo near, I know, is a great prejudice to Truth; Things
that lie Abroad, and a great way off, Men ſooner believe, than
what is done at Home. And therefore they had much rather
theſe Witneſſes ſhould riſe in <hi>Piedmont, Germany,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> than
in <hi>England:</hi> But this cannot be; for the Goſpel is the Blood of the
World, which never reverts till it comes to the Toes; and theſe
Nations may be called the <hi>Feet</hi> or <hi>Toes</hi> of the Univerſe. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61150:18"/>
theſe New-Riſen-Witneſſes are to Convert and Proſelyte the
whole World, and therefore the Extream Parts are the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places to begin in. I know many would have the Witneſſes
Riſe in <hi>Piedmont, Germany</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> but they are under great
Miſtakes, as to the true and genuine Nature of Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
as I ſhall fully, and to the ſatisfaction of all the World,
make appear, as follows.</p>
               <p>All who have wrote upon this Subject hitherto, have ſuppoſed
a Wounding and a Healing, an Impriſonment and Releaſing, a
Deprivation and Reſtoration of Power, in the ſame Numerical
and Identical Body of Men, to be a Death and Reſurrection;
which, alas! doth not riſe up to the true nature thereof at all.
Though the Witneſſes Death and Reſurrection are not natural
and literal, yet they ought to hold a moſt exact and ſtrict Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
thereto, and this Analogy falls exceedingly ſhort thereof.
Theſe are only accidental, and not ſubſtantial Mutations in the
ſame Body; and no accidental or circumſtantial Mutation will
do the buſineſs: No, a Transformation will not do the thing;
for no Man will ſay <hi>Nehuchadnezzar</hi> died and roſe again. No Increaſe
or Decreaſe, or any other accidental Alteration in one and the ſame
ſubject, can poſſibly reach the Heighth of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
A repairing an Old Houſe makes it not a New One. There muſt
be an abſolute pulling down to make it <hi>Death;</hi> and an intire
New Building from the Foundations, to make it a <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
Death makes a ſubſtantial Alteration: 'Tis a total Diſſolution
of Parts, a melting down the Bullion, and not a ſodering the
piece. In the Reſurrection there muſt be a ſubſtantial New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
A Body that is ſaid to riſe again, muſt have <hi>nothing of the
Old Body in it,</hi> but be abſolutely <hi>New</hi> both in ſubſtance and
circumſtance. And a Body that is ſaid properly and truly to be
Dead, muſt be abſolutely diſſolved, and muſt undergo a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
and ſubſtantial Mutation. A Truth of this weight can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made too plain. Now neither the Witneſſes in <hi>Piedmont,
Germany, France,</hi> or any other part of the World whatſoever, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61150:19"/>
in <hi>England</hi>) have paſſed ſuch a Teſt as this. The <hi>ſame</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Perſecuted, and then tollerated; Wounded, and then Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Depreſſed, and then Re-eſtabliſhed; does not come up to
the Heighth of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> Becauſe theſe are only
Alterations in the <hi>ſame Body,</hi> and the ſame Body ought not to be in
the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thou Fool, thou ſoweſt not that Body
that ſhall be—</hi> The Body is to dye and to be diſſolved, and receive
an abſolute <hi>New</hi> Body, <hi>New</hi> in ſubſtance and circumſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can be ſaid to have a Reſurrection: If it riſe with its <hi>Old</hi>
Body, it may be ſaid to be <hi>altered</hi> or <hi>changed,</hi> but not riſen; 'tis
only <hi>BARE GRAIN,</hi> an Old Houſe repaired, a Piece ſodered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but nothing elſe: There is a vaſt difference betwixt Corn
<hi>raiſed</hi> up, and Corn that is <hi>Riſen;</hi> one implying help, the other
none (the Stone comes out of the Mountain without hands) The
one is only <hi>Old</hi> Corn, tho' it be raiſed from the Ground; but
the other is abſolutely <hi>New.</hi> Men have hitherto called <hi>accidental</hi>
alterations in the ſame Subject to be a Reſurrection, and ſo have
made their Witneſſes riſe only <hi>BARE GRAIN;</hi> but the Grain
ought to rot in the Ground, and receive a <hi>New</hi> Form and Body,
ſuch as God ſhall pleaſe to give it, before it can be ſaid to have a
True Reſurrection. This has been done in <hi>England</hi> to an <hi>Iota,</hi>
and anſwered the true and genuine nature of Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in the moſt minute circumſtances. For the Old Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and their Conſtitution, hath been killed, melted or cut down,
like the Corn, and ſome of it has been caſt into the Ground, and
'tis riſen up with a New Body, abſolutely <hi>New,</hi> both in ſubſtance
and circumſtance; there is nothing of the <hi>Old Way or Method</hi> in
them; but in Temporals &amp; Spirituals, <hi>a Fundamentis,</hi> they have all
things New; And the Name of Witneſs is ſtamped all over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. All the Nation will witneſs what I ſay to be true. I
lay ſtroke upon ſtroke, becauſe Men have been miſerably miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
about this Great Truth; and I had rather undergo ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
than not be plain, ſo weighty a Truth requiring it.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> ſhould be reſtored to their Lands and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61150:19"/>
Livings, and be priviledged to exerciſe their Old Methods in
Religion, this can never mount to a Reſurrection; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Learned <hi>Jurieu</hi> is much miſtaken in this matter, and ſo
are all others who have wrote on this Subject; which the Reader
muſt of neceſſity acknowledge, if he impartially peruſe what I
have wrote.</p>
               <p>The livelieſt Emblem of Death &amp; Reſurrection, which I know of,
is a Silk-Worm: In its firſt ſtate 'tis a crawling <hi>Worm</hi> of a green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
colour; and the whole buſineſs of its Life (which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
Chriſtians) is to prepare for Death; for ſpinning a Noble
Coffin, it dies, laying it ſelf therein; and after ſome time, it
comes forth of this <hi>Mauſoleum</hi> a perfect New Creature of Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
colour, with Wings and Legs. The Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Witneſſes ought to hold a due Conformity thereto:
They ought to be in two differing States, in two differing diſtinct
Bodies, attended with two clearly differing Circumſtances. The
Old Witneſſes ought to have no Life, no Power, no Model or
Form at all; but their Conſtitution is to be abſolutely diſſolved,
and lie dead, dead, dead: Then the Spirit of Life and Power is to
enter into them, and give them a New Life, Model, and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
perfectly New in ſubſtance and circumſtance, in all points
and reſpects differing from the former,</p>
               <p>This has not been done yet, in any part of the World, but in
<hi>England,</hi> and here it has been done, and is lifted up as an Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
for all the World to copy after. What has been done in
other places has been only a Field of Corn raiſed up, after it has
been flatted by ſome boiſterous wind of Perſecution; this amounts
not to a Reſurrection, it being the ſame Old Corn, not <hi>riſen,</hi> but
<hi>raiſed.</hi> But here our Harveſt has been cut down, and our Wheat
caſt into the Ground for a New Crop, which we can ſay is not
<hi>raiſed,</hi> but <hi>riſen;</hi> one implying help, the other none; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid that ever any one helped our New-Riſen-Witneſſes
to Riſe; 'Tis purely Gods Work, and is marvellous in our
Eyes.</p>

                  <hi>England</hi> is reaped, but wo to the Vintage! Wo to all the
Conſtitutions of the Earth! For the Angel with his Sickle will
cut all down before him: And where he pulls down, there will
he build; and where he reaps, there he will ſow: For the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

               <p>CHRIST taking Poſſeſſion of the Kingdoms of this World,
as Heir and Conqueror thereof, and the Church being
brought to bed of the New-Riſen-Witneſſes, theſe things make
ſuch a great Alteration, that there is ſaid to be a <hi>New Heaven, and
a New Earth:</hi> All things in Church and State receive a New
Face: And things are ſo turned up-ſide-down, that <hi>This State</hi> is
called by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, The World to come:</hi> But
it is not well Tranſlated, for the Original is not <hi>Coſmos,</hi> but
<hi>Oceonimia,</hi> which is <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> ſo ought to be rather <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
to come,</hi> of which we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Millennium</hi> doth introduce a <hi>New Diſpenſation,</hi> but not a
New Goſpel; by Diſpenſation, I underſtand a Publication of all
New Diſcovered Truths, and an Errecting up a New Outward
Adminiſtration ſuitable thereto. Light and Truth breaking
forth, they ought to be Publiſhed; and Children being Born,
they muſt be Provided for: The New Bride muſt have a New
Houſe built for her; and it was never known, that a King took
the Field, but he had a Royal Tent pitched for him: 'Twas the
cuſtome of the Warriers of old, as ſoon as their Armies were
Muſtered, to Erect a Pavilion for their General, called the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi>
Tent; which being pitched in the middle of their Camp,
all Commiſſions and Orders were Iſſued out from thence; and
the whole Camp Addreſſed themſelves thereto in all their Affairs
of Concern and Moment. The <hi>WORD</hi> is in the Field, Riding
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61150:21"/>
upon his White Horſe, and his Army of White Linnen Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are Muſtered; but there is no Tent Erected for the Lamb;
there are Muſter-Maſters, but no Quarter-Maſters, and every one
bears his own charge in the War; this ought not to be: the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No man goes to War at his own Charges;</hi> 'tis a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing that the Generaliſſimo ſhould lye out in the Field;
there was never any Army yet, but had ſome Head Quarters.</p>
               <p>In all the Diſpenſations that have hitherto happened, There
was ſome principal place appointed for God and Religion. <hi>Moſes</hi>
built God a Tabernacle and <hi>Solomon</hi> a Temple, and it has been the
confuſion of the World, that Chriſtianity has had none appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it in this laſt Diſpenſation. The Chriſtian Diſpenſators,
having no peculiar Lodgings appointed for Them, fell into the
Baudy Houſe of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo She that was at Firſt a Pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
became a Proſtitute, and is now that great Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
which muſt be turned out of doors to make Room for the True
Bride. This Great Neglect of not making due Proviſion for Gods
Servants, will coſt the World dear; for all that Irregular Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Vile Mixture of the <hi>Sons of God</hi> with Men, is to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down; and Men muſt do what they ought to have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
They muſt build a place for the Servants of God in each
Nation, for the Diſpenſers of his Word to dwell in; and it ought
to be as our Saviours Sepulcher, in which 'tis ſaid <hi>Never yet Man
lay.</hi> For had the Spouſe layen in ſuch an one before, She had had
no occaſion of Repentance, and had not now been called a <hi>Church
Regenerate.</hi> So many Vile Idolators having lain in <hi>Rome,</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
her Manners and Converſation, and made her unfit for
her Lords preſence. What Irregularities and Confuſions there
have been in the laſt Diſpenſations, I think will be needleſs here
to enumerate, they being ſo plain and ſelf evident to the World,
and that the principal cauſe and occaſion of them, has been what
I mentioned, I think is a like manifeſt. The <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>
was much better than this Laſt; for he appointed Thirteen Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the Prieſts, and Forty Eight for the Levites, through
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61150:21"/>
all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Servants of God were not left to
ſcramble for their Livings, in ſuch a precarious manner as ours;
but had their due Lot of Land allowed them for a Poſſeſſion;
which indeed was the greateſt Due and Juſtice in the World. And
God appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> to do it. And when they came into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Land, they applied themſelves to <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Eleazer:</hi> And
they ſpake unto them at <hi>Shiloh</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>The Lord commanded by the hand of Moſes, to give us Cities to dwell
in, with the Suburbs thereof for our Cattel.</hi> The Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this thing, not only ſhews the Juſtice, but the Fitneſs and
Properneſs of it. And I challenge all the Skill and Wiſdom of
the Univerſe, to propoſe a better Way and Method of Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Gods Word, than what He here doth Himſelf in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>New Jeruſalem.</hi> There is a River of Life, and a Tree
of Life, in the midſt of this City; which no Skill or Learning
in the World can make any thing of, but muſt of Neceſſity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it to be the Goſpel, and the Preachers thereof: And to what
purpoſe can the Twelve Gates ſerve, but that the Preachers may
go out Twelve times a Years, or every Month, to heal the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
'Tis ſaid, <hi>The Tree yielded its Fruit every Month, and the
Leaves of the Tree were for the Healing of the Nations, And the
Kings of the Earth bring their Glory and Honour into it.</hi> This ſhews
the <hi>Millennium</hi> to be rather an Hierarchy than a Monarchy, as I
hinted before; And this Conſtitution of Circular and Itinerant
Predicants, doth confirm the ſame: <hi>The Inhabitants of the City
are a Royal Prieſthood, a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome ſay, This <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe it comes
down from above.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Millennium</hi> is the Morning of an Eternal Day, and this
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate is a Type of Heaven, but not Heaven it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Text ſaith plainly it <hi>comes down from Heaven,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot be Heaven it ſelf. It is ſaid to <hi>come out of Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Excellency of its Conſtitution, being contrived by
God himſelf, and becauſe 'tis a Copy of the Heavenly Motions,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61150:22"/>
anſwering it in all its Circular Revolutions. But if Men conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it right, 'tis a very ſtrange Opinion to make all the other
Scenes through the whole Prophecy to be on Earth, and this to
be in Heaven; they may as well make <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as to make this City in Heaven: As his Temple was the
Perfection of the Tabernacle, ſo this City is the Perfection of
the laſt Tabernaculous Diſpenſation of <hi>Babylon:</hi> The Bride and
the Whore are always put in oppoſition to one another; and to
make one upon Earth, and the other in Heaven, is to go againſt
the whole current of Scripture-Analogy. This City can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
no other way but in a Literal ſence: And Men that only
Gaze, and ſpeak at Random, may be ſurprized; But whoever
doth ſoberly and ſeriouſly conſider of the matter, muſt needs
Vote for me in this Caſe: There is ſuch a Torrent of Reaſon and
Juſtice on my ſide, that I cannot well ſee how any one can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it.</p>
               <p>All Men will acknowledge that God made <hi>This World</hi> as a
Theater to diſplay his Glory upon; the <hi>Five Empires</hi> are no other
but <hi>Five Acts:</hi> And the Altar, Tabernacle, Temple, Mock City,
and True City, are the <hi>Five Scenes. Jeruſalem</hi> is but the Scene
of the Fifth Act, which always is the beſt: And 'tis uſual in the
Laſt Act to have all the Actors on the Stage at once; For firſt,
there are the <hi>New-Riſen-Witneſſes,</hi> or Church Regenerate, then
the Jews, then the Whore and her Retinue, and laſtly a Set of
Idolaters throughout the World; Every one are to be rewarded
according to their Merit. The Witneſſes are the principal Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
in this laſt Act, and are Riſen, but as yet enter not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
till <hi>The Scene of the New Jeruſalem be Drawn;</hi> when, <hi>The Stone
which the Builders rejected, becomes the Head Stone of the Corner.</hi> But
I ſpoke of the Reaſon and Juſtice of the thing; Is it not a moſt
Juſt thing, that the Lord in Chief, when He comes to viſit the
World, ſhould be ſerved with the beſt Furniture, and lie in the
beſt Room in his own Houſe? He has had the Firſt Fruits of
our Flocks and our Herds, an Altar for the Earth, a Tabernacle
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61150:22"/>
for our Tents; a Temple, for our Houſes; But he has had no
City yet: And 'tis fit he ſhould be preſented with the firſt Fruits
of all the Compoſitums, as well as of the Simple and Natural
Things on the Earth. The Kings of the Earth have built to
themſelves many ſtately Cities, and called them after their <hi>own
Name:</hi> Saith one, <hi>Is not this Great Babylon which I have Built, for
the Houſe of the Kingdom, and for the Honour of my Majesty?</hi> And
this is the cauſe which makes the Earth mourn, and the Hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones
of a Talent (the Bombs) ruine ſo many Cities. Men build
their own Houſes, and neglect Gods. <hi>David</hi> would not do ſo;
He would not lie in Cedar, when the Ark of God was in Tents.
But now the <hi>WORD OF GOD</hi> is on his White Horſe in the Fields,
and like <hi>Jacob,</hi> muſt lay his Head upon a Stone: For He has no
Tent at all. But 'tis hoped ere long, this thing will be conſidered
by our <hi>David,</hi> when the Wars are over, and when God ſhall
give him Peace round about.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> calls <hi>Babylon, The Houſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
Every Kingdom is to have a Houſe or Principal City in it.
Now all the Kingdoms of the World are become Chriſts, and
'tis the moſt reaſonable thing in the World, that He ſhould have
a Houſe in every Kingdom, as Lord in chief, and Proprietor of
the Whole: This is but a very reaſonable Sacrifice to Him, who
can enter upon the whole Premiſes when He pleaſes. At this
very time He is Soveraign Lord of the Univerſe, <hi>The King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> and that by a Decree, ordained Him
from Eternity: No Monarch in the World has a Foot of Ground
or an Inch of Power, but what is given by him: He therefore
who has received from him the Firſt Fruits of Power and Empire
in <hi>England,</hi> who has been preferred before all the Monarchs of
the World, being conſtituted his Firſt Delegate; He, I ſay, who
has <hi>Received Firſt,</hi> ought to pay his <hi>Homage Firſt;</hi> and to Erect
ſuch a Monument of Gratitude, as may be a Pattern to other
Nations to all Generations. I ſpeak not ſo much of a Glorious
City, as a <hi>Tent, Colledge,</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> to ſhew the way, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61150:23"/>
make a beginning: And was it a City, the thing is very feaſible;
for if every little Village can rear a Church, ſure a whole Nation
can quickly build a City. In this Tent, Colledge, Tabernacle,
or City, let there be built, as for the Prophets of old, a little
Apartment for each Prophet, putting a Bed, a Stool, a Table,
and Candleſtick there; and a ſufficient Number being Annually
choſe out of all the Counties by Lot, let them Twelve times a
Year iſſue out, and heal the Nation: When this is done, <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
will quickly cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea;</hi>
We ſhall have no dark Corners, or barren Mountains, but every
thing will be full of Light, and every thing will flouriſh and be
green, like the Paradice of God. Indeed the Advantages of this
moſt Excellent Adminiſtration, are inexpreſſible, and is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Great Contriver, God Himſelf. Then we ſhall know
what the New Moons and the Sabbaths mean; for Earth will
Eccho to Heaven, and we ſhall in a manner have a Sun, Moon,
and Stars, here below; keeping due time in their Motions and
Circulations, with them above. What the Sun is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
or the Heart in Mans Body, the ſame will this City be in
every Nation.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> is to be the Head, for to Her the
great Stream of Promiſes belong: The Text ſaith, <hi>And Thou, O
Tower of the Flock, to Thee it ſhall come, even the Firſt Dominion;
The Kingdom ſhall come to the Daughter of Jeruſalem: Jeruſalem</hi>
will be the Royal Seat, or Houſe of Chriſt Kingdom; for, <hi>The
Name of the City ſhall be, THE LORD IS THERE:</hi> That is, He
will be there in <hi>a moſt Glorious manner,</hi> but not Perſonally; His
Name is called <hi>Wonderful Counſeller:</hi> 'Tis extreamly probable his
Preſence will be there after the manner he was in the Temple of
old, viz. <hi>Oracularly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince I am come to the City of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it will not be amiſs
to obſerve the poſition of it, and of the diviſion of the whole
Land, which is exactly like a Man: For there are the Lot of
Five Tribes above, and Seven Tribes below, and the holy Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61150:23"/>
for the Prieſts and Levites in the middle; and this City in
the upper part of the holy Portion anſwering the Heart exactly,
the holy Portion below anſwers the Belly and Intrails, which are
eſteemed holy; And the Princes Portion lies on both ſides the
holy Portion, Eaſt and Weſt, like two Arms. to guard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it. And 'tis ſaid, <hi>They that ſerve the City ſhall ſerve it out
of all the Tribes of Iſrael:</hi> This ſeem; but Reaſonable, for this
City being the Heart, ſupplies the whole Body with Salutiferous
Juyces. The Preachers do iſſue out Twelve times a year to heal
them, and there is the greateſt Reaſon in the World, that the
whole Tribes ſhould ſerve it; by Adminiſtring ſuch Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
and Neceſſaries as are ſuitable. And that the Inhabitants
of this City are Preachers, tho' the Text be ſilent, yet is a thing
without all contradiction: For the Waters that iſſue out, firſt to
the Ancles, then to the Knees, then to the Loyns, and at laſt to
be like a River not be paſſed over; theſe Waters, I ſay, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifeſt that the Goſpel and Preaching is meant hereby; and
their Salutiferous Virtue does confirm the ſame. And another
Prophet is more appoſite to the thing; ſaith he, <hi>In that Day, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Waters ſhall go out of Jeruſalem, half of them towards the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sea, and half of them towards the hinder Sea; in Summer and
in Winter ſhall it be.</hi> Here is the exact Method and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pointed at, and the Continuance of the ſame, ſaying, <hi>In Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and in Winter it ſhall be:</hi> Now 'tis not poſſible to ſpell any
thing out of this ſo clear an Expreſſion, but the Goſpel and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
The Apoſtle to the Jews, levels the whole of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to this, <hi>New Diſpenſation;</hi> for, as it were, rejecting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he ſaith, <hi>Leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let
us go on unto Perfection, not laying again the Foundation of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of
Baptiſm, and of Laying on of Hands, and of the Reſurrection of the
Dead, and of Eternal Judgment:</hi> Theſe all ſeem to be the matter
of the <hi>laſt Diſpenſation,</hi> and therefore he leaves them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
to ſpeak of ſomething higher, implyed by the ſucceeding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61150:24"/>
Verſe,—<hi>And this we will do, if God permit.</hi> And he makes Chriſt
to be the chief Adminiſtrator in it; ſaying, <hi>For unto the Angels
he hath not put in ſubjection the World</hi> (Diſpenſation) <hi>to come, of
which we ſpeak:</hi> And afterwards he tells them, <hi>But ye are come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Mount Zion, and to the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
and to an innumerable Company of Angels: To the General
Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-born, whoſe Names are written in
Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Juſt Men
made perfect: And to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant; And
to the Blood of Sprinkling, which ſpeaketh better things than that of
Abel.</hi> This City is of a <hi>Heavenly Nature,</hi> miniſtring in Spiritual
things, in which the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the <hi>New-Riſen-Witneſſes</hi>
do convene; The Latin Verſion is <hi>Conventum &amp; Concionem,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
a <hi>General Aſſembly of Preachers;</hi> and their <hi>Names being
written in Heaven,</hi> anſwers to that Conſcript Number which
<hi>John</hi> mentions ſtood on <hi>Mount Zion,</hi> and we cannot ſuppoſe that
Heaven is meant thereby. But this, as I have before intimated,
for their Security, in oppoſition to the Jewiſh Genealogies which
are kept ſo ſtrictly on Earth: <hi>And for the Miniſtration of Angels,</hi>
God has always uſed them to Miniſter to <hi>Thoſe</hi> which ſhall be
Heirs of Salvation: And no doubt but they will be imployed in
a more eſpecial manner in this moſt happy Diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>This <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> can by no means be Heaven; for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having brought in God making a New Heaven and a New
Earth, he brings in the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> building Houſes and
inhabiting them, and planting Vineyards and eating the Fruit of
them, which are things inconſiſtent with <hi>Heaven:</hi> And 'tis ſaid,
<hi>The Kings of the Earth do bring their Glory into it,</hi> which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do into <hi>Heaven;</hi> For <hi>Heaven</hi> needs no Glow-Worms to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
it: And to repreſent any Church-ſtate which is paſt,
there's too much Beauty and Symmetry in it for that: It muſt
needs therefore preſigure ſomething to come. And if it be
objected, It cannot be in a literal ſence, becauſe of the Ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Materials: This makes little; for the Richneſs and Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61150:24"/>
of the Materials, is not ſo much to be underſtood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
as to ſet forth that moſt admirable Beauty and Harmony
it will introduce, and to make it a more proper Repreſentative
of Heaven, of which it is really and truly a Type, and nothing
elſe. <hi>John</hi> was ſet upon a Mountain to ſee this glorious ſight,
and he tells us, <hi>It came down from Heaven,</hi> and therefore cannot
be Heaven it ſelf. He might be ſet on a Mountain to ſee as far
as <hi>Judea,</hi> he being in <hi>Patmos;</hi> but I rather think it was to ſee as
far as <hi>Britannia,</hi> where this happy State ſhould firſt dawn, and
where the Firſt Pillar in this Temple of God, or of the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
ſhould be erected; which is a peculiar Promiſe to the
<hi>Philadelphian Church,</hi> which we really and in truth have amongſt
us: <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> will be the <hi>Tower of the Flock,</hi> or the
<hi>Cupola</hi> of this moſt Magnificent Structure; and all other Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
will be as Pillars to ſupport the Main Fabrick: It will be
like St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the reſt anſwering our Cathedral
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſaw no Temple in it;</hi> which plainly
ſets forth the changing the Temple-Adminiſtration for that of a
City: And how excellently is this Diſpenſation ſuited to the
Age of the World? The World is now Adult, and come to its
Manhood; and what more proper Scenes can we have than Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are the Diſcretional and Political parts of her Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>But further, The Body of Jeſus Chriſt is the Grand Pattern
of things in Heaven and in Earth, and were we but well-inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in our own Frame, we might almoſt know any thing: The
laſt expired Diſpenſation has been only a <hi>Fermentation</hi> in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
or a preparing of the Juyces to convert them into Blood,
which this City-Heart diſperſes, and makes to circulate through
all the Body. The Circulation of the Blood being found out, the
Goſpel (which is the Blood of the World) could not be long a
Myſtery; and the Blood coming to the Extream Parts, reverts,
as I hinted before, proving thereby the Church to be Re-born,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61150:25"/>
or the Witneſſes to have their Reſurrection in the Weſt. The
Increment of Chriſts Natural Body is the Great Rule of all our
Diſpenſation, or Cauſe of Alterations of all the Political Affairs
in the World: As the Fleſh grows, the Politicks of the World
change; The Fleſh is the Incremental or Changeable Part, and
the Spirit the Firmamental or Immoveable Part, being God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
That common meaſure of Prophetick Time, of <hi>Time, Times,
and Half a Time,</hi> has a peculiar reſpect to the Age of Chriſt. And
the Three Grand Diſpenſations by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
have a peculiar Regard to his Childhood, Youth, and Manhood:
In the dark ſhadowy Diſpenſation of the Jews, He was growing
in the <hi>Womb;</hi> and to <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> time a <hi>Child;</hi> and the laſt 1260
years, he was a <hi>Youth,</hi> (and what Aeſtuations and Fermentations
there are in <hi>Youth,</hi> is well known; and 'tis as well known how
<hi>Youths</hi> are corrupted and impoſed upon, who are Heirs to great
Eſtates.) But now he is Adult, and come to his Manhood,
and therefore, as is uſual for Heirs, makes claim to his Eſtate,
which is no leſs than the whole World: Hitherto he has been as
it were in his <hi>Nonage;</hi> But <hi>Now,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, his
Body the Church is come to the <hi>Meaſure of the Fulneſs of his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
which is not well Tranſlated, for 'tis <hi>Chriſti Adulti,</hi> in the
Latin, which ought to be rendred of <hi>Chriſt come to his Manhood,</hi>
or grown a Man.</p>
               <p>Before, Other Lords Ruled over his Heritage; But <hi>Now,</hi> in
the <hi>Millennium,</hi> being his Manhood, he will Rule <hi>Himſelf:</hi> He
<hi>Now</hi> Claims all Power and Authority, and gives and beſtows the
Kingdoms of this World to whom he pleaſes. And whoſoever
henceforward Exerciſes any <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> on Earth, if not
delegated by him, 'tis either Permiſſion or Uſurpation; for <hi>all
Power and Dominion belongs to Him.</hi> And when Kings come to
their Kingdoms, 'tis uſual to prefer ſome City before others, for
their Reſidence; Therefore <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> is the place; He
will reſide and put his <hi>Name there;</hi> The Text ſaith, <hi>The Name of
the City ſhall be, THE LORD IS THERE.</hi> 'Tis alſo (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61150:25"/>
Spiritually) uſual for Men who come to Age, to Marry, and
take a Houſe; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is this Houſe, and the Church Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
is the Bride; and bleſſed are thoſe that are called to the
Wedding: Saith <hi>John, Bleſſed are they which are called to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Supper of the Lamb:</hi> That is, Bleſſed are thoſe that are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church regenerate; Bleſſed are thoſe that live in the
times of this happy Adminiſtration of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> for
they (if they be Holy) ſhall be Sharers of the Firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or be inveſted with the Firſt Fruits of his Power; They
ſhall enter into, and have the Priviledges of this Holy City, if
they are cloathed in their Wedding Garments, the white Linnen
of Holineſs; but if not, they muſt ſtand without: The Text
ſaith, <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that Defileth,
neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a Lye; but they
which are written in the Lambs Book of Life:</hi> And, <hi>Bleſſed are they
that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of
Life, and may enter in thorow the Gate into the City: For without are
Dogs, and Sorcerors, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolators,
and whoſoever loveth and maketh a Lye:</hi> And all theſe things are
to be underſtood in a <hi>Literal,</hi> as well as in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſence; No
indigeſted crude ſtuff muſt come to the Heart, but pure and
rarified Blood.</p>
               <p>And what can Men object againſt this moſt happy Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?
I know they will ſay, It will make ſtrange Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and overturn all their Old Conſtitutions in the World: I
allow this: 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and behold I make
all things New.</hi> And Men may thank themſelves for this; for if
they had not built with Wood, Hay, and Stubble, it had not
been pulled down; If they had made due Proviſion for the Infant
Bride, ſhe had not turned Proſtitute, and ſo had now had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to have been waſhed and purified; ſhe had been ready
long ago, and had not now occaſion to make her ſelf ready.
Chriſt ſet the World a Bleſſed Pattern, but they would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it. The Text ſaith, <hi>And it came to paſs, that He went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61150:26"/>
every City and Village, preaching and ſhewing the Glad Tidings of
the Kingdom of God; and the Twelve were with him.</hi> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaith, <hi>And Jeſus went about all the Cities and Villages, teaching
in their Synagogues, and preaching the Doctrine of the Kingdom.</hi>
This was the way which our Saviour took, and had it been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
hitherto, there had been no need of a New Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Way and Method a Doctrine was firſt planted, is the
moſt proper way to preſerve it. This way therefore being uſed
at the <hi>Publication,</hi> ought to be uſed at the <hi>Reſtoration.</hi> The
running Waters are living and wholeſome, but the ſtanding do
putrifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt is the</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega; <hi>The</hi> Throne <hi>mentioned in the
firſt part of the</hi> Revelations, <hi>is nothing elſe but this</hi> New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
<hi>This Book is the moſt exquiſite piece of Paint in the World,
and were the Painting-Art loſt, it might be found here: The Son
of God firſt draws the Deſign, then the heavenly</hi> Raphael<hi>'s and</hi>
Michael Angelo<hi>'s go on, adding Line upon Line, and Stroke upon
Stroke, guided by his Divine</hi> Hand, <hi>till at laſt they finiſh and ſhew
this Incomparable</hi> Hierogliphick <hi>in its proper colours. By</hi> Throne
<hi>nothing is meant but this</hi> City; <hi>And the Prophet</hi> Jeremiah <hi>doth
confirm the ſame, ſaying,</hi> At that time they ſhall call Jeruſalem The
THRONE of the Lord, and all Nations ſhall be gathered into it, to
the Name of the Lord at Jeruſalem. <hi>And when the Text ſaith,</hi> I ſaw
Thrones, and they ſat upon them, and Judgment was given unto them;
<hi>I know not how to underſtand any thing elſe but</hi> Cities, <hi>where
places of Judicature are uſually erected. Nor do I ſee any Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
to let the Sword of Juſtice and the Sword of the Spirit,
to make their Monthly Circuits together, that the Counſel of
Peace may be betwixt them both. When the Prophet ſaith,</hi>
And thou, O Tower of the Flock, <hi>this argues there muſt be many of
them, elſe they could not be a Flock. And every holy City in
each Nation ſending annually their Repreſentatives to pay their
Homage, and receive Inſtructions there, theſe make in Council
together</hi> The General Aſſembly of the Firſt-Born, (<hi>much greater
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61150:26"/>
than that at</hi> Nice.) Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, It ſhall come to
paſs, that there ſhall come People, and the Inhabitants of many Cities.
And the Inhabitants of one City ſhall go to another, ſaying, Let us go
ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts; I will
go alſo: Yea many People and ſtrong Nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord
of Hoſts in Jeruſalem, and to pray before the Lord. <hi>And another
Text ſaith,</hi> That whoſoever of all the Families of the Earth that ſhall
not come up to Jeruſalem, upon them there ſhall be no Rain. <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſuppoſe that the whole Number ſhould come to the Feaſt of
Tabernacles, but ſome Repreſentatives from the</hi> Regenerate City
<hi>of each Nation; and theſe being in a Body at the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
make up the</hi> General Aſſembly of the First-Born. <hi>And
the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah <hi>ſaith,</hi> And it ſhall come to paſs, from one New
Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, ſhall all fleſh come
to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord. <hi>This has a peculiar reſpect to
this moſt excellent Oeconomy, in ſending out Monthly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
out of each</hi> National Regenerate City, <hi>which will give birth to
Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Solemnities, ſo that
this Prophecy will then be fulfilled to an</hi> Iota. <hi>Theſe Circular
Monthly Preachers, are plainly hinted at in the Texts following.</hi>
I have ſet Watchmen on thy Walls, which ſhall never hold their peace
day nor night. Thy Watchmen ſhall lift up the Voice, with the Voice
together ſhall they ſing, for they ſhall ſee Eye to Eye, when the Lord
ſhall bring again Zion. And I will ſet Shepherds over them that ſhall
feed them, and they ſhall fear no more, nor be diſmayed, neither ſhall
they be lacking, ſaith the Lord. And I will give you Paſtors according
to my heart, which ſhall feed you with Knowledge and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.
Then he brought me, and cauſed me to return to the brink of the River:
Now when I had returned, behold there were very many Trees on the one
ſide and the other: Then ſaid he unto me, Theſe Waters iſſue out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt Countrey, and go down into the Deſart, and go down
into the Sea, which being brought forth into the Sea, the Waters ſhall
be healed. And it ſhall come to paſs, that every thing that liveth, that
moveth, whitherſoever the River ſhall come, ſhall live; and there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61150:27"/>
ſhall be a very great multitude of Fiſh, becauſe theſe Waters (<hi>theſe
Preachers</hi>) ſhall come thither, for they ſhall be healed; and every thing
ſhall be healed where the River cometh: And it ſhall come to paſs, that
the Fiſhers ſhall stand upon it from Engedi to Eneglaim: There ſhall be
a place to ſpread forth Nets. There Fiſh ſhall be according to their kind,
as the Fiſh of the Great Sea, exceeding many: But the Miry Places
thereof, and the Marſhes (<hi>That is, thoſe that will not hear, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of theſe Preachers</hi>) ſhall not be healed, but given to Salt. And
by the River on the Bank thereof, on this ſide and on that ſide, ſhall
grow all Trees for meat, whoſe Leaf ſhall not fade, neither the Fruit
thereof he conſumed: (<hi>That is, theſe Preachers ſhall never fail to
make their Monthly Circuits out of the Cities</hi>) it ſhall bring forth
new Fruit according to its Months, becauſe the Waters iſſued out of the
Sanctuary: And the Fruit thereof ſhall be for Meat, and the Leaf
thereof for Medicine. <hi>This is ſo full, that there will be no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of quoting that of</hi> John, <hi>which in a manner is a Repetition
of it.</hi> Daniel <hi>ſaith in the end of his Prophecy,</hi> Many ſhall run
to and fro, and Knowledge ſhall be increaſed: And Zacharia, We have
walked to and fro thorow the Earth, and behold all the Earth ſitteth ſtill
and is at Reſt. <hi>Were but theſe things fixed, then might we very
well ſay,</hi> How Beautiful upon the Mountains are the Feet of him that
bringeth Glad Tidings, that Publiſheth Peace, that bringeth Good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of Good, that Publiſheth Salvation, that ſaith unto Zion, Thy
God reigneth. <hi>Theſe things</hi> are <hi>to be performed and done in the
time of Chriſt Reign. And theſe Preachers ſhall further ſay,</hi>
Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters; and he that hath
no Money, come ye, buy and eat; yea come, and buy Wine and Milk
without Money and without Price. <hi>Many have paid very dear for a
Draught of theſe Waters; but old things are paſſed away, and
all things are become New.</hi> The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come;
and let him that heareth ſay, Come; and let him that is athirſt come;
and whoever will, let him take the Waters of Life freely. <hi>The Goſpel
then is to be as free as the Air, or the Sun Beams:</hi> Then will Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
cover the Earth as the Waters cover the Sea: <hi>For what dry
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61150:27"/>
Mountain will not this conſtant heavenly Rain fall upon? What
dark Corners can be hid from theſe ever-ſhining Lights?</hi> Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things are ſpoken of Thee, O thou City of God! <hi>But when theſe
things come to paſs, Men ſhall ſay that the Prophets have not
told them half of the Truth. That</hi> Pillar of Fire <hi>which led the
Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and all the former Glory in the
Tabernacle and Temple Adminiſtration, were but firſt Fruits of
the Glory which ſhall be revealed in this City-Adminiſtration:</hi>
For God ſhall create upon every Dwelling-Houſe of Mount Zion, and
upon all her Aſſemblies, a Smoak of a Fire by Day, and the ſhining of a
flaming Fire by Night; and upon all the Glory there ſhall be a Defence.
<hi>The Sun it ſelf is to be</hi> aſhamed, when God reigns in Zion before his
Ancients gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>The Political part of this Worlds Oeconomy being ſcrewed up
to the Harmonious Pitch of the Natural, there's a <hi>Non-plus-ultra,</hi>
and we can go no further: Nature is the utmoſt Bounds, and is
the Handmaid to that Eternal Bliſs which is to be revealed in
the preſence of God for ever.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> are ſo full in their Deſcriptions of the Glory of
this Adminiſtration, that to come up to any tolerable meaſure
of its Commendation, I muſt tranſcribe them all, and then fall
far ſhort of it too; For to deſcribe the Beauty of Nature, is in
a manner to deſcribe GOD Himſelf, who is the Fountain of it,
which is impoſſible. But there is one of the <hi>Prophets</hi> put the
Old Diſpenſation, and the New, in a Ballance; his words are
theſe: <hi>Before theſe Days, there was no hire for Man, nor any hire for
Beaſt; neither was there any Peace to him that went out or came in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of Affliction: for I ſet all Men every one againſt his Neighbour.
But now I will not be unto the Reſidue of this People as in the former
Days, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts: For the Seed ſhall be proſperous, the
Vine ſhall give her Fruit, and the Ground ſhall give her Encreaſe, and
the Heavens ſhall give their Dew; And I will cauſe the Remnant of
this People to enjoy all theſe things.</hi> This is a moſt gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
and that God may be as good as his Word, he binds Satan
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61150:28"/>
up all the time of this Oeconomy; for ſhould he ſtill be looſed,
things would go on as formerly, nay worſe; but being overcome
in this laſt Battel, God promiſes that neither he nor his crew
ſhall <hi>Live Again,</hi> as formerly, when Defeated by <hi>Conſtantine;</hi>
but that they ſhall be as Drones without Stings, and lick up the
Duſt of the Earth, and lie proſtrate at the Feet of the <hi>New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
or Church Regenerate, for the whole time of this Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.
<hi>The Reſt of the Dead lived not till the Thouſand Years were
ended:</hi> Then he and the reſt of his impudent Dead Vaſſals will
attack this City, and Fire comes down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
them. But during his Impriſonment, She Rules as a
Queen, and as the Soveraign Empreſs of the whole Earth; but
in an <hi>Hierarchical</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> manner, and not in an <hi>Imperial:</hi>
For, <hi>Chriſt was a Prieſt for ever, after the Order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this Reign, there will be no more Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi>
but to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for there the Court of the General Aſſembly
of the Firſt Born, will be held; every Regenerate City ſending
yearly their Members to ſerve in this Heavenly Parliament: God
doth not aboliſh the Old Jewiſh Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor the
Babyloniſh one at <hi>Rome,</hi> but puts a far better and more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
One in their room; and this the Apoſtle hints all along in
his Treatiſe or his Epiſtle on this Subject to the Jews; he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>a Reſt to the People of God,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the
<hi>Millennium;</hi> and <hi>HE</hi> the Heavenly <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> is ſupream
Adminiſtrator in it, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was in the Old Diſpenſation of the
Jews: He makes a Compariſon all along betwixt one and the
other, and prefers one in a high degree before the other; by all
which it may be plainly underſtood, Chriſts Reign is after a
Spiritual Prieſtly manner; and if it had not, it had never been
put ſo much in oppoſition againſt the Whore; and as for the
Temporal Power, He delegates that to whom He pleaſes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of it ſo thorough the whole time of the <hi>Millennium;</hi> that
no King or Potentate in the World, ſhall be able to diſturb or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61150:28"/>
hurt his True Church: The Bride has a Husband, inveſted with
all Power in Heaven and in Earth, and is ſufficient to maintain
her againſt all Whoriſh, Beaſtly or Satannical Uſurpations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
and He will uſe all his power to Cheriſh and Careſs her,
to compenſate her Sufferings under former Uſurpations during his
Minority: He diſpoſes his Power ſo, that the Kings of the Earth
bring their Glory and Honour, and lay it in her Lap; this is
but their Duty, and as I may ſay, a Tythe to this Royal <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck,</hi>
who to requite their kind Protection and Kindneſs to his
Spouſe, Bleſſes them, as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> of old did <hi>Abraham;</hi> and
<hi>this bringing their Glory and Honour into it,</hi> ſtands in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that Evil Treatment and Barbarous Affronts, the Kings
of the Earth of Old put upon her, who butchered her Servants
as Sheep for the Slaughter; for which vile Indignities, <hi>He</hi> now
takes Revenge, <hi>and caſts the Beaſt and the Whore into the Burning
Lake.</hi> Men may raiſe many Mountains of Difficulties againſt
this <hi>New Jeruſalem:</hi> But hear what God ſaith, <hi>Who art thou, O
great Mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou ſhalt become a Plain; And
He ſhall bring forth the Head-Stone thereof with ſhouting, crying, Grace,
Grace. Joſhua</hi> is brought in by the Prophet ſtanding before the
Angel in filthy Garments, and Satan at his right Hand; and the
filthy Raiment is taken away, and he is cloathed with Prieſtly
Raiments, and a Miter ſet upon his Head. <hi>Joſhua</hi> here is the
Repreſentative of the Witneſſes in Sackcloth, or the Suffering
Church in the Old Diſpenſation: And <hi>Satan</hi> ſeems to be angry
that ſhe ſhould be delivered from his Tyranny; and ſtands by,
and accuſes her of all thoſe Backſlidings which he has tempted
her to; and, as it were, infers from thence that ſhe is unworthy
to be delivered; But God rebukes him: <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, O
Satan; even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem rebuke thee: Is not
this a Brand pluck'd out of the fire?</hi> This Rebuke, is that <hi>Great
Battel</hi> fought by the <hi>WORD</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> in which <hi>Satan</hi> is Defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Virgin-Church Delivered out of his Clutches, and
a Crown or Miter ſet upon her Head: The Text ſaith; <hi>They
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61150:29"/>
Lived and Reigned as Prieſts with Chriſt a Thouſand Years;</hi> That is,
all the time which <hi>Satan</hi> and his Accomplices lay under the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
Rebuke.</p>
               <p>By this Pair of Witneſſes, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> is plainly
hinted to us how the <hi>Millennium</hi> will Commence: <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is
to overthrow all the Powers or Mountains of Oppoſition, and ſo
the Church Regenerate is Deliver'd, and he is to aſſiſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> in
the Eſtabliſhment of her; for it is ſaid, <hi>The Counſel of Peace is
betwixt them hoth.</hi> The Text ſaith, That <hi>The Man whoſe Name
is The BRANCH, ſhall riſe out of his Place and build the Temple</hi> (or
City:) I know not how to make Chriſt come from <hi>Heaven</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
to build this Temple; I know <hi>He</hi> is the Root and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo may be called a <hi>Branch,</hi> but all his Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is of a Spiritual Nature: he builds up his Church Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
conferring Spiritual Gifts and Graces upon his Maſter-Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whom he employs in the Work: But it is plain, that this
Building is to be Material, and therefore requires a Man upon
Earth to do it. I am no <hi>Theologue,</hi> and if I ſhould be miſtaken,
may be excuſed; but I cannot remember that the <hi>NAME</hi> of
<hi>Branch</hi> is attributed peculiarly to Chriſt any where elſe in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
The Angel ſaith, <hi>His Name ſhall be called Jeſus;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place 'tis ſaid, <hi>His Name ſhall be called Emanuel, God with us;</hi>
and, <hi>Wonderful Counſellor,</hi> &amp;c. This Text points directly to the
<hi>Mans NAME,</hi> and to the Manner and Circumſtance of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
It ſaith, <hi>He ſhall riſe out of his Place,</hi> implying an Aſcent
to <hi>Honour: David</hi> roſe out of his <hi>Place,</hi> being but a Shepherd,
and he overthrew the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and all the Enemies of God's
Church round about: And <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> roſe out of his <hi>Place,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a Threſher, and he caſt down <hi>Baal</hi>'s Worſhip, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and ſettled the People of God in Peace.
This <hi>Man the Branch,</hi> if he could be found, muſt be attended
with the like Circumſtances, becauſe there is the ſame buſineſs
to be done: The <hi>Baalitiſh</hi> or <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Worſhip is to be thrown
down, and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and all other Enemies of God's Church,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61150:29"/>
to be overcome; <hi>The Kingdoms of this World becoming the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt finds the World in great Confuſion, and his Church
much oppreſſed, and therefore wants a Man to overturn his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and to Deliver his Church from Oppreſſion: Therefore he
raiſes ſome Man or other <hi>out of his Place,</hi> to perform this, as God
did <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>David</hi> of old.</p>
               <p>Now there is a Man riſen out of his place, and is already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
this Great Work; on Him Chriſt has delegated the
Firſt Fruits of his Power in his <hi>Millennian</hi> Kingdom: <hi>He alſo
roſe out of his Place,</hi> in another ſence, being a <hi>Poſthume:</hi> His Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
is alſo from a thing that grows out of the Earth, or
out of its place. And ſo it is ordained that He who ſhould be
the firſt Introducer of the <hi>Millennian</hi> Kingdom, ſhould not have
his Name from a <hi>Fierce Ravenous Creature,</hi> by which Beaſtly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
all the preceding Monarchies were repreſented, but from
a <hi>Tree;</hi> A Tree, next to the Olive Tree, the only Emblem of
Peace and Proſperity in the World; For the nature of it is ſuch,
that it has always Fruit upon it, either New or Old, and often
both together: This happy Emblem is choſen to repreſent to us
the moſt flouriſhing and happy State of the <hi>Millennium;</hi> and
poſſibly that this Nation ſhall never want one to ſit upon his
Throne. After the cutting down our Harveſt, and the Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Old Powers, <hi>Saul</hi> was our firſt King, who though
under great Obligations did nothing; the laſt, was only an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalation;
But this ſeems to be our <hi>David,</hi> that muſt do the
Work.</p>
               <p>Now I have brought the Monarchy to a Tree, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to enlarge more upon the Name of <hi>Branch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt Head of the Fifth or Weſtern Monarchy, ought to
be a great Hunter, to drive the wild Boar out of the Vineyard,
and chace the Lions, the Leopards, and Bears, out of the Forreſt,
that the Flocks of God may feed and lie down in ſafety. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
theſe Beaſts of Prey have made ſad Deſolation and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61150:30"/>
vock amongſt the Lords Heritage: <hi>Conſtantine</hi> once drove them
out, but they came in <hi>Agatn:</hi> But <hi>Now</hi> the Promiſe is, They
ſhall not live <hi>Again.</hi> Great God, when will this <hi>Great Battel</hi>
come? But come it certainly will, and then theſe Beaſts ſhall be
for ever driven out. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>The reſt of the Beaſts had their
DOMINION taken away;</hi> That is, they were civilly kill'd.</p>
               <p>The laſt Tyrannical Scene of Lions, Leopards and Bears, being
withdrawn, the next is, <hi>A Fair and Beautiful Forreſt;</hi> and this
comes of courſe: There are now no Inhabitants in the Forreſt
of the World, but <hi>Trees;</hi> the wild Beaſts had driven out the
Flocks before; and now They Themſelves being driven out, the
<hi>Trees</hi> only are left. The <hi>Millennium</hi> enters of courſe, and a
Beautiful Forreſt is the firſt Scene. And then the firſt Tree
that appears, which is to have the chief Dominion, is The
<hi>Meinreb</hi> or <hi>Vitis;</hi> The Second is, The <hi>Pomerancenbaum,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Aſſyria;</hi> one is to be the <hi>Adminiculum</hi> or <hi>Pedimentum</hi> to the
other: This laſt with its Golden Fruit introduces the Golden
Age. This in behalf of the Vine is made the firſt King of the
Trees; <hi>This</hi> has a preference to all the Trees in the Forreſt, and
has the <hi>First</hi> Commiſſion of <hi>Power</hi> granted him from the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Lord in Chief, in the Firſt Reſurrection of Power.</p>
               <p>Which Tree may next be preferred, I cannot tell: <hi>All Power
being Chriſts,</hi> He chooſes whom he pleaſes. But this I can tell,
The laſt in Succeſſion, when <hi>Satan</hi> is looſed, muſt be <hi>ſome Vile
Bramble,</hi> only fit to be burnt; becauſe, ſuggeſted by <hi>Satan,</hi> he
attempts a Rape upon the Spouſe of Chriſt, the beloved City;
So he and his fellow Brambles are all burn'd with Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And in all probability this New and Laſt <hi>Aera</hi> will hold
Analogy to the laſt Expired Monarchies; We ſhall have the <hi>Beſt
Trees firſt,</hi> and the worſt at laſt, as is intimated by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
Image; <hi>Whoſe Head was of fine Gold, his Breſt and his Arms
of Silver, his Belly and his Thighs of Braſs, his Legs of Iron, his Feet
part of Iron, and part of Clay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if Men ſhould object againſt this <hi>New Emblem</hi> of Power,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61150:30"/>
They ought to conſider, the <hi>Old Tree</hi> of Monarchy being cut
down, a <hi>New One</hi> ought to grow in its Room. The Beaſtly
Monarchies Expiring, and the Kingdom of the Forreſt Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the Powers, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, are no more to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Emblem of Beaſts of Prey, but of <hi>Trees,</hi> whoſe Leaves
are for Shade and Protection, and Fruit for Profit and Delight;
and therefore moſt proper to repreſent the moſt Glorious Reign
of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> all whoſe Officers ſhall be Peace, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors
Righteouſneſs. But the old Tree being cut down, and
the Stump left in the Ground, there muſt be ſome time allowed
for another Tree to grow up, and before it can be a <hi>Tree,</hi> it muſt
firſt be a <hi>zweig,</hi> a <hi>Surculus,</hi> in Engliſh a <hi>Branch:</hi> The <hi>Old</hi> (Vine,
the <hi>Old</hi> Church, or <hi>Old</hi> Tree of Life and Power of the Goſpel,
has been cut down, as alſo the Old Tree of Power or Monarchy,
and two New <hi>Branches</hi> ſprouts out. Theſe <hi>Two Branches</hi> grow
up together, the latter being the ſupport and ſtrength of the
former, which is tender, and weak, and needs Aſſiſtance; All
the World knows the Nature of a young Vine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this leads me to the underſtanding of two</hi> Texts <hi>which
has been hid from Ages, but now Revealed to the Glory of
God in due time:</hi> Jer. 23. 5. Behold the Days come, ſaith the Lord,
that I will raiſe unto David a Righteous BRANCH; (And a King
ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute Judgment and Juſtice upon
Earth: In his Days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſreal ſhall dwell ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
And this is his Name whereby he ſhall be called, The LORD our
RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESS: <hi>Zach.</hi> 6. 12. Behold the Man whoſe
Name is the BRANCH, and HE ſhall grow up out of his Place, And
He shall build the Temple of the Lord, even HE (<hi>becauſe there is
two</hi>) shall build the Temple of the Lord, and He ſhall bear the
Clory, and ſhall ſit and rule upon his Throne; And HE ſhall be a
Prieſt upon his Throne; And the Counſel of Peace ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them BOTH. <hi>Firſt there is a</hi> Righteous Branch <hi>born to</hi>
David; <hi>this is the Spiritual Birth of Chriſt in the Church Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
or his New-Riſen-Witneſſes: This cannot be himſelf</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61150:31"/>
Perſonally, for he ſaith, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches.</hi> Then
there is a King which ſhall reign and proſper, and execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Juſtice upon the Earth; And in <hi>His</hi> days <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall
be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell ſafely: And this King ſhall give
the <hi>Name,</hi> or be Godfather, as it were, to the Righteous <hi>Branch.</hi>
And as if he ſhould ask what Name? The Spirit ſeems to make
Anſwer, <hi>This is the Name whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD
OUR RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now nothing is more plain and evident, than that the <hi>Name</hi>
of the Lord our Righteouſneſs, is not the <hi>Name</hi> of the Man
whoſe Name is the <hi>Branch,</hi> for they are plainly <hi>Two Names,</hi> one
is called the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the other is called the <hi>Man.</hi> The <hi>Man</hi>
whoſe Name is the <hi>Branch,</hi> is <hi>That King</hi> which ſhall reign and
proſper, and execute Judgment and Juſtice upon Earth; the <hi>Text</hi>
levels directly at his <hi>Name Apellative:</hi> Now what King has ſuch
an Apellative Name, I leave to the World to Judge. But if Men
ſhall ſay they are both one, they very much miſtake, for the
Text is plain and expreſs to the contrary, making <hi>Two</hi> of them,
ſaying, <hi>The Connſel of Peace ſhall be betwixt them both.</hi> The <hi>One</hi>
ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, and ſhall bear the Glory, and
ſit and Rule upon his Throne; and the <hi>Other</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Prieſt</hi>
upon his Throne; <hi>And the Counfel of Peace ſhall be betwixt them
both.</hi> How the Tranſlators have ordered it, I know not, but the
thing is ſelf-evident, that there is an <hi>Hic &amp; Ille</hi> in the caſe, tho'
they have render'd it He and He. God ſaith He will create a
new thing upon Earth, <hi>A Woman shall compaſs a Man;</hi> as this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to a common birth, 'tis no new thing: This compaſſing a
Man, I know may very well be applied to the Firſt Birth, but
more particularly to this Second, this young tender Branch cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
round, or encircling its <hi>Pedimentum,</hi> expreſſed by <hi>the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of Peace being betwixt them both;</hi> the State being then the
Husband or Guardian to the Church. But here is ſomething far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intended by the Newneſs of this thing; 'Tis not cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the Woman to careſs the Man, for the Church to be above
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61150:31"/>
the State; But in the <hi>Millennium</hi> the Church ſhall rather be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt,
and therefore may be ſaid to <hi>compaſs the Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that this King that ſhall reign and proſper, is not <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Caeſar,</hi> nor the <hi>Righteous Branch,</hi> but purely <hi>He,</hi> the Man
whoſe <hi>Name</hi> is the Branch, I have this further to offer: The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>
gave ſpecial order what the Name of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Birth ſhould
be, ſaying, <hi>His Name ſhall be called JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> Now we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſame Birth to have <hi>Two</hi> Names, therefore the Name of
<hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be the Name of the
<hi>Second</hi> Birth, the Birth Spiritual, or of his New-Riſen-Body,
the Church Regenerate. Again, The Name of Righteous, ſpeaks
ſo much Sanctity and Holineſs, as cannot well be given to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince. And that <hi>This</hi> King which ſhall reign and proſper,
is not <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> is plain, becauſe it ſaith, <hi>In his Days Judah
ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely:</hi> Now all the World knows
that in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and the Firſt Birth, the Jews
were far from dwelling ſafely, they were under Bondage, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little while utterly exterminated; therefore <hi>This Name of
the Lord our Righteouſneſs</hi> muſt relate to a <hi>Second</hi> Birth, in a little
time after which, the Jews ſhall be Saved and return home.</p>
               <p>To ſum up the whole, <hi>Behold, the Days come, ſaith the Lord,
that I will raiſe unto David,</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>a Righteous Branch; And a King
ſhall reign and proſper, and execute Judgment and Juſtice upon Earth;
and in HIS Days Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely:</hi>
This King, &amp;c. ſeems to come in by a Parentheſis; as if he ſhould
ſay, The time of the birth of the Righteous Branch ſhall be in
the Days of ſuch a Kings Reign, in whoſe Reign <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be
ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell ſafely; and then the Parentheſis is
ſhut up, and the Childs Name given. And when 'tis ſaid that
Kings ſhall be <hi>Nurſing-Fathers,</hi> and Queens the <hi>Nurſing-Mothers</hi> of
Chriſts Church, this ſuppoſes <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Childhood,</hi> and is more
particularly applicable to the birth of the Church Regenerate;
for when the Old Jewiſh Church was brought to bed of the
Chriſtian, the Kings were ſo far from <hi>Nurſing</hi> the Child, that
they would have <hi>ſtrangled</hi> it: And therefore this Promiſe muſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61150:32"/>
relate to the birth of the Church Regenerate, or none at all. This
Child or Righteous Branch was born in the Firſt Year of the
Reign of the King that began to Reign and Proſper; <hi>viz. Anno</hi>
1689. And the Time of its being baptized with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or
<hi>Power from on High,</hi> is juſt at hand, and He is to be its Nurſing-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Royal God-Father, and to call it, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
And the Counſel of Peace ſhall be betwixt them both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo this difficult Text is, by the Grace and Aſſiſtance of
God, plainly ſolved; and the Event thereof, will ſpeedily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
its Truth: And then <hi>Judah</hi> will be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> will
dwell ſafely; for as the <hi>Former</hi> pouring out of the Spirit did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe
them, <hi>This</hi> will collect and gather them. The Text is plain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> tells the Jews how long they ſhall be under Tribulation
and Miſery, viz. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Spirit be poured on us from on High, and
the Wilderneſs</hi> (the Church in the Wilderneſs) <hi>be a Fruitful Field</hi>
(be Regenerate) <hi>and the Fruitful Field be counted for a Forreſt.</hi> The
Temporal Power is the Forreſt, which incloſes and guards the
Fruitful Field of the Church. When this comes to paſs, which
is juſt at hand, it will confirm and ſufficiently ratifie what I have
aſſerted. The bleſſed Pentecoſt cannot be far off, it muſt needs
be at the Door; and I deſire all good Men to prepare themſelves
for it, but eſpecially the <hi>New-Riſen-Witneſſes,</hi> on whom the
Great Deſcent will be. This will Arm all the World againſt the
<hi>Wild Beaſts of the Forreſt,</hi> that the Arborical Reign may be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd.
The Church hitherto has been in the Wilderneſs, but
when the Spirit deſcends, it will be a <hi>Fruitſul Field,</hi> and yet will
be <hi>counted for a Forreſt.</hi> The Great Deſcent opens the Fountain,
which by a New Predication will quickly over-ſpread the World.
This River ſhall receive no ſtop by the way, as the laſt. <hi>Satan</hi>
being bound, it ſhall run over all the High Mountains. <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
ſaith, <hi>And there shall be upon every high Mountain, and upon every
high Hill, Rivers and Streams of Waters, in the Day of the Grees
Slaughter when the Towers fall.</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Every Plant which
my Heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up;</hi> and this is
the time of rooting up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61150:32"/>
But God never pulls down, but he builds up; &amp; where he reaps,
he ſows: The falling of theſe Towers is nothing elſe but driving
the wild Beaſts out of the Forreſt, an overthrowing the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nsh</hi>
Kings, and their Buildings; and this is done by the <hi>Sword:</hi>
Then comes the <hi>Word,</hi> implied by theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> and inſtructs
and informs them in the Ways of the New Diſpenſation. This
is the laſt Diſpenſation, which hitherto was <hi>to come.</hi> The Text
ſaith, <hi>We give Thee thanks, Lord God Almighty, who art, and waſt, and
at TO COME.</hi> This is that World or Diſpenſation <hi>to come,</hi> which
the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of. It therefore being <hi>now come,</hi>
no more is to be expected.</p>
               <p>Four do not bear Record in Heaven, only <hi>Three,</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> the
Word, and the <hi>Spirit;</hi> And God having applied himſelf to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
Men by <hi>Three</hi> ſeveral Methods, they can in Reaſon expect
nothing elſe: And therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>He that is filthy, let
him be filthy ſtill; and he that is Holy, let him be Holy ſtill;</hi> implying
thereby, that no more Attempts would be made to reclaim them.
The firſt Approximation was by Angels, very Terrible, <hi>above
them;</hi> the Second, by Fleſh, more Familiar and Kind, yet <hi>without</hi>
them; the Laſt, by his Spirit, comes neareſt of all, even <hi>within</hi>
them. This is a moſt Gracious Approach, and will leave the
whole World without Excuſe: Men need not ſtep out of Doors
for any thing, they have all things at home.</p>
               <p>In the Propagation of this laſt Diſpenſation, there will be no
ſuch Martyrdoms as before, the bloody Beaſts are driven out, or
chained up; <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and all things are bcome
New.</hi> The Martyrdom will lie <hi>inward,</hi> a renouncing Self, and
the World, and a crucifying the Affections and Luſts. Nothing
henceforward can hurt Gods True Church, for Chriſt preſides
over the Forreſtial Kingdoms and makes Kings the <hi>Nurſing</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Queens the <hi>Nurſing-Mothers</hi> thereof: 'Tis ſaid, <hi>The
Kings of the Earth ſhall bring their Glory and Honour into it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis an amazing thing to obſerve how tenacious Men are of
their Old Models, thinking that God will build ſo laſting an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61150:33"/>
as that of his Son, upon ſuch rotten and weak Foundations;
Whereas he has publickly declared to all the World, that he
would make all things New. Let them henceforward think of
nothing elſe but of being broken to pieces by the <hi>Stone out of the
Mountain.</hi> The whole Civil and Eccleſiaſtical World is now in the
Crucible, and the Fire of Gods Wrath will quickly melt it down,
and make it ready for a New Impreſſion. The Angel has his
Sword in his Hand, and only wants the Word to fall on. Chriſt
has granted his Royal Pattent to his Church, <hi>it wants only the
Sealing, and the Wax is juſt now a melting;</hi> When 'tis Sealed,
when the Complex Birth is Circumciſed, or the Child Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Baptized (with the Spirit I mean) Then all the World ſhall
know, <hi>That the Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of
the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> They are truly and really His now;
<hi>And never a Tree in the Forreſt has any Legal Power, but One;</hi> But
this World knows not; But then they ſhall; And all the Reſt
ſhall be found to be Uſurpers. Then wo to <hi>Herod!</hi> Wo to <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah</hi>
and <hi>Zalmunnah!</hi> For the Sword of the Lord and of <hi>Gideon</hi>
ſhall do mighty things. Then the Kingdom of the Foreſt will
enter, and every Man will be a Soldier to help to kill the wild
Beaſts: Every Man then ſhall underſtand what is meant by the
Man whoſe <hi>Name</hi> is the <hi>Branch;</hi> And ſhall confeſs that God has
given him for a Witneſs to the People, a Leader and Commander
to the People.</p>
               <p>I care not to perplex the Reader with Numbers: When the
Sun is up, there is no occaſion to ask when he Riſes: Yet I could
do it very exactly. But this is anothers Province.</p>
               <p>Before I Conclude, I muſt deſire the following Writers to take
particular notice of what I have wrote.</p>
               <p>The One is an Ingenious Man, but more a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
than a Divine:<note place="margin">T. Burnet.</note> He melts down the World
Literally, inſtead of its Civil Frame: This is moſt
Cruel and Inhoſpitable: There might have been ſome better
Correction found out, than to burn Mens Houſes about their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61150:33"/>
Ears: and Some Better Entertainment, for wearied Gueſts and
Strangers, than to fall on them and kill them in their Lodging;
'tis not cuſtomary to turn men off, before They have ſaid their
Prayers: The Millennium is the Repentance of the world: The
Counterpart of a Voyage: The Reverſion of an Eſtate after an
others deceaſe: But He cuts off the Entail; Sinks the Veſſel in
the Harbour; kills the weary Traveller, and allows the Penitent
no Benifit of the Clergy. 'Tis the cuſtom of a Skilful Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to Break his Metal before He caſts it a new: The Stone out
of the Mountain, is ſaid to break the metal Image of the Four
Monarchies to pieces: This Breaking to pieces, is nothing but
the unravelling of all the Conſtitutions upon Earth: Now,
Had He well conſidered This, I Believe He would have left us
our Good Old world ſtanding, during the Time of the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium:
For there is no doubt but It would Laſt us much longer
were the Heavy weight of Mens Iniquities Swept off.</p>
               <p>The Other is more a Divine than a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;
and would have Chriſt to come Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
and his Saints with him,<note place="margin">T. Beverly.</note> and to Live and
Rule with him in a Heavenly Court over us, in the Air, dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Thouſand Years: and to have The Dead-Riſen Saints to
hold a Coreſpondence and Commerce with the Saints that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
alive below upon Earth; as plainly appears by his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichiſm
and other of his writings. Now having ſo plainly
and fully proved The Firſt Reſurrection not to be Literal, there
needs no more to be ſaid in Confutation. This Caſtle in the
Air (as He himſelfe makes it) will quickly vaniſh. The Man
is a Pious and Good Man, and has Great Communications of
Light, But, <hi>Humanum eſt Errare.</hi> 'Tis much more probable,
That Chriſt will appear in an <hi>ORAC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LAR</hi> manner as in
the Temple of old, rather than in a Perſonal: On This account
He is called Wonderful <hi>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NCELLOR,</hi> &amp;c. And The Prophet
Saith Men ſhall Say no more The <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RDEN</hi> of The Lord,
But what hath The Lord <hi>ANSWERED.</hi> This plainly Implies
That He is to be Sought to for Councel and Advice, And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
The Name of The City be, The Lord is <hi>There,</hi> Yet
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61150:34"/>
                  <hi>an Oracular</hi> Preſence is more Suitable to Reaſon, Scripture, and
Gods former Methods, than a Perſonal.</p>
               <p>The Laſt, is (if alive) A Good Philoſopher
and Divine,<note place="margin">M. Jurieu.</note> But a Bad Mariner (Though at
<hi>Roterdam</hi>) and a worſe Husbandman. For He
makes His Veſſel to return back, before it comes to its ordained
Port: Empire and The Goſpel, ought to Sail to the Extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Parts before They Return. He makes alſo His Witneſſes
to Riſe <hi>BARE GRAIN,</hi> Whereas 'tis <hi>Firſt</hi> to rot in the Ground

'Tis well known <hi>France</hi> is not the Extreameſt Nation,
The Witneſſes therefore, could not <hi>Riſe There:</hi> The Extruſion
of the Poor Reffugies was only an Act of Secretion By Him
who has his Fan in his hand, who being unwilling to have the
Wheat and Chaff burned together, diſperſed them abroad, not
for their Ruine but their Safety; <hi>Sodom</hi> could not be deſtroyed
till Theſe <hi>Lots</hi> were gone out. And Now The Fatal Day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
The French Tyrant was Raiſed up, on purpoſe to be
thrown down, and made Great, that Neighbour of his might
be made Greater: But this runs me on another Subject.</p>
               <p>I Freely acknowledge, that what I have wrote on theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is <hi>New,</hi> But this gives it a title to Truth, Since all who have
hitherto wrote on the Same Points, have been miſtaken. Now
if Perſons would but lay aſide their Prejudices to Cauſes and
Perſons and conſider of things ſincerely, and impartially, I doubt
not but they would confeſs, that I have made good The Title,
and that Theſe things will remain no longer a Myſtery to all
Generations. To God be the Praiſe and Glory, <hi>who hath hid
theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and Revealed them unto
Babes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANd I ſaw another Mighty Angel come down from Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
comes on a Solemn Embaſſy from the Mighty God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Garb is very magnificent, He is clothed with a Cloud, has a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
on his head, his face is like the Sun, and his feet as Pillars of Fire: The
Great Buſineſs of his Embaſſy, is to inſtruct The World in the Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of TIME, and to Commence a NEW Diſpenſation, Which is <hi>firſt</hi> to
be Publiſhed throughout the world, and <hi>then</hi> TIME <hi>is to be no longer.</hi> This
NEW Diſpenſation is plainly intimated in the Commiſſion He gives to
<hi>John,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou muſt Prophecy</hi> AGAIN <hi>Before Many People,</hi> &amp;c. The
Open Book in his hand, is The Book of the OLD Diſpenſation: and
his Commanding <hi>John</hi> to eat it up, is the <hi>Cancelling</hi> of it, and The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing
a New One. This Solemn Act of eating it up, lays it up in a ſafe
place, that Man may come at it at all times, and ſo renders him inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
before the Great Judge. The King is come himſelf, The WORD
is upon his White Horſe, and though We may regard his Picture in his
abſence and call it The King, yet to call The Written Word <hi>ſo</hi> in his
<hi>Preſence</hi> is ſomething unmannerly. I have a due value for The <hi>Written</hi>
Word of God, But a <hi>much greater</hi> for The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or The ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL
WORD, The One is The <hi>Original,</hi> The other is but The <hi>Copy.</hi>
WORDS Printed or writen are but <hi>painted,</hi> And we have had a great
many unhappy Artiſts, who have made The Copy very differing from
The Original: Some of The Draughts look more like <hi>J—</hi> than <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
The True <hi>word</hi> is only <hi>Audible</hi> and not <hi>viſible:</hi> No man yet ever <hi>ſaw</hi>
words only <hi>heard</hi> them: Therefore what is written or Painted in our
Books cannot be The <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Real</hi> word. Before The Marriage 'Tis uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to ſend The <hi>Picture,</hi> But when The Bridegroom comes, 'tis laid aſide.
If it be asked, how we ſhall diſtinguiſh? I Anſwer, The Spirit is our Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and The <hi>Bride</hi> knows Her <hi>Lord.</hi> But to Return to The Angel: His Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
is all Hiroglyphick, and plainly declares, in what part of the world he
delivers his Errand <hi>viz,</hi> in the Weſt. 'Tis the Setting Sun of the Goſpel which
ſets under a Cloud: when The Sun is ſetting, 'tis uſual to ſee the Rayes dart
down on the Sea and Earth like Pillars of Fire: Before, The Church was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
<hi>without,</hi> but under This <hi>New</hi> Diſpenſation, She is all-glorious <hi>with
in,</hi> Her State is <hi>now</hi> inverted: And This Angel coming to proclaim a New
Diſpenſation and to uſher in The Refreſhing Times, is Clothed with a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61150:35"/>
Cloud, which is a Symbol both of Change and Refreſhment. The Eaſtern
Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining on the Weſtern Cloud makes The Rainbow,
which is a very Comfortable Symbol, and aſſures us God is mindful of his
Promiſe, which Promiſe He Performes by Renewing all The Old Eaſtern
Images in the weſt: For the Death, Birth, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of
Chriſt are <hi>again</hi> Renewed in His Witneſſes or Church Regenerate: And
Theſe Things being <hi>ſtrange</hi> to The world are appointed to be Publiſhed:
<hi>John</hi> Therefore is Commanded by The Angel to <hi>Prophecy</hi> AGAIN.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And He cryed with a loud voice as when a Lyon roareth.</hi> He comes from the
Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and therefore ſpeaks in his Maſters Language;
But beſides His Embaſſy being to all the World, ſhould He not cry a loud
He would not be heard. <hi>And when He had cryed, Seven Thunders uttered their
Voices, &amp;c.</hi> Since theſe Thunders are ſealed, I will not be too buſie with
them, 'tis probable they are the Seven years of the Seventh Angels ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betwixt the Second and Third Woe, which are a Myſtery till the
Laſt Blaſt. <hi>And ſtanding on The Sea and upon The Earth He lift up his hand
and ſwore by Him That liveth for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. I Never ſee The Sun
Setting under a Cloud with his Feet like Pillars of Fire, but it puts me into
a Fit of devotion, <hi>Thinking</hi> of The Moſt Solemn Oath of This Angel,
which puts a diſmal Cataſtrophe to The World. The Great God who
is Juſt in all his ways, and Holy in all his works, is unwilling to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
The world; and therefore ſends a ſpecial Meſſage to Mankind by
This Angel, to acquaint them, that after ſuch a Time, <hi>TIME</hi> ſhould be
<hi>no longer;</hi> And That He may be Believed, He Confirms it with an Oath,
that which a more Tremendous and Solemn One was never ſworn.</p>
               <p>Now ſince He has been ſo kind to ſend a Special Embaſſador, 'Tis worth
our while to hear, and conſider well of his Meſſage. His Oath is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
and Indefinite, That <hi>TIME ſhould be no longer,</hi> BVT, &amp;c. <hi>But In The
Days of The voice of The Seventh Angel, when He ſhall</hi> BEGIN <hi>to ſound, The
Myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed, as He hath declared to his Servants The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
Here is no mention made of <hi>Time, Times, and half a Time,</hi> as by the
Angel in <hi>Daniel,</hi> under The ſounding of The Sixth Trumpet, But The
Death of CRONOS, or <hi>TIME Indefinite,</hi> is poſitively Swore to; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
CRONOS, All The <hi>Tempeſtates,</hi> or Species of Time what ſoever are
comprehended: Having Swore his Death ſo ſolemnly, one would have
thought The Angel would preſently have fell upon The Aged Monſter,
But He gives him a <hi>little</hi> Reſpite, coming in with a BUT, or an Exception,
which <hi>Semper firmat Regulam; But,</hi> Saith He, <hi>In The Days of the voice of
The Seveath Angel</hi> (Reckoning Theſe Days from the very Time) <hi>when
He ſhall</hi> Begin <hi>to ſound,</hi> &amp;c. Did I Say He gave him Reſpite? He gave him
none, but killed Him <hi>then,</hi> and Raiſed Him <hi>again</hi> to life: The Oath flew
both Him and his Iſſue. TIME, <hi>here</hi> is of a Complex nature and may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61150:35"/>
be ſupoſed a She Monſter, And being Pregnant, The Angel rips
open the Belly and lets the Young live out all their DAYS, which had
otherwiſe periſhed in The Womb of Their Parent: But Though Theſe
<hi>POST HUMES</hi> live, yet Their life is only a Reprieve after Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for They are not to propagate, Their Death being <hi>really</hi> ſwore to
in the Death of their Parent: This BUT, <hi>limits</hi> their Life, which is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>All The Days</hi> under the Sounding of the Seventh Angel.</p>
               <p>Some Pious Men amongſt us, underſtand <hi>TIME</hi> here, in a Relative and
Reſtrictive ſenſe, affirming that The Angel means no more, than that
ſome of the ſame quality or ſort ſhould be <hi>no longer,</hi> than the Beginning
of the Angels ſounding; which Interpretation, though acidentally true,
yet falls much ſhort of The Angels Oath, being only a <hi>part</hi> of his plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable
ſenſe: For nothing is more plain than that the Senſe extends
it ſelf farther, even to the <hi>END</hi> of the <hi>Days,</hi> and conſequently to The
<hi>END</hi> of the world: The Text at the very entrance, confirms <hi>this,</hi>
making The <hi>Hyſteron,</hi> the <hi>Proteron,</hi> or Puting The <hi>Days</hi> before The <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>
plainly implying thereby, That we are to include <hi>All</hi> The days
under The Angels ſounding, before his Oath of <hi>Time being no longer,</hi> can
take place: We cannot ſuppoſe, that God would ſend ſo Extraordinary
in Embaſſador to The world, on ſuch a ſlight Errand, as to acquaint
them, That when The Sixth Hour was paſt, it would be Seven a clock,
or that The Time under The Sixth Trumpet, ſhould laſt <hi>no longer</hi> than
The <hi>Beginning</hi> of The Seventh; Such a Meſſage would be very unworthy
ſo Great a Courtier; And was his Buſineſs to tell us, That The Time
in the ſixth Hour would not be <hi>The ſame for quality,</hi> with That in The
Seventh; This would not add much to the Dignity of His Office.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, <hi>TIME</hi> Ends not (as is vulgarly ſuppoſed) when The Angel
BEGINS to Sound, But at the Expiration of the whole Days under his
Sounding: And the Angels Chief Errand is to point out to Men The PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOD
of The world, And The END of Time: And Methinks I hear
Him Speaking to The world after <hi>This manner.</hi> 
                  <q>YE Sons of Men Take
Notice, The Old Glaſs of Time (<hi>viz.</hi> of 1260) is juſt run out; And
I Am Sent to Turn it, And I Here Turn it in The Preſence of you
All, And do Swear, By The Living God who Liveth for ever and ever,
That It ſhall never be turnd <hi>more,</hi> But when The Sands are run out, or
when The Days of the voice are <hi>Ended,</hi> (Reckoning Them from the
<hi>Beginning</hi> of his Sounding, or <hi>Tuning</hi> of his Trumpet) <hi>Then,</hi> The Glaſs
ſhall be broke, and TIME, (of whatſoever Denomination) ſhall never be
Meaſured <hi>more,</hi> but be ſwallowed up, in the Great Ocean of <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </q>
Two Things The Reader muſt Note. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>That</hi> TIME which
The Angel ſwears the <hi>Death</hi> of, is of a Simple and indefinite nature: and
that The <hi>Time</hi> which He <hi>Excepts</hi> is of a Complex nature, Becauſe there
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61150:36"/>
are <hi>Days</hi> in it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That The Angel is <hi>Seven year</hi> in ſounding
<hi>viz,</hi> Betwixt The Second and Third Woe. Theſe things being premiſed
Though there may be ſo me ſeeming difficulty <hi>when</hi> to Commence The
<hi>Excepted</hi> Time, and <hi>when</hi> it Ends, or Expires: Yet <hi>really,</hi> There will be
none at all.: For We are to <hi>Begin</hi> Theſe <hi>Excepted</hi> Days, <hi>Not</hi> when The
Angel has ſounded or <hi>done</hi> ſounding, But when He <hi>Begins</hi> to ſound: Not
When The Clock has ſtruck all, But at The very <hi>Firſt</hi> ſtroke of Seven:
The Text is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Quum futurum eſt ut Clangat:</hi> That is,
When He ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> begin, or be <hi>about</hi> to begin to ſound: The very <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
his Trumpet, or his <hi>Preparing</hi> himſelf to ſound, comes into The
Account. 'Tis uſual to ſay, T'is Seven a Clock, when it has ſtruck Seven;
But This is our Errour, For it was seven at the <hi>Firſt</hi> ſtroke: at that very
Inſtant, when The Sixth Hour Lapſed, or The Second Woe to The True
Church <hi>Ended.</hi> The Reign of a King Commenceth, <hi>Not</hi> from the Time
of his Proclamation; But, From The <hi>Exact</hi> Time of His Predeceſſors
Death. There is no Interregnum, Time being <hi>not</hi> diſcontinued: So The
Reign of Chriſt Commenceth, from the very moment of the Angels
<hi>Beginning</hi> to ſound, which was in The Later part of 1688, When The
Witneſſes Roſe. The Spirit puts an Emphaſis on The word <hi>beginning,</hi>
God being unwilling that Men ſhould be ignorant, of the Exact Epoche
of Chriſts Reign: Becauſe it is The <hi>Index,</hi> which points out The Final
Day of Judgment. Now, In The ſecond Place, How long Theſe
<hi>Excepted Dayes</hi> will Laſt, or when they will Expire, and Time be Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
is alike plain, and manifeſt: For, The Sands In The upper part
of the Glaſs, will be no longer in runing, than in the lower part: The
Leaſe of The Bride, (If The Indentures be compared) will be found to be
cut out of the Same ſheet of Time, with that of the Whores: Now The
Whores Leaſe, was for 1260 Years, or Time, Time, and halfe a Time;
under the Sounding of the Sixth Angel: And The Brides, under the
Sounding of the Seventh, will be the Same, <hi>viz,</hi> 1000, for The Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,
and 260, for The Little Seaſon, In which, Satan ſhall be Looſed,
which Ballances exactly. <hi>Then,</hi> Time ſhall be no longer. The Turning
the Laſt Glaſs, or the Angels <hi>Begining</hi> to ſound, Is the <hi>Finiſhing</hi> of time
<hi>Inchoate,</hi> And Its <hi>vacuity,</hi> (or Expiration of the 1260 Years,) Is the
<hi>Finiſhing</hi> of time <hi>Conſummate.</hi> Theſe things muſt needs be very plain.
The Sounding of the Seventh Angel, Is the worlds Paſſing Bell: Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then <hi>begins,</hi> and They are Deſtroyed, which deſtroy the Earth;
and in the <hi>End</hi> are thrown into Hell, when the Quick and Dead will
he judged. Theſe Laſt 1260 Years being the <hi>Dawn</hi> of an Eternal Day to
the Godly: But the Dire <hi>Crepuſculum</hi> of an Eternall night to the <hi>Wicked.</hi>
Theſe Days <hi>Began</hi> in the Latter part of 1688, But had no Solemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
'till An. 1689 'when The Man, whoſe NAME is The <hi>Branch,</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:61150:36"/>
was Crowned King. Now, would The Inquiſitive know, what the <hi>Laſt</hi>
Year of the Seventh Angels Sounding will Iſſue in: Let me tell them,
Tis, very probable 'twill <hi>Terminate</hi> in a Moſt Glorious <hi>Appearance</hi> of
Chriſt, Pouring down the Spirit from on High, at Pentecoſt: For, He
is Now Conſidered under the Following Relations. <hi>viz,</hi> As the Son of
A Great King, or an Heir <hi>Adult,</hi> Claiming All the Kingdoms of the
Earth: As a Bridegroom, come to marry His Bride: As a Great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
come to Conquer the World, whoſe Name is called The WORD
of God: As an High Prieſt, or Chief Adminiſtrator in His Millennian
Kingdom, and Laſtly, As a Young Infant in His Church Regenerate
The Pouring out the Spirit (ſo often promiſed) may Refer to all Theſe:
As He is a King, 'Tis the Great Proclamation: As a Bridegroom, 'Tis
The Marriage Supper: 'Tis the Sealing His Commiſſion as a Souldier: His
Inſtallment as He is an High Prieſt: As He is married, 'tis the Sealing
His Bride a Jointure of Power For a Thouſand Years: and as He is
an Infant, 'tis his <hi>Babtizing:</hi> and Laſtly 'tis the <hi>TEMPLE OPENED,</hi>
not of which The Plagues do Iſſue forth, with a Full Commiſſion to
Deſtroy all His Enimies, who would not have Him to Rule over them.</p>
               <p>No Sort of Chriſtians will deny that God hath made to Men a Promiſe
of a NEW COVENANT in the Latter Days: Obliging Himſelf thereby
to write his Law in their HEARTS, &amp;c. Now, He never makes a NEW
Covenant but He Break The OLD one: Nor is it his Cuſtom ever to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
a New, or Cancel an Old one, with out the Greateſt Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
After what Manner, and with what Solemnity He Broke The old
one; I have plainly hinted in my Preface to the King. The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the New one (there being Two SEDE VACANTES by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
the Old one) is but the Reverſe of That: And That It will be
Introduced with a Joyous Solemnity, is The Rational Expectation of
all Good Men.</p>
