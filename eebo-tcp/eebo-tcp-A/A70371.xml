            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UPon the Diſcourſe that paſſed not long ſince betwixt you and me, concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Differences amongſt us in this Nation, and the Difficulties you then preſſed me with, about the Nature and Reaſons of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and the Side which the Sin of it would lie upon; I began to conſider of it, and forthwith reſolved to ſee what I could meet with of that Subject amongſt that Party you ſo boldly charge with it, eſpecially before their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, when they might be ſuppoſed to ſpeak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially. And amongſt the reſt, having procured of a Friend the Notes of a <hi>Sermon</hi> long ſince preached by Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> I diligently read it over, and thought it a Diſcourſe very well calculated to bring this matter to an iſſue betwixt us: for which end, having compared it with and corrected it by what he afterward printed upon that Text, I did reſolve to ſend it to you. This, I confeſs, I the rather pitched upon, as he is yet alive, and is able to juſtifie it; and becauſe you alſo urged me with ſome Objections offered in particular againſt him, and his proceedings in the caſe, and did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59953:3"/>
That he, with the reſt of his Brethren, durſt not now own what they had formerly preached, or preach what they formerly did about <hi>Separation,</hi> leſt they ſhould revive what they hope is by this time forgotten, and diſquiet the Aſhes of the old <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> whoſe Followers they profeſs to be, but herein, as you ſaid, widely differ from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I muſt confeſs my ſelf not to have been a little diſturbed at thoſe Paſſages that you produced out of ſome of them, and could not but tranſcribe that from Mr.</hi> Calamy, <hi>in his</hi> Apologie againſt an unjuſt Invective, <hi>pag. 10. viz.</hi> What will Mr. Burton ſay to old Mr. Dod, Mr. Hilderſham, Mr. Ball, Mr. Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp;c? Did not theſe Reverend Miniſters ſee the Pattern of Gods Houſe? And yet it is well known, that they wrote many Books againſt thoſe that refuſed Communion with our Churches <hi>(he means the</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal), and were their greateſt Enemies. <hi>And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget another you ſhewed me out of the</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Presbyterial Government, <hi>pag. 135. publiſhed by the</hi> Provincial Aſsembly of London, <hi>1650. (of whom you told me Mr.</hi> Jenkin <hi>was one) viz.</hi> There were many godly and learned Nonconformiſts of this laſt Age, that were perſuaded in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that they could not hold Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in receiving the Sacrament kneeling, without ſin; yet did they not ſeparate from
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59953:3"/>
her. Indeed, in that particular Act they withdrew; but yet ſo, as that they held Communion with her in the reſt; being far from a negative, much more from a poſitive Separation. Nay, ſome of them, even when our Churches were full of ſinful Mixtures, with great Zeal and Learning defended them ſo far, as to write againſt thoſe that did ſeparate from them.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge, that I am not able to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all things of this nature, and that it is very hard to ſhew where the difference lies betwixt now and then, and to find out what the People have to ſcare them from Communion with the <hi>Church of England</hi> now, that they had not in thoſe Times; and why what Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> &amp;c. wrote then in defence of it, will not ſtill ſo far hold good. But I hope you eaſily conceive, that the Caſe is not the ſame with the <hi>Miniſters</hi> as the <hi>People.</hi> For the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> it is confeſſed, and you gave me an undeniable Proof of the general Belief of the preſent <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That when by the late <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> every one that was in any Office of Truſt was required to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> according to the uſage of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> they that amongſt them were concerned, were generally adviſed to it by their own <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and few, if any, were found to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it; which doubtleſs they would have done, if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59953:4"/>
either <hi>they</hi> or their <hi>Paſtors</hi> had thought that they had ſinned in ſo doing; and their own Intereſt, or the capacity they might be in of doing better Services in their Places, than out of them, would not have made it lawful, if it had not been thought lawful in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do very readily grant this. But withal I hope you do perceive, that there is a great difference betwixt the <hi>People</hi> and their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> betwixt the Peoples Communicating with, and the Miniſters Officiating in the <hi>Church:</hi> for the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> are in order to this required to renounce the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and to <hi>aſſent and conſent</hi> to the uſe of the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> And therefore, though the People may now Communicate upon the ſame terms that the People did before the Wars (when <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church of England</hi> was proved to be <hi>Schiſm</hi> by the great <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> of thoſe Times, as is aboveſaid), and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> may now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate upon the ſame terms as the <hi>People,</hi> yet they cannot do it as <hi>Miniſters;</hi> and what reaſon is there that they ſhould degrade themſelves, who are (as Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> ſaith, on <hi>Jude, pag.</hi> 21.) <hi>Church-Officers betruſted with the ordering of the Church, and for opening the Doors of the Churches Communion, by the Keys of Doctrine and Diſcipline;</hi> and be no more than private Chriſtians, that have no power
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59953:4"/>
in theſe matters, as he there obſerves? Is this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to be, from <hi>Rulers</hi> of the Flock, turned down amongſt the <hi>common Herd;</hi> and from being keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Keys, to be brought under the power of them?</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing that they could thus far conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, yet do you make nothing of the <hi>Apoſtles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> and <hi>woe is me?</hi> or think you it fit, after ſo ſacred a <hi>Character</hi> as that of <hi>Ordination,</hi> that they can clear themſelves if they neglect it? Conſider what is written in a Book called <hi>Sacrilegious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the Holy Miniſtry rebuked,</hi> pag. 30. viz. <hi>Is a Vow and Dedication to preach the Goſpel, no reaſon to preach it elſewhere, when it's forbidden in your Aſſemblies? Is the alienation of Conſecrated Perſons no Sacrilege?</hi> You told me indeed, That ſuppoſing they were under the like neceſſity (which you ſaid they were not), yet, that as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>neceſſity</hi> did not, ſo neither did theirs confine them to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Place, Time, or Number; that Preaching was not more ſo, when it was to many, than to few, in publick than in private, in <hi>London</hi> than the <hi>Countrey;</hi> and that as the Law did permit them to preach to <hi>Five</hi> beſides their own <hi>Family,</hi> ſo it did not forbid them private Conference elſewhere; a way that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> do ſo much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that one of them, in his Advice to the reſt,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59953:5"/>
ſaith of it, <hi>That Publick hearing without Perſonal conference, ſeldom bringeth men to underſtand well what you ſay, (Sacrileg. Diſert. pag.</hi> 93.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you conceived not how St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Wo,</hi> or their <hi>Ordination,</hi> did oblige them to flock up to the Capital City, or to betake themſelves to the chiefeſt Towns, and to draw great numbers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; no more than it did before <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in 62, to follow the ſame courſe.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I will onely ask you, whether you think it not better to preach to many, than to few; and in publick, than in corners; and in Towns, than Villages; and in <hi>London,</hi> than the <hi>Country?</hi> In Villages People will jog on in their old way, they have neither much curioſity nor leiſure; or whatever is there taught or learned, ſpreads no further: But you know, teach <hi>London,</hi> and you teach the whole Nation; thence the Light before the Wars ſhone forth into all parts; and after when <hi>Hereſies were hatched and nouriſhed up under her wings, from her they ſpread all the Kingdom over,</hi> as is obſerved by the <hi>Provincial Aſsembly of London,</hi> in their <hi>Vindication, pag,</hi> 119. and the ſame way doubtleſs is ſtill to be obſerved, if any good is to be done. And it is the ſame as to the Places of eminency in the Country. And therefore whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becomes of the remote Parts, and the little
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59953:5"/>
Places, great care is here to be taken, <hi>that the Souls in Cities and Corporations be not deſerted,</hi> as the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion</hi> doth hint, <hi>p.</hi> 69. and better leave thoſe to ſhift for themſelves, than to leave theſe unſupplied. Which gives a very good account, why they flock ſo much from the <hi>Country</hi> to the <hi>Town.</hi> And if you ſtill perſiſt to demand, why it was not thought ſo before 62? the Anſwer is ready; for then <hi>London</hi> was their own, and the Pulpits were ſafe, when kept by thoſe that were of their own Perſuaſion: But the caſe being now otherwiſe, if they ſhould retire, and not keep up a diſtinct Party, the <hi>City</hi> would be another thing, and the whole Nation be in danger of Infection. And then what would become of them and their Families? For there are not very many of them that were bred up to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Trade, or keeping Books of Account, and that can ſhift for themſelves as other Men; and if put by that way of Livelihood, where muſt they ſeek for it? As <hi>there cannot be a walking, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moving</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> judiciouſly obſerves on <hi>Jude, pag.</hi> 447.); ſo there cannot be an eating without Food: and how Food is to be had on their part, without Preaching, is not eaſie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>Do you think, if they had betaken themſelves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59953:6"/>
to inſtruct their Flocks, that they left, by private Conference (as the Author of the <hi>Addreſs to the Nonconformiſts</hi> propounds, <hi>pag.</hi> 199.), <hi>that thoſe who now ſupport them in point of Livelihood in the way they are in, would do the ſame in the other way,</hi> as that <hi>Author</hi> conjectures? Nay, if they were left to the mercy of the <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which allows <hi>Five</hi> beſide their own Family, and did govern themſelves by it, can you think that would turn to any account?</p>
            <p>Alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> you know Charity is grown cold in theſe times; and if they put all upon that iſſue, we may ſay, <hi>God</hi> help them, for it may be feared the People will not. We know, <hi>Sir,</hi> and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant of it, that it's a Publick way, and the being followed and admired by Multitudes, when the Members have the reputation of being joyned to a numerous and wealthy Congregation, and where Trade may be promoted, that opens the Purſes, and, ſhall I ſay, engages the Hearts of not a few; and therefore if you will not allow them to preach in this way, you muſt not allow them to live and eat as other Folk.</p>
            <p>Methinks your own experience ſhould open your eyes, and let you ſee what difference is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him that labours in the Word, and him that doth not; betwixt him that preacheth at ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

Seaſons, that he may reſort to the Publick Worſhip, and is willing to ſhew, that he and the <hi>Church of England</hi> in effect are one; and him that preacheth in oppoſition to it, at the ſame time with the Publick, and thereby proclaimeth, that he and the Church are two. Alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> the City-Mouſe did not more excel the Country, than one here doth the other, in the Proviſions of his Table, and the Munificence of his Benefactors. The one lives by Preaching, and lives plentifully; the other lives by his Learning, in the ſenſe of the Scholar that ſold his Books to maintain himſelf with, as ſome of them whom I know you love and reverence are reported to do; and others forced to be beholden to <hi>Conformists,</hi> that have made private Collections for them. Theſe are they that the Author of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Deſertion, pag.</hi> 111. is to be underſtood of, when he ſaith, <hi>That the French Impreſſion of the Councils is too dear for the Purſe of a Nonconform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Miniſter.</hi> And beſides, <hi>Sir,</hi> is it nothing, think you, for a Man to walk diſconſolately through the Streets, hardly taken notice of, and his Worth and Learning covered by his Cloak and Modeſty; and another in the mean time ſailing along, perhaps with two or three Attendants, and ever and anon one or other ſtepping forth to ſalute him with a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reverence? And is not this another material
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59953:7"/>
difference betwixt him that preacheth, and him that preacheth not; betwixt him that preacheth in the one way, and him that preacheth in the other before ſpoken of? Nay, is it not come to this, that thoſe they call <hi>moderate yielding</hi> men are ſcarcely endured, but even their Reputations are clancularly ſtruck at by their Brethren; inſomuch that they are fain to carry it with more warineſs, and comply more than otherwiſe they would, that they may not be the Marks of their Reproches? Hence, I believe, it was, that after the Book enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>The Cure of Church-Diviſions</hi> had exaſperated the Party, <hi>Anno</hi> 1670. the <hi>Author,</hi> to lick himſelf a little whole in their eſteem, made ſome amends for his tranſgreſſion, in his thundring Book of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Deſertion,</hi> in the Year 1672. And I gueſs, that it is for the ſame reaſon, that when he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly profeſſed, <hi>That the notorious neceſſity of the People, who were more than the Pariſh-Church could hold, moved him to preach at the ſame hours with the Publick; and that he met not under any colour and pretence of any Religious Exerciſe in other manner than according to the Liturgie, and the Practice of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and were he able, that he would accordingly read himſelf:</hi> yet that he never had that read; and ſince his diſpoſal of that Place, doth preach occaſionally in the Meeting-places of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59953:7"/>
               <hi>City,</hi> at the ſame hours, where there is none of that neceſſity before pleaded by him, and where the <hi>Churches</hi> generally rather want <hi>Auditors,</hi> than <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors Churches.</hi> And ſo much are they under the awe of this, that you know, when Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was asked why he uſed not the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> he replied, That he omitted it, not that he thought it unlawful, but leſt by the uſe of it he ſhould give offence to ſome of his Brethren, and his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So that you ſee, <hi>Sir,</hi> to what a paſs things are brought, and that it is as neceſſary for them thus to do, as it is to retain the eſteem of their Party; and as neceſſary to retain that eſteem, as it is to have a Livelihood where it is wanted, or to be accounted Godly and Religious. Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I know not how you may like this, to ſuffer diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and want, and diſcouragement; but if you do, I'le aſſure you that I know but few that are of your mind. For is not Reſpect to be valued before Contempt; providing for a Mans Houſe, before neglecting it; and eſpecially, when this is conſiſtent with, and obtained in the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I am fallen upon the thing that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you would bring me to, when you charge them upon Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>'s <hi>Principles,</hi> who ſaith, that <hi>admiration of mens perſons, and ſelf-conceit, ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pride,</hi> are the moſt general Cauſes of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59953:8"/>
               <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as I ſee that he doth, <hi>pag.</hi> 26, 27, 28. of this <hi>Sermon.</hi> Cauſes, you ſaid, as evident among them, as their <hi>Schiſm</hi> it ſelf, and by which, with no little art, they bolſter it up. Thus they take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Title of the <hi>Servants of God,</hi> and give to the People that of <hi>the godly</hi> and the <hi>gracious;</hi> and for their encouragement, magnifie their <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and which they take all occaſions to repreſent. As, a <hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> can no ſooner die, but it ſhall be ſpread through all the <hi>Congregations,</hi> who are told by their <hi>Miniſters</hi> the <hi>Lords-day</hi> before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment, that ſuch a one is lately dead, and to be buried at ſuch a time, from ſuch a place, where he deſires them to be, and to ſhew their Reſpects by attending his Corps to its Funeral. In order to which, his Praiſes are ſounded from the Pulpit, and he Sainted by ſome little Poet, and his <hi>Sayings,</hi> that have either been ordinarily uſed by him in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, or frequently dropped from him in the Pulpit, are collected; and then <hi>Sermon, Poem,</hi> and <hi>Sayings</hi> vented amongſt the Multitudes crowding from all Quarters of the Town, and that are as proud to carry one of them home, as the poor Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are to get any Rag that hath but touched the Reliques of their Saint in a ſolemn Proceſſion. After which rehearſal, you bid me conſider, how this would look if done in the <hi>Church of England.</hi>

But, <hi>Sir,</hi> this is a courſe that ſeems to me not at all unreaſonable, in their circumſtances; it being very neceſſary, that they ſhould, above all things, get the Peoples eſteem, and very fit that the People ſhould teſtifie their eſteem of them; and why not in this way of Attendance on them? For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's a comfort to the <hi>Church</hi> under the loſs of their <hi>Paſtor,</hi> to ſee him reſpected when dead, as he was when alive. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By burying their <hi>Paſtor</hi> with honour, and putting themſelves into Mourning, and engaging others to follow him to his Burial, they do ſhew the reſpect that they had to him in a day of Perſecution and Diſtreſs, when deſpiſed by others; and that they continued conſtant to him to the death. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's good to ſhew the World that they are not ſo deſpicable for Quality or Number, as is pretended. And are not theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſufficient to juſtifie their Practice in this caſe, and to ſhew, how it would not ſo well become <hi>you</hi> in <hi>your Church,</hi> as it doth <hi>them</hi> in <hi>theirs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, I perceive, this that I ſaid laſt of all ſtuck moſt in your ſtomach, as you judged it a kind of an open Challenge and Defiance to Authority; and you thought that you had me at a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when you ſo readily brought Chapter and Page upon me from Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> on <hi>Jude, pag.</hi> 623. viz. <hi>That miſerable is that Commonwealth whoſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59953:9"/>
               <hi>have brought their Laws under their power.</hi> For you conſidered not, that this is ſpoken of Irreligious Perſons, and Civil Affairs; but in the Matters of Religion, I hope, you know better, and that the more contemptible the Laws about thoſe things are made, and the weaker the Authority is to put them into execution, the ſafer they themſelves be whom the Laws are deſigned againſt. And beſides, do you think, that Men ought not to make as publick a Profeſſion of their Religion as with ſecurity they can; and to let <hi>the Power</hi> underſtand, how much it would be for their Safety and Intereſt to come over to the ſtrongeſt Side? And is it not far better for <hi>Authority</hi> to depend upon <hi>Religion,</hi> than <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> upon <hi>Authority?</hi> Where have you lived all this while, that are yet to learn in ſo neceſſary a Point of Caſuiſtical Divinity?</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> himſelf, when you ſaid, that he made very bold with the Reputation of others, and took as great a liberty to revile, as to commend; and did produce him againſt himſelf, on <hi>Jude, pag.</hi> 184. viz. <hi>That it is Seducers policy to aſperſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to cauſe a diſlike of their Ministry:</hi> and again, <hi>pag.</hi> 394. <hi>That the great endeavour of Seducers is, to be magnified, or rather omnified, to have all others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed and nullified:</hi> I muſt confeſs that I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay: and that what you pointed me to in

It is a great fault in them, and what, if he hath miſcarried in, as I hope he hath repented of, ſo by his ſilence upon that gentle Reproof given him in <hi>The Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Conforming Clergie,</hi> doth ſeem to own. I muſt acknowledge, that my own Temper, as well as my Religion, hath ſo much endeared me to that moſt excellent Deſcription of <hi>Charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. <hi>Charity envieth not; Charity vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, &amp;c. beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> &amp;c. that were all other things in the <hi>Church of England</hi> as agreeable to me, as the Temper of it, it would mightily reconcile me to it. We find no <hi>Martins,</hi> no <hi>Centuries,</hi> no <hi>Gangraena's,</hi> no <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-Coblers,</hi> no Stories or uncertain Reports, pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and maliciouſly improved, by which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of their Adverſaries are invaded, and expoſed to the World; notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations they have received, and the abundant matter that hath been formerly and of late afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch an Hiſtory. And there is nothing hath made me more out of love with my old Friend Mr. <hi>J.</hi> than a certain proneneſs that he hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59953:10"/>
to make Invectives againſt others, and to attend in the mean time ſo little to himſelf, as to give occaſion to others (if they would take it) to make them againſt him. But I hope, how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he reſpected what in another caſe he once ſaid, in his <hi>Sermon</hi> of the <hi>Saints Worth, pag.</hi> 11. viz. <hi>If a man takes the Picture of another, he will not take it of his Back-ſide, Leg, or Hand, or the like; but of his Face, his beautifulleſt Part:</hi> yet that you and others will obſerve it, that the World be no more troubled with ſuch Narratives as can ſerve to no good End, but will effectually promote a bad; which is to expoſe <hi>Religion,</hi> and make it mean and contemptible.</p>
            <p>For my part, I could heartily wiſh, that all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences about little things were laid aſide; <hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (as he obſerves, <hi>pag.</hi> 252. on <hi>Jude) very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, that a greater Fire ſhould be employed in roaſting of an Egg, than an Ox; and to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious for Bubbles, than Bleſſedneſs.</hi> As for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Differences, I could as heartily wiſh they were compoſed, that the Love of <hi>God</hi> did more encreaſe, and that would be the encreaſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> For what he ſaith, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. on <hi>Jude, pag.</hi> 630. is very true; <hi>The preſerving of our Love to God is an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt Sectaries and falſe Teachers. He who loves God, will fear to break the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace of the Church.</hi>

I cannot conclude better.

5. To whom it is oppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to theſe Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: <hi>Theſe are they who ſeparate themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhews, That theſe who <hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelves from the <hi>Church,</hi> were <hi>Scorners;</hi> and that theſe who were <hi>ſenſual and void of the Spirit, did follow their ungodly luſts.</hi> Or, in the Words <hi>Jude</hi> expreſſeth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Sin</hi> of theſe <hi>Seducers,</hi> in <hi>ſeparating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof, which was,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Their being ſenſual: <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Their not having <hi>the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, their <hi>Separation;</hi> Two things are here to be opened.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here intends by <hi>ſeparating themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Wherein the Sinfulneſs of it conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt: The Original word may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the unbounding of a thing, and the removing of a thing from thoſe Bounds and Limits wherein it was ſet and placed, &amp;c. Or it imports, the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeparating of one thing from another, by Bounds and Limits put between them; and the putting of Bounds and Limits, for diſtinction and ſeparation, between ſeveral things: it being (thus) a Reſemblance taken from Fields or Countries, which are diſtinguiſhed and parted from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59953:12"/>
by certain Boundaries and Land-marks ſet up to that end: and thus it's commonly taken by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters in this place, wherein theſe Seducers may be ſaid to <hi>ſeparate themſelves,</hi> divide or bound themſelves from others, either <hi>firſt,</hi> Doctrinally; or, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Practically.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> by falſe and Heretical Doctrines, whereby they divided themſelves from the Truth and Faithful, who were guided by the Truth of Scripture, and walked according to the Rule of the Word, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Practically;</hi> they might ſeparate themſelves as by Bounds and Limits,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Prophaneneſs,</hi> and living in a different way from the Saints; namely, in all looſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Schiſmaticalneſs,</hi> and making of ſeparation from, and diviſions in the Church: Becauſe they proudly deſpiſed the Doctrines or Perſons of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as contemptible and unworthy; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not endure the holy ſeverity of the Churches Diſcipline, they (ſaith <hi>Calvin)</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it. They might make Rents and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the Church, by Schiſmatical withdrawing themſelves from Fellowſhip and Communion with it. Their Hereſies were perverſe and damnable <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> their Schiſm was a perverſe <hi>ſeparation</hi> from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59953:13"/>
               <hi>Church-communion:</hi> The former was in <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> the latter in <hi>Practicals.</hi> The former was oppoſite to <hi>Faith,</hi> this latter to <hi>Charity.</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> all the Members are united to the Head; by <hi>Charity,</hi> one to another: And as the breaking of the former is <hi>Hereſie,</hi> ſo their breaking of the latter was <hi>Schiſm.</hi> And this <hi>Schiſm</hi> ſtands in the diſſolving the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Band of Love and Union among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and appears in the withdrawing from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> which are both the Signs of, and Helps to <hi>Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> as <hi>Prayer, Hearing, Receiving of Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. For, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of <hi>Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> chiefly appears in the undue ſeparation from <hi>Church-communion,</hi> therefore this rending is rightly called <hi>Schiſm.</hi> It is uſually ſaid to be twofold, <hi>Negative,</hi> and <hi>Poſitive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Negative</hi> is when there is onely <hi>ſimplex ſeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio,</hi> when there is onely a bare ſeceſſion, a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet withdrawing from Communion with a Church, without making any head againſt that Church from which the departure is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitive</hi> is when Perſons ſo withdrawing do ſo conſociate and draw themſelves into a diſtinct and oppoſite Body, ſetting up a Church againſt a Church, or, as <hi>Divines</hi> expreſs it, from <hi>Auguſtine, an Altar againſt an Altar:</hi> And this it is which in a peculiar manner, and by way of eminency, is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59953:13"/>
called by the name of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and becomes ſinful either in reſpect, <hi>firſt,</hi> of the <hi>groundleſneſs,</hi> or, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>groundleſneſs;</hi> when there is no caſting of Perſons out of the Church by an unjuſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> no departure by <hi>unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſecution,</hi> no <hi>Hereſie</hi> nor <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the Church maintained, no neceſſity (if <hi>Communion</hi> be held with a Church) of communicating in its <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Corruptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> makes it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; when 'tis made without due endeavour and waiting for Reformation of the <hi>Church</hi> from which the departure is: and ſuch a raſh departure is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Charity,</hi> which <hi>ſuffers</hi> both <hi>much and long,</hi> all tolerable things: It is not preſently diſtaſted, when the juſteſt occaſion is given; it firſt uſeth all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means of remedy. The Chyrurgeon reſerves <hi>Diſmembring,</hi> as the laſt remedy. It looks upon a ſudden breaking off from <hi>Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church</hi> (which is a <hi>Diſmembring)</hi> not as <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> but <hi>Butchery;</hi> not as <hi>medicinal,</hi> but <hi>cruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sinfulneſs of this <hi>Schiſmatical ſeparation</hi> appears ſeveral ways. I ſhall not ſpend time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with <hi>Hereſie,</hi> though ſome have ſaid, that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is the greater Sin of the two. <hi>Auguſt. cont. Donat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. tells the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that <hi>Schiſm</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59953:14"/>
was a greater Sin than that of the <hi>Traditores,</hi> who in time of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> through fear, delivered up their <hi>Bibles</hi> to the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> to be burnt. (A Sin at which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> took ſo much offence, that it was the ground of their <hi>ſeparation.)</hi> But to paſs by theſe things: By theſe three Conſiderations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the ſinfulneſs of <hi>Schiſm</hi> ſhews it ſelf.</p>

            <p n="1">1. An horrible Indignity offered to his Body, it <hi>dividing Chriſt</hi> (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15.) and makes him to appear the Head of two Bodies. How monſtrous and diſhonourable is the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit hereof!</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's Rebellion againſt his Command, his great Command of <hi>Love.</hi> The Grace of <hi>Love</hi> is by ſome called <hi>the Queen of Graces;</hi> and it's greater than <hi>Faith</hi> in reſpect of its Object, not God onely, but Man; its duration, which is eternal; its manner of working, not in a way of receiving <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as <hi>Faith)</hi> but of giving out the Soul to him: and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Love</hi> is the greateſt Command, in reſpect of its <hi>comprehenſiveneſs,</hi> it taking in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the end of them all being <hi>Love,</hi> and it being the fulfilling of them all.</p>

            <p n="4">4. It tends to fruſtrate his <hi>Prayer</hi> for Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Saints, <hi>John</hi> 17. and endeavours that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may not be heard by his Father.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5. It oppoſeth his Example:</hi> By this ſhall all men <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> know that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another.

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It's injurious to his Service and Worſhip. How can Men pray, if in wrath and diviſion? How can <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fight with Heaven and prevail, when they are in ſo many divided Troops? What worthineſs can be in thoſe <hi>Communicants,</hi> who celebrate a Feaſt of Love, with Hearts full of rancour and malice?</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reſpect of <hi>the Parties ſeparating:</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cauſeth a <hi>decay of all Grace.</hi> By diviſions among our ſelves, we endeavour to divide our ſelves from him, in and from whom is all our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All wickedneſs follows contention. Upon the Stock of <hi>Schiſm</hi> commonly <hi>Hereſie</hi> is grafted. There is no <hi>Schiſm</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jerome)</hi> but ordinarily it invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and produceth ſome <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that ſo the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59953:15"/>
may ſeem the more juſtifiable. The <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> from <hi>Schiſm</hi> fell to <hi>Hereſies.</hi> Our Times ſadly comment upon this Truth, they equally ariſing to both. The farther Lines are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced one from another, the greater is their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Center: And the more divided <hi>Christians</hi> are among themſelves, the more they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves from <hi>Christ.</hi> Branches divided from the Tree, receive no Sap from the Root. The Soul gives Life to Members which are joyned together, not pluck'd aſunder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Schiſm</hi> is the greateſt diſgrace to the <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> A <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> is a Name much diſowned, becauſe very diſhonourable: All Poſterity loads the name of <hi>ſinful Separatists</hi> with diſgrace and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.

any to abide in it; that <hi>Christ</hi> will not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we cannot have Communion with it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's injurious to the <hi>peace and quietneſs</hi> of the <hi>Church. Schiſmaticks</hi> more oppoſe the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> than do <hi>Heathens.</hi> If the natural Body be divided and torn, pain and ſmart muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The tearing and rending of the Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy goes to the Heart of all ſenſible Members.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It's oppoſite to the <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Diviſion of Tongues hindred the building of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel;</hi> and doubtleſs diviſion in Hearts, Tongues, Hands, Heads, muſt needs hinder the building of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> While <hi>Parties</hi> are contending, <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths</hi> ſuffer.

            <p n="2">2.

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> are making a <hi>ſeparation</hi> in that <hi>Church,</hi> by reforming it? But,</p>

And is <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from that <hi>Church</hi> lawful, from which <hi>God</hi> doth not ſeparate? Did the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mixtures</hi> in the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> direct the Faithful to <hi>ſeparate?</hi> Muſt not he who will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear <hi>Communion</hi> with a <hi>Church,</hi> till it be altogether freed from <hi>mixtures,</hi> tarry till the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? till when, we have no promiſe, that <hi>Christ</hi> will gather out of his Church <hi>whatſoever doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Let them conſider, Whether <hi>God</hi> hath made <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians Stewards in his Houſe,</hi> to determine whether thoſe with whom they Communicate are fit Members of the Church, or not? Or rather, Whether it be not their duty, when they diſcover Tares in the Church, in ſtead of ſeparating from it, to labour that they may be found good Corn; that ſo when <hi>God</hi> ſhall come to gather his Corn into his Garner, they may not be thrown out? <hi>Church-Officers</hi> are miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially betruſted with the Ordering of the Church, and for the opening and ſhutting of the doors of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59953:19"/>
Churches Communion, by the Keys of Doctrine and Diſcipline: And herein if they ſhall either be hindred, or negligent, <hi>private Chriſtians</hi> ſhall not be intangled in the guilt of their Sin, if they be humbled, and uſe all lawful means for remedy, though they do Communicate.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let them ſearch, Whether there be any <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-warrant</hi> to break off Communion with any Church, when there is no defect in the <hi>Ordinances themſelves,</hi> onely upon this ground, becauſe ſome are admitted to them, who, becauſe of their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſcarriages, ought to be debarred? The <hi>Jews</hi> of old, though they ſeparated when the Worſhip if ſelf was corrupted, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 14, 16. yet not becauſe wicked men were ſuffered to be in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Communion with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 9, 10. Nor do the Precepts or Patterns of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for caſting out of Offenders, give any liberty to <hi>ſeparation,</hi> in caſe of failing to caſt them out; and though the ſuffering of ſcandalous Perſons be blamed, yet not the Communicating with them. The Command <hi>not to eat with a Brother who is a fornicator, or covetous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. concerns not Religious, but Civil Communion, by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, familiar, intimate Converſation, either in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited, or inviting; as is clear by theſe two Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59953:20"/>
1. That Eating which is here forbidden with a Brother, is allowed to be with an <hi>Heathen:</hi> But it's the Civil Eating which is onely allowed to be with an <hi>Heathen:</hi> Therefore, it's the Civil Eating which is forbidden to be with a Brother.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Eating here forbidden, is for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>nocent,</hi> not for a puniſhment to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi> Now though ſuch Civil Eating was to be forborn, yet it follows not at all, much leſs much more, that Religious Eating is forbidden.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Civil Eating is arbitrary, and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; not ſo Religious, which is enjoyned, and a commanded Duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is danger of being infected by the wicked in civil, familiar, and arbitrary Eatings; not ſo in joyning with them in an holy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Service and Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Civil Eating is done out of love to the Party inviting or invited; but Religious is done out of love to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> were it not for whom, we would neither eat at <hi>Sacrament</hi> with wicked men, nor at all.</p>
            <p>To conclude this; <hi>Separation</hi> from <hi>Churches,</hi> from which <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not ſeparate, is <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> Now it's clear in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> owneth <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> where <hi>Faith</hi> is found for the ſubſtance, and their <hi>Worſhip Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> though there be many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59953:20"/>
defects and <hi>ſinful mixtures</hi> among them. And what I have ſaid concerning the <hi>Schiſmaticalneſs</hi> of <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>ſinful mixtures</hi> of thoſe who are wicked in <hi>practice,</hi> is as true concerning <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from them who are erroneous in <hi>judgment,</hi> if the Errours of thoſe from whom the <hi>ſeparation</hi> is made, be not Fundamental, and hinder Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Head. And much more clear (if clearer can be) is the <hi>Schiſmaticalneſs</hi> of thoſe who ſeparate from, and renounce all <hi>Communion</hi> with thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> which are not of their <hi>own manner of conſtitution,</hi> and modell'd according to the Platform of their own particular <hi>Church-order.</hi> To refrain Fellowſhip and Communion with ſuch <hi>Churches</hi> who profeſs <hi>Chriſt</hi> their <hi>Lord,</hi> whoſe <hi>Faith</hi> is ſound, whoſe <hi>Worſhip</hi> is <hi>Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> whoſe <hi>Lives</hi> are holy, becauſe they come not into that particular way of <hi>Church-Order</hi> which we have pitch'd upon, is a Schiſmatical rending of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to pieces.

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Heartily thank you for putting me in mind of our late Diſcourſe, and for giving me ſo fair an opportunity to purſue it, by the <hi>Sermon</hi> that you ſent me; which I greedily read, and had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er run over, but I bleſs'd my ſelf to find, that you ſhould put the Cauſe upon this Iſſue, and to appeal to <hi>that</hi> for the juſtification of the preſent <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I look'd again, and thought that you might be miſtaken, and had ſent me a Sermon againſt Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> rather than one for him. It was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe that I do acknowledge my ſelf not to be altogether a Stranger to, and what I then retained ſome remembrance of; but yet wholly to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſelf, I ſent for the Book which you ſay you compared it with, and, to my no ſmall ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, found them (as to what concerns the matter of our Diſpute) honeſtly to agree; and that you may as well bring the one to vouch for the credit
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59953:24"/>
of the other, as he himſelf may (if there were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi>'s <hi>Arraignment of Schiſm</hi> (from whence he hath borrowed the ſubſtance of this <hi>Sermon)</hi> in the juſtification of what he hath ſaid here upon that Subject.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am glad that I have brought you thus far; for I deſire no better advantage than what this <hi>Sermon</hi> will afford me, and ſhall decline the Order that we obſerved in our Diſcourſe, on purpoſe to comply with it.</p>
            <p>You may remember, that I then undertook to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>old Nonconformists</hi> did themſelves hold <hi>Lay-Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and accounted thoſe that did not, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as by their Writings yet extant doth appear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>preſent Nonconformiſts,</hi> who are <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> did plead their Practice, and uſe their Arguments, againſt the <hi>Independents,</hi> and others, that did in the late Times ſeparate from themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Lay-Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is the ſame in our Times, that it was in the Times of the <hi>old Nonconformists;</hi> and that the <hi>Church of England</hi> hath as much to ſay for it ſelf now, as it had then.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59953:24"/>
4. That therefore the <hi>new Separation</hi> doth not in reality differ from the <hi>old,</hi> and is truly <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if either <hi>they,</hi> or the <hi>old Nonconformiſts</hi> ſpoke true.</p>
            <p>Now this I look upon as a very covenient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to bring the Caſe to a Deciſion; but becauſe I will ſhew how willing I am to meet you, and how confident I am in the goodneſs of my Cauſe, I ſhall take that courſe which will more readily lead me to make uſe of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> though in the purſuing of <hi>that,</hi> I ſhall alſo ſay what will ſerve for the proof of the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> before laid down.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it will be neceſſary to ſhew what <hi>Schiſm</hi> is. Now, that, as may be collected from Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> here, <hi>is a perverſe or undue ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Church-Communion, pag.</hi> 21, 22. or, <hi>a voluntary and unneceſsary dividing and ſeparation from a true Church, pag.</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>And upon this Definition I ſhall proceed, and ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That the Church of England is a true Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That there is a Separation from it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That this Separation is voluntary and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That therefore the preſent Separation is ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Church of England is a true Church.</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59953:25"/>
But here we are put to it, to tell what the <hi>Church of England</hi> is, by the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion,</hi> pag. 35. <hi>We are told</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of Schiſm from the Church of England, when I would give all the Money in my Purſe, to make me understand what the Church of England is.</hi> I might here, without any more ado, refer him to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for reſolution, of whom, Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Bonaſus Vapulans,</hi> printed the ſame Year, <hi>pag.</hi> 138. <hi>That he has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of England in all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> who cannot but certainly know what that <hi>Church</hi> is, or elſe how can he hold Communion with it? But becauſe there is ſo great a Profit like to attend it, and in compaſſion to him that hath there raiſed ſo much duſt that he cannot ſee his own way, I ſhall for once tell him what it is by Wiſe Men thought to be, <hi>viz.</hi> That Company of Perſons, in this Nation, that doth joyn together in the Ordinances of God, according to the Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt us for Eccleſiaſtical Matters. <hi>It is the joyning together in the Ordinances of God, which makes a Church a True Church,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Arraignment of Schiſm,</hi> pag. 31. And it's the joyning together in them, according to the Laws eſtabliſhed amongſt us, that makes ſuch a Church to be the <hi>Church of England.</hi> I muſt profeſs, Sir, to you, That I can hardly forbear to expoſe that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59953:25"/>
Book of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion,</hi> that as much abounds with Ill-nature, Self-conceit, Confuſion, and Self-contradiction, as any that I have met with of that kind; but becauſe the <hi>Author</hi> hath been in many things of good uſe to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> I ſhall not treat him with that rigour ſuch a Book deſerves; and ſhall therefore proceed to ſhew, <hi>That this Church is a True Church.</hi> He indeed, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. of that Book, when it had been objected againſt the preſent <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> That <hi>their Members are taken out of True Churches,</hi> replies, <hi>How many Biſhops have written, that the Church of Rome is a True Church, &amp;c. and must no Churches therefore be gathered out of them? [Her,</hi> it ſhould be.] thereby diſingenuouſly inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> is no otherwiſe a <hi>true Church</hi> than that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and may as ſafely be ſeparated from. Now how the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi> will inform us, <hi>pag.</hi> 26. of his <hi>Arraignment of Schiſm: There is a twofold Trueneſs; Natural, the one; Moral, the other: In the former ſenſe, a Cheater, a Thief may be ſaid to be a true Man, and a Whore a true Woman, and (till ſhe be divorced) a true Wife; yea, and the Devil himſelf, though the Father of Lies, yet a true Spirit. And in this ſenſe we ſhall not need to grutch the Church of Rome the name of a true Church; if not ſo, why do we call her a Church? A Church ſhe</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59953:26"/>
               <hi>is, in regard of the outward Profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but yet a falſe Church: true in Existence, but falſe in Belief, &amp;c. not ſo a true Church, but that ſhe is alſo a falſe Church, an Heretical, Apoſtatical, Antichriſtian Synagogue.</hi> But whether the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion</hi> hath the ſame thoughts of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> let <hi>pag.</hi> 76. ſhew, where he ſaith, <hi>As I conſtantly joyn in my Pariſh-Church in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie and Sacraments, ſo I hope to do while I live (if I live under as honeſt a Miniſter) at due times.</hi> And he would by all means have their Aſſemblies accounted onely as <hi>Chappel-Meetings, pag.</hi> 15. with reſpect to the Publick. Now God forbid that all this ſhould be, and that in the mean time he ſhould think, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> is no more a <hi>true Church</hi> than the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and not more to be held Communion with. But the contrary is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from him, and ſo his aboveſaid Inſinuation the more blame-worthy. But however, let him think as he pleaſeth, it is very obvious, that the conſtant Opinion of the <hi>old Nonconformiſts</hi> was, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> was a <hi>true Church,</hi> and what, as ſuch, they thought that they were oblig'd to hold Communion with. So Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Cure of Church-Diviſions,</hi> ſaith of them; <hi>The old Nonconformists, who wrote ſo much againſt Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were neither blind, nor Temporizers. They ſaw</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59953:26"/>
               <hi>the danger on that ſide. Even</hi> Brightman <hi>on the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, <hi>that writeth againſt the Prelacy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſeverely reprehendeth the Separatiſts. Read but the Writings of Mr.</hi> J. Paget, <hi>Mr.</hi> J. Ball, <hi>Mr.</hi> Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſham, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bradſhaw, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bains, <hi>Mr.</hi> Rathband, <hi>and many ſuch others, againſt the Separatiſts of thoſe Times, and you may read, that our Light is not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but leſs than theirs,</hi> &amp;c. So Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi> in his <hi>Reformation not Separation,</hi> (though ſeveral of them he evidently wrongs, that were far from any diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Order and Diſcipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Ridley, &amp;c.) pag.</hi> 43. Tindal, Hooper, Ridley, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, Farrar, Whitaker, Cartwright, Bains, Sibbs, Preſton, Rogers, Geree, J. Ball, Langly, Hind, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cols, &amp;c. <hi>groaning under retained Corruptions, &amp;c. yet lived to their laſt breath in conſtant Communion with the Church.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And this they did, upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this Truth. Nay, ſo far were they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of this, that they did prefer it to moſt <hi>Churches</hi> in the World. So the Letters betwixt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rathband,</hi> 1643. <hi>If we deny Communion with ſuch a Church as ours, there hath been no Church this thouſand years with which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian might lawfully joyn.</hi> When the Wars began, there were thoſe indeed that talked otherwiſe, and then they would perſuade the People, that there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59953:27"/>
was no difference betwixt <hi>that</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> upon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Two Houſes,</hi> Jan. 18. 1647. <hi>All Chriſtendom, except Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants in England, do now ſee, that the Queſtion in England is, Whether Chriſt or Antichriſt ſhall be Lord and King?</hi> Then thoſe that were ſuſpended before the <hi>Long-Parliament</hi> time, were <hi>the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that were ſlain,</hi> and the <hi>Prelacy</hi> was an <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Power;</hi> and the <hi>taking away of that, and the Ceremonies,</hi> was <hi>the tenth part of the City falling,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Woodcock</hi> did expound it, in his <hi>Sermons of the two Witneſſes,</hi> 1643. <hi>pag.</hi> 83, &amp; 86. Then they were the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and there was <hi>the cup of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> amongſt them, as you may find it in a Book called <hi>The Principal Acts of the General Aſſembly convened at Edinburgh,</hi> May 29. 1644. pag. 19. But when the Tide began to turn, and <hi>Presbytery</hi> was oppoſed, and in great danger of being run down by <hi>Independency,</hi> they changed their Tune, and began to plead for the Truth of it, and their Propriety in it. Thus we find <hi>Ordination according to the Church of England</hi> maintained by the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Miniſters,</hi> in their <hi>Vindication, pag.</hi> 143. <hi>We do not deny, but that the way of Miniſters entring into the Miniſtry by the Biſhops, had many defects in it:—But we add, That notwithſtanding all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental corruptions, yet it is not ſubſtantially and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi>

And to ſhew you how reverendly they ſpoke of this <hi>Church,</hi> I will onely quote it from one that muſt be thought to ſpeak out of no affection, and that is <hi>J. Goodwin,</hi> in his <hi>Sion College viſited,</hi> pag. 26. <hi>Doubtleſs the real and true Miniſters of the Province of London, having ſuch abundant opportunity of converſe with Travellers from all Parts, cannot but be full of the truth of this Information, That there was more of the truth and power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in England, under the late Prelatical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than in all the Reformed Churches beſides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, All this may be granted, and yet nothing ſaid; for the Caſe is altered, the <hi>Church of England</hi> not being now what it was then. This, I acknowledge, the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion, pag.</hi> 43. doth ſuggeſt; <hi>The love of Peace, and the fear of frightning any further from Pariſh-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than I deſire, do oblige me to forbear ſo much as to deſcribe or name the additional Conformity, and that Sin which Nonconformists fear and fly from, which maketh it harder to us that deſire it, to draw many good People to Communion with Conformists, than it</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59953:28"/>
               <hi>was of old.</hi> But this <hi>additional Conformity</hi> that the People are concerned in, I am yet to underſtand; and I fear he had another Reaſon to forbear the deſcription of it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he could not. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for once ſuppoſe this; yet he grants, that it's onely harder; but that doth not make it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: For then what ſhall we ſay to Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> that in his <hi>Diſcourſe of the Religion of England, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1667. <hi>pag.</hi> 33. doth declare, <hi>That the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians generally hold the Church of England to be a true Church, though defective in its Order and Diſcipline, and frequent the Worſhip of God in the Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies?</hi> (I believe he ſpeaks of thoſe that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with, for here it is generally otherwiſe as to the point of Practice.) What ſhall we ſay to Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> that in his <hi>Bonaſus Vapulans, page</hi> 133. ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I profeſs, where-ever I come, I make it my buſineſs to reconcile People to the Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; my Conſcience would fly in my Face, if I ſhould do otherwiſe?</hi> What ſhall be ſaid to that of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in his <hi>Cure of Church-Diviſions,</hi> pag. 263, 264, 265. where he ſaith, <hi>Thouſands of well-meaning People live as if England were almost all the World, and do boldly ſeparate from their Neighbours here; which they durſt not do, if they ſoberly conſidered, that almoſt all the Chriſtian World are worſe than they?</hi> And that the preſent State of this <hi>Church</hi> is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59953:28"/>
than almoſt any in the World, he there doth largely prove. So far as the Profeſſion of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doth hold (who both deſerve, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent have your reverence) we are ſafe.</p>
            <p>But ſtill ſuppoſe the worſt, I will be bold to ſay, and I queſtion not to prove, that our <hi>Church</hi> is more a <hi>Church,</hi> than what theirs was, when they ſo briskly aſſaulted the <hi>Independents,</hi> and charged them with no leſs than <hi>Schiſm,</hi> for their <hi>ſepartion</hi> from it. For, if you conſider, you will find, that their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> was not ſetled, nor the <hi>Church</hi> in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when this Controverſie began, and was carried on amongſt them. How it was in 1642. Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Dering,</hi> in his Speeches then made and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will inform us, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. <q rend="margQuotes">The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (not long ſince the Glory of the Reformed Religion) is miſerably torn and diſtracted: you can hardly now ſay, which is the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </q> A little above, in the ſame <hi>page,</hi> he ſaith thus: <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> There is a certain new-born, unſeen, ignorant, dangerous, deſperate way of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency:</hi> Are we, <hi>Sir,</hi> for this <hi>Independent</hi> way?

and Protectors of theſe ſo different, ſo repugnant Innovations, &amp;c.</q> How it was in 1645. you may gueſs, when the Sovereign Argument they had was, That they had hopes of a Settlement.

In what Ordinance is this Power given to any but the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi>
               </q> The want of this, was what their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries did continually object; and this was what they uſed all their skill to refute, as Mr. <hi>Brinſley, pag.</hi> 31. Object. <hi>We want an Ordinance,</hi> viz. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi> So in <hi>Knutton</hi>'s <hi>Seven Queſtions about Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> 1645.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59953:30"/>
hath no place in theſe <hi>Churches;</hi> for, <hi>Prayer, Preaching, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments,</hi> yea, <hi>Diſcipline</hi> they had in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> days, &amp;c.</q>  As if that were ſufficient to vindicate what they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theirs.</p>
            <p>The Caſe then was plainly thus: That they were ſome Years without any <hi>ſetled Constitution;</hi> That though the <hi>Province of London</hi> was by an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> 1645. divided into Twelve <hi>Claſſical Elderſhips,</hi> yet after all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> about it, the very <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> was not ordered to be publiſhed till 29 <hi>Aug.</hi> 1648. nay, nor the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> agreed to be printed till about a Month before: And yet notwithſtanding, then the Cry was, <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency a great Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>worſe than Popery,</hi> (as <hi>Adam Steuart</hi> in his <hi>Zerubbabel to Sanballat, p.</hi> 53.) and <hi>Separation</hi> from them, <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> Now, if it muſt be ſo, when no body knew what the <hi>Church</hi> was, nor they themſelves knew what Foundation to lay it upon (if <hi>J. Goodwin,</hi> in his <hi>Sion College vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited,</hi> pag. 10. or <hi>J. L.</hi> in his <hi>Plain Truth,</hi> pag. 6. are to be believed, and as Mr. <hi>Brinſley, pag.</hi> 49. doth not deny); then what muſt it not be, when it is from a <hi>Church</hi> that is eſtabliſhed, and whoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Conſtitutions, and Orders are, and have been time out of mind ſetled, as ours is? If in 1647. there was a <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>Church of England,</hi> as the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59953:31"/>
               <hi>Ministers</hi> ſent by the <hi>Parliament</hi> in that Year to <hi>Oxford</hi> did maintain, and as the <hi>Form of Church-Government to be uſed in the Church of England,</hi> printed by Order of <hi>Parliament,</hi> 1648. doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; then certainly ſuch a thing there is now to be found.</p>
            <p>To conclude this: If the <hi>old Nonconformiſts</hi> thought the <hi>Church of England</hi> to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> and what they did think themſelves obliged to hold Communion with; If the preſent <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> when time was, did declare as much; If the <hi>Church of England</hi> doth not now differ from what it was when they ſo thought of it; and that it is much more a <hi>Church,</hi> than what that was that the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> were accounted by them <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> for withdrawing from: Then I hope their <hi>Separation</hi> from us, will be allowed to be <hi>unwarrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I know not what can be ſaid, unleſs, with the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion,</hi> pag. 33. it be ſaid, that this is onely <hi>local distinction, not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi> But that is the ſecond thing I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Separation from the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> If there was no more to be ſaid in this Caſe, than what <hi>Adam Steuart,</hi> in his <hi>Zerubbabel to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat,</hi> wrote againſt the <hi>Independents,</hi> 1644. it would be ſufficient; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">If ye be not ſeparated

from us, but entertain Union and Communion with us, what need ye more a <hi>Toleration,</hi> rather than the reſt of the Members of our <hi>Church?</hi>
               </q> The pains the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> took to compaſs, and the joy which they expreſſed at obtaining a <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſhews that they were not of its Communion. But what credit can we give to ſuch a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <q rend="margQuotes">For alas, (as Mr. <hi>Brinſley, pag.</hi> 28. ſaith in the ſame caſe) what meaneth the lowing of the Oxen, and the bleating of the Sheep? I mean, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe of our leſſer and greater Diviſions?—Diviſions, not onely without Separations, Sects, and Factions; but Diviſions of an higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, amounting to no leſs than direct Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that not barely to a negative, but to a poſitive Separation, to the ſetting up of Altars againſt Altars, Churches againſt Churches. That it is ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> I think it will not, it cannot be denied.</q> For, if Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and ſome others, ſhall profeſs, That they meet not at the ſame hour with the Publick, <hi>under any colour and pretence, in any Religious Exerciſe, than according to the Liturgie;</hi> and yet in the mean time uſe it not: <hi>the Dividers will not ſee</hi> (as the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag,</hi> 20.) <hi>the different Principles on which they go, while their Practice ſeemeth to be the ſame.</hi> But if we ſhould grant this, to thoſe that are willing to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59953:32"/>
hold Communion with us; yet theſe are very few, to what do wholly decline and deny it. Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi> here ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 22.

                  <hi>Schiſm</hi> is negative, when there is onely a ſimple ſeceſſion, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making head againſt that <hi>Church</hi> from which the departure is; or poſitive, when Perſons ſo withdrawing do ſo conſociate and draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a diſtinct and oppoſite Body, ſetting up a Church againſt a Church.</q> Now I dare appeal to all that know them, whether Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> and the far greater part of his Brethren, have been ever ſeen in our <hi>Congregations</hi> (unleſs at ſome times the more adventurous of them have thruſt their Heads in at the Door; when, if they heard all, as it is uſually but very little of the <hi>Sermon</hi> that they have patience to hear, Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi> will tell them, That <hi>as for Occaſional hearing, it is agreed on all hands, it is not properly an act of Church-Communion,</hi> pag. 35.) And I will appeal to your Eyes, whether they do not conſtantly keep up their <hi>Meetings</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe of the <hi>Church.</hi> But what need I go ſo far about, when this is not onely acknowledged, but defended?

in his <hi>Cure of Church-Diviſions, pag.</hi> 393, 394. <q rend="margQuotes">As I have known many unlearned Sots, that had no other Artifice to keep up the reputation of their Learning, than in all Companies to cry down ſuch and ſuch (who were wiſer than themſelves) for no Scholars;—So, many that are, or ſhould be conſcious of the dulneſs and ignorance of their fumbling and unfurniſh'd Brains, have no way to keep up the reputation of their Wiſdom with their ſimple Followers, but to tell them, <hi>O ſuch an one hath dangerous Errors, and ſuch a Book is a dangerous Book, and they hold this, and they hold that;</hi> and ſo to make odious the Opinions and Practices of others.—And if Ignorance get poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ancient and gray-headed, it triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there, and ſaith, <hi>Give me a Man, that I may diſpute with him;</hi> or rather, <hi>Away with this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, he is not fit to be diſputed with.</hi>
               </q>  How far Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> is concerned in this Character, I leave to his conſideration; but if you have a mind to inquire into it, you may repair to his <hi>Exodus,</hi> where he comes like another <hi>Samſon,</hi> ſhaking his Locks, and ruſhing forth with his mouth full of Menaces againſt the <hi>uncircumciſed Philiſtims,</hi> thoſe <hi>audacious Hereticks</hi> that lie ſculking in the corners of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> but (poor man) meets with the misfortune of that Champion, to be led away

in triumph; and in ſtead of anſwering others, is not able to defend himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Separation</hi> is not to be allowed for the <hi>manner of Church-conſtitution.</hi> So ſaith Mr. <hi>J.</hi> here, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. <hi>Much more clear (if clearer can be) is the Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs of thoſe who ſeparate from, and renounce all Communion with thoſe Churches which are not of their own manner of Conſtitution.</hi> For which he gives three Reaſons, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. And herein he agrees with Mr. <hi>Brinſley,</hi> in his <hi>Arraignment, pag.</hi> 32. and in his <hi>Church-Remedy, pag.</hi> 51. Now if this Argument held for <hi>Presbytery</hi> againſt <hi>Independency,</hi> and that the <hi>ſeparation</hi> of the <hi>latter</hi> was for that reaſon <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi> I ſee not why it ſhould not be of as equal force to condemn the former, who yet do preſume to offer it on their own behalf againſt us, and think that they have ſaid enough, when they have been able to pick ſome quarrel with the <hi>preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Separation</hi> is not to be allowed when it is <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe terms which will make us refuſe ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon which are ſeen the Scripture-characters of true Churches.</hi> This Mr. <hi>J.</hi> gives as a Reaſon to confirm the former, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. Now what thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are, he tells us a little before, in the ſame <hi>page,</hi> viz. <hi>In Scripture, Churches are commended, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their fundamental Faith was ſound, and</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59953:42"/>
               <hi>their Lives holy.</hi> Nay, he ſeems to reſolve it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the former, <hi>pag.</hi> 34. where he ſaith, <hi>Hath not God his Church, even where corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hath crept into a Church, if purity of Doctrine be maintained?</hi> Now how far our <hi>Church</hi> hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it theſe Characters, I appeal to what is above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to ſhew; and for which, I queſtion not but it may contend with any <hi>Church</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not to be allowed becauſe other <hi>Churches</hi> are by them accounted better.

The reaſon of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> on the <hi>Sacrament, p.</hi> 235.) <hi>ſeems plauſible to eaſie capacities, ſuch as the Apoſtle calls,</hi> Rom. 16. 18. <hi>the</hi>

Hither the Author of <hi>Separation yet no Schiſm</hi> doth with confidence betake himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 65, 66, 67. <hi>The Reaſon ſuppoſeth that which is</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59953:43"/>
               <hi>not to be ſuppoſed,</hi> i. e. <hi>That to withdraw from a Church for the benefit of a more profitable Miniſtry, is a Crime.</hi> Now here I ſhall conſider, whether this Reaſon will hold, and ſerve to juſtifie a <hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>Church;</hi> and, if it were granted, whether yet it is a Reaſon amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Whether it is ſo in it ſelf, let Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi> ſpeak, in his <hi>Arraignment, pag.</hi> 47. where the Caſe is put thus; <q rend="margQuotes">May not People make choice of what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters they pleaſe, putting themſelves under ſuch a Miniſtry as by which they may edifie moſt? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe it, That a People have ſuch a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Right to chuſe their own Miniſters; yet having once choſen them, and God by giving a Bleſſing to their Miniſtry having ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Choice, evidencing that they are the Miniſters of God to them; whether they may now, upon pretext of greater Edification, take a liberty to themſelves to chuſe new ones as oft as they pleaſe: this the moderate Author of the late <hi>Irenicon [i. e.</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughs]</hi> will by no means allow, but condemns, as the direct way to bring in all kind of diſorder and confuſion into the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </q> This both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> then are agreed in, That <hi>Edification</hi> alone is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon to forſake one <hi>Church</hi> for another; and that a Perſons own Opinion of his Caſe in that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59953:43"/>
matter, will not make that lawful to him, which will be the unavoidable means of bringing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to the <hi>Churches</hi> which he either leaves, or joyns himſelf to. But the Author of <hi>Separation yet no Schiſm</hi> thinks he hath ſufficient Reaſon for his Opinion, who doth thus argue, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="margQuotes">You call it a Crime, becauſe you ſuppoſe it is a tranſgreſſion the Law of viſible Communion with ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Church:</hi> But I ſay, That the Laws of viſible Communion with this or that particular <hi>Church,</hi> are but <hi>poſitive,</hi> and therefore ſubordinate to Laws more <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſsary;</hi> ſuch is that wherein we are commanded to take care of our Souls and Salvation: So that if <hi>Christians</hi> do ſhift particular <hi>Churches,</hi> for the obtaining of very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent advantages to their Salvation, above what they have had where they were, I ſee therein no Crime at all committed.</q> I grant indeed, that <hi>poſitive Laws</hi> muſt give way to <hi>natural;</hi> but then there muſt be a plain neceſſity that muſt intervene, to make them inconſiſtent: for otherwiſe, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in force, as I conceive they do in the Inſtance here given. If indeed Salvation was inconſiſtent with, or what we run the apparent hazard of, in Communion with a particular <hi>Church,</hi> then there is ſufficient reaſon for ſeparation from it: but if it be onely that I conceive the increaſe of Knowledge,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59953:44"/>
or the engaging of my Affections, may be better attained by ſeparation from, than continuance in its Communion, this is far from a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and ſo no ſufficient Reaſon to break it. As it is in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, If the Maſter takes no care to provide for his Children and Servants (who of old were eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goods of their Maſter) but that they muſt ſtarve if they continue with him; or if what he provides, is ſuch as will rather poyſon than nouriſh them, or what is abſolutely forbid (as <hi>Swines fleſh</hi> under the <hi>Law):</hi> in ſuch a caſe they may ſhift for themſelves, and refuſe to live with him, till he mends their Condition. But if what he provides is lawful, wholeſom, and ſufficient, though not of ſo good nouriſhment as might be wiſhed, they are to content themſelves, and to keep within the bounds of Duty and Obſervance. So it is here; If we were in a <hi>Church</hi> that either denied us what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, or that would engage us to do what will bring it into imminent hazard, we have an unqueſtionable Reaſon to forbear Communion with her: But when the means of Salvation that we enjoy are ſufficient to it, and what we delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate about is onely the Degree and Meaſure, <hi>[what is better and fitter]</hi> we cannot quit a <hi>Church</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, and our departure is <hi>unneceſſary.</hi> And that will further appear, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59953:44"/>
1. <hi>That no further Knowledge or Edification is neceſſary, than what we can attain to in a lawful way; and what is otherwiſe lawful in it ſelf, by taking an undue courſe for it, is made unlawful.</hi> As, <hi>Hearing, Reading,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Converſe,</hi> are very fit Means for my Improvement; but if I for it do injure my Family, and neglect my Calling, it is ſo far from being my <hi>duty,</hi> that it is my <hi>ſin.</hi> So to edifie my ſelf, and to acquire a greater meaſure of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Christian Vertues,</hi> is a noble and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent End; but if I for it break off Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> whereof I am a Member, I make my ſelf a Tranſgreſſor. All which, if well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the falacy of our Author's Argument will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. For, ſuppoſe I reaſon thus: <hi>The Laws of particular Families are but poſtive, and therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Laws more neceſſary; ſuch is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are commanded to take care of our Souls: and therefore if I neglect the former for the good of the latter, I ſee no Crime therein committed.</hi> Would not this appear very conceited and imaginary? And if it's falſe here, it is ſo in the Caſe that he offers. The grounds of his miſtake herein, ſeem to be, 1. That he was ſo intent upon the <hi>poſitive Laws of particular Churches,</hi> that he had no reſpect to <hi>Church-communion</hi> in it ſelf, which is highly neceſſary; by which means he did not conſider, that this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59953:45"/>
of ſhifting Communion for the expectation of further Improvement, is what tends ſo to the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a <hi>Church,</hi> that he that holds it is capable of continuing in no <hi>Communion</hi> whatſoever; and what cannot be put in practice, but confuſion in, and breaking up of <hi>Churches</hi> will moſt certainly follow. This was what they of <hi>New-England</hi> had experience of, and therefore provided againſt, in their <hi>Platform of Church-Diſcipline, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Church-Members</hi> (ſay they) <hi>may not depart from the Church, and ſo one from another, as they pleaſe, nor without juſt and weighty cauſe.—Such departure tends to the diſsolution of the Body.—Juſt Reaſons for a Members removal of himſelf, are,</hi> 1. <hi>If a man cannot continue, without ſin.</hi> 2. <hi>In caſe of Perſecution.</hi> But not a word of a <hi>more profitable Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>greater edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> Now if this be the neceſſary and conſtant Effect of this Principle, it cannot be true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ground of his miſtake ſeems to be, That the notion of a <hi>particular Church,</hi> led him to think, that their ſeparation into Societies diſtinct from <hi>our Church,</hi> was no more than to go from one <hi>Pariſh-Church</hi> to another (which is alſo the conceit of the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion):</hi> This he inſinuates <hi>pag.</hi> 66. But this is apparently falſe, as I have ſhewed in part before; and which will be further evident, if you obſerve, that their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59953:45"/>
with us in Thirty ſix of our <hi>Articles,</hi> makes them to be no more of us (whilſt they differ in the others that refer to our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and which they ſeparate from us for, as they profeſs), than that of the <hi>Independents</hi> made them one with the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> who <hi>in all matters of Faith did freely and fully conſent to the Confeſſion publiſhed by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the things of Church-Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline onely excepted,</hi> as they ſay in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Platform of Church-Diſcipline in New-England.</hi> And much to the ſame purpoſe is that of the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches</hi> met at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1658. But yet for all this, they neither of them think themſelves one with the other; and the <hi>Independents,</hi> for their <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> were notwithſtanding accuſed of <hi>Schiſm</hi> by the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Courſe is <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> and ſo <hi>unlawful,</hi> becauſe even in the way in which a Perſon is (whilſt a Member of a <hi>true Church</hi> in the ſenſe all along ſpoken of), he may attain to all due Improvement. The Author of <hi>Prelatique Preachers none of Christs Teachers, pag.</hi> 31. to encourage People rather to ſit at home than hear the <hi>Publick Miniſters,</hi> tells them, That they might otherwiſe help themſelves, and that they had Means ſufficient without it, <hi>as the Scriptures, mutual Edification and Conference, Prayer, and Meditation, &amp;c. and that, though never ſo few or</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59953:46"/>
               <hi>weak, Chriſt was amongst them.</hi> And if this would be ſufficient when wholly deſtitute of a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> I am apt to think it would do as well with one, though not altogether ſo well qualified as might be deſired. I ſhall conclude this with what the ſame Author ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. <hi>When God hath vouchſafed a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Means, and thoſe unqueſtionably lawful, though not of ſo rank fleſh, or ſo highly promiſing as ſome others, for the attaining of any good and deſirable End, a declining and forſaking of thoſe Means (whether out of a diffidence of the ſufficiency of them for the End deſired, or upon any other reaſon whatſoever) to eſpouſe others pretending to more ſtrength and efficacy, hath been ſtill diſpleaſing unto God, and of ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to thoſe that have been no better adviſed than to make trial of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is it really thus, that there is any ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Abilities of their and our <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi> and that the obtaining apparent Advantages to their <hi>Salvation</hi> in that reſpect, above what they could have had with us, is what they ſeparate for? So they would have it thought, as you may ſee in <hi>the Call to Archippus,</hi> printed 1664. <hi>pag.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>There is indeed a Miniſtry, and Preaching (ſuch as it is); but whether ſnch as is likely to anſwer the Ends of it, judge ye. Are thoſe like to convert Souls, that have neither will nor skill to deal with them</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59953:46"/>
               <hi>about their Converſion?</hi> So again, <hi>When there is no better help than an idle, ignorant, looſe-living Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, (under which, God knows, we ſpeak it with grief of heart, too many, not to ſay the moſt of thoſe that are of late come in, may be reckoned) or than the cold and heartleſs way that is generally in uſe, the Coal of Religion doth ever go out.</hi> An high and daring Charge, which he will be concerned to make good; or to ſuffer under the imputation of a foul Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>Have they neither will nor skill to convert Souls?</hi> From whence then proceed thoſe moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and laborious <hi>Sermons</hi> that the Wiſeſt of the Nation do ſo extol the preſent Generation for? Whence was it, that when we were bewildred with Phraſes, and <hi>Religion</hi> made hard and unintelligible, and <hi>Caſes</hi> intricate and perplexed, that the things of it were made eaſie, and to lie near to Mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; and that the part of <hi>Caſuistical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is not near ſo cumberſom as it was in the days of ſome Men? Are they <hi>idle and ignorant?</hi> From whence then is it that their Adverſaries of all ſorts are ſo well oppoſed, not to ſay confuted, that they are made to quit their ground, and to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to new Principles in their own defence; to fall from the <hi>Infallibility of the Perſon,</hi> to that of <hi>Tradition,</hi> as they do abroad; from old <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> to <hi>Browniſm;</hi> and from <hi>Presbyterianiſm</hi> to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59953:47"/>
as ſome do at home? In what Age and Church have the great Truths and Principles of our <hi>Religion</hi> been more effectually conſidered, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſearched into, more clearly ſtated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, or more ſucceſsfully defended, than in ours; and which I may challenge the whole Party of the <hi>Separation</hi> to ſhew any thing equal to? From whence comes all this to paſs, if our <hi>Church</hi> did ſo abound with <hi>uncatechiſed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pstarts, poor Shrubs, and empty and unaccompliſhed Predicants,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jenkin,</hi> with an <hi>holy indignation,</hi> doth in his <hi>Exodus, p.</hi> 55. complain? Surely if theſe Men had but duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, and had been converſant in the Writings of our <hi>Church,</hi> or looked amongſt themſelves, they would not have dared thus to reproch the moſt Learned and Induſtrious <hi>Miniſtry</hi> that perhaps <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ever yet had.

uſeful Men in the World as themſelves. Do we not find ſome of themſelves forced to acknowledge as much? Conſult <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion, pag.</hi> 86. <hi>I really fear, leſt meer Nonconformity hath brought ſome into reputation as conſciencious, who by weak Preaching will loſe the reputation of being judicious, more than their ſilence loſt it.</hi> And a little after, ſpeaking of their own <hi>Miniſters,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Verily the injudiciouſneſs of too many among you, is for a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> And, <hi>pag.</hi> 88. he adds, <hi>Through Gods mercy, ſome Conformiſts preach better than many of you can do.</hi> Truly when I conſider what a Stock of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and accompliſhed Perſons in that Quality, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Sobriety and Learning, our <hi>Church</hi> is at preſent furniſhed with, (though it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there are that are defective in both; as when were they not?) I look upon Men of this quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom temper, to be ſuch as are deſcribed in <hi>Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Deſertion,</hi> pag. 91. <hi>That having ſet themſelves in a dividing way, ſecretly do rejoyce at the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conformists, and draw as many from them as they can;</hi> and that therefore deſerve the Character he there gives, That <hi>they are but destroyers of the Church of God:</hi> Such that to ſtrengthen themſelves, and carry on their own Intereſt, care not what they do or ſay; but how worthily, let the Author of <hi>the Antidote to Mr. Baxter's Cure</hi> judge, who

ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. <hi>That to reproch a whole Party, for the miſcarriages of ſome few, without taking notice how many faults are in thoſe whom they would defend, is the uſual artifice of ſuch that think themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, upon any wretched terms whatſoever, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an ill Cauſe, and have proſtituted their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to defend an Argnment.</hi> I will leave ſuch to conſider what Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Sermon of God's Anatomy upon the Heart, pag.</hi> 167. which is ſo ſevere, that I care not to tranſcribe.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: As little reaſon is there to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from a <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>remiſneſs of Diſcipline.</hi> This the Author of <hi>Separation yet no Schiſm</hi> ſaith that <hi>he ſeeth no ſin in, pag.</hi> 67. for the Reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before; and to which my aboveſaid Anſwer, and what I have alſo ſaid <hi>pag.</hi> 66. will be ſufficient.

And as they there declared the Office of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to be unlawful in it ſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. ſo I find, that the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> did require, that beſides this Subſcription to the Book of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> ſome Perſons (I ſuppoſe ſuſpected of affection that way) ſhould ſubſcribe a particular Declaration of the unlawfulneſs of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as was the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hay,</hi> in <hi>the Principal Acts of the General Aſſembly,</hi> 1644.

I do grant, that it muſt needs be a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a good Man, that he cannot do <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> that Service which he hath devoted himſelf unto, by reaſon of ſome Limitations put upon him; but yet I think, that this is not ſufficient to carry him off from Communion with a <hi>Church,</hi> and to ſet up another, becauſe he is denied this Liberty: for he is ſtill capable of being a private Member of it, and therefore he ought to continue in the latter Capacity, when ſuſpended from the former. So ſaith Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi> in his <hi>Reformation not Separation, Epiſt. to the Reader: I cannot be perſwaded, that I am disbanded from Chriſts Army, ſo ſoon as I am ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded to my Conduct; I must march under his Banner, when I may not be permitted to march at the Head of a Company.</hi> So again, <hi>pag.</hi> 98. <hi>I conceive, Adminiſtration of God's Worſhip is much different from Attendance on God's Worſhip; and I stand bound to the last, when I am (juſtly or unjustly) bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the firſt.</hi> And this was the Opinion of the <hi>old Nonconformiſts.</hi> But now we find it otherwiſe; and ſometimes <hi>theſe</hi> plead the <hi>obligation of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the Relation which they have to a peculiar People,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>the neceſſity of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Souls.</hi> The firſt we find inſiſted upon by the Author of <hi>Separation yet no Schiſm, Epiſt. to the Reader: If it be asked, May not Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59953:54"/>
               <hi>within their Dominion, ſuſpend ſome Miniſters from the Exerciſe of their Office, when they conceive it is for the peace of the reſt? It will be anſwered, That the Lord of Lords, who giveth the Office and the Commiſſion,—hath certainly with the Office deſigned them to the Exerciſe thereof, and hath therein placed, not onely the Office, but the Exerciſe thereof, above the reſtraint of any Powers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo long as the Exerciſe thereof continues to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the Laws of Chriſt.</hi> And in this caſe, nothing is more ordinarily produced than that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Wo is me,</hi> &amp;c. But is not this to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance every one beyond the cogniſance of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and to fall in with the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> whilſt they decry it? If indeed theirs was the Apoſtle's caſe, the Apoſtle's reſolution of <hi>obeying God rather than Man,</hi> would become them: But how little it is ſo, let the <hi>old Nonconformiſts</hi> ſhew, in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the Browniſts,</hi> pag. 41. <hi>How unskilfully that ſpeech of the Apoſtles is alledged, will appear to them that will conſider theſe three differences between their Caſe and ours.</hi> 1. <hi>They that inhibited the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, were profeſſed Enemies to the Goſpel.</hi> 2. <hi>The Apoſtles were charged not to teach in the Name of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>nor to publiſh any part of the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> 3. <hi>The Apoſtles received not their Calling and Authority from men, nor by the hands of men, but</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59953:55"/>
               <hi>immediately from God himſelf; and therefore might not be reſtrained or depoſed by men: whereas we, though we exerciſe a Function whereof God is the Author, and we are alſo called of God to it, yet we are called and ordained by the ministry of men, and may therefore by men be depoſed, and reſtrained from the exerciſe of it.</hi> I ſhall conclude this with what Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Reformation not Separation,</hi> pag. 70. <hi>If the Being of Christianity depended upon my Perſonal Miniſtry, as the being or appearing a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth on my Communion with the Church viſible, the Inference might be of ſome force:</hi> But till that be proved, I think it is of little.</p>
            <p>But is this really the caſe? Then what becomes of thoſe that among themſelves have taken up whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with other Profeſſions, and yet were never char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their Brethren, for ſo doing, (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is by the Author of the <hi>Antidote, pag.</hi> 15.) <hi>with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the Lord's Work?</hi> Now I queſtion not, but the ſame Reaſon that did induce ſome to take up with other Employments to the neglect of this, and ſo ſatisfie the reſt, that they acquieſce in it, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be ſufficient to ſhew, That meer <hi>Ordination</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bind to the Exerciſe of that Office, when the Magiſtrate and Church forbids; and conſequently, that a <hi>Restraint</hi> is no <hi>intolerable Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>

(as it ſeems he may) it ſhews, that the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſo ſtrict as is pretended; and that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, Superiors in Church and State may ſo far diſſolve that Relation, as well as the Paſtor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But however, what relief will this afford to thoſe that leave thoſe Places where they had any pretence of ſuch a Relation, and buſie themſelves where they had none? What relief will this be to thoſe that contract a new Relation, and that do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches out of Churches? Surely Dr. <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s, Dr. <hi>Jacomb</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi>'s Flocks now, are taken from other Places than <hi>Alhallows Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, Martins Ludgate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The <hi>neceſſity of the People</hi> is what doth make their Preaching neceſſary (as they would have it underſtood. So <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion, pag.</hi> 59.), and ſo their Suſpenſion <hi>intolerable Perſecution.</hi> But ſuppoſing this, (as doubtleſs there is and ever was Work ſufficient for a greater number of skilful and faithful Labourers); yet is there no way to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but by facing a numerous Congregation, and preaching at ſuch Times, and in ſuch Places, as do declare a defiance to the Church, which they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make a manifeſt rupture in, and open ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from? Is there no good to be done by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Five, beſides a Mans own Family, and by Perſonal Conference and Inſtruction? How came
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59953:56"/>
then <hi>our Saviour and his Apoſtles oftentimes</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to this way, as an Author of their own, in his <hi>Archippus,</hi> doth inform us, <hi>pag.</hi> 21? But if it be of great advantage, and that <hi>it is no little part of a Miniſters Duty, perſonally to Inſtruct, and Preach from Houſe to Houſe,</hi> as that Author ſaith, how comes it to be ſo <hi>ſadly neglected</hi> by them, as he there complains? and how comes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Wo</hi> to be pleaded for the one, and not to bind the other? Hear what the Author of <hi>Sacrilegious Deſertion</hi> faith, <hi>pag.</hi> 93. <q rend="margQuotes">Is it not too much Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie to cry out againſt them that forbid us Preaching, and in the mean time to neglect that which none forbids us, <hi>viz. Chriſtian Conference.</hi>
               </q>  Certainly, as he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 94. <hi>Sincerity inclineth men to that way of Duty that hath leaſt Oſtentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the ſtate of the People be indeed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why do we not find them where there is moſt need of their Aſſiſtance? Are we not told, in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious Deſertion,</hi> pag. 10. <hi>That the Nonconformiſts have found, that ſome Places of many Years past have had no Ministers at all?</hi> Are there no Places in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> that do much more abound in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, than <hi>London,</hi> and the adjacent Parts? and are the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> there to be met with? No, that Work is left to one (good Soul) that having not a Liberty by the Law to exerciſe his Office in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59953:57"/>
the more Publick way, doth with unwearied dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence purſue the Ends of it, in travelling over ſteep Mountains and craggy Rocks, and converſing with the rude and untaught Natives, whilſt others do more conſult their Eaſe and Profit.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, upon the whole, that their Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is not <hi>intolerable Perſecution,</hi> or what will be ſufficient to juſtifie their <hi>Separation;</hi> but that ſtill, notwithſtanding their Pleas, they are upon the ſame terms with the People; and what will not juſtifie the Separation of the People, will not juſtifie that of the Miniſter; and what is ſufficient to retain the People in Communion, is ſufficient to retain the Miniſter.</p>
            <p>And ſo we are left to conſider the State of the People, and whether there be on their part <hi>intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſecution.</hi> Not to diſpute whether what is ſuffered be <hi>Perſecution,</hi> or not; I ſhall onely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether it be what is ſufficient to warrant their <hi>Separation:</hi> And that will appear, if we obſerve, That their Suffering muſt be either becauſe they do not at all Communicate with the Church, or that there are ſome particular things onely which they do not Communicate with us in. If it be for the former, then they did ſeparate before their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſequently their Suffering can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their Separation. If it be onely as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59953:57"/>
things, then, I ſay, it will be hard to ſhew, that any Perſon doth ſuffer <hi>intolerably</hi> upon that ſcore; the Church proceeding in ſo great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where Perſons have ſhewed their readineſs to hold Communion with her in what they can, and have ſo far given ſatisfaction of their Piety, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, and Compliance, that in the Caſes where the Laws have been thought ſevere, they have rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been executed upon ſuch in their ſeverity. Which I conceive is a ſufficient Reply to thoſe that cry out, <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and <hi>intolerable,</hi> becauſe of the great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that Offenders in ſuch kind are liable unto. For, the meer ſuppoſal and expectation of ſeverity, is no good Reaſon for Separation, as long as it is not, nor is likely to be actually inflicted. For, as Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> in his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Separation,</hi> printed 1640. <hi>pag.</hi> 107. doth ſay, <hi>Though Humane Laws, under never ſo great Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, ſhould bind us to never ſo great Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Gods Service; yet ſo long as we do not actually communicate in thoſe Corruptions, our Communicating is never the worſe for the ſaid Laws:</hi> So I ſay, Though Laws threaten never ſo great Puniſhments, yet ſo long as we do not actually ſuffer them, our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the worſe for theſe Laws. And this was thought a good Argument by Mr. <hi>Baily,</hi> in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Vindication of the Church of Scotland,</hi> 1646.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59953:58"/>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. who, when charged, That the King and his Family are ſubject to the <hi>Claſſical Aſſemby,</hi> anſwers, <hi>That any</hi> Presbyterian <hi>did ever ſo much as begin a Proceſs with any Prince, when they had the greatest Provocations thereto, it cannot be ſhewed to this day. The Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>notwithſtanding all the croſs Actions of King</hi> James, <hi>or King</hi> Charles,—<hi>yet never did ſo much as bethink themſelves of drawing againſt them the Sword of Church-Cenſures.</hi> Where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not the Charge of their Churches claiming ſuch a Power; but thinks it enough to reply, That ſhe had never ſo uſed it. So then you ſee, that it is not the Power that our Superiors have, nor the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that a Law threatens, that will ſerve in this caſe; as long as the Uſe of that Power, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thoſe Laws is ſuſpended: and a Perſon ought not any more to quit the Church, than he will his Country, as long as he may be ſuffered to abide in it. And that he may do with us, that will hold Communion with our Church in what he can, and doth behave himſelf with modeſty in thoſe things which for the preſent he cannot Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in.</p>

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59953:58"/>
5. That which will warrant a <hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>a neceſſary Communion with it in its Sins.</hi> Towards the reſolution of which, I ſhall obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That bare Communion with a Church, doth not neceſſarily make a Perſon to communicate with the Sins of it.</hi> This is granted by all that ſay, We muſt not ſeparate from a Church, becauſe of the <hi>ungodly</hi> that are in its Communion, or becauſe of ſome <hi>mixtures</hi> that are in its Worſhip: And if we muſt not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from them, it is certain we may continue there, without being guilty of the Sin of them. How far the firſt of theſe is and ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, I have ſhewed above, at <hi>pag.</hi> 62. And how far the latter, you may ſee in Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi>'s <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of Schiſm,</hi> pag. 50. <hi>Though toleration of ſome unwarrantable mixtures in a Church, be an evil; yet it is not ſo great an evil, as Separation upon that ground.</hi> This was the Opinion of the Five diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethren, in their <hi>Apologetical Narration,</hi> pag. 6. <hi>We have always profeſsed, and that in thoſe times when the Churches of</hi> England <hi>were the most either actually over-ſpread with defilements, or in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est danger thereof,—That we both did and would hold a Communion with them, as the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> And this they agreed to, upon this conſideration, that otherwiſe there hath been no Church yet, nor will be to the day of Judgment, which Perſons
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59953:59"/>
otherwiſe perſwaded, could or can hold Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with; as you may find it in the <hi>old Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Letters</hi> to thoſe of <hi>New-England,</hi> pag. 12. Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s <hi>Separation examined,</hi> pag. 25. and <hi>the Vindication of the Provincial Aſsembly,</hi> pag. 135.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. I add,</hi> That the impoſition of things unlawful, or ſo thought to be, in a Church, makes a Perſon in this caſe no farther concerned, than as they are impoſed on him. <hi>For, if Corruptions</hi> tolerated <hi>are no bar to Communion, then they are not when</hi> impoſed; <hi>meer</hi> Impoſition not altering the Nature, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>ſaith, in his</hi> Jerubbaal, pag. <hi>27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Impoſition in ſome things unlawful, or ſuppoſed ſo to be, will not juſtifie a ſeparation from what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> The Author of <hi>Separation yet no Schiſm,</hi> in his <hi>Epistle to the Reader,</hi> thus pleads for the People: <q rend="margQuotes">The People are not always free from ſuch Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which they extremely ſuſpect as ſinful; as that they cannot enjoy <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren without the <hi>Croſs,</hi> nor receive the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> without <hi>Kneeling;</hi>
               </q> to name no more, (as well he could not). But ſuppoſe that theſe things are impoſed, and what they extremely ſuſpect; can this be a Reaſon for their ſeparation in thoſe things where nothing of this nature is? Certainly, in obedience to Magiſtrates, and for Communion with a Church, we ought to go as far as we can;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59953:59"/>
and what I cannot do, is no excuſe for the omiſſion of what I can. Thus did the <hi>old Nonconformiſts</hi> think and practice, as I obſerved to you before, from the <hi>Vindication of the Provincial Aſſembly,</hi> pag. 135. <hi>That though ſome of them thought it unlawful to receive the Sacrament kneeling, yet they held Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church in the reſt.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> argues, in his <hi>Separation examined,</hi> pag. 29. <hi>Suppoſe there ſhould be ſome Humane mixtures, are all the Ordinances polluted? Why do you not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with them in thoſe Ordinances which are pure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be true, what ſhall we ſay to them that have nothing to object againſt the greateſt part of what they are required to communicate with us in; and yet keep up a total and poſitive Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from us, as if all Parts were alike infected, and that from the Crown of the Head, to the Sole of the Foot, there was nothing but Wounds and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying Sores?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The meer ſuſpicion that a Perſon may have of the unlawfulneſs of what is impoſed, will not juſtifie his omiſſion of, or ſeparation in that particular.</hi> For, he ought to come to ſome reſolution in it, and in caſe of Obedience, Communion, and Charity, to go againſt ſuch his Suſpicion. To this purpoſe ſpeaks Mr. <hi>Geree,</hi> in his <hi>Reſolution of Ten Caſes,</hi> 1644.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59953:60"/>
               <q rend="margQuotes">Things wherein doubts ariſe, are of a double na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 1. Meerly arbitrary, and at my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe: 2. That are under command; as coming to the Sacrament, Obedience to the Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in things lawful. If Scruples ariſe about theſe, and a Man doubts he ſins if he acts, and he alſo doubts he ſins if he forbears, &amp;c. In this caſe he muſt weigh the Scales, and where he apprehends moſt weight of Reaſon, muſt incline that way, though the other Scale be not altogether empty. And this done, after humble and diligent ſearch, with bewailing our infirmity, that we are no more diſcerning, will be accepted by God: God puts not his People on neceſſity of ſinning, nor can our Scruples diſpenſe with his Commands.</q> So Mr. <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> in his <hi>Quakeriſm no Chriſtianity, pag.</hi> 93. <q rend="margQuotes">In doubtful and difficult Caſes, wherein we cannot reach the knowledge of our Duty, it's our Duty to follow the Examples of the greateſt number of the Saints, &amp;c.</q>  And then ſurely, what will ſerve in ſuch a caſe to let us diſpenſe with our Doubts, will much more in Obedience to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and for Communion with a Church. This I thought to have more largely handled, as it's thought a new and late Argument, uſed by Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> &amp;c. (but what I can prove to be of old the common Reſolution of the Caſe), and as the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59953:60"/>
contrary is pleaded for from Mr. <hi>Hales:</hi> But light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happily upon a Book called <hi>Mr. Hales's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Schiſm examined,</hi> wrote by a Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſhall refer you to it, where he particularly undertakes this Point, <hi>pag.</hi> 110, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Having thus made good the Three Propoſitions aboveſaid, and ſhewed, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a True Church; That there is a Separation from it;</hi> and, <hi>That this Separation is voluntary and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:</hi> that which remains is not to be denied, <hi>viz. That therefore the preſent Separation is Schiſmatical.</hi> So that now you may ſee in what condition thoſe of our diſſenting Brethren are, that withdraw from the Communion of our Church; and how little able they will be to reconcile their preſent Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to their former Principles and Profeſſions. It was once ſaid by them, in the <hi>Vindication of the Presbyterial Government,</hi> pag. 133. <hi>We dare not make ſeparation from a true Church, by departing from it, as you do,</hi> [ſpeaking to the <hi>Independents.]</hi> Then <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency</hi> was what they proved to be <hi>Schiſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> 1. <hi>Independents do depart from our Churches, being true Churches, and ſo acknowledged by themſelves.</hi> 2. <hi>They draw and ſeduce Members from our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> 3. <hi>They erect ſeparate Congregations.</hi> 4. <hi>They refuſe Communion with our Churches in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now we judge, that no Schiſm is to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59953:61"/>
               <hi>in the Church;</hi> as ſay the <hi>London-Miniſters,</hi> in their <hi>Letter to the Aſſembly, pag.</hi> 3. Then the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Conſequences of it could be diſcovered and repreſented, as that by it <hi>Peoples minds would be troubled, and in danger to be ſubverted; bitter heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning would be fomented and perpetuated; godly, painful, and orthodox Miniſters be diſcouraged, and deſpiſed; the life and power of Godlineſs be eaten out, by frivolous Diſputes; and the whole Courſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in private Families be interrupted, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;</hi> as they there ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. Then <hi>Church-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was as great a Sin as Adultery and Theft,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Bryan</hi> maintains, in <hi>the Publick Diſputation at Kilingworth,</hi> 1655. <hi>pag.</hi> 28. Then it was pleaded, That they <hi>Covenanted not onely againſt Sin, but Schiſm,</hi> as ſaith Mr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> in his <hi>Anatomy upon the Heart, pag.</hi> 160. But is not that now true, which he there charges upon themſelves, <hi>We have gone againſt the Letter of it?</hi> For, do not many of them that have ſaid all this, <hi>ſet up Churches againſt Churches, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Worſhip of God, adminiſter Ordinances, the Word, Sacraments, apart, and in a ſeparated Body? Which in a peculiar manner, and by way of eminency, is called Schiſm,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Brinſley,</hi> pag. 16. Is <hi>Schiſm</hi> all on a ſudden grown ſo innocent a thing, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be indulged, and tamely permitted to continue in it? And is it not as <hi>ſad</hi> now, as it was
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59953:61"/>
then, that <hi>many that pretend to Religion, make no Conſcience of Schiſm,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> on <hi>Jude,</hi> pag. 492. doth obſerve? Certainly, That ſtill remains good which was ſaid by Mr. <hi>Brinſley,</hi> pag. 17. <hi>The Schiſms and Diviſions which are broken in, and that amongst God's own People, are what I cannot but look upon as one of the blackeſt Clouds, one of the ſaddeſt Judgments which hang over the head of this Kingdom at this day; of ſad influence for the preſent, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be healed, of dangerous conſequence for the future.</hi> Have we not <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> enough to encounter; but muſt we have more Work found us, by thoſe that have given us Arguments to oppoſe themſelves with? Are we in no danger of being over-run with a Foreign Power, and <hi>that the Romans ſhall come and take away our Name and Church;</hi> when we, which are at difference amongſt our ſelves, ſhall without any oppoſition be ſwallowed up by them? Are they yet to be taught, that as nothing can, ſo nothing will ſooner make us a prey to them, than mutual Hoſtilities amongſt our ſelves? And whence is it, that they will run the adventure, and care not what they expoſe us to? Is it that <hi>Rome</hi> is nearer to them, than they are to us? That will not be ſuppoſed. Is it that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect better Quarter from that, than they meet with from our Church? That let Experience decide. Is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59953:62"/>
it that by bringing all to confuſion, and a common ſcramble, they may hope to go away with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy? That their Diviſions amongſt themſelves doth confute. For, can they think, becauſe they agree againſt us, that they will agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Or, can they think, if they do not, that one alone can carry the Victory from the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? Let a ſober Author of their own, in his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe of the Religion of England,</hi> be heard, who ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. <hi>That the common ſafety and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of true Religion cannot ſtand by a multiplicity of petty Forms; but requires an ample and well-ſetled State, to defend and propagate it againſt the amplitude and potency of the Romiſh Intereſt.</hi> And are not theſe the thoughts of the wiſeſt in this Nation? and ſhall Men yet continue to keep up Feuds and Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and make no ſcruple of contradicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to feed them? It was once ſaid by Mr. <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley, pag.</hi> 62. That <hi>it's a foul blemiſh to a Miniſter of Chriſt, to ſpeak one thing to day, and another thing to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, to ſay and unſay.</hi> And I will appeal to all the World, whether this be not what our Brethren are guilty of. Surely, if they would but take the pains to review what they have written, and weigh thoſe Arguments againſt <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> that they formerly publiſhed, they would return to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to that <hi>Church</hi> which they have ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59953:62"/>
broken off from; they would then think it their Duty, with the <hi>old Nonconformiſts,</hi> to come as far as they can, and their Happineſs to live in the Communion of that <hi>Church</hi> where they may be as good as they will; they would then ſee, that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a great Sin, and that their <hi>preſent Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould now conclude, but that I may fear that Mr. <hi>Jenkin</hi> will proclaim, and others think me a Slanderer, for ſaying, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. That he hath borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Subſtance of this <hi>Sermon</hi> from Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi>'s <hi>Arraignment of Schiſm,</hi> if I do not make it good: and therefore in my own vindication, and alſo to ſhew you how far <hi>holineſs and indignation</hi> may be pretended, when indeed it is little better than <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and calumny</hi> that prompts Men on, I ſhall draw the Compariſon, and leave you and all others to judge, whether he be not one of thoſe <hi>empty and unaccompliſhed Predicants</hi> ſpoken of in his <hi>Exodus,</hi> pag. 56. <hi>that preach the Sermons of others,</hi> and, more than that, dare before all the World publiſh them as his own: the like to which is alſo done by him, or one of his Brethren, in the <hi>Vindication of the Presbyterial Government, pag.</hi> 132. compared with Mr. <hi>Brinſley, pag.</hi> 16. and <hi>pag.</hi> 134. with 52. and <hi>pag.</hi> 135. with 41.

                           <label>Mr. Jenkin.</label>THeir Hereſies were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and damnable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; their Schiſm was a perverſe Separation from Church-communion: The former was in Doctrinals, the latter in Practicals; the former was oppoſite to Faith, this latter to Charity. By Faith all the Members are united to the Head, by Charity one to another: and as the breaking of the former is Hereſie, ſo their breaking of the latter was Schiſm. <bibl>pag. 21.</bibl>

The groundleſneſs; when there is no caſting of perſons out of the Church by an unjuſt Cenſure of Excommunication, no departure by unſufferable Perſecution, no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie nor Idolatry in the Church maintained. 2. The manner of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration makes it unlawful; when 'tis made without due endeavour, and waiting for Reformation of the Church from which the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is: and ſuch a raſh departure is againſt Charity, which ſuffers both much and long all tolerable things: It is not preſently diſtaſted, when the juſteſt occaſion is given; it firſt uſeth all poſſible means of remedy. The Chyrurgeon reſerves Diſmembring as the laſt remedy. It looks upon a ſudden breaking off from Communion with a Church (which is a diſmembring) not as Chyrurgery, but Butchery. <bibl>pag. 23.</bibl>

How monſtrous and diſhonourable is the very conceit hereof! 2. It's rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt his Command, his great Command of Love. The Grace of Love is by ſome called the Queen of Graces; and it's greater than Faith in reſpect of its Object, not God onely, but Man; its Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is eternal; its manner of working, not in a way of receiving Chriſt (as Faith), but of giving the Soul to him. <bibl>pag. 24.</bibl>
