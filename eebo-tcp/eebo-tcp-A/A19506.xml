            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:23620:3"/>
God hath made so eminent in you.</p>
            <p>I may truely say, there is no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

            </p>
            <p>It is now twelue hundreth years
<pb facs="tcp:23620:3"/>
since your honourable name hath
beene famous in this kingdome: but
which is much more, and wherein,
in my iudgement, it is marueilous,
the first mention of your Tribe, in the
story, doth not record the rising ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
from a small estate vnto an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as it doth in many Peeres of the
land, who for their vertue also were
aduanced; but at the first sight, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
your worthy Predecessor stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the highest top of Honour,
wherein a subiect can be: for not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was he then brother in law to king
<hi>Fergus</hi> the 2. but for his Wisedome,
Valour, &amp; Manhood, by consent of
the Nobles, both Scots &amp; Picts, then
gathered to battell, he was chosen, as
meetest Chieftaine, to demolish that
diuision-wall of <hi>Abircorne,</hi> stretching
from the East sea, to the West, built
first by <hi>Victorine,</hi> and fortified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
more strongly, by <hi>Gallio,</hi> both of
them Romane Lieutenants; but more
victoriously, first &amp; last, broken down
by the valiant <hi>Graeme,</hi> in presence
<pb facs="tcp:23620:4"/>
of both the Kings, that so a way might
be prepared to their armies, to make
irruption vpon the Romans, for
which, vnto this day, the remanents of
that worke, beares the name of <hi>Graeme</hi>
his ditch, when himselfe is gone.

            <p>It is true, there are many honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
families in this land, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with you in the same name:
but that this is the honour of your
house, is euident, not onely by the
lands, bordering with that wall, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
as yet by your L. and was, as
the story recordeth, one of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
why that waighty charge was
committed to your worthy ancestors;
but in this also that the remanant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
who come vnder the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the same name, hold lands
of your house, from which, as from
a most ancient stocke, they as sproutes
and branches, haue growne and
sprung out.</p>
            <p>And of this, as it is euident, that
<pb facs="tcp:23620:4"/>
your honourable house is more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
then the Chronicle can declare,
so doth this greatly increase the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, that it hath continued in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
euer since, euen to the daies of
your noble Father of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who for fidelitie to his Prince, loue
to his Countrey, equity toward all
men, after he had borne many other
offices of honour, was in his olde
age honored to be his Maiesties high
Commissioner, and also great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of this kingdome: his house
like the open court of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> his
palace, wherein hee banquetted his
people, euer plenished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and patent to
such, as pleased to resort.</p>
            <p>In a word, no lesse honourable in this
Kingdome hath your Familie beene,
then the Tribes either of <hi>Leontis,</hi> or
<hi>Aeantis,</hi> among the Athenians, for
their feates of armes, and glorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
atchieued in battell; or among
the Romanes, these fiue principall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<hi>Vitellij, Fabij, Antonij, Potitij,
Mamilij,</hi> who for their most ancient
<pb facs="tcp:23620:5"/>
discent, were called <hi>Aborigines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But howsoeuer these be great
things, yet are they not the greatest,
which doe commend you, <hi>Virtute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,

            <q>Miserum est aliorum incumbere famae.</q>
            <p>Yea, the more honourable the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage
is, the greater is the shame
of him that degenerates from it, and
so becomes <hi>indignus genere.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may iustly be spoken of
many in this age, which
the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
spake of the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note>
               <hi>When, as concerning the time,
yee ought to be teachers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yee haue neede againe that
wee teach you the first principles
of the word of God, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
such, as haue neede of
Milke, and not of strong meate:</hi>
they professe faith in Christ, but in
truth doe not beleeue in him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet can they, because they know
him not: they are baptised in his
name, but are not bureid with him
<pb facs="tcp:23620:9"/>
through Baptisme, neither raised
vp together, through the faith of
the operation of God, that raised
him from the dead: they carrie his
cognisance and badge, but are not
militant vnder him in his warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
            <p>As the Athenians sacrificed, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noto
Deo,</hi> to a strange God, and the
Samaritans worshipped that, which
they knew not; so our Atheists,
<hi>profitentur ignotum Christum,</hi>
professe a strange Christ: they know
not what he is in himselfe, nor how
hee is become ours, nor what hee
hath done for vs: and therefore
neither in life, nor death, doe they
expresse his vertue. They liue licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
<hi>reprobate vnto euery
good worke,</hi> dishonouring Christ,
as if hee were a Sauiour who
had no power to sanctifie those
which are in him; and they dye
<pb facs="tcp:23620:9"/>
without comfort, as if Christ by
death had not obtained life, and by
death did not transport to life, all
that are in him; thus while they
professe fellowship with him, they
declare themselues to be strangers
from him.</p>
            <p>It is witnessed by the Lord, in
<hi>Ezechiel,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18. 20.</note> the same soule that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
shall die: the sonne shall not
beare the inquitie of the father,
neither shall the father beare the
iniquitie of the sonne, but the
righteousnesse of the righteous
shalbe vpon him, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of the wicked shalbe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himselfe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A question good to waken drousie Christians out of their dead security.</note> If according to this
testimonie of the word, it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them, seeing Christ is holy,
and righteous, and wee are the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
how is it that hee is punished
and wee are spared? This is but one
of the least of Sathans assaults, by
<pb facs="tcp:23620:10"/>
which he impugnes the faith of men,
and yet if they be required to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
it, they shall soone bewray
themselues to be voide of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and solide faith, confident one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a naked profession, which will
not faile in the end to beguile them.
For as an house faultie in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
cannot abide the stormy
windes,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> and raine, no more can a
Christian not informed with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
not rooted, grounded, and
builded in Christ Iesus, by faith,
endure in the houre of tentation.</p>
            <p>That therefore the doctrine of
Christianitie may be learned by such
as knowes it not,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in three arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie, Baptisme, and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> from the very
foundation, we haue here proposed
three most necessary points to be
entreated: The first, is Christs Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie:
the second, his Baptisme:
the third, his Tentation. In the
first, wee are taught what manner
<pb facs="tcp:23620:10"/>
of man our Lord is in himselfe. In
the second, what manner of way he
is become ours. In the third, what
manner of way he did begin to worke
the worke of our Redemption: all
most necessary to be knowne, for the
right grounding of our Faith on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
him.<note place="margin">The first is to know that Iesus the sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
               </note> In his Genealogie wee see how
Iesus, the sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is that
same blessed seede of the woman,
whom the Lord promised in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
to whom the Prophets, of all
times, pointed, and for whom the
godly fathers of all ages waited, and
expected, lineally desended from
<hi>Adam,</hi> by seauentie and foure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
In his Baptisme wee see how
he was consecrated,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours.</note> and ordained, in
most solemne manner, to doe the
office of the <hi>Mesias,</hi> that is, of an
anointed King, Preist, and Prophet,
for our Saluation, so that he is now
no more a priuate man but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb facs="tcp:23620:11"/>
by most sure authoritie, and
in most solemne manner, become our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> head and redeemer.<note place="margin">The third, how hee hath done the worke of a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> And in his
temtation we see how immediately
after his ordination, he encounters
with Sathan in a singular combat,
ouercomming him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
who before had ouercome our
parents in paradise: and so by his
first deed after his consecration,
makes it manifest that he was come
to destroy the workes of the Diuell.<note place="margin">These three ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make vp a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If these three be ioyned together
in one, wee shall finde them making
vp vnto vs a compleat doctrine of
Christian consolation. The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
in regard of his diuine nature,
is called by the Prophet <hi>Zachary,
Gnamith,<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note> Iehoua,</hi> that is, the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and companion of <hi>Iehoua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☞</note> or
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it,<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 6.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
equall with God. In regard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
of his humaine nature,<note place="margin">Iob 19. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23620:11"/>
calleth him <hi>Goel,</hi> my kinsman. In
regard of his vnited natures, he is
called by <hi>Esay,<note place="margin">Esa. 8. 8.</note> Emanuel,</hi> God with
vs.<note place="margin">Nomb. 3 5.</note> Now we know that by the law he
who was neerest kinsman,<note place="margin">How Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers equal and our kinsman is properly the true auenger and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of his brethren.</note> had power
to reuenge the blood of his brother
vpon the Murtherer, if hee had
found him without a Citie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;
and therefore was he stiled by
the name of an auenger, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hee had power to redeeme the
inheritance which his brother,
through pouertie, had lost: for the
word <hi>Gaal,</hi> from which <hi>Goel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
hath in it these two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
significations, to <hi>redeeme,</hi> and
to <hi>reuenge;</hi> So that heere wee see
how the Lord Iesus, being neerest
of kinne vnto vs, as wee may see out
of his Genealogie, being likewise
clad with the power of a redeemer
and reuenger, as wee shall learne
out of his Baptisme, commeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb facs="tcp:23620:12"/>
after his entrie to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Office of the Messias, vpon
Sathan that murtherer, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him out of a Citie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
enters into combat with him,
to reuenge the blood of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and to redeeme the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which they had foolishly sould
for nothing: yea moreouer he doth
that which no tipicall <hi>Goel</hi> vnder
the <hi>Law,</hi> was able to doe; for not
onely doth hee ouerthrow the
murtherer, but restoreth
life againe to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that were
slaine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred
by
him.</p>

first father of Christ according to
the flesh, reckoned in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie,
<hi>Adam,</hi> is called the sonne
of God, to wit, both by creation,
and regeneration: for in it, wee
haue manifold comforts discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto vs, if wee conioyne the
end of this Genealogie with the
beginning. For in the beginning
thereof wee see that the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
is the sonne of God, and the
same by diuine dispensation; the
the first father of Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the flesh, and so as <hi>Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>

Christ, who being very GOD,
would also be made the sonne of
man, that by him men might be
made the sonnes of GOD. See
what a binding corner-stone the
Lord Iesus is, knitting together
not man with man onely, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

God also, and that not by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall

hath perfected in himselfe, but by
a spirituall vnion also, by which
he vnites all the members of his

such ioyfull tydings as these
are? We read that vnder the <hi>Law,</hi>
the Lord came downe to Mount
Sinai,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> and <hi>Moses</hi> went vp; a great
fauour indeed, that the Maiestie
of God should come downe to
visite his owne creature, and
should honour man, by keeping
dyet to speake with him in so
homely a manner. But vnder the
GOSPELL, in a more fauourable
manner the Lord shews himselfe
familiar with men, for not onely
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23620:18"/>
doe his holy Angels ioyne in
company with shepheards,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 9.</note> but
himselfe becomes the sonne of
man, walking among men, to mak
men the sonnes of God.<note place="margin">How wee should be thankefull for so great a mercy.</note> Let vs
meditate vpon this mercy, that
howsoeuer wee be not able to
conceiue the greatnesse thereof,
yet at least wee may grow in
thankfulnesse to our God for it:
he came to seeke vs, hee found vs
imprisoned, bound with the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of our sinnes, hee hath loosed
our bands, gone vp againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, and bidden vs follow him,
worthy are wee of double shame,
and confusion, and that our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
woe should be worse then
our first, if wee will not arise to
make hast and follow him. The
sinnes done against the Law may
be cured by the grace of the
Gospell, but if the grace offered
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23620:19"/>
in the Gospel be despised, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
there any other sacrifice
for sinne?<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 27.</note> None at all, <hi>but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  </p>
                  <p>Beside this, we are here confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in two other notable points
of Christian religion, the one is,
of Christs marueilous Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which hee became the
sonne of man, the other is
of our supernaturall Adoption,
whereby wee become the sonnes
of God. Wee beleeue that our
first father <hi>Adam</hi> was a very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man, yet neither gotten of
a man, nor borne of a woman, but
formed immediatly by the hand
of God, and that of the earth,
being as yet a virgin (so to call
it with <hi>Ireneus</hi>) for neither had
the Lord rayned vpon it,<note place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. Cap. 31.</note> neither
had the hand of man tilled, or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23620:19"/>
laboured it:<note place="margin">And that by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison taken from the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Euah.</hi>
                     </note> as likewise wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that <hi>Euah</hi> was a naturall
woman, yet neither begotten by
a man, nor borne of a woman,
but formed of <hi>Adams</hi> rib, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by God. Why then will we
doubt that Christ was made a
very naturall man,<note place="margin">☜</note> yet not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by man, but formed of <hi>Dauids</hi>
seede in the virgins wombe, by
the immediate operation of the
holy Ghost? Indeed if the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had beene begotten of the
seede of man, it might probably
haue beene thought that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam</hi> was begotten of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> hath with the first the same simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
but seeing the first <hi>Adam</hi>
was formed of the earth, by the
hand of God immediately, it was
also conuenient, that the second
<hi>Adam,</hi> who was to bring home
man againe to GOD, should be
made man by the hand of God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23620:20"/>
without the operation of man,
that so the second <hi>Adam,</hi> might
haue with the first <gap reason="foreign">

the same simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and likenesse of generation.</p>
                  <p>The other point,<note place="margin">Our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption is here also confirmed.</note> wherein here
wee are confirmed, is of our owne
supernaturall Adoption: wee see
that the sonne of God is become
the sonne of man; the sonne of
<hi>Dauid;</hi> of <hi>Abraham;</hi> of <hi>Adam;</hi>
and why then will wee not (saith
Chrisostome) be strengthned in
the faith,<note place="margin">☞</note> to giue glory to God,<note place="margin">For seeing we see that God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the sonne of man, why shall wee thinke it impossible that man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the the sonne of God?</note>
by beleeuing that the sonnes of
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> following
the Adoption, shall also be made
the sonnes of God? surely in mans
iudgement, it seemes more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that God should become

the shape of a Seruant, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the ignominious death of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23620:20"/>
Crosse, then that man should be

with glory; yet the first of these

why then shall wee any more
doubt of the second?<note place="margin">Chrisost. <hi>in</hi> Math. Hom. 2.</note> especially
seeing it was not in vaine, and for

of Christ, according to the
flesh; and where <hi>Sem</hi> also had
many sonnes, hee passes by them
all, and makes choise of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi>
and so contracting his promises
into narrower bounds, he makes
vp the couenant with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
and is content to be named
the God of <hi>Sem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 26.</note> which is the

                  <p>Next,<note place="margin">Three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons giuen why in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie, <hi>Thamar</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christs mothers, not <hi>Sara,</hi> nor <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca.</hi>
                     </note> it is to be considered
heere, why in this Genealogie
<hi>Thamar, Rahab, and Bethsabe,</hi> are
mentioned among the mothers
of our Lord, and not <hi>Sara,</hi> nor,
<hi>Rebecca,</hi> women famous for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse;
whereas this <hi>Thamar,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
shee had an earnest desire
of seede, and thereby declared
her faith in the promises of God,
yet shee sought it by an vnlawfull
incestuous copulation with her
owne father in law; and <hi>Rahab</hi>
by Nation was a Cananite, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23620:25"/>
conuersation a harlot, and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shabe</hi>
the wife of <hi>Vriah</hi> was shee
with whom <hi>Dauid</hi> committed
double adultrie. The reasons of
this are many, but wee content
vs with three: the first is to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Iewes: the second is to
comfort sinners: the third to
shew the great glory of Christ.</p>
                  <p>As for the first,<note place="margin">The first is to represse the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie of the Iewes, glorying of their progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> it is knowne
how insolently the Iewes gloried
that they were the posteritie of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> neglecting the vertues
of their fathers, they boasted that
they were their children, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
their fathers vertue a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Apologie and defence of
all their vices: and therefore to
humble them, the blemishes of
their parents are purposly shewed
in this Genealogie. And to teach
all men that true Nobilitie is
not in the priuiledges of flesh,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23620:25"/>
but in the graces of the minde, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be sought without vs in
the prerogatiues of our parents,
but within our owne proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,<note place="margin">An answer for such as vainely glory of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage.</note>
whereby we are rectified. But
at this day it may be spoken to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> records,
was sometime answered to a Noble
man, despising another that was
come of meane parentage, &amp; boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of his owne nobilitie,<note place="margin">Nazan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in nobilem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le moratum.</note> 
                     <hi>mihi, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit,
probro genus meum est, tu au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
generituo:</hi> My parentage is a
reproach to me,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of poore pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed that nature which once was sinnefull and did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from sinne.</note> but thou art a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to they parentage.</p>
                  <p>The second reason is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
poore penitent sinners. The
Lord Iesus came into the world
<hi>non vt iudex, sed vt medicus,</hi> not
as a iudge, but as a Phisitian, <hi>non
vt nostra fugeret opprobria, sed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingueret
potius:</hi> that hee might
not shunne our reproches, but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23620:26"/>
rather that hee might blot them
out, and heale them. If it had
pleased him hee might haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
mans nature anew, such
as had neuer sinned, as was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
nature before the fall, such
a one, I say, might hee haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and ioyned it in a personall
vnion with his diuine, but if so
hee had done, where then should
haue bene the comfort of sinners,
wee had still remained vnder des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
without any hope that
this nature of ours,<note place="margin">See wat a comfort is here.</note> should euer
haue beene deliuered from the
corruption thereof, but that now
hee assumed our nature,<note place="margin">☞</note> which
once was sinfull, and hath fully
seperated it from all sinne, it giues
vnto vs liuely hope, that hee will
also sunder vs from our sinnes,
so that they shall not be able to
hinder our spirituall fellowship,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23620:26"/>
and communion with him.</p>
                  <p>The third reason is,<note place="margin">The third is to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Christ his glory, in that hee tooke no holinesse from his parents.</note> to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Christ his greater glory, by
declaring to the world, that hee
tooke no holinesse of his fathers.
If all his parents mentioned in
this Genealogie had bene famous
for godlinesse onely, it might
haue beene thought a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Christ to be holy, that
was come of so holy progenitors;
but in that he descended of sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
parents, and yet was borne
a holy one, and without sinne, it
declared him to be that great
high Preist, <hi>holy, harmeles, vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 27</note>
separate from sinners,</hi> who
giueth holinesse to all that are in
communion with him, but takes
not holinesse from any. This is
his peculiar glory belonging to
himselfe alonely, and to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:23620:27"/>And therefore the Papists,<note place="margin">It is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to affirme that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceiued and borne without sinne.</note>
while as they goe about to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Christ, by affirming that his
mother the blessed Virgin was
conceiued and borne without
sinne, doe in very deede rather
dishonour him: as if from her, he
had taken the holinesse of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or that hee could not haue
beene conceiued and borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinne, vnlesse his mother had
beene conceiued and borne
without sinne before him. They
might consider that the holy
Ghost, by whom our Lord was
conceiued, could very well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the seede of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the
Virgins wombe, from the sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
corruption thereof; he tooke
that seede; hee sanctined it, and
separated it from sinne, and of
it framed the humane body of
our Lord, and this is the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23620:27"/>
reseruing to Iesus Christ
his proper glory, and to poore
sinners their necessary comfort.</p>
                  <p>But the contrary doctrine of
the Aduersaries,<note place="margin">How this errore was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long since by <hi>Barnard.</hi>

of Lyons, who first did institute
a feast of the conception of <hi>Mary,</hi>
to be obserued in the Church, in
the honourable remembrance
of her conception without sinne:
for it is, saith he, the onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of Christ, who was to
sanctifie all: hee came without

Fathers, who through the priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the first borne, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Doctors, and cheife lights
of the Church, till the comming
of Christ. Vpon this golden line
runnes the whole booke of God:
he that would read it with profit,
must remember the course of
the spirit of God in the diducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this line. If at any time he
diuert from it, it is onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlace
some purpose, which may
cleare the storie of the line. So
with the description of the linage

of the house and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of <hi>Cham,</hi> who are not in

the line. Likewise when he draws

the Historie of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and
<hi>Iacob,</hi> so likewise the historie and
posteritie of <hi>Nahor, Ismaell,</hi> and
<hi>Esau.</hi> But as we may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
he insists not in the historie
of them who are beside the line,
but hauing spoken so much of
them as may cleare the storie of
the line, he lets them alone, and
returnes to his purpose, alway fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
forth the line, till he come
to the promised <hi>Shiloh.</hi>

he, and therefore neuer one had
such a calling, and confirmation
as hee, for now the heauens are
opened, the holy Ghost in a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

shape discends vpon him,
and God the father by an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice from heauen, doth au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise
him. The principall end of
this Treatise will be to teach vs
how Iesus is become ours, which
is a speciall and necessary point
for vs to learne.</p>
                  <p>The parts of his Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are two;<note place="margin">Two things considered in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of Christ to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Redeemer.</note> In the first wee see,
how the Lord Iesus by receiuing
the Sacrament of Baptisme, doth
come in our place and roome,
as our kinsman, as the first borne
of his brethren, as the head of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
his misticall body; in a word,<note place="margin">That Christ wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly maketh himselfe debtor for vs.</note> as
our cautioner, acting, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
himselfe to pay our debt,
and to fulfill those points of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which we were bound
to fulfill, but could not doe by
our selues, and so, to releiue, and
redeeme his brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:23620:39"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the second wee see how the
father not onely accepts him as
debtor for vs,<note place="margin">That the father not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts him, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines him to this worke.</note> but also designes
and ordaines him to this great
worke, by annointing him with his
holy spirit. And thereafter in a
publicke assembly of the people
at <hi>Iorden,</hi> in most solemne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
by an audible voice from
heauen, proclames him, to be
that great high Preist, by whom
onely attonement must be made
betweene him and vs.</p>
                  <p>These two ioyned together
make vp vnto vs a most sure
ground of Christian comfort.<note place="margin">What sweet com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort arises to vs of these two conioyned together.</note> If
first we consider that the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
for the loue hee bare to the
glory of his father, and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his brethren, voluntarily
steppes into our roome, and in
our name becomes obliged to
his father, according to that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

Prophesie. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 6. 7.
which yet were a small thing were
it not that the second followes, to
wit, that the Father of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
wisedome finding out in Christ
a way to preserue both the glory
of his mercy, and iustice, doth of
his speciall loue toward vs, not
onely accept him, but ordaine
him to doe the worke of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
imponing to him, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
law of a redeemer, which
was neuer imposed to man nor
Angell, as we shall here hereafter.</p>
                  <p>And here wee learne how by
most sure right the Lord Iesus
becomes ours,<note place="margin">How Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours in most sure man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> to wit, by the surest
right that can be, namely, the
free gift of God, hee is giuen for
a Prince of saluation to vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these testimonies,
both of Angels and men, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by inspiration of the holy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23620:40"/>
Ghost.<note place="margin">Luke 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Vnto you this day is borne

which is Christ the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 3 16.</note> Againe,
<hi>God so loued the world, that hee

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> And againe,
<hi>Christ Iesus is made vnto vs, of
God, wisedome, righteousnesse, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
and redemption.</hi> Looke
then what way any other thing is
ours, which most properly wee
may call ours, that same way
Christ is ours;<note place="margin">Namely by the free gift of God the Father.</note> namely by the free
and sure gift of God. If we know,
and beleeue this, we shall finde it
a most sure ground of comfort to
vphold vs in the houre of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is true, <hi>Gloriatio Ecclesiae, est
omnis Christi actio:</hi> Euery action
of Christ is the Churches reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

his actions,<note place="margin">Except we know this we can haue no comfort in any of Christ his actions.</note> if this ground be not
first laid, that he is ours, and what
he did hee did it for vs, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs? If he had not died for our
sinnes, and risen for our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
what could his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
haue profited vs? But
here is the ground of all, that he
is giuen vnto vs of the Father for
a Sauiour, whereunto most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
hee condescends, and for
which worke the spirit annoints
him, so that now hee is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor a stranger to vs, but
our owne, by diuine ordination,☜
and all that hee does, is for vs.
These being premitted, we come
now to the particular historie of
his Baptisme, as it is set downe
by Saint <hi>Luke, Chap. 3. Ver.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:23620:41"/>
                  <bibl>LVKE 3. 21.</bibl>
                  <q>Now it came to passe, as all the
people were baptised.</q>
                  <p>VVHat these people were,<note place="margin">We read not in the Gospell of any Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but one.</note>
you may vnderstand out
of the 7. <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 29. 30. for there
it is said, that the Pharises and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders
of the Law, despised the
counsell of GOD, and would not
come to be baptised of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
Here then comes poore Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,
and sinners, and goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them into the kingdome of
God. There are many of euery sort
of people (as we may read) saued
in the Gospell, but of Pharises
wee finde none but one, namely,
<hi>Nicodemus:</hi> no sort of men are
further from the kingdome of
God then proud iusticiars.<note place="margin">For a soule filled with a conceit of the owne righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teousnesse is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of grace.</note> For as

which is filled with a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of her owne righteousnes, is
not capable of the grace of Christ.

is no place for grace to enter in,
where merit hath possession:
what thou attributest to merits
is wanting to grace. I will none of

                  <p>But that the Lord Iesus comes
in among these poore people,<note place="margin">That Christ comes to be baptised among sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, shews his great loue and rare humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> it
shewes his wonderfull loue, and
rare humilitie: his loue, for to the
end that hee might help vs, hee
would be like vs, he assumed our

didst presume to be as God, and
so diddest perish, but hee being

Wee see by experience, that if a
man fall another cannot raise
him, vnlesse hee bow himselfe
downe vnto him, hee that will
stand in his statelinesse can neuer
raise vp him who hath fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, the Lord Iesus that hee

to be like vnto God, but he not

hee reached, but lost that

Then he was clad with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Image of God, now hath hee

                  <p>Againe it is said by Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How hee that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises with the spirit, seekes the Baptisme of water from his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.</note>

of the holy Ghost to giue
vnto all his brethren, doth now
come, and seeke the Baptisme
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23620:43"/>
of water from one of his owne
seruants. Why is this done? surely
to recommend vnto men the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of that ministrie,<note place="margin">This hee did to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a reuerence of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by him in his Church.</note> which
GOD hath appointed in his
Church: no conceit of thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should make thee disdaine
it, since the sonne of God by his
example before thee, hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
it. Hee would not teach
and baptise the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
hee sent <hi>Philip</hi> to doe it: hee
would not teach, and baptise
<hi>Cornelius</hi> by an Angell, hee sent
<hi>Peter</hi> to doe it: hee would not
baptise <hi>Paul</hi> by himselfe, suppose
hee conuerted him by himselfe,
he sent <hi>Ananias</hi> to doe it. It is an
order stablished in his Church,
<hi>by the foolishnesse of preaching to
saue them who beleeue:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note> now none
can beleeue vnlesse they heare,
they cannot heare but by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23620:44"/>
and none can preach, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be sent: let it therefore
content men to goe to the base
seruants of CHRIST, in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things far inferiour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and seeke saluation by such
meanes as God in his wisedome
hath thought good to giue it,
or else be sure they shall neuer
come neere it.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs come and see
why Iesus is baptised,<note place="margin">For three reasons was Christ our Lord baptised, when as he needed no washing, being the Lambe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted.</note> seeing hee
had neither sinne to be forgiuen,
nor nature to be renewed. The
reasons are many, but wee will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
speake of three, the first
is giuen by himselfe: for when
<hi>Iohn</hi> refused to baptise him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
hee had more neede to
be baptised of him, hee receiued
this answere, <hi>let alone now, for it
becomes vs to fulfill all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23620:44"/>As for the righteousnesse of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Law morall,<note place="margin">First that he might fulfill a point of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of any but of him.</note> hee had fulfilled it
perfectly from his youth: for hee
was the innocent Lambe of God,
without spot or blemish, neuer
guile was found in his mouth:
But now he will say, there is more
required of me then the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of that common Law, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto all men, there is the
singular law of a redeemer, which
yet I haue to fulfill: a law neuer
imposed to Angell nor man,<note place="margin">The miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for our greater comfort.</note> but
onely to the sonne of God, Christ
Iesus; by which he was bound so
to loue his father, that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed
to vindicate the glory
both of his iustice and mercy,
and so to loue his brethren, that
he behoued to take the debt of
their sinnes vpon him, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his fathers iustice for them:
this is it will our Sauiour say, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23620:45"/>
high point of righteousnes, which
yet I haue to fulfill, and for which
I must be baptised, that by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of Baptisme, I may become
obliged to doe that for my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
which they could not doe
for themselues: for as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
circumcision, by that same
very deede,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> became bound to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the whole law: so hee who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
Baptisme, becomes obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to euery condition of that
couenant, whereof Baptisme is a
seale.</p>
                  <p>That wee may the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this,<note place="margin">Two parts of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace, both of them sealed by Baptisme.</note> wee are to know,
that the couenant of grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
BAPTISME is a seale, hath
two parts in it, to wit, GODS
part, and mans: GODS part of
the couenant containes promises
made to vs of the remission of
our sinnes, and renouation of our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23620:45"/>
nature, comprised in this one

againe containes promises made
to God by vs, of faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
comprised in this one word,
<hi>we shalbe his people.</hi> Now as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
is a seale of God his part,<note place="margin">As Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is a seale on Gods part, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising vs remission, Christ did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it.</note>
confirming the promise of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of our sinnes, and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of our nature, vnder which
two all other good things are
comprehended, that way Christ
our Sauiour did not receiue it for
himselfe, seeing as I haue said,
hee had neither sinne to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen,<note place="margin">But as it is a seale of our part, promising to God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that way he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, that he might be bound in our name.</note>

but as it is a sacrament of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of our selues to God,
and a band, whereby we become
obliged to be his, by acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his badge, and marke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it, that by accepting the seale of

the promise, hee might become

we may gather it out of

dolours, and griefes, proceeding
from the sense of the heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of sinne,<note place="margin">How is it that our Sauiour did pray for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?</note> not his owne sinne, I
say, for hee knew no sinne, but of
our sinne, which was laid vpon
him. As also from the sense of that
fearefull wrath due to sinne; for
strength, and comfort against
these he prayed to his Father, as
witnesseth the Apostle, <hi>that in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23620:48"/>
daies of his flesh,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> he offered vp pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and supplications, crying, and
teares, to his Father, and was heard
also in that which hee feared.</hi>
Which, as we see in the Gospel he
did before his Passion, so now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his entrie to the worke of our
redemption; a worke greater then
the worke of our first Creation;
for now he hath to satisfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of his Father; to worke the
confusion of Sathan; and to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate
the saluation of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And therefore in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of this great worke he prayes,
no doubt, for an happy successe
thereof, and as it is euident by the
answere he receiues from heauen,
hee was heard in that which hee
prayed for.</p>
                  <p>And in this also our Sauiour
learnes vs by his example to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
all our actions with prayer.<note place="margin">Our Lord by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to sanctifie all our actions by Prayer.</note>

When he was baptised, he praied:
when he was tempted he prayed:
when he brake bread, he prayed:
when he wrought miracles, he
prayed: when he was troubled in
the garden, he praied: when he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
on the Crosse, he prayed. As
<hi>Isaacs</hi> mariage could not but pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
because it was begunne with
the prayer of <hi>Abraham</hi> his Father,
prosecuted with the praier of <hi>Elie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
his Seruant, and finished with
his owne prayer: so can it not
faile, but a blessing must be vpon
those honest actions which are
begunne,<note place="margin">Actions, suppose they be good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are like bodies without spirits.</note> continued, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
with prayer: where other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
euen those actions which in
themselues are good to the doer,
can not be good, where they are
done without prayer. <hi>Vere nouit
recte viuere, qui recte nouit or are:</hi>
Hee knoweth truely how to liue
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23620:49"/>
wel, who knoweth how to pray wel.
But best actions without prayer,
which obtaines grace to them,
are like bodies without spirits:
yea, as the body without breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot liue to doe any worke
competent to a Naturall life: so
the soule without prayer, can doe
no worke, that truely is Spirituall.
Therefore said <hi>Macarius,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

                  <p>But here we are to be warned,<note place="margin">Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Prayer.</note>
that wee content not our selues,
with the shadow of prayer, in steed
of the substance thereof; where
we are to take heede of these two
things: First, that our prayer be
not by starts, without making of
conscience whether it be or not,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23620:49"/>
but we must continue &amp; perseuere
in prayer, remembring, he that

Secondly, that our praier be not
outward, but inward, made with
feruencie of spirit, and attention
of the minde, remembring hee is
the God of the spirits of all flesh,
with whom thou hast to speake in
praier. It is a godly Meditation of
<hi>Chrisostomes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chris. in Math. hom. 25.</note> that as a man who
seekes a thing which hee hath lost
in his house, seekes it with such
affection, that he forgets all other
things; yea, hee seeth not those
things that are afore him, so faine
is he to see that which hee is see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
euen such should be the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of a Christian, so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desiring mercy, and grace from
God, that till hee finde it, no other
thing be in his minde to distract
him from seeking it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:23620:50"/>And vnto this continuance
and feruencie in prayer, it should
greatly encourage vs, that now we
see after our Sauiours prayer the
heauens are opened, shewing vs
the great vertue of prayer: if wee
pray in his name, if we send it vp
like incense, perfumed with his
merit, flowing from faith in him,
it opens heauen vnto vs, &amp; brings
vs backe a fauourable answere.

VVhen our Sauiour prayed on
Mount Tabor, then was he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurated,
and his countenance
changed: when <hi>Peter</hi> prayed in
the top, or platforme, of <hi>Simon</hi>
the Tanners house, in <hi>Ioppe,</hi> then
did he receiue in a trance the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
vision:<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable effects of prayer.</note> when <hi>Daniel</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

then the holy Ghost descended
vpon them: such is the vertue of
prayer,<note place="margin">Prayer is the first step of our ascension to God with Iesus Christ.</note> that by it, not onely doe
the heauens open vnto men, and
out of their treasure send downe
necessarie blessings and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

transported and carried vp into
heauen, and so begin to practise
the first degree of their ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

partakers of the first resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">Reu. 20. 6</note>
so by prayer they ascend with

which is vnto them an
vndoubted pledge of the ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
both of their soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hereafter. For, if while they
are in the bodie, they get accesse
to the throne of grace many a
time, and finde heauen opened
vnto them, how much more when
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23620:51"/>
they are separate from the bodie,

therefore let vs take great delight

&amp; this part extends to the whole

albeit, the three persons

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23620:57"/>

                        <hi>No man hath seene God

                     <p>Here then for our further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

the three persons of the blessed
Trinitie concurre together, to
worke the great worke of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:
for here is the father

expressing the vnitie of their

But here a more cleare and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct

of our saluation, should neither
be discouraged, for the power
and malice of our spiritual aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
that withstands it; neither
yet for our owne manifold wants,

which Iesus hath receiued, is not
for himselfe, but for vs; <hi>that,</hi> as
saith the Euangelist, <hi>of his fulnesse
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23620:58"/>
we might all receiue grace for grace:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 16.</note>
which was figured in that <hi>oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Psal. 133. 2</note>

                     <p>The next circumstance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the manner,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to wit, by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> by which this
testimonie is giuen, to wit, by an
audible voice, such as all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

vnderstand. How this voice was
sounded, is needlesse for vs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
the Lord who made the
tongue, can speake without the
tongue, and frame Organes of
voice at his pleasure, by which he
can proclaime his will, euen to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:23620:59"/>
the eares of men, who without a voice
cannot heare him. Thus the Lord
both by his practise and precept
hath declared,<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell should be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such a language as people may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.</note> that hee will haue
his Gospell, which is a doctrine
of Christ, preached to the whole
world, clearely, distinctly, and in
such a manner, as all may heare
it: the practise wee haue here, the
precept we haue hereafter: for our
Sauiour commanded his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that what hee told them in
the eare, they should proclaime
it on the tops of houses; &amp; for this
cause,<note place="margin">Therefore Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Apostles with the gift of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</note> did the holy Ghost endue
them with the gifts of tongs, that
vnto euery people they might
speake in their owne language,
otherwise one language had been
sufficient for all people. Whereof
it is euident, that they who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this doctrine, either by whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering,
or muttering in the eare,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23620:59"/>
or else in such a language as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
doe not vnderstand, declare
themselues not to be the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours

neither following his practise, nor
obaying his precept; but Locusts,
proceeding from the smoake that

                     <p>The third circumstance is of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the place,<note place="margin">The place from which the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is giuen.</note> from which this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
is giuen, to wit, from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
whereof first wee learne that
the doctrine of the Gospell is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
doctrine, not written by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the heart of man, as is the
law, but heauenly and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
bred in the bosome of God;
proceeding from the deep of God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23620:60"/>
his infinite wisedome,<note place="margin">This lets vs see first, that the Gospel is a heauenly doctrine.</note> which no

which at the first began to be

preached by the Lord, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
was confirmed to vs by them
that heard him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And againe we are warned,</hi> See

                     <p>And thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, no way to bring a man to heauen, but by the faith of the Gospell.</note> the proclaiming
of this doctrine from heauen, as
likewise the opening of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
at the first proclamation of
it, is to teach vs that there is no
way, whereby man may learne a

doctrine of the Gospell, which is
come from heauen. Pitifull then
is the blindnes of worldlings, to

will not so much as looke vpon it,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23620:61"/>
but like those vncleane beasts in

Thus the Father speakes of

not the Sonne of God by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

that is, as hee is the second

is the Sonne of God, by essentiall

him from all eternitie, by a full

                        </note>
but that wee close the
mouth of Sathan, and of our owne
infidelitie, receiuing this for an
vndoubted truth, which the Lord
in this heauenly Oracle deliuereth
vnto vs: that this Christ Iesus,
the Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is the Sonne
of God, and that promised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
on whom all the Fathers
since, the first beginning, fastened
their hope, and of whom all the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23620:67"/>
Prophets hath spoken, pointing
him out, as it were with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
how hee was to come to
worke the worke of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which in all circumstances
wee see performed by him, as
was prophesied by them, to our
euerlasting comfort.</p>
                     <p>Wee might hereunto adde
some testimonies of the Gentiles,
as of <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lactan. Iustit. lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

whose testimonie <hi>Lactantius</hi> cals
<hi>Diuino simile,</hi> Diuine-like, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
out of the Oracles of <hi>Sibillae,</hi>
which were tenne in number; so

                        </gap>,
and were by some of the Fathers
accounted prophetesses of the
Gentiles: for seeing the Lord <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was to be sent into the world
for saluation both of Iewes and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23620:67"/>
Gentiles, it pleased the Lord long
before his comming, to make
signification thereof, not to the
Iewes onely, by Prophets raised
vp among themselues, but to the
Gentiles also, who because they
could not easily embrace the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of the Iewes, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of religion, it pleased him, by
their own Prophets, to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and descriptions of Iesus
Christ, that when they should
come to passe, they might haue
no exception against them. And
therefore is it that the heathen
persecuting Emperours, stirred
vp with hatred by Sathan, against
the very name of Christians, the
mysterie whereof they no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way vnderstood, nor yet
would receiue any light, that
might bring them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
therof, forbade the reading

of their owne Sibilline Oracles,<note place="margin">Iustin. Mart. Orat. ad Anton. Pium.</note>
and that because euen their owne
prophesies, bare witnes to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of Christian religion. But
for the present, we content vs with
that most sure word of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
as S. <hi>Peter</hi> calles it, and
rests in this heauenly Oracle,
which the Father from heauen
proclaimed, concerning his Son:
<hi>Blessing the Lord our God, who
hath opened vnto vs the mysterie
of his will, according to his good
pleasure, which hee had purposed in
Christ. By whom wee haue redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now come to the
historie of Christ his
tentation, which being
ioined with the former
two, whereof wee haue spoken,
makes vp vnto vs a complete do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christian comfort: for
in his Genealogie, we haue seene
what manner a man Christ Iesus
is. In his Baptisme wee haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
how he is become ours, and
now in his temptation we see, how
hee beginnes to worke the worke
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23620:70"/>
of Sathans confusion, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p>Great ioy was there in the
campe of Israel, when they saw
that <hi>Dauid</hi> ouercame Goliah,
cast him to the ground, and cut
off his head, for he was a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enemie, hee had reuiled the
host of the liuing God, and none
of <hi>Saul</hi> his warriours durst en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with him. But greater ioy
should be in our hearts, when we
see how our <hi>Dauid</hi> in this singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
combate, fights with spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>Goliah</hi> hand to hand, and
ouercomes him; who euer since
the creation hath beene a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
blasphemer of the euerliuing
God, and an spitefull enemie of
all true Israelites. In this first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
the Sonne of God casts him
downe: In the last combat which
he fights with him, on the crosse,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23620:70"/>
he bursts his head. Sathan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the first <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise,
ouercame him, and so caried him
away and his posteritie, in a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
captiuitie, and bondage: but
the second <hi>Adam</hi> suffering temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by Sathan in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
ouercomes him, and by
a more glorious victory then
<hi>Abraham</hi> had ouer <hi>Chedarlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
doth hee recouer his owne
<hi>Lots,</hi> from the power of this
enemie.</p>
                  <p>In all we haue three points here
to be treated of:<note place="margin">Three things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it.</note> first, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
premitted: Secondly the
combat it selfe, consisting of a
three-fold assault, made by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
with their seuerall repulses,
giuen by our Lord: Thirdly, the
euent, and issue thereof.</p>
                  <p>The circumstances premitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
are sixe:<note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreit, sixe in number.</note> First, the time, which is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:23620:71"/>
declared to haue beene immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after his Baptisme: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the place, expressed to be the
wildernes: Thirdly, the motion,
by which hee is caried thither, to
wit, by the spirit: Fourthly, the
person who is tempted; namely,
Iesus, full of the holy Ghost: Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the tempter, named here the
Diuell: Last of all, the occasion
of the temptation, which is said
to be CHRIST his hunger, after
that hee had fasted fotty dayes.
As for the time it is noted to
haue beene immediately after his
baptisme:<note place="margin">The time of Christ his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is first noted.</note> hee had liued twenty
nine yeares a priuate man, and
all that time wee reade not that
Sathan tempted him; but now
when hee comes out in publike
to doe the worke of a Redeemer,
for the glorie of God, and good
of his brethren, hee is assaulted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23620:71"/>
of Sathan with all his might.</p>
                  <p>Whereof it is euident,<note place="margin">Persons in high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to greatest temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they be faithfull in them.</note> how Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
intends his greatest malice
against them, who are set vp into
those high callings, in the which
greatest good may be done, to
the glorie of God, and saluation
of others: So was it with <hi>Moses,</hi> so
long as he liued a priuate life, he
liued a peaceable life: but when
hee came forth to be a deliuerer
of his brethren, from their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then was he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
by <hi>Pharao:</hi> So also with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
in his priuate calling hee had
quietnes; but from the time that
hee had once begunne to worke
the deliuerance of Israel, by the
slaughter of Goliah, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> for the
greater benefit of that people:
then did Sathan stirre vp <hi>Saul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, who hunted him like a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23620:72"/>
Partrich, through the fieldes and
mountaines of Israel. The like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
may be seene in the Apostle
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
As trees on the toppes of
hilles are obiect to euery winde;
so persons in a high calling, if in
a good conscience they labour to
discharge it, shall finde themselues
on euery side compassed with
temptations.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it so onely with those
that are set vp in more eminent
callings,<note place="margin">Such as giues their names to Christ, let them looke to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note> but with euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
also: what malice Sathan pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
against the head, that same
will he practise against the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
So soone as our Lord was
borne, so soone was he persecuted
by <hi>Herod:</hi> so soone as he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised,
so soone was he tempted by
Sathan; thus as saith <hi>Chrysostome,<note place="margin">In Math. hom. 7.</note>
ab ipfis vitae initiis ad tentationes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23620:72"/>
praeparam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <note place="margin">Macar. hom. 47.</note> then we see that euen
in the cradle our Lord began to
beare the crosse, and no sooner
we are borne by regeneration to
be his, but so soone without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay, doth Sathan set vpon
vs with all his might, like a new
<hi>Pharao,</hi> pursuing Israel, to see if
hee can reduce vs to his former
seruitude, and bondage.</p>
                  <p>And this I marke for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of weake and young Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">A comfort for yong Christians who after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion are exercised with vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
who after their conuersion
finde themselues troubled with
great temptations, wherewith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were not acquainted, let
them know that it is a cursed
peace, to be at peace with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and giue thankes to God,
who now hath put them in an ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
with him: for thereby they
may know they are none of his;
but are called to a fellowship and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:23620:73"/>
communion with Christ, <hi>Diabolus
enim non persequitur nisi bonos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. de Temp. Iust. 58.</note>
Sathan pursues none but good
men, such as hathcast off his yoke:
as for the wicked what needes
hee to pursue them, seeing hee
possesses them? yea, so farre is he
from tempting them, that he vses
them as his instruments, to tempt
others: and therefore let vs not
be discouraged, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
when wee finde our selues
tempted by Sathan.</p>
                  <p>The second circumstance is of
the place,<note place="margin">The place of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat is next set downe.</note> noted here to be the
wildernes: Wherin two things we
obserue, one in the person of the
Aduersarie; letting vs see how he
is a restlesse tempter, sparing no
place, not Paradise, nor the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes,
in the Temple, <hi>Vbique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiatur
homini,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. de Temp. 77.</note> euery where hee
lyes in waite for vs: neither can
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23620:73"/>
wee goe our way. Wherein hee
hath not his snares laid before
vs:<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> 
                     <hi>multi laquei quacunque progre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimur,</hi>
there be many snares
wheresoeuer we goe,<note place="margin">In euery piece Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath his snare spred out for temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> our way on
earth, being like the way of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
wherein lurkes many fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
to sting vs, that hurts vs
many time before wee can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them: none of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, but they haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
this in their own experience,
for where is the place, wherein we
haue not beene tempted; yea,
wounded by this subtle serpent,
and almost slaine to the death; if
mercy and grace had not come
in from God to succour vs? The
remedie is that we suspect this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
in euery place wherein
we come, walking as the Apostle
commands vs circumspectly, and
with feare and trembling: euer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23620:74"/>
looking vp for grace, to keepe vs
wee fall not into his snare, at least
we perish not in it.</p>
                  <p>The other thing to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
here,<note place="margin">In this combat our Lord giues the Aduersarie vantage of the place, and why?</note> is the person of our
Lord, who ouerthrowes Sathan
in so victorious a manner, that
no exception can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; for in that Nature
which Sathan once had ouercome
doth he encounter with him, and
giues him also the vantage of
place. Sathan tempted the first
<hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, which was the
place in all the world, wherein he
should haue been strongest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the Diuell, considering that
in it he had very many tokens of
Gods great goodnes toward him,
euer before his eyes; yet in
it Sathan ouercame him: But
the second <hi>Adam</hi> to recouer this
losse, encounters with Sathan in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23620:74"/>
the wildernes, a place of all
other in the world, meetest for
Sathan to tempt a man in; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to desperation. Thus we see,
<hi>quemadmodum suis nodis praeiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

resoluantur,<note place="margin">Ambros in Luke 4. Nazian. Orat. 21. Apologel.</note> &amp; suis diuina be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia
vestigiis reformentur:</hi> for
the first <hi>Adam</hi> tempted by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
was driuen from Paradise
to the wildernes, but the second
<hi>Adam</hi> by suffering himselfe to be
tempted of Sathan, brings home
the first againe from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
into Paradise: thus doth hee
follow the Aduersarie, as it were,
foote by foote, confounding him
in all those meanes, by which
before ouer man hee made his
conquest.</p>
                  <p>The third circumstance is,<note place="margin">The third circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, he is led into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by motion of the spirit.</note> that
our Lord was ledde into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
by the motion of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to wit, that same spirit which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23620:75"/>
before descended on him at Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and wherewith here hee is
said to haue beene filled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished.
Of this we learne that
temptations comes not by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,<note place="margin">Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by uine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</note>
or chance, but are ordered
by diuine dispensation: In our
weakenes ofttimes wee conceit of
our temptations, as if they came
to vs by the will of Sathan: but
in very truth it is not so, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
a roaring Lyon, but the
Lord haue bound him in chaines,
and without the bounds of his
chaine hee cannot goe, roare as
hee will, hee is not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
vnto vs, nor moue any
temptation against vs, but as he
is a licenced of the Lord,<note place="margin">Ber. in Psal. qui habit at Ser. 13..</note> 
                     <hi>est
quidem leo rugiens, sed gratias ago

hee is indeede a roaring Lyon,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23620:75"/>
but I giue thankes vnto the great
Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hee
may roare, but he cannot strike
me.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore good to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in our temptations,<note place="margin">Three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> these
three things: First, that it is the
Lord who takes vs by the hand,
and enters vs within the listes to
fight in his name, hand to hand
with Sathan, as here our Lord is
ledde by the spirit to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Secondly, that the Lord
measures our temptations, and
will not suffer vs to be tempted
aboue our power: And thirdly,
that wheresoeuer he leade vs, he
goes with vs, not as a spectator
onely to behold vs, which should
also greatly encourage vs, that
wee fight vnder the eye of our
King, but as an actor also fighting
in vs; helping our infirmities,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23620:76"/>
and strengthening our weakenes,
by his grace: and therefore how
euer our Aduersarie be like a
mighty terrible <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet should
wee not be afraide to goe forth
against him in the name of the
Lord our God.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth circumstance we
haue to consider the Person,<note place="margin">The fourth circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is of the person tempted.</note> who
is tempted, to wit, Iesus, full of
the holy Ghost. In regard of his
nature, he is very man, and so he
behoued to be, that hee might
ouercome the Aduersarie of man,
<hi>alioqui iuste victus non fuisset:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theodoret. dial. 2. cap. 26.</note>
otherwise, he had not been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conquered, but in regard of
the qualitie of his Nature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
holy, and fully sanctified:
so full of the holy Ghost, that not
so much as a contrarie motion of
euill could enter into him, no
more then liquor can be conuaied
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23620:76"/>
into a vessel, which is full already:
and this is it, which our Sauiour
testifies in another place; <hi>The
prince of this world commeth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 30.</note> and
hath nothing in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist,<note place="margin">Neuer any full of the holy Ghost as Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was.</note>
and <hi>Stephen</hi> the first Martir, are
also said to haue beene full of
the holy Ghost; but that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
either in comparison of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
who at sometime were
more filled with grace, then at
another: for in all the godly the
Spirit hath his own intention and
remission; or else in comparison
of themselues, with other men.
But as for Christ Iesus, it is his
singular priuiledge, that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the spirit aboue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all measure, that of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
all his Saints and seruants
might receiue grace for grace,
euery one a portion in their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23620:77"/>
owne measure: whereof it comes
to passe, that there being in most
holy men, a great vacuitie and
emptinesse; roome is made for
Sathan to enter in, and worke
vpon the corruption hee findes
there, but in the Lord Iesus it is
not so.</p>
                  <p>But here two things further
are to be considered: first, how
could Christ be tempted, there
being, as I haue said, no corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in him,<note place="margin">Sundry sorts of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> whereupon any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
could worke: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for what causes was he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For resolution of the first, we
are to consider the sundry sorts
of temptations, there is one wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
man tempts God: this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
forbidden,<note place="margin">God temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth man, and is tempted of man.</note> as we will shew
hereafter; one whereby GOD
tempts man, so the Lord temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and he is said also to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23620:77"/>
haue tempted the Israelites; as,
for that which S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> that
God tempts no man; wee must
know that there is,<note place="margin">Aug. in Ioan. tract. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>tentatio quae
probat, &amp; tentatio quae decipit:</hi>
a temptation which proueth, and
a temptation which deceiueth.<note place="margin">One man tempts an other: these sinne after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note>
By the first of these only the Lord
tempts, but neuer by the second.
There is also a temptation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
one man tempts another to
snare him, or manifest some
weakenes in him; so the <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Pharises</hi> tempted Christ:
and this is common to all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men of the world, that not
content to doe euill themselues,
they delight also to tempt others
to euill. Let such remember that
this is to sinne after the similitude
of Sathan, who not content to
rebell against GOD himselfe,
tempted man also to the same
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23620:78"/>
rebellion with him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may they looke to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after the similitude of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
and last of all, there
is a temptation,<note place="margin">Sathan tempteth man.</note> by which Sathan
tempts man, plaine contrarie to
that which is ascribed to the Lord;
for it is not to make man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor to manifest any goodnes
that by grace is in him, but euer
to snare him: for which cause the
temptations of God are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to fanning, that driues away
the chaffe and dust, and so fines
the corne: but Sathans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are compared to sifting, that
letts away the good, but keepes
still the worst.<note place="margin">The temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Christ were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and could not enter into him.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to returne to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we must know that the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Christ, in this doe differ
from the temptations of <hi>Adam,</hi>
and all other men in the world;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23620:78"/>
that his were onely externall, that
is, such as Sathan presented by
externall voices and obiects to
his eare and eye; but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
carry any further, for incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
the Lord Iesus discerned
the vanitie of them, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
light of his minde, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
repelled them, by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
holines of his will; so
that he was not so much as affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or moued with them; farre
lesse infected, by consenting vnto
them, and in this, as I said, hee
farre excels, the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and
all his posteritie.</p>
                  <p>For as for our first Parents <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Euah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It was far otherwise with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah.</hi>
                     </note> in that first onset
Sathan made vpon them, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
externall obiects to their
eyes, and voices to their eares, he
incontinent fastned his sting into
them, by reason that they how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:23620:79"/>
made holy; yet being mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
were easily affected with his
allurements, and so wounded by
him: but the second <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perfect, and vnchangeable in
holines, was in such sort tempted,
that he was not, nor could not
be peruerted, no more then the
most stable rockes of the Sea are
moued, or remoued by the raging
waues thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whereof great comfort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
vnto vs,<note place="margin">The salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lost to any of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> who now by
grace are the generation of the
second <hi>Adam,</hi> and beares his
image; as by Nature we were the
sonnes of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and did
carry also his image. What the
first <hi>Adam</hi> had by creation, hee
receiued it not for himselfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but for his posteritie also: if
he had kept it for himselfe, hee
had kept it to them also; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23620:79"/>
when he lost it to himselfe, he lost
it to his posteritie: And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord Iesus, in like
maner, that stock of life in whom,
by grace we are grafted, and of
whom onely, wee as Christians
haue our beginning and being;
what hee hath receiued as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
from his Father,<note place="margin">Comfort.</note> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it not for himselfe, but for
his brethren, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
communicate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
vnto vs a most sure saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for so long as hee who haue
obtained it, cannot loose it, so
long wee are sure it cannot be
lost vnto vs, seeing of him, and
in him we possesse it.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie,<note place="margin">Our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are not exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall onely, but chiefly internall.</note>
now since the fall, our estate is so
much by Nature the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
that our greatest temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
comes from our inward
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:23620:80"/>
corruption, so that albeit there
were no externall tempter to
tempt vs with obiects of sinne,
presented to our eyes and eares:
yet wee are tempted of our owne
concupiscence within vs. <hi>Tale
quippe est vitium malignitatis,<note place="margin">Chris. in Math. hom. 7.</note> vt
a nullo impulsa plerunque sese ipsa
praecipitet:</hi> for such is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that although it be

a besieged citie, that not onely
hath strong enemies without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
it, but in like manner
false Traytors within, to betray it.
Now haue wee seene how the
temptations of Christ Iesus doe
differ from <hi>Adams,</hi> and ours.</p>
                  <p>The other thing in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
that comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,<note place="margin">The endes why Christ was temp.</note>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:23620:80"/>
is the endes for which
our Lord humbles himselfe to be
tempted of Sathan: and those we
shall see doe most of all respect
vs; as for our cause he was in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
so for our cause hee was
tempted: all that hee suffered in
our Nature, are medicines to
cure the infirmities of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">First that he might ouercome our enemy in a iust and lawful manner.</note> then hee was content to
be tempted by our enemie, that
hee might ouercome our enemie,
and that in so iust, and lawfull a
manner, as against which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
could haue no exception, for
in mans nature hee encountred
with him, in a place conuenient
for Sathanin a state and condition
most subiect to temptation, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all necessaries for refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his body, and hauing
none to comfort him; and no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23620:81"/>
doubt it did wonderfully astonish,
and confound, <hi>that euill one,</hi> that
hauing ouercome so many since
the beginning of the world, now
hee encounters with a man, ouer
whom hee hath so many appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
vantages, and against whom
he assayed all his temptations, yet
can hee not any way fasten his
sting in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Secondly, to let vs see how Sathan is a spitefull enemy of mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> to let vs see what a
spitefull enemie of mans salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Sathan is, for the hatred he
beares to the glory of God, hee
hates man, made to the image of
God, and doth all that hee can
to hinder his saluation. <hi>Non enim
vult vt ibi simus,<note place="margin">Aug. hom. 38.</note> vnde ipse deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus

that man should be exalted to
that place, from which for his
sinne hee was deiected. If wee
could apprehend this, and take
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23620:81"/>
it to heart; what a deadly enemie
Sathan is vnto vs, and for what
cause, it would encourage vs to
make stronger resistance to him
then we doe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly, that hee might teach vs how to fight with Sathan.</note> hee vndergoeth this
temptation to teach vs, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
and Souldiours, how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with him, <hi>Pugnat Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,

to assure vs, that if wee
wil fight against him in the might
of our Lord, it is possible, that we
(clothed with this same nature)
shall ouercome him. Since the
dayes of <hi>Adam</hi> Sathan, by sinne,
hath wonderfully preuailed ouer
men: none haue escaped him
without a wound; and many hath
he slaine vnto the death: but now
in the same nature, the Lord Iesus
wrastles with him, and ouercomes
him;<note place="margin">Theodoret. dial. 1. cap. 28.</note> that so, <hi>radicitus euelleret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperationem

hee might plucke vp desperation

                  <p>And fourthly,<note place="margin">Fourthly, that hee might comfort vs in our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> hee humbled
himselfe to suffer temptation, that

                     <hi>For, wee haue not an High

on vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And,<note place="margin">Lastly, that wee should not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come from an angry God.</note> last of all, that we should
not apprehend our tentations to
come from an angry God, as
commonly of our weakenesse we
doe: wee see here, that the Lord
Iesus, who a little before, was
proclaimed to be the Sonne of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:23620:82"/>
GOD, in whom the Father was
well pleased, is now led by the

the <hi>Tempter:</hi> stiles, both of
them properly belonging to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than:
for, before him there was
no tempter vnto euill, nor yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, except such as are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him: wherefore <hi>Augustine</hi>
doth thus prettily describe him:

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23620:83"/>
of lyes, the roote of malice, the
chiefe head of all wickednesses,
the Prince of all sinnes and vices.
In tempting hee is restlesse, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
no time, no place, no person.
It may truely be said of him,
which without a reason <hi>Esau</hi> said
of <hi>Iacob; was he not iustly called Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?</hi>
that is, a supplanter: <hi>for
first hee stole my Birth-right, and
now hee would steale my blessing.</hi>
Is not Sathan iustly called a
Tempter? By our first Creation,
wee were made to the Image of
God, and that Sathan by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our parents, subtlely stole
from vs; and now the blessing of
God, in Christ the Redeemer,
whereby he offers to aduance vs
to a better estate then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee were created, hee laboreth
by crafty temptations, to steale
from vs also. The Lord giue vs

eyes to see his enmitie against vs,
and hearts to resist him.</p>
                  <p>But let vs marke that hee is
called a Tempter,<note place="margin">Sathan a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the wicked, a Tempter of the godly.</note> chiefly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the godly: for in regard

his effectuall power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <p>We are not therefore to faint,<note place="margin">Why wee should not faint at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note>

proues wee are none of his. As

a dogge doth not barke at those
that are of the houshold, but at
strangers; so, Sathan keepes a
close mouth to such as are his,
and suffers them to brooke a false
peace; but such as by grace are
deliuered from his bondage,
those he compasseth like a roring
Lion, seeking to deuoure them.</p>
                  <p>And next, there is great profit,
and vtilitie, redounding to vs by
the tentations of Sathan: they
humble vs, chase vs to God, and
make vs more feruent in prayer.
That which <hi>Luther</hi> marked in
himselfe by experience (that <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

miraculous, let vs see, that

this fact of Christ is vainely, and
superstitiously abused by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,

which helpes them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
it is true, all his actions

                  <p>The workes of Christ our Lord,<note place="margin">The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23620:88"/>
dead, descended to hell, and rose
againe the third day: these are
so proper to the Sonne of God,
the Lord Iesus; that if any man
would presume to counterfet him
in them, he were to be abhorred,
as a most wicked blasphemer.</p>
                  <p>In the second ranke,<note place="margin">Workes of miraeles: to follow him in these is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility.</note> are his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
workes of miracles, as, that he
clensed the Leper, healed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitique,
gaue sight to the blinde,
raised the dead, and such like, but
no man is so foolish, as to say
these stands to vs for rules of
imitation: for how euer he hath
giuen power to many of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to doe the like of these, for
confirmation of his Gospell: yet
haue others also receiued power,
to doe such miraculous workes;
who for all that shall neuer enter
into his kingdome.</p>
                  <p>In the third ranke,<note place="margin">Morall workes: to follow him in these is pietie.</note> are his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23620:89"/>
workes morall of a godly life and
conuersation: such as his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in washing his Disciples feete:
his meekenes, patience, and loue,
in praying for his enemies; his
subiection to his Parents: and
these indeede stand vnto vs for
rules of imitation. Learne of me
saith our Sauiour, that I am low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and meeke; hee bade vs not,
said <hi>Augustine,</hi> learne of him how
to make the world, or how to
raise the dead; but learne of him
that hee is lowly and meeke. To
striue to follow him in the first
ranke of these, is blasphemie: In
the second is impossibilitie: In
the third, is true pietie.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to know that fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is either supernaturall,<note place="margin">Fasting is of sundry sorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the endes thereof.</note> and so
miraculous, as the fasting of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

the naturall againe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23620:89"/>
and vndertaken, either for
physicke, for ciuill affaires, or for
religion: Of the first I speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
saue only that it is a shame
that men for bodily health can
take them to a dyet,<note place="margin">A warning for careles Christians.</note> vse mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
&amp; abstinence from meate,
who for spirituall health will no
way regard it: As for the second,
that worldlings to redeeme the
time of their market, or otherwise
to ouertake their ciuill affaires,
can fast from morne to euening,
condemnes in like manner care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Christians, who to make vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues encrease in the
gaine of godlinesse, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
any time to the exercises
of fasting and praying: As for the
third, fasting for religion, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publike, such as by publike
authoritie is enioyned for vrgent
causes: as that of <hi>Hester</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat:</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:23620:90"/>
or else priuate; such as
priuate Christians, either by
themselues, or with their families,
doe willingly vndertake.</p>
                  <p>Now in both these,<note place="margin">The right end of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, to subdue the body by discipline.</note> we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to take heed, that fasting be
vsed for the right end, and in the
right manner. Then it is vsed to
the right end, when we fast for
this cause, that the flesh being
subdued to the Spirit, may be the
more able to pray. As a naturall
man delights in the subduing of
his enemie, so a Christian in the
subduing of his flesh.<note place="margin">In the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the flesh and spirit, vve should helpe that partie which we would haue victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</note> In a battell

it is easily coniectured, that the

the flesh and the spirit: for
these two lust one against the
other: why then doe we not helpe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23620:90"/>
that party which fainest we would
haue victorious? If wee desire the
spirit should preuaile, then let vs
helpe it with fasting, and prayer;
for <hi>Ieiunium est animae auxilium:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nazian. Orat. 25. in laudem Gorgorij.</note>
Fasting is an helpe &amp; furtherance
to the soule; if otherwise wee
bring in surfetting and gluttony,
we strengthen corrupt flesh, we

our selues a pray to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                  <p>This being the ende,<note place="margin">Rules in fasting: first that it be without opinion of merit.</note> which in

vs, let vs beware of those euils,

for a diseased soule And first
let vs beware of the opinion of
merit before God: for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
makes euen good workes
an abhomination to the Lord;
as it is euident in that Pharisie,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:23620:91"/>
who boasting of his almes, and
fasting, went home without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

                     <hi>Non enim habet quo

There is no place for Grace
to enter in, where merite hath

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Next that it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> we are to take heede
that our fasting be without super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
which then is done, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do

hoc praescrib at:</hi> when it is done nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for imitation of any other,
nor for custome, nor for the day,
as if the day should prescribe the
same: such is the fasting of
many, vndertaken for such a
day, or such a custome, and not
for cause of conscience: such fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is plaine superstition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Thirdly that it be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer: to fast, and not to pray is to offer a dead thing to the Lord.</note> that it be not without
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:23620:91"/>
prayer. Fasting is good, but such
a good as in religion is not to
be vsed for it selfe, but for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good; namely for prayer:
therefore the spirit of God ioynes
these together, fasting and prayer:
for fasting without prayer is like a
dead body without a spirit, and to
offer such a fasting vnto the Lord
is no lesse abhomination, then if
vnder the Law, any man should
haue offered a dead thing vnto
him: and this is also for them
who make not the dayes of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dayes of prayer, I meane
who are no more instant in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that day wherein they fast,
then other dayes wherin they fast
not; vainely conceiting, that fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by it selfe, should commend
them to God.<note place="margin">Fourthly, that it be without ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, let fasting be without
ostentation before men: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23620:92"/>
fasted in secret, in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
where none saw him.
In cities, and in the company of
men, he did eate and drinke, and
this commandement hath he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs, <hi>when ye fast looke not sowre,
as hypocrites doe, who disfigure their
faces, that they may be seene of men
to fast: but when thou fastest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
thine head, and wash thy feet,
that thou seeme not vnto men to
fast, but vnto thy father, who is in
secret, and thy father who sees thee
secretly, will reward thee openly.</hi>
But, this condemned hypocrisie is
now counted good deuotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both
among Papists, and carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors;
for if they haue a day of

                  </p>

yet are wee not to trust in them:
as if it were they, and not Gods
blessing, that did helpe our life.
Physicke is good, but because
<hi>Asa</hi> trusted in it, it could not
profit him. And flesh is good for
nourishment, but because Israel
thought that their life was in it,
GOD slew them by the same
meane by which they thought to
liue: and therefore the Lord to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23620:106"/>
teach men that the vertue is not
in the meanes,<note place="margin">Who sometime workes without meanes, sometime by small meanes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time makes the meanes of life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of death.</note> but in his blessing.
Sometime hee workes without
meanes, as when hee made light
without the Sun, fertilitie of the
earth without raine; when hee
kept the life of <hi>Moses</hi> without
meate, and made cornes grow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ezechia</hi> without sowing: and
sometimes to small meanes hee
giues great vertue; as when hee
made one paire of shooes, and
one sute of raiment, last Israel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares. There were many in the
daies of <hi>Elisha,</hi> who had more
oyle and meale then the widdow
of <hi>Sarepta</hi> had, but wanted the
blessing; shee had, and therefore
was theirs spent, when her
portion, being lesse, remained to
the ende.</p>
                     <p>Beside this,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the second meanes proues that our life is not by them.</note> the very nature of
the meanes which wee vse, may
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23620:107"/>
teach vs, it is not they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
our life; for they being
things without life themselues,
and such as by time putrifies and
rots, what life can they giue or
keep vnto vs? Or if they be things
endued with life, we see that they
must first loose their life, before
they become helpes of our life,
to teach vs that howeuer by them
we liue; yet in them is not that
vertue, that conserues our life.</p>
                     <p>Last of all,<note place="margin">Experience also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the same.</note> experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
it; if bread preserued the

would be most liuely, but we see
the contrary: more lusty was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
vpon his potage, then the
other children were on the kings
delicates. <hi>Dauid</hi> in his old daies
wanted no couerings nor gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but none of them could
get heate to his body. We see by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23620:107"/>
experience, some consuming
more then may content other
three, yet in the midst of wealth
they dwyne away; and poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
feeding on the refuse of
bread and water, more strong and
liuely then they: all these doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
it is not the meanes which
preserue the life, but how it is
preserued he declares in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue

man can giue seruice to

Wherein Sathan keepes
a course plaine contrarie to the
first:<note place="margin">In the right wing of Sathans battell stands Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</note> in the former he tempted to
Desperation, thy poor &amp; indigent
estate proues thou canst not be the
Sonne of God: in this hee tempts
to presumption. If thou be sure that
thou art the Son of God, then doe
what thou wilt, nothing can harme
thee. Thus Sathan assaults not the
godly alwayes with one tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but can craftily change them
for his owne aduantage: such as
hee cannot draw to one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">Sathan changes tentations for his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</note>
he labours to draw to another:
and albeit by this craft hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
nothing with the Sonne
of GOD: yet doth hee many
time by it speede among men.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23620:109"/>
There are some whom he can not
moue to be carelesse in religion,
and them he tempts to the other
extremitie, to be superstitious in
religion: some whom he cannot
induce to shake off conscience, yet
hee makes scrupulous in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
doubting where they neede
not; and so of other temptations:
for the which wee haue neede to
be armed with the armour of God
on the right hand and on the left.</p>
                     <p>This temptation Saint <hi>Luke</hi>

the substance, &amp; matter of things
which were done.</p>
                     <p>In the first assault we haue seene

see how in the other wing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans

with his followers.</p>
                     <p>Wherein the time first is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">After vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation let vs stand ready for a new battel.</note>
                        <hi>Then:</hi> that this temptation
ensued vpon the end of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
learning vs after victorie
gotten in any battell against Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
not to fall into securitie, but
to stand still in our armour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
another assault: In bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

hath many times brought destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to mighty armies: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites
(sitting downe to eate
and drinke, after the burning of
<hi>Ziklag,</hi> suddenly in their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ouerthrowne by the sword of
<hi>Dauid</hi>) may stand for a proofe of
it: but in the spirituall battell
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23620:110"/>
it is much more dangerous.</p>

<hi>the holy Citie, Ierusalem:</hi> where
first wee haue to consider, how it
is that Sathan carryes him vnto
it, whether was this transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mentall or corporall? The
first I denie; for, it could not be,
that our Sauiours imagination
could be so farre abused, as that
he should thinke he was carried,
when he was not caryed; nothing
in him could be deceiued. All his
tentations (as I said) were exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
onely, and proceeded not to
the mouing or affecting any of his
internall faculties; and therefore
I agree vnto the second, that this
transportation was corporall.</p>
                     <p>Where,<note place="margin">Offences that may arise of Christs corporall</note> if it be offensiue to any

place to place by that vncleane
Spirit,<note place="margin">transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> let them consider that this
was done, not against his will, but
with his owne will: as afterward
willingly hee was lead, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
members, like a sheepe to
the slaughter, so now willingly
is he carried by Sathans selfe,
to be tempted of him; and that
for the greater glory of his owne
name, greater confusion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and greater comfort of his
children.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Iesus permits the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
to handle his holy body,<note place="margin">In it the inuincible power of our Lord is made manifest.</note>
to carry it, for a time, to such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as might yeeld him greatest
vantage to tempt it; hee permits
him to speake what hee pleased,
and to shew what obiects he could
for his allurement; yea, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be deliuered into the
hands of wicked men, Sathans
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23620:111"/>
instruments, and giues them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to abuse his blessed body,
to spit vpon it, to buffet it, to
scourge it, to crucifie it, and yet
for all that hee could doe, either
by himselfe, or by his members,
he can neuer preuaile against the
Lord Iesus. Certainely the more
liberty Sathan had granted to
him, in all this, the greater was his
owne shame and confusion; and
the more manifest the glory of
our inuincible captaine, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ouercome, nay not when
he is in the hands of his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

of Gods children, for sometime
power is giuen to Sathan ouer
their bodies, to afflict them, as
we see for a time in <hi>Iob,</hi> or for a

the body of <hi>Magdalen</hi> (for albeit
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23620:112"/>
then shee was not called: yet
euen then was shee an elect wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)

of God should at any time be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with the like of this, to
take it for an argument of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
or finall deliuery of them
vnto Sathan, that the Lord for
a time permits him to haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
our their bodies, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
who would in all things be
tempted as we are, except sinne,
did taste of this temptation also
for our comfort.</p>
                     <p>This being spoken concerning
the manner of his carrying:<note place="margin">The place of this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, the holy City.</note> now
we come to the place, which is
the holy City Ierusalem; &amp; more
particularly, the very Temple,
which stood in the sight of all
Ierusalem, Sathan sets him on
the platforme of it, wherein were
turrets with pinacles on their tops,

&amp; this place he takes as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient

lurked too long as a priuate man,
among this people: if thou be the

Messiah, the king of Israel, here
is the time and place to shew thy

the people shall admire thee, and
acknowledge thee for to be the
Sonne of God, if thou cast thy
selfe downe among them: which
easily thou maist doe, without
all perill or harme, seeing the
Lord hath giuen his Angels
charge ouer thee, to keepe thee.</p>

that which we marked in the first
temptation, how that there is no
place so holy on earth, wherin we
can be free from the temptations
of this vnholy spirit: In Paradise
he tempted <hi>Adam;</hi> at Christs table
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23620:113"/>
he tempted <hi>Iudas;</hi> and in the very
Temple, dedicated to the seruice
of God, how often finde wee by

worldly affaires: or else into a den
of theeues, whilst he carryeth our

so hee may infect the heart: or
else, at least, he casts vpon vs the
spirit of slumbring, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

of Sathan: <hi>Cast thy selfe downe.</hi>
Neuer hath he any word for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or others, to bid them mount

draw them downe. Hee cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
downe from heauen to hell,
and if he might would cast downe
all Gods Children from the state
of grace, into the state of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Oh, if we could remember

of all Sathans temptations, <hi>Cast

this is a great abuse, to draw any

seeing it is true of it all, which <hi>S.

are become his learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">That hee makes any place of Scripture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme a sin.</note>
when they vse any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

that saying of the Apostle to

abuseth that saying of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;

estate of Elect men, who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected

haue remembred him of that first

vnhappy condition whereinto he
had fallen by pride, yet he makes
no profit by it at all: hee is not
touched with any remorse for
his sin, nor once moued so much
as to lament, according as hee
had cause. Alas, that euer I fell
from the fellowship of those holy
Angels. Alas, that I should abide
in this desperate estate, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
the glory of God, which
cannot be oppugned, and to fight
against his Saints, ouer whom I
shall neuer preuaile. Nay, no such
thought or motion enters into
his heart.</p>
                     <p>This proceedes from his great
obstinacie in euill,<note place="margin">This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from his obstinacie, which lets him not repent.</note> which lockes
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:23620:120"/>

that sinne which is against the
holy Ghost, that neyther can he,
nor will he repent, but contrary
his light, wilfully, and of malice
hee sets himselfe alwayes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicter
of the Lord. These are
<hi>Viae Daemonum praesumptio, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinatio,</hi>

casts him into the sinne of shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

to all senselesse and stupid hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the Word of God, who
when they heare their sinnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
are eyther not moued
at all, or else if they be moued,
are not mended. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had
some motion, and prayed <hi>Moses</hi>
to pray for him, but it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
continuance, being choked
by the hardnesse of his hart. <hi>Achab</hi>
rent his cloaths, and put on Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
at the threatning of <hi>Elias,</hi>
but his humiliation continued
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23620:121"/>
not. <hi>Foelix</hi> trembled when <hi>Paul</hi>
preached, but hee proceeded no
further. Yet euen these may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the senselesse hearers of
this age; who, after so long hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
haue beene so little moued.
And those come ouer-neare vnto
the nature of Sathan, who is so
confirmed in his sinne, that no
conuiction, made by the cleare
light of the Word of God can
moue him to repent.</p>
                     <p>It is farre otherwise with the
godly:<note place="margin">How the children of God trem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble at the rebukes of his word.</note> if the Lord speake they
tremble: if his Word condemne
any sinne in them, they fall downe
and mourne before him, till hee
forgiue it. So were the Publicanes
moued, at the preaching of <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptist, to cry, <hi>What shall we
doe?</hi> So were the Iewes pricked
in their hearts at the preaching
of <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note> saying; <hi>What shall we doe?</hi>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:23620:122"/>
So cryed the Iaylor to <hi>Paul</hi> and

for, it is not the way of a godly
man to precipitate himselfe from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23620:123"/>
a height, but to come downe
some ordinary way. And this is
also a piece of Sathans skill, in
tempting men, to hide from
them that which may restraine
them from sinne, and onely to let
them see that which may embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
them vnto it.</p>
                     <p>And herein also we learne how

and not abuse them to the offence
of our God. It is true, God hath
promised protection to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but all his promises are
euer with a condition, that wee
keepe ourselues within the wayes
of God: <hi>The Lord is with you
while yee be with him.</hi> Sathan
knoweth this very well, that so
long, as men walke in the way of
God, the Lord is a hedge vnto
them, and his Angels are as a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23620:123"/>
guard to keepe them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his first care is to draw them
out of the way of God, that so
spoiling them of their protector,
they may become a pray vnto
him: this is cleare in that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
which <hi>Balaam</hi> taught <hi>Balak,</hi>
and wee may see by experience,
it is the daily practise of Sathan.</p>

<hi>The glory of a King is in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

his prouidence it selfe is
sufficient enough to preserue and

them when they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                     <p>As for the forbidden tempting
of God,<note place="margin">How men tempt God.</note> men fall into it many

they tempt him in his mercy,<note place="margin">In his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> as

things, which wee cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand:
for if a man by the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

the way to present a view of the

by the helpe of nature, who for

it is he presents to our Lord a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

neuer thinke that hee made him
beleeue, he saw that which he saw
not: and his end in presenting
this pleasant obiect to the eye
was, out of all question, to assay
if hee could allure his heart with
the loue thereof: for this is one
of his customable temptations,
whereby he hath greatly preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
among the sonnes of men, by
the eye to encroach vpon the
heart. He deceiued <hi>Euah,</hi> by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on the Apple, pleasant to
the eye: he deceiued the Sonnes
of God, who were of the line of
<hi>Seth,</hi> by looking on the daughters

of men, who were of the house of
<hi>Cain:</hi> he deceiued <hi>Achan,</hi> by loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on a wedge of Gold, and a
goodly Babilonish garment: hee
deceiued <hi>Dauid,</hi> by looking on
the beauty of <hi>Bathsheba:</hi> but so
could hee not preuaile ouer our
Lord: for neither was his nature
mutable from good, as was <hi>Euah,</hi>
in her best estate, farre lesse infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

In his offer wee see two notable
lyes: first, saith he all these are
mine, al this power is deliuered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my hands. The Psalmist saith;
<hi>The earth is the Lords,<note place="margin">Psal. 24. 1.</note> and the
fulnesse thereof:</hi> and wee reade in
<hi>Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In this he makes two notable lyes, first in affirming that the kingdomes of the world were his.</note> that honour, glory and
dominion are the Lords, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
kingdomes, &amp;c. and this
shamelesse Beare, saies all is his:
when in very deede not so much
as any beast in the world is his,
farre lesse any kingdome thereof:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:23620:134"/>
for hee could not doe so much,
for all his pretended power, as
enter into a Sow, vntill the Lord
gaue him power.</p>
                     <p>Where if ye obiect vnto mee,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>How Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> The God of the world.</note>
how is it then, that Sathan is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Apostle, the God of
this world? I answere, that is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard of the reprobate,
whom the Lord in iustice hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer vnto Sathan, and in
whom hee commands and workes
at his pleasure; no otherwise then
an executioner, to whom the iudge
giues power to punish a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
sometime in his goods,
sometime in his person, and
sometime by taking away of his
life: if this executioner should
vaunt that he were Lord of life
and death, or had power of health
and sicknes, riches and pouertie,
such as knew him, would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:23620:134"/>
him. It is euen so with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
he is but a false deceiuer:
for hee being the executioner of
God, imployed by the Lord, to
punish the wicked in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in their mindes, or in their
goods, will notwithstanding beare
his blinded wretches in hand, as
if all this power were his owne.</p>
                     <p>The other lye hee makes,<note place="margin">Next he lies in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that hee would giue them to Christ, which he neuer would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he might.</note> is
that he pretends hee would giue
all these vnto Christ, which as it
was not in his power to doe, so
was it farre from his minde: for
he enuies that man should enioy
any creature, that euer the Lord
made; so the ende will declare,
when he shall bring his miserable
captiues to such a scarsitie, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of all good things, that if a
drop of water might comfort
them, they shall not get it.</p>
                     <p>We must therefore put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:23620:135"/>
betweene Sathans promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">Sathans promises are alwaies to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from his performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
and his performance: liberall
in the one, poore in the other:
faire in promises, but false in
deeds. He promised to make <hi>Euah</hi>

hee can name a <hi>Rachel,</hi> and giue a

<hi>Achah,</hi> that so he may chase him

what can he giue, but a part of his
owne portion? that is, to make mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable

in his most fearefull condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>And yet alas,<note place="margin">Yet blinde worldlings follow Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than as if the world were at his donation.</note> how many are

by stealing, lying, deceiuing, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing,
thinking to be rich and

this to take out of the hand of
Sathan? Such as multiplyes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

great things offers he for them,

sees to be so base creatures, that
hee bids but a small price for

<hi>Iudas</hi> to doe him seruice for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

hee hire to lye, to sweare, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare,

for one very small piece of

hee esteemes so much, that hee
offers them greater things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

rich rents;<note place="margin">This is their shame, who doe Sathan seruice for small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> but to none did hee

make the men of the world asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
who for smallest trifles make
ship-wracke of their consciences,
and bowe downe to Sathan to
serue him. If there were no more
but a sparke of true man-hoode
and courage in them, this were
sufficient to beget in their hearts
a disdaine of the Diuell, that they
see in his estimation, they are but
base creatures, and therefore hee
thinkes by smallest trifles to make
conquest of them.</p>

                        <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Supplication, Consideration.
Determination</hi> is first, by it we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
and conclude to liue a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life: <hi>Supplication</hi> is second, for
without helpe obtained of God,
our determinations soone vanish:
<hi>Consideration</hi> is the third, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

or not, we haue done as we

vs forward continuing in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and consideration brings vs
home, when we haue gone astray.

doe so, what visible thing should

loue him, that for loue of vs, he
became like vs, but so that hee is
the fairest among the children of
men. When he was transfigured,
his face shined like the Sunne, but
now the brightnes of his face far
surmounts the glory of the sunne:
among all the creatures none in
