            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>My Lord Byrons Letter to his Excellencie
the Marques of Newcaſtle, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
day of January, 1643.</head>
            <p>I Shall now give your <hi>Excellence</hi> an account of the
Victory it hath pleaſed God to give a part of this
Army, againſt all the Forces Sir <hi>William Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werton</hi>
could make. Upon Chriſtmaſſe Even laſt,
I had intelligence, that hee was marched from
<hi>Mancheſter</hi> with ſixteene hundred ſelect foot, and eight
Cornets of horſe, and that upon Chriſtmas day hee was
to keepe his Rendezvous at <hi>Sandbacke</hi> within ſix miles
of my Quarters: Whereupon I reſolved to march thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Army, leaving a Regiment of horſe and
a Regiment of foot for the ſecurity of my Quarters,
leaſt they of <hi>Nantwich</hi> ſhould in the meane time ſally
forth, but wee came no ſooner within view of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,</hi>
but the Rebels retreated in great confuſion, yet
in regard of a narrow paſſe which was betwixt us and
them, we could not overtake any of them, and tooke
up our quarters in theirs that night: There I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by all the Countrey people, that <hi>Brewertons</hi> forces
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30007:3"/>
were totally diſper'ſt and returned to their ſeverall
homes. Whereupon I commanded Colonell <hi>Warren</hi> with
his Regiment of foot, and my Lord <hi>Molineux</hi> with his
horſe to march back to <hi>Crew-houſe,</hi> a ſtrong place poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Rebells, betwixt <hi>Nantwich</hi> and <hi>Sandbacke,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to march thither my ſelfe with the reſt of the
Army the next morning; but as I was upon my march,
certaine intelligence was brought me by a Scout I had
ſent forth, that <hi>Brewerton</hi> was at <hi>Middlewich</hi> with all
his Forces, within three miles of us: Whereupon I
immedately marched thither, and our Forlorne-hope
diſcovered ſeven of their Collours drawne forth of the
Towne, and the reſt advancing as faſt as they could;
Upon this, Colonell <hi>Gibſon,</hi> and my brother <hi>Robert Byron</hi>
advanced with their Regiments, having the Van that day,
Sir <hi>Michael Earnley</hi> with his Regiment was forc't to
ſtay with the Cannon which ſtuck in a durty lane, ſo that,
in that particular we were equall, for they had no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
with them, and we could make no uſe of ours. The
Rebels had poſſeſſed themſelves of the hedges, and all
places of advantage, and gave excellent fire, being the
prime Traine-band men of <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> but our men
with great reſolution ran up to them, and after hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
which laſted almoſt an houre and a halfe, bear them
out of their hedges, and uttetly routed them, the
horſe followed the execution, which was all the ſervice
they could doe in that place, and purſued them almoſt as
far as <hi>Nantwich,</hi> which Garriſon the Rebels quitted the
ſame night, and our men have ſince poſſeſſed themſelves
of five of their Collours. We took three hundred pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
with all theit Baggage and Ammunition; at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30007:3"/>
the leaſt ſix hundred ſlaine, as I am ſince certainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
all their Armes they threw away in their flight,
many inferiour Officers are taken, but their Colonels are
too wiſe to come in danger, yet <hi>Brewerton</hi> himſelfe eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
narrowly, for hee had two great falls in making too
much haſte, wherewith hee was ſo bruiſed, that hee was
faine to have one ride behind him. On our part, fifteene
was ſlaine outright, whereof fourteene were of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Roberts</hi> Regiment, and amongſt the reſt himſelfe
ſhot in the leg, but God be thanked without danger.
We are now returned ro quarter about <hi>Nantwich,</hi> which
being now out of hope to be relieved, I beleeve will not
hold out long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The day after the buſineſſe of <hi>Middlewich,</hi>
My Lord <hi>Mollineux</hi> and Colonell <hi>Warren</hi> tooke in <hi>Crew-houſe,</hi>
and in it above two hundred priſoners, and ſixty
horſe, with all their Armes. Our ſtrength here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above foure thouſand foot, and one thouſand horſe,
but this I can aſſure your <hi>Excellence,</hi> the world hath no
better men, nor will they be beaten by any equall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
