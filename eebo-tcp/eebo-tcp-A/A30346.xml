            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Giving an Account of the most Remarkable

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Account (you so earnestly desire of me) of the Prince's
Expedition and Invasion of <hi>England,</hi> is a Task no one
should have commanded from me, but yourself; the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Friendship between us, makes nothing appear difficult in the way
to serve you.</p>
            <p>I shall not undertake to determine the Legality of this great and
bold Attempt, nor reflect on the Counsels that have brought this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
upon us, but shall content myself with giving you a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Prince's Expedition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52272:2"/>
And first, you are to take notice, That his Highness set
Sail from <hi>Holland</hi> with 51 Men of War, 18 Fire-ships, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
330 Tenders, being Ships hired of Merchants, for the
carriage of Horse and Foot, Armes, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Fleet stood out at Sea to the <hi>Norward,</hi> which met with horrid
Storms for two days and two nights together, in which bad
Weather there were lost above 500 Horse, and a Vessel part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Fleet, wherein were 400 Foot, supposed to be
lost, but now known to be arrived safe at the <hi>Texel,</hi> but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
shatter'd and torn by the Storms; two of the Prince's
principal Men of War were <gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ed to new Rigg at <hi>Helversluse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince immediately on his return back inform'd the
States of the condition of the Fleet, (which was not so dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
as was represented by the Vulgar and Ignorant) who
thereupon, to lull a great Man asleep, the States, or some one
employed by them, order'd, That the <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
Courrantier should make a dismal Story of it, by representing
to the World, that the Prince returned with his Fleet mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
shatter'd and torn, having lost nine Men of War, and
divers others of less concern; 1000 Horse <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
among the Sea-men; the loss of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Burnett,</hi> and the chief
Ministers under the Prince, the ill Opinion the States had
of the Expedition; in short, that a 100000 <hi>l.</hi> would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Damage sustained; and, almost next to an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that the Prince should be in a condition to pursue his
Design till the Spring. And yet at the same time all hands
were at work to repair the damaged Ships, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable:
so that in eight days time they were all re-fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Signal being given by the discharge of a Gun, all
the Fleet immediately weigh'd Anchor and stood out at Sea,
steering their Course <hi>Norward</hi> all that night; next day, upon
Tide of Ebb, they made a Stretch and made a Watch above
a League, and then stood <hi>Westward,</hi> and lay all night in the
same posture, not making two Leagues of Watch.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the night, an Advice-boat brought us an
Account, That the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, consisting of 33 Sail, lay to
the <hi>Westward</hi> of ours. Upon which the Prince fired a Gun,
which caused a great consternation in the whole Fleet, we
having a brisk <hi>Easterly</hi> Wind, concluded ourselves to be all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52272:2"/>
ruin'd: But the small Advice boats crusing for a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
account of the English, brought us back word, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, which the former Advice had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd
us with, it was Admiral <hi>Herbert</hi> with part of our Fleet
which had been seperated some hours from the body of the
Fleet: Upon whose arrival, great rejoycing was among us
all, and a Signal of Joy was given for it by the Prince.</p>
            <p>In the morning, about eight, the Prince gave a Signal, that
the Admirals should come aboard him: Immediately after the
whole Fleet was got into the <hi>North-foreland,</hi> upon which the
Prince gave the usual Sign of Danger, (according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Book) and ordered that the Fleet should all come up in
a Body, some fifteen or sixteen deep, his Highness leading the
Van, in the Ship <hi>Brill,</hi> (in <hi>English, Spectacles:</hi>) His Flag was
<hi>English</hi> Collours, the Motto impaled thereon, is, <hi>The PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANT
RELIGION, and LIBERTIES of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and underneath, instead of <hi>Dieu &amp; Mon Droit, And I
will Maintain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council of War, from aboard the Prince, sent three
small Frigats into the Mouth of the <hi>Thames, viz.</hi> the <hi>Porpus,
Postilion,</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> who on their return, brought us word,
That the <hi>English</hi> Fleet lay in the Buoy of the <hi>Nore,</hi> consisting
of 34 Sail, and three more which lay in the Downs. The
Wind continuing at <hi>E. N. E.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince immediately thereupon, gave another Signal
of stretching the whole Fleet in a Line, from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Callis,</hi>
twenty five deep: So that our Fleet reached within a League
of each place; the Flanks and Reer were guarded by our
Men of War. This sight would have ravish'd the most curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Eyes of <hi>Europe.</hi> When our Fleet was in its greatest splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
the Trumpets and Drums playing various Tunes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
our hearts; this continued for above three hours.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Prince gave us a Sign to close, and
failed that night as far as <hi>Beach,</hi> and commanded us to follow
the Signal by Lights he had hung out to us, <hi>viz.</hi> all the small
Sail should come up to him by morning.</p>
            <p>By the morning-day we espied the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and then
the Prince order'd the Fleet to be drawn into the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
as before related; yet not stretching above half Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52272:3"/>
over in this place. About five in the morning we made
the Start, the Wind chopping about to the <hi>Westward;</hi> upon
which we stood fair by <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and so made for <hi>Torbay,</hi>
where the Prince again order'd the whole Fleet into the same
posture as at <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon his arrival at <hi>Torbay,</hi> the People on Land, in great
numbers, Welcom'd his Highness with loud Acclamations of
Joy.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Prince gave two Signals, that the
Admirals should come abord him, which they did; and then
order'd, that the whole Fleet should come to an Anchor, and
immediately Land; and further order'd, that the Admirals
should stand out at Sea as a Guard, as well as the smaller
Men of War to Attend and Guard their Landing; and also
order'd six Men of War to run in to Guard <hi>Torbay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince then put out a Red Flag at the Misen-yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm;
and provided to land in sixty Boats, laid ready for that
purpose: Upon which the Prince signified, that General
<hi>Mackay</hi> with his six Regiments of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> should
first Land; and also, that the little <hi>Porpus</hi> with eighteen Guns
should run a Ground to secure their Landing: But there was
no Opposition; for the People bid us <hi>Heartily Welcome to</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
and gave us all manner of Provisions for our Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The fifth of <hi>November</hi> (a Day never to be blotted out of the
<hi>English-man's</hi> Heart) the Prince caused to be landed about
2000: On the sixth we landed as many Horse and Foot
as we could possibly; and so continued the seventh. The
Country bringing in all manner of Provision both for Man
and Horse; and were paid their Price honestly for it.</p>
            <p>The Prince the same day commanded Captain <hi>M</hi>— to
search the Lady <hi>C</hi>—'s House, at <hi>Tor-Abby,</hi> for Arms and
Horses; and so all other Houses which were <hi>Roman Catholics.</hi>
The Lady entertained them civilly, said her Husband was
gone to <hi>Plymouth:</hi> They brought from thence some Horses
and a few Arms, but gave no further Disturbance to the Lady
or her House. Nor shall it be forgotten, what was faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted at this Lady's House, immediately on our arrival at
<hi>Torbay:</hi> There was a Priest, and some others with him were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52272:3"/>
upon a watch Tower, to discover what our Fleet was, whether
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch:</hi> at last they discover'd the White Flags on some
of our Men of War; the ignorant Priest concluded absolutely
we were the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which with great impatience they
had so long expected; and having laid up great Provisions for
their Entertainment; the Priest ordered all to the Chappel to
Sing <hi>Te Deum</hi> for the arrival of their supposed Forces; but
being soon deceived, on our landing we found the benefit of
their Provisions; and instead of <hi>Vostre Serviture Monsieur,</hi> they
were entertained with <hi>Yeen Mijnheere,</hi> Can you <hi>Dutch</hi> Spra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
upon which they all run away from the House, but the
Lady and a few old Servants.</p>
            <p>The whole Army, to the best of my knowledge, consisted
of 1800 Horse, 3000 Draggons, and 1800 Foot, besides 1000
Volunteer Persons of Quality, Horse well equipped, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
800 Horse for Carriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the Eighth, the Prince came from <hi>Chudleigh</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Exeter</hi> with the greatest part of his Army attending him,
and about one of the clock Entred at the <hi>Westgate</hi> of the City,
welcomed with loud Acclamations of the People. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his publick Entrance into <hi>Exeter</hi> was as follows.</p>
            <p>1. The Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>M</hi>— with 200
Horse, the most part of which were <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mounted on <hi>Flanders</hi> Steeds, managed and used to War in
Head-pieces, Back and Brest, bright Armour.</p>
            <p>2. 200 Blacks brought from the Plantations of the <hi>Neather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
in <hi>America,</hi> having on Imbroyder'd Caps lin'd with white
Fur, and Plumes of white Feathers, to attend the Horse.</p>
            <p>3. 200 <hi>Finlanders</hi> or <hi>Laplanders</hi> in Bears Skins taken from
the Wild Beasts they had slain, the common Habit of that
cold Climate, with black Armour, and broad Flaming Swords.</p>
            <p>4. 50 Gentlemen, and as many Pages to attend and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Prince's Banner, bearing this Inscription, <hi>God</hi> and
the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. 50 Led Horses, all manag'd and brought up to the Wars,
with two Grooms to each Horse.</p>
            <p>6. After these Rid the Prince on a Milk White Palfrey,
Armed Cap-a-Pee, a Plume of white Feathers on his Head, all
in bright Armour, and Forty two Footmen running by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52272:4"/>
7. After his Highness followed likewise on Horseback 200
Gentlemen and Pages.</p>
            <p>8. 300 <hi>Switzers</hi> with Fuzies.</p>
            <p>9. 500 Voluntiers, each two led Horses.</p>
            <p>10. His Captain and Guards 600 Armed Cap-a-Pee. The
rest of the Army brought up the Reer.</p>
            <p>That night the Prince lay at the Deanry, having before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Advanced Guard to March to <hi>Clist-heath,</hi> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Quarters of the Army; which was done so much to
the content and satisfaction of the Inhabitants in and about
the City, and such just payments made for what the Soldiers
had, and such civil behaviour among them, without Swearing
and Damning, and Debauching of Women, as is usual among
some Armies, that 'tis to admiration to behold. I am sure Sir
I was an eye-witness of the whole order, and when we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away from this City, their joy was turned into dulness and
cloudiness.</p>
            <p>On the Ninth the Prince commanded Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to order
the Priest, Vicars of the Cathedral, not to pray for the Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> and to make use of no other Prayer for the King,
but what is in the second Service, which they refused to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
till they were forced and very severely threatned; the
Bishop and Dean being then gone from the City.</p>
            <p>About Twelve this day, notice was given to the Canons
and all the Vicars, Choral and Singing Lads, to attend in the
Cathedral immediately, for that the Prince would be there,
and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ordered them as soon as the Prince entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Quire, they should sing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> which was observed.
The Prince sat in the Bishops Chair, and all his great Officers
attending on him. After <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung, Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in
a Seat under the Pulpit, read aloud the Princes Declaration
and Reasons for this his Expedition: when this was over the
Prince returned to the Deanery.</p>
            <p>The Baggage was many days bringing from <hi>Torbay,</hi> but the
Ammunition, both Arms for Foot and Horse, and the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
were brought into <hi>Topsham</hi> Road, and there by Boats and
other Carriages landed; the Field pieces were sent after the
Army at <hi>Clist-heath,</hi> the Brass Canon remaining some of
them in <hi>Exon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52272:4"/>
The greatest part of the Army were ordered to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to <hi>Ottery</hi> and <hi>Honyton,</hi> and in several Parties were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to divers places in the County. One party was sent to
the North of <hi>Devon</hi> for Horses, which were bought at exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
rates: From <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> they took Horses without
Money, and many Gentlemen who might have had Money
for their Horses refused, as the Bishops Son and divers others.</p>
            <p>On Sunday Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> Preached at the Cathedral on this
Text, 107 <hi>Psalm, last verse. Ferguson</hi> Preached in the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
Meeting house, but was fain to force his way with his
Sword up to the Pulpit, for even the old Presbyter himself
could not away with the breath of his Brother <hi>Ferguson</hi> in his
Diocess: His Text was in the 94 <hi>Psalm, Who will rise up for
me against evil doers.</hi> I heard one of that Gang say, that his
Discourse came very much under the lash of the 25 of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Third; he is not much regarded by any of the
Princes Retinue.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William W</hi>— who had been at <hi>Ford</hi> with the Prince,
to see Sir <hi>William G</hi>— were both refused to be seen of him.
One Major <hi>M</hi>— and Sir <hi>Will</hi> were in Commission to make
new Levies, which was carried on vigourously, and many
Listed under them: but Sir. <hi>W.</hi> it seems began to use an old
Trade of taking Money for Quarters: Complaint was made
thereof to the Prince, and they were discarded, and the Men
Disbanded to seek for new Officers. But Sir <hi>W.</hi> does conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
under the Prince's Protection.</p>
            <p>The Prince was here above three days, before any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gentry came, insomuch that the great Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wonder, that the Prince should be Invited into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by them, and not to appear to the Prince's Assistance;
but this consternation was soon over, when a considerable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Gentry came into him. Some that were for taking
off the Test and Penal Laws, they have not appeared as yet.
So that now the Counties of <hi>Cornewall</hi> and <hi>Devon</hi> are in the
possession of the Gentry thereof, and the Prince's Army quite
marched away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pendennis</hi> Castle is managed by several Gentlemen, who
take their turns, <hi>Plymouth</hi> Fort is declared for the Prince's
Service, by the Earl of <hi>B</hi>— who it seems was to have been
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52272:5"/>
poyson'd, by throwing white <hi>Mercury</hi> over a Leg of <hi>Mutton</hi>
(appointed as one Dish for his Supper) instead of Flower;
that, and for some other Reasons, he secured the Lord <hi>H</hi>—
turned out all Papist Soldiers, and has taken in the County
Soldiers into the Fort.</p>
            <p>Since which, there is an Association among the Gentry,
worded much after that of my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> being made Governor of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Mordant</hi> in his absence; there are new Leavies raising every
day; so that this City is almost full of these new Regiments,
which are hourly disciplining by Officers and old Soldiers
left here by the Prince. All their Arms are the Prince's, and
I am told, he brought with him as many as will set out 20000
both Horse and Foot. I am apt to believe this to be true, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
seen most of what has been Landed. All the Vessels
that brought up the Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are returned again to
<hi>Torbay,</hi> under the Guard of the principal Men of War, a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of which lye now in the Sound of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and saluted
each other with many Cannon from the Fort and the Fleet.</p>
            <p>On Sunday last there was a report that the <hi>French</hi> were
Landed 20000, at <hi>Porlock</hi> in this County, upon which the
whole Country rise with Pikes, Spits, Scythes, and what wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
they could get, and made away for <hi>Exeter;</hi> but it prov'd
a false Allarm; for there were two small <hi>French</hi> Ships driven
by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet ashoar, and the <hi>French</hi> quitted their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and went on Land, and were some Killed, others sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So that now they are pretty quiet again; but has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that advantage to the Commissioned Officers, who are to
raise New Leavies, to pick and choose amongst them whom
they please.</p>
            <p>I shall now return again to the Prince; when his Highness left <hi>Exeter,</hi>
Wednesday <hi>Nov.</hi> 21. he marched with his own Guards, attended by a great
many of the Gentry both of <hi>Somersetshire</hi> and <hi>Devon,</hi> to St. <hi>Mary Ottery,</hi> where
he dined, after which he marched to <hi>Axminster,</hi> where he continued four
days, from thence to <hi>Crookehorn,</hi> where he tarried only one night, from thence
to <hi>Sherborne,</hi> where his Highness was splendidly entertained by the Lord <hi>D</hi>— From
thence he went to <hi>Wincanton,</hi> where he Lodged at the House of one
Mr. <hi>Churchill</hi> a Merchant, and its credibly reported, designs for <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have given you the best Account I can of this great Affair, you may
Communicate it to such Friends as you think fit. Sir, I am with all due
