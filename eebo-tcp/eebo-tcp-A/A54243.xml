            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98728:4"/>
particular enough about the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt: And it is generally Rumour'd and Charged upon you by your Adverſaries, that you have little reverence to the Doctrine of Chriſt's Satisfaction to God for our Sins, and that you do not Believe, That the</hi> Active <hi>and</hi> Paſſive <hi>Obedience of Chriſt, when He was in the World, is the</hi> alone <hi>ground of a Sinners Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> §. 1. The Doctrine of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, are placed in ſo ſtrict an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the one is a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the other, and what we ſay of them, is what agrees with the ſuffrage of Scripture, and for the moſt part in the terms of it; always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that in Points where there ariſes any difficulty, be it from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98728:4"/>
Obſcurity of Expreſſion, Miſ-tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the Duſt raiſed by the Heats of <hi>Partial</hi> Writers, or <hi>Nice Criticks,</hi> it is ever beſt to keep cloſe to the Text, and maintain Charity in the reſt. I ſhall firſt ſpeak <hi>Negatively,</hi> what we do not own, which perhaps hath given occaſion to thoſe who have been more Haſty then Wiſe, to judge us defective in our Belief of the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt to Juſtification: As,</p>
            <p>§. 2. Firſt, We cannot Believe that Chriſt is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> but the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of God's Love, according to the Teſtimony of the Beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>God hath ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World, that he hath given his only Begotten Son into the World, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We cannot ſay, God <hi>could not</hi> have taken another way to have ſaved Sinners, than by the Death
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98728:5"/>
and Sufferings of his Son, to ſatisfie his Juſtice, or that Chriſt's Death and ſufferings were a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> Satisfaction for that Eternal Death and Miſery due to a Man for Sin and Tranſgreſſion: For ſuch a Notion were to make God's Mercy little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Man's Salvation; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are at too great a diſtance from his Infinite Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to judge of the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of his Actings.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We cannot ſay Jeſus Chriſt was the <hi>greateſt Sinner</hi> in the World, (becauſe he bore our Sins on his Croſs, or becauſe he was made Sin for us, who knew no Sin) an Expreſſion of great <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> yet often ſaid by great Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Profeſſors of Religion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We cannot Believe that Chriſt's Death and Sufferings <hi>ſo</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies God, or juſtifies Men, as that they are thereby Accepted of God: They are indeed thereby put into a ſtate capable of being accepted of God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98728:5"/>
and through the Obedience of Faith and Sanctification of the Spirit, are in a ſtate of Acceptance: For we can never think a Man juſtified before God, while <hi>Self-condemned;</hi> or that any Man can be in Chriſt, who is not a <hi>New</hi> Creature, or that God looks upon Men <hi>otherwiſe</hi> then they are. We think it a ſtate of <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and not of <hi>Salvation,</hi> to call <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Lord!</hi> and not by the Work of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt. Maſter!</hi> And he not yet <hi>Maſter of our Affections: Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our!</hi> And they not ſaved by him from their <hi>Sins: Redeemer!</hi> And yet they not redeemed by him from their <hi>Paſſion, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Vanity, Honours, vain Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of this World: Which were to deceive themſelves: for God will not be mocked, ſuch as Men ſow, ſuch muſt they reap. And though Chriſt did <hi>Die</hi> for us, yet we muſt, by the Aſſiſtance of his Grace, <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling:</hi> As he Died for Sin, ſo we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98728:6"/>
muſt Die <hi>to</hi> Sin, or we cannot be ſaid to be ſaved by the Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, or throughly juſtified and accepted with God. Thus far Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively. Now, Poſſitively, what we own as to Juſtification.</p>
            <p>§. 3. We do Believe, that Jeſus Chriſt was our Holy <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Attonement,</hi> and <hi>Prepiriation;</hi> that he bore our Iniquities, and that by his Stripes we were healed of the Wounds <hi>Adam</hi> gave us in his Fall; and that God is juſt in forgiving true Penitents upon the Credit of that Holy Offering, Chriſt made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God for us; and that what he did and ſuffer'd, ſatisfied and pleaſed God, and was for the ſake of fallen Man that had diſpleaſed God: And that through the Offering up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once for all, through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit, he hath for Ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected thoſe (in all times) that are ſanctified, <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit. Rom.</hi> 8. 1. Mark that.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98728:6"/>
§. 4. In ſhort, <hi>Juſtification</hi> conſiſts of two parts, or hath a two-fold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification from the Guilt of Sin, and Juſtification from the Power and Pollution of Sin, and in this Sence Juſtification gives Man a full and clear Acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. For want of this latter part, it is that ſo many Souls Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inclin'd, are often under Doubts, Scruples and Deſpondencies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that their Teachers tell them of the Extent and Efficacy of the firſt part of Juſtification. And it is too general an Unhappineſs among the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, that they are apt to cloak their own <hi>Active and Paſſive Diſobedience</hi> with the <hi>Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt.</hi> The firſt part of Juſtification we do reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and humbly acknowledge is only for the ſake of the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt; nothing we can do, <hi>though by the Operation of the Holy Spirit,</hi> being able to Cancel Old Debts,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98728:7"/>
or wipe out Old Scores: It is the Power and Efficacy of that Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Offering, upon Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that juſtifies us from the Sins that are paſt; and it is the Power of Chriſt's Spirit in our Hearts that purifies and makes us acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. For till the Heart of Man is purged from Sin, God will never accept of it. He Reproves, Rebukes and Condemns thoſe that entertain Sin there, and therefore ſuch cannot be ſaid to be in a <hi>Juſtified</hi> State; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Juſtification being <hi>Contraries:</hi> So that they that hold themſelves in a Juſtified State by the Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt, while they are not Actively and Paſſively Obedient to the Spirit of Chriſt Juſus, are under a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>dangerous Deluſion;</hi> and for crying out againſt this Sin-pleaſing Imagination, not to ſay <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we are Staged and Reproached as Denicrs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of the Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But be it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98728:7"/>
known to ſuch, they add to Chriſt's Sufferings, and Crucifie to themſelves afreſh the Son of God, and trample the Blood of the Covenant under their Feet, that walk unholily under a Profeſſion of Juſtification; for God will not acquit the Guilty, nor Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Diſobedient and Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Such deceive themſelves, and at the Great and Final Judgment their Sentence will not be, Come ye Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe it cannot be ſaid to them, <hi>Well done Good and Faithful,</hi> for they cannot be ſo eſteemed that live and die in a Reproveable and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable State; but, Go ye Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 5. Wherefore, O my Reader!

CHRIST JESUS, according to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. But becauſe we ſo Believe, muſt we not Believe what Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that is with you ſhall be in you,</hi> John 14. <hi>I in them, and they in me,</hi> &amp;c.

This we eſteem hard and unrighteous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98728:10"/>
Meaſure; nor would our warm and ſharp Adverſaries be ſo dealt with by others: But to do as they would be done to, is too often no part of their Practice, whatever it be of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Yet we are very ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the whole World, that we cannot think Men and Women <hi>can be ſaved</hi> by their Belief of the one <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Senſe and Experience of the other;</hi> and that is what we oppoſe, and not his Bleſſed Manifeſtation in the Fleſh. We ſay that he then overcame our Common Enemy, ſoiled him in the open Field, and in our Nature tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over him that had overcome and triumphed over it in our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Poſterity; and that as truly as Chriſt overcame him in our Nature, in his own Perſon, ſo, <hi>by his Divine Grace</hi> being received and obeyed by us, he overcomes him in us: That is, he detects the Enemy by his <hi>Light</hi> in the Conſcience, and <hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98728:11"/>
the Creature to reſiſt him, and all his Fiery Darts, and finally, ſo to Fight the Good Fight of Faith, as to <hi>overcome</hi> him, and lay hold on Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</p>
            <p>§. 4. And this is the Diſpenſation of <hi>Grace,</hi> which we declare, <hi>has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all,</hi> more or leſs; teaching thoſe that will receive it, <hi>to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and wordly luſt, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World; looking for</hi> (which none elſe can juſtly do) <hi>the bleſſed Hope, and glorious Appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. And as from the Teachings, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Motion of this Grace, we miniſter to others, ſo the very drift of our Miniſtry is to turn Peoples Minds to this Grace in themſelves, that they may all, up and be doing, <hi>even the good and acceptable Will of God, and work out their Salvation with fear and trembling, and make their High and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98728:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Heavenly Calling and Election ſure;</hi> which none elſe can do, whatever be their <hi>Profeſſion, Church</hi> and <hi>Character: For ſuch as Men ſow they muſt reap; and his Servants we are, whom we obey. Regeneration</hi> we muſt know, or we cannot be Children of God, and Heirs of Eternal Glory: And to be Born again, <hi>an other</hi> Spirit and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple muſt <hi>prevail, leaven, ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> us, than either the Spirit of the World, or our own depraved Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and this can be no other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than that which dwelt in Chriſt, for unleſs that dwell in us, we can be none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And this Spirit begins in <hi>Conviction,</hi> and ends in <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance:</hi> And the one follows the other; Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being the Conſequence of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions obey'd,</hi> and Perſeverance a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Fruit</hi> of Converſion, and being Born of God; for ſuch Sin not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Seed of God abides in them, <hi>John</hi> 3. 7, 8. but through Faithfulneſs, continue to the end, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98728:12"/>
obtain the Promiſe, even Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</p>
            <p>§. 5. But let my <hi>Reader</hi> take this along with him, that we do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Chriſt, through his Holy <hi>Doing</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> (for being a <hi>Son</hi> he learned <hi>Obedience)</hi> has obtained Mercy of God his Father for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and that his Obedience has an Influence to our Salvation, in all the Parts and Branches of it; ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became a Conqueror, and <hi>led Captivity Captive, and obtained Gifts for Men with divers Great and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſes, that thereby we might be partakers of the Divine Nature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> (firſt) <hi>eſcaped the Corruption that is in the World, through Luſt. I</hi> ſay we do Believe and Confeſs that the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus affects our Salvation throughout, as well from the Power and Pollution of Sir, as from the Guilt, He being a Conqueror as well as a Sacrifice, and both, through Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98728:12"/>
Yet, they that reject his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Gift, ſo obtained, and which he has given to them, by which to ſee their Sin, and the ſinfulneſs of it, and to repent and turn away from it, and do ſo no more; and to wait upon God for daily ſtrength to reſiſt the Fiery Darts of the Enemy, and to be Comforted through the Obedience of Faith in and to this Divine Grace of the Son of God, ſuch do not pleaſe God, believe truly in God; nor are they in a ſtate of true Chriſtianity and Salvation. <hi>Woman,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, to the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> at the Well, <hi>hadſt thou known the Gift of God, and who it is that ſpeaketh to thee,</hi> &amp;c. People know not Chriſt, and God, whom to know is Life Eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17. becauſe they are Ignorant of the Gift of God, <hi>viz.</hi> a meaſure of the Spirit of God that is given to every one to profit with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals Chriſt and God to the Soul. <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> cannot do it; <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> cannot do it; <hi>Tongues</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98728:13"/>
and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> cannot do it; for they that <hi>by Wisdom</hi> knew not God, had theſe things for their <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> They were ſtrong, deep and accurate in them; but alas, they were clouded, puft up, and ſet farther off from the Inward and Saving Knowledge of God, becauſe they ſought for it in them, and thought to find God there. But the <hi>Key of David</hi> is an other thing, which ſhuts and no Man opens, and opens and no Man ſhuts; and this Key have all they that receive the <hi>Gift of God</hi> into their Hearts; and it opens to them, the Knowledge of God and themſelves, and gives them a quite <hi>other Sight, Taſte</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of things, than their <hi>Educational</hi> or <hi>Traditional</hi> Knowledge afforded them. This is the beginning of the <hi>New Creation</hi> of God, and thus it is we come to be New Creatures: And we are bound to declare there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, beſides this, by which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can come into Chriſt, or to be true Chriſtians, or receive the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98728:13"/>
that comes by the Death and Sufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore we ſay, and upon good Authority, even that of our <hi>own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> as well as that of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, Chriſt will prove <hi>no Saving Sacrifice</hi> for them that <hi>refuſe</hi> him for their <hi>Example.</hi> They that <hi>reject</hi> the Gift, do <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Giver,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of themſelves <hi>daily,</hi> for the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> ſake. O that People were wiſe! that they would conſider their latter End, and the things that make for the Peace thereof! Why ſhould they <hi>periſh</hi> in a vain hope of Life, <hi>while Death Reigns?</hi> Of living with God, who live not to him, nor walk with him? <hi>Awake,</hi> thou that ſleepeſt in thy Sin, or at beſt, in thy Self-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Awake, I ſay, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life! For he is the <hi>Lord from Heaven, the quickening Spirit,</hi> that quickens us, by his Spirit, if we do not, <hi>reſiſt</hi> it and <hi>quench</hi> it, by our Diſobedience; but receive, love and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98728:14"/>
obey it, in all the Holy Leadings and Teachings of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14, 15. To which Holy Spirit I commend my <hi>Reader,</hi> that he may the better ſee where he is, and alſo come to the true Belief and Advantage of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our Dear and Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaves from the <hi>Power and Pollution,</hi> as well as Guilt of Sin, all thoſe that <hi>hear his knocks, and open the Door of their Hearts</hi> to him, that he may come in and work a real and through Reformation in and for them. And ſo the <hi>Benefit, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Eſſicacy</hi> of his <hi>Doings</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> without us, will come to be livingly applied and felt, and fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Death and Sufferings known, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle; which, thoſe that live in that which made him ſuffer, know not, tho' they profeſs to be ſaved by his Death and Sufferings. Much more might be ſaid as to this matter, but I muſt be brief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98728:14"/>
§. 6. To conclude this Chapter, we wonder not that we ſhould be miſtaken, miſ-conſtrued and miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, in what we believe and do to Salvation, ſince our Betters have been ſo treated in the Primitive Times; nor indeed is it only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Religion, for our <hi>Practice</hi> in <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> have had the ſame Succeſs: But this is what I earneſtly deſire, that however bold People <hi>are</hi> pleaſed to make with us, they would not <hi>deceive</hi> themſelves in the great things of their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: That while they would ſeem to own all to Chriſt, they are not found <hi>diſowned</hi> of Chriſt in the laſt Day. Read the 7th of <hi>Matthew;</hi> it is, he that hears Chriſt, the great Word of God, and does what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, what he commands, and by his Bleſſed Example, recommends, that is a <hi>Wiſe Builder,</hi> that has founded his Houſe well, and built with good Materials, and whoſe Houſe will ſtand the laſt ſhake and Judgement.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98728:15"/>
For which cauſe we are often plain, cloſe and earneſt with People, to conſider, that Chriſt came not to ſave them in, but <hi>from their Sins;</hi> and that they that think to diſcharge and releaſe themſelves of his <hi>Yoke</hi> and <hi>Burden,</hi> his <hi>Croſs</hi> and Example, and ſecure themſelves, and Complement Chriſt with his having done all for them, while he has wrought <hi>little or nothing in them,</hi> nor they parted with any thing for the love of him, will finally awake in a dreadful ſurprize, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, and at this ſad and irrevokeable Sentence, <hi>Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I know you not:</hi> Which terrible End, may all timely avoid, by <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening</hi> to Wiſdom's Voice, and <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at her Reproof, that ſhe may lead them in the Ways of Righteouſneſs, and in the midſt of the Paths of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that their Souls may come to inherit <hi>Subſtance;</hi> even <hi>durable Riches and Righteouſneſs</hi> in the Kingdom of the Father, World without end.</p>
