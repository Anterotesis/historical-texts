            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN, That Part eſpecially now call'd <hi>England;</hi> Continu'd to the <hi>Norman Conqueſt.</hi> BOOK I.</head>
            <p>THe beginning of Nations, thoſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of whom ſacred Books have ſpok'n, is to this day unknown. Nor only the beginning, but the deeds alſo of many ſucceeding Ages, yea periods of Ages, either wholly unknown, or obſcur'd and blemiſht with Fables. Whether it were that the uſe of Letters came in long after, or were it the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of barbarous inundations, or they themſelves at certain revolutions of time, fatally decaying, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55158:3"/>
degenerating into Sloth and Ignorance; wherby the monuments of more ancient civility have bin ſom deſtroy'd, ſom loſt. Perhaps diſ-eſteem and contempt of the public affairs then preſent, as not worth recording, might partly be in cauſe. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly oft-times we ſee that wiſe men, and of beſt abilitie have forborn to write the Acts of thir own daies, while they beheld with a juſt loathing and diſdain, not only how unworthy, how pervers, how corrupt, but often how ignoble, how petty, how below all Hiſtory the perſons and thir actions were; who either by fortune, or ſom rude election had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as a ſore judgment, and ignominie upon the Land, to have cheif ſway in managing the Common-wealth. But that any law, or ſuperſtition of our old Philoſophers the <hi>Druids</hi> forbad the <hi>Britains</hi> to write thir memorable deeds, I know not why any out of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould allege: he indeed ſaith, that thir do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they thought not lawful to commit to Letters; <note place="margin">Caſ. l. 6.</note> but in moſt matters elſe, both privat, and public, among which well may Hiſtory be reck'nd, they us'd the Greek Tongue: and that the <hi>Britiſh Druids</hi> who taught thoſe in <hi>Gaule</hi> would be ignorant of any Language known and us'd by thir Diſciples, or ſo frequently writing other things, and ſo inquiſitive into higheſt, would for want of recording be ever Children in the Knowledge of Times and Ages, is not likely. What ever might be the reaſon, this we find, that of <hi>Britiſh affairs,</hi> from the firſt peopling of the Iland to the coming of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> nothing certain, either by Tradition, Hiſtory, or Ancient Fame hath hitherto bin left us. That which we have of oldeſt ſeeming, hath by the greater part of judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Antiquaries bin long rejected for a modern Fable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55158:3"/>
Nevertheleſs there being others beſides the firſt ſuppos'd Author, men not unread, nor unlerned in Antiquitie, who admitt that for approved ſtory, which the former explode for fiction, and ſeeing that oft-times relations heertofore accounted fabulous have bin after found to contain in them many foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, and reliques of ſomthing true, as what we read in Poets of the Flood, and Giants little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd, till undoubted witneſſes taught us, that all was not fain'd; I have therfore determin'd to beſtow the telling over ev'n of theſe reputed Tales; be it for nothing elſe but in favour of our Engliſh Poets, and Rhetoricians, who by thir Art will know, how to uſe them judiciouſly.</p>
            <p>I might alſo produce example, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> among the <hi>Greeks, Livie</hi> and others of the <hi>Latines, Polydore</hi> and <hi>Virunnius</hi> accounted among our own Writers. But I intend not with controverſies and quotations to delay or interrupt the ſmooth courſe of Hiſtory; much leſs to argue and debate long who were the firſt Inhabitants, with what probabilities, what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities each opinion hath bin upheld, but ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor that which hitherto hath bin needed moſt, with plain, and lightſom brevity, to relate well and orderly things worth the nothing, ſo as may beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and benefit them that read. Which, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring divine aſſiſtance, that it may redound to his glory, and the good of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, <hi>I now begin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the whole Earth was inhabited before the Flood, and to the utmoſt point of habitable ground, from thoſe effectual words of <hi>God</hi> in the Creation, may be more then conjectur'd. Hence that this Iland alſo had her dwellers, her affairs, and perhaps her ſtories, eev'n in that old World thoſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55158:4"/>
years, with much reaſon we may inferr. After the Flood, and the diſperſing of Nations, as they journey'd leaſurely from the Eaſt, <hi>Gomer</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Japhet,</hi> and his off-ſpring, as by Authorities, Arguments, and Affinitie of divers names is generally beleev'd, were the firſt that peopl'd all theſe Weſt and Northren Climes. But they of our own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who thought they had don nothing, unleſs with all circumſtance they tell us when, and who firſt ſet foot upon this Iland, preſume to name out of fabulous and counterfet Authors a certain <hi>Samothes</hi> or <hi>Dis,</hi> a fowrth or ſixt Son of <hi>Japhet,</hi> whom they make about 200 years after the Flood, to have planted with Colonies; firſt the Continent of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> or <hi>Gaule,</hi> and next <hi>this Iland;</hi> Thence to have nam'd it <hi>Samothea,</hi> to have reign'd heer, and after him lineally fowr Kings, <hi>Magus, Saron, Druis,</hi> and <hi>Bardus.</hi> But the forg'd <hi>Beroſus,</hi> whom only they have to cite, no where mentions that either hee, or any of thoſe whom they bring, did ever paſs into <hi>Britain,</hi> or ſend thir people hither. So that this out-landiſh figment may eaſily excuſe our not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the room heer ſo much as of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fable.</p>
            <p>That which follows, perhaps as wide from truth, though ſeeming leſs impertinent, is, that theſe <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theans</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Bardus</hi> were ſubdu'd by <hi>Albion</hi> a Giant, Son of <hi>Neptune:</hi> who call'd the Iland after his own name, and rul'd it 44 years. Till at length paſſing over into <hi>Gaul,</hi> in aid of his Brother <hi>Leſtrygon,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Hercules</hi> was haſting out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> he was there ſlain in fight, and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> alſo his Brother.</p>
            <p>Sure anough we are, that <hi>Britan</hi> hath bin ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly term'd <hi>Albion,</hi> both by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55158:4"/>
And <hi>Mela</hi> the Geographer makes mention of a ſtonie ſhoar in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where by report ſuch a Battel was fought. The reſt, as his giving name to the Ile, or ever landing heer, depends altogether upon late ſurmiſes. But too abſurd, and too unconſcionably groſs is that fond invention that wafted hither the fifty daughters of a ſtrange <hi>Diocleſian King of Syria;</hi> brought in doubtles by ſom illiterat pretender to ſomthing miſtak'n in the Common Poetical Story of <hi>Danaus King of Argos,</hi> while his vanity, not pleas'd with the obſcure beginning which trueſt Antiquity affords the Nation, labour'd to contrive us a Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as he thought, more noble. Theſe Daughters by appointment of <hi>Danaus</hi> on the mariage-night ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving murder'd all thir Huſbands, except <hi>Linceus,</hi> whom his Wives loialty ſav'd, were by him at the ſuit of his Wife thir Siſter, not put to death, but turn'd out to Sea in a Ship unmann'd; of which whole Sex they had incurr'd the hate: and as the Tale goes, were driv'n on <hi>this Iland.</hi> Where the Inhabitants, none but Devils, as ſom write, or as others, a lawleſs crew left heer by <hi>Albion</hi> without Head or Governour, both entertain'd them, and had iſſue by them a ſecond breed of Giants, who ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranniz'd <hi>the Ile,</hi> till <hi>Brutus</hi> came.</p>
            <p>The Eldeſt of theſe Dames in thir Legend they call <hi>Albina;</hi> and from thence, for which cauſe the whole ſcene was fram'd, will have the name <hi>Albion</hi> deriv'd. Incredible it may ſeem ſo ſluggiſh a conceit ſhould prove ſo ancient, as to be authoriz'd by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Ninnius,</hi> reputed to have liv'd above a thouſand years agoe. This I find not in him; but that <hi>Hiſtion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Holinſhed.</note> ſprung of <hi>Japhet,</hi> had four Sons; <hi>Francus, Romanus, Alemannus,</hi> and <hi>Britto,</hi> of whom the <hi>Britans;</hi> as true, I beleeve, as that thoſe other Nations whoſe names
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55158:5"/>
are reſembl'd, came of the other three; if theſe Dreams give not juſt occaſion to call in doubt the Book it ſelf, which bears that title.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the things themſelves have giv'n us a warrantable diſpatch to run them ſoon over. But now of <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Line, with the whole Progeny of Kings, to the entrance of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo eaſily be diſcharg'd; Deſcents of Anceſtry, long continu'd, laws and exploits not plainly ſeeming to be borrow'd, or devis'd, which on the common beleif have wrought no ſmall impreſſion: defended by many, deny'd utterly by few. For what though <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the whole <hi>Trojan</hi> pretence were yeelded up, ſeeing they who firſt devis'd to bring us from ſom noble Anceſtor were content at firſt with <hi>Brutus</hi> the Conſul; till better invention, although not willing to forgoe the name, taught them to remove it higher into a more fabulous Age, by the ſame remove light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Trojan</hi> Tales in affectation to make the <hi>Britan</hi> of one Original with the <hi>Roman,</hi> pitch'd there, yet thoſe old and inborn names of ſucceſſive Kings, never any to have bin real perſons, or don in thir lives at leaſt ſom part of what ſo long hath bin remember'd, cannot be thought without too ſtrict an incredulity.</p>
            <p>For theſe, and thoſe cauſes above mention'd, that which hath receav'd approbation from ſo many, I have chos'n not to omitt. Certain or uncertain, be that upon the credit of thoſe whom I muſt follow; ſo far as keeps alooff from impoſſible and abſurd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by ancient Writers from Books more ancient I refuſe not, as the due and proper ſubject of Story. The principal Author is well know'n to be <hi>Geoffrey of Monmouth;</hi> what he was, and whence his authority, who in his age or before him have deliver'd the ſame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55158:5"/>
matter, and ſuch like general diſcourſes, will better ſtand in a Treatiſe by themſelvs. All of them agree <note place="margin">Henry <hi>of</hi> Hunting don. Matthew <hi>of</hi> Weſtminſter.</note> in this, that <hi>Brutus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Silvius;</hi> he of <hi>Aſcanius;</hi> whoſe Father was <hi>Aeneas a Trojan Prince,</hi> who at the burning of that City, with his Son <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and a collected number that eſcap'd, after long wandring on the Sea, arriv'd in <hi>Italy.</hi> Where at length by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Latinus King of Latium,</hi> who had giv'n him <hi>his Daughter Lavinia,</hi> he obtain'd to ſucceed in that Kingdom, and left it to <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Silvius</hi> (though <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories deny <hi>Silvius</hi> to be Son of <hi>Aſcanius)</hi> had maried ſecretly a Neece of <hi>Lavinia.</hi>

            <p>She being with Child, the matter became known to <hi>Aſcanius.</hi> Who commanding his <hi>Magicians to enquire by Art, what ſex the Maid had conceiv'd,</hi> had anſwer, <hi>that it was one who ſhould be the death of both his Parents; and baniſh'd for the fact, ſhould after all in a farr Country attain to higheſt honour.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction fail'd not, for intravel the Mother di'd. And <hi>Brutus</hi> (the Child was ſo call'd) at fifteen years of Age, attending his Father to the Chace, with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unfortunately kill'd him.</p>
            <p>Baniſh'd therefore by his kindred he retires into <hi>Greece.</hi> Where meeting with the race of <hi>Helenus King Priams Son,</hi> held there in ſervile condition by <hi>Pandraſus then King,</hi> with them he abides. For <hi>Pirrhus</hi> in revenge of his Father ſlain at <hi>Troy</hi> had brought thither with him <hi>Helenus,</hi> and many others into ſervitude. There <hi>Brutus</hi> among his own ſtock ſo thrives in vertue and in Arms, as renders him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd to Kings, and great Captains above all the Youth of that Land. Wherby the <hi>Trojans</hi> not only beginn to hope, but ſecretly to move him, that he would lead them the way to liberty. They allege
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55158:6"/>
their numbers, and the promis'd help of <hi>Aſſaracus</hi> a Noble Greekiſh Youth, by the Mothers ſide a <hi>Trojan;</hi> whom for that cauſe his Brother went about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs of certain Caſtles bequeath'd him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Brutus</hi> conſidering both the Forces offer'd him, and the ſtrength of thoſe Holds, not unwillingly conſents.</p>
            <p>Firſt therfore having fortifi'd thoſe Caſtles, he with <hi>Aſſaracus</hi> and the whole multitude betake them to the Woods and Hills; as the ſafeſt place from whence to expoſtulate; and in the name of all ſends to <hi>Pandraſus</hi> this Meſſage; <hi>That the</hi> Trojans <hi>holding it unworthy thir Anceſtors to ſerv in a Foren Kingdom, had retreated to the Woods; chooſing rather a Savage life then a ſlaviſh; If that diſpleas'd him, that then with his leave they might depart to ſome other ſoil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this may paſs with good allowance, that the <hi>Trojans</hi> might be many in theſe parts, for <hi>Helenus</hi> was by <hi>Pirrhus</hi> made King of the <hi>Chaouians,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Pirrhus</hi> by <hi>Andromache Hectors Wiſe</hi> could not but be powerful through all <hi>Epirus,</hi> ſo much the more it may be doubted, how theſe <hi>Trojans</hi> could be thus in bondage, where they had Freinds and Country-men ſo Potent. But to examin theſe things with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, were but to confute the Fables of <hi>Britan</hi> with the Fables of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> for of this Age, what we have to ſay, as well concerning moſt other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as this Iland, is equally under Queſtion. Bee't how it will, <hi>Pandraſus</hi> not expecting ſo bold a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Sons of Captives, gathers an Army. And marching toward the Woods, <hi>Brutus</hi> who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his approach nigh to a Town call'd <hi>Sparatinum,</hi> (I know not what Towne, but certaine of no Greek name) over night planting himſelf there with good part of his men, ſuddenly ſets upon him, and with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55158:6"/>
ſlaughter of the <hi>Greeks</hi> purſues him to the paſſage of a River, which mine Author names <hi>Akalon,</hi> meaning perhaps <hi>Achelous,</hi> or <hi>Acheron:</hi> where at the Ford he overlaies them afreſh. This victory obtain'd, and a ſufficient ſtrength left in <hi>Sparatinum, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the Kings Brother and his Freind <hi>Anacletus,</hi> whom he had tak'n in the fight, returns to the reſidue of his freinds in the thick Woods. While <hi>Pandraſus</hi> with all ſpeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting, beſeiges the Town. <hi>Brutus</hi> to releive his men beſeig'd, who earneſtly call'd him, diſtruſting the ſufficiency of his force, bethinks himſelf of this Policy. Calls to him <hi>Anacletus,</hi> and threatning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant death elſe, both to him and his freind <hi>Antigonus,</hi> enjoyns him, that he ſhould goe at the ſecond howr of night to the Greekiſh Leagre, and tell the Guards he had brought <hi>Antigonus</hi> by ſtealth out of Priſon to a certain woody Vale; unable through the waight of his Fetters to move furder: entreating them to come ſpeedily and fetch him in. <hi>Anacletus</hi> to ſave both himſelf and his freind <hi>Antigonus,</hi> ſwears this; and at fit howr ſetts on alone toward the Camp: is mett, examin'd, and at laſt unqueſtionably known. To whom, great profeſſion of fidelity firſt made, he frames his Tale, as had bin taught him: and they now fully aſſur'd, with a credulous raſhneſs leaving thir Stations, far'd accordingly by the ambuſh that there awaited them. Forthwith <hi>Brutus</hi> dividing his men into three parts, leads on in ſilence to the Camp; commanding firſt each part at a ſeveral place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forbear Execution, till he with his Squadron poſſeſ'd of the Kings Tent, gave Signal to them by Trumpet. The ſound whereof no ſooner heard, but huge havock begins upon the ſleeping, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded Enemy; whom the beſeiged alſo now ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

forth, on the other ſide aſſaile. <hi>Brutus</hi> the while had ſpecial care to ſeiſe and ſecure the <hi>Kings Perſon;</hi> whoſe life ſtill within his Cuſtody, he knew was the ſureſt pledge to obtain what he ſhould demand. Day appearing, he enters the Town, there diſtributes the <hi>Kings Treaſury,</hi> and leaving the place better fortify'd, returns with the King his Priſner to the Woods. Strait the ancient and grave men he ſummons to Counſell, what they ſhould now demand of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After long debate <hi>Mempricius,</hi> one of the graveſt, utterly diſſuading them from thought of longer ſtay in <hi>Greece,</hi> unleſſe they meant to be deluded with a ſuttle peace, and the awaited revenge of thoſe whoſe freinds they had ſlain, adviſes them to demand firſt the <hi>Kings Eldeſt Daughter Innogen</hi> in mariage to thir Leader <hi>Brutus,</hi> with a rich dowry, next ſhipping, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and fitt proviſion for them all to depart the Land.</p>
            <p>This reſolution pleaſing beſt, the King now brought in, and plac'd in a high Seat, is breifly told, that on theſe conditions granted, he might be free, not granted, he muſt prepare to die.</p>
            <p>Preſt with fear of death the <hi>King</hi> readily yeelds: eſpecially to beſtow his Daughter on whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd ſo Noble and ſo Valiant: offers them alſo the third part of his Kingdom, if they like to ſtay; if not, to be thir Hoſtage himſelf, till he had made good his word.</p>
            <p>The Mariage therfore ſolemniz'd, and ſhipping from all parts got together, the <hi>Trojans</hi> in a Fleet, no leſs writt'n then three hunderd fowr and twenty Sail, betake them to the wide Sea; where with a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe two daies and a night bring them on a certain Iland long before diſpeopl'd and left waſt by Sea-Roavers; the name wherof was then <hi>Leogecia,</hi> now unknow'n.

            <p>Theſe Verſes Originally Greek, were put in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, ſaith <hi>Virunnius,</hi> by <hi>Gildas</hi> a Britiſh Poet, and him to have liv'd under <hi>Claudius.</hi> Which granted true,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55158:8"/>
adds much to the Antiquitie of this Fable; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Latin Verſes are much better, then for the Age of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> ap-<hi>Arthur,</hi> unleſs perhaps <hi>Joſeph of Exeter,</hi> the only ſmooth Poet of thoſe times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freinded him; in this <hi>Diana</hi> overſhot her Oracle thus ending, <hi>Ipſis totiusterrae ſubditus orbis erit,</hi> That to the race of <hi>Brute</hi> Kings of this Iland, the whole Earth ſhall be ſubject.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Brutus</hi> guided now, as he thought, by divine conduct, ſpeeds him towards the Weſt; and after ſom encounters on the <hi>Afric</hi> ſide, arrives at a place on the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> Sea; where he happ'ns to find the Race of thoſe <hi>Trojans</hi> who with <hi>Antenor</hi> came into <hi>Italy;</hi> and <hi>Corineus</hi> a man much fam'd, was thir Cheif: though by ſurer Authors it be reported, that thoſe <hi>Trojans</hi> with <hi>Antenor,</hi> were ſeated on the other ſide of <hi>Italie,</hi> on the <hi>Adriatic,</hi> not the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> ſhoar. But theſe joyning Company, and paſt the <hi>Herculean Pillars,</hi> at the mouth of <hi>Ligeris in Aquitania</hi> caſt Anchor, Where after ſom diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very made of the place, <hi>Corineus</hi> Hunting nigh the ſhoar with his Men, is by Meſſengers of the King <hi>Goffarius Pictus</hi> mett, and queſtion'd about his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand there. Who not anſwering to thir mind, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,</hi> one of them, lets fly an Arrow at <hi>Corineus,</hi> which he avoiding, ſlaies him: and the <hi>Pictavian</hi> himſelf heerupon levying his whole Force, is over-thrown by <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Corineus;</hi> who with the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell Ax which he was wont to manage againſt the <hi>Tyrrhen Giants</hi> is ſaid to have done marvells. But <hi>Goffarius</hi> having draw'n to his aid the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Gaul,</hi> at that time govern'd by <hi>twelv Kings,</hi> puts his Fortune to a ſecond Trial, Wherin the <hi>Trojans</hi> over-born by multitude, are driv'n back, and beſeigd in thir own Camp, which by good foreſight
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55158:8"/>
was ſtrongly ſituate. Whence <hi>Brutus</hi> unexpectedly iſſuing out, and <hi>Corineus</hi> in the mean while, whoſe device it was, aſſaulting them behind from a Wood, where he had convayd his men the night before: The <hi>Trojans</hi> are again Victors, but with the loſs of <hi>Turon</hi> a Valiant Nefew of <hi>Brutus;</hi> whoſe Aſhes left in that place, gave name to the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> built there by the <hi>Trojans. Brutus</hi> finding now his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers much leſsn'd, and this yet not the place foretold him, leavs <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and with an eaſie courſe, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Totneſs</hi> in <hi>Dev'nſhire,</hi> quickly perceivs heer to be the promis'd end of his labours.</p>
            <p>The Iland not yet <hi>Britain</hi> but <hi>Albion,</hi> was in a manner deſert and inhoſpitable; kept only by a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Giants;</hi> whoſe exceſſive Force and Tyranie had conſum'd the reſt. Them <hi>Brutus</hi> deſtroies, and to his people divides the Land, which with ſom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his own name he thenceforth calls <hi>Britain.</hi> To <hi>Corineus, Cornwal,</hi> as now we call it, fell by Lot; the rather by him lik't, for that the hugeſt Giants, in Rocks and Caves were ſaid to lurk ſtill there; which kind of Monſters to deal with was his old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
            <p>And heer, with leave be-ſpok'n to recite a grand Fable, though dignify'd by our beſt Poets; while <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> on a certain Feſtival day ſolemnly kept on that ſhoar, where he firſt landed, was with the people in great jollity and mirth, a crew of theſe Savages breaking in upon them, began on the ſuddain another ſort of Game then at ſuch a meeting was expected. But at length by many hands overcome, <hi>Goëmagog</hi> the hugeſt, in higth twelv Cubits, is reſerv'd alive; that with him <hi>Corineus,</hi> who deſir'd nothing more, might try his ſtrength; Whom in a Wreſtle the Giant catching aloft, with a terrible hugg broke three
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55158:9"/>
of his Ribs: nevertheleſs <hi>Corineus</hi> enrag'd, heaving him up by main force, and on his Shoulders bearing him to the next high Rock, threw him headlong all ſhatter'd into the Sea, and left his name on the Cliff, call'd ever ſince <hi>Langoëmagog,</hi> which is to ſay, the Giants leap.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Brutus</hi> in a choſen place builds <hi>Troia nova,</hi> chang'd in time to <hi>Trinovantum,</hi> now <hi>London:</hi> and began to enact Laws; <hi>Heli</hi> beeing then high Preiſt in <hi>Judaea:</hi> and having govern'd the whole Ile 24 Years, dy'd, and was buried in his new <hi>Troy.</hi> His three Sons <hi>Locrine, Albanact,</hi> and <hi>Camber</hi> divide the Land by conſent. <hi>Locrine</hi> had the middle part <hi>Loëgria; Camber</hi> poſſeſs'd <hi>Cambria</hi> or <hi>Wales; Albanact Albania,</hi> now <hi>Scotland.</hi> But he in the end by <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns,</hi> who with a Fleet invaded that Land, was ſlain in fight, and his people driv'n back into <hi>Loëgria. Locrine</hi> and his Brother goe out againſt <hi>Humber;</hi> who now marching onward, was by them defeated, and in a River drown'd, which to this day retains his name. Among the ſpoils of his Camp and Navy, were found certain young Maids, and <hi>Eſtrildis,</hi> above the reſt, paſſing fair; the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a <hi>King in Germany;</hi> from whence <hi>Humber,</hi> as he went waſting the Sea-Coaſt, had led her Captive: whom <hi>Locrine,</hi> though before contracted to the Daughter of <hi>Corineus,</hi> reſolvs to marry. But beeing forc'd and threatn'd by <hi>Corineus,</hi> whoſe Autority, and power he fear'd, <hi>Guendolen</hi> the Daughter he yeelds to marry, but in ſecret loves the other: and oft-times retiring as to ſom privat Sacrifice, through Vaults and paſſages made under ground; and ſeven years thus enjoying her, had by her a Daughter equally fair, whoſe name was <hi>Sabra.</hi> But when once his fear was off by the Death of <hi>Corineus,</hi> not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55158:9"/>
content with ſecret enjoyment, divorcing <hi>Guendolen,</hi> he makes <hi>Eſtrildis</hi> now his Queen. <hi>Guendolen</hi> all in rage departs into <hi>Cornwall;</hi> where <hi>Madan,</hi> the Son ſhe had by <hi>Locrine,</hi> was hitherto brought up by <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> his Grandfather. And gathering an Army of her Fathers Friends and Subjects, gives Battail to her Huſband by the River <hi>Sture;</hi> wherein <hi>Locrine</hi> ſhot with an Arrow ends his life. But not ſo ends the fury of <hi>Guendolen;</hi> for <hi>Eſtrildis</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Sabra,</hi> ſhe throws into a River: and to leave a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of revenge, proclaims, that the ſtream be thenceforth call'd after the Damſels name; which by length of time is chang'd now to <hi>Sabrina,</hi> or <hi>Severn.</hi>

            <p>Fifteen Years ſhe governs in behalf of her Son; then reſigning to him at Age, retires to her Fathers Dominion. This ſaith my Author, was in the daies of <hi>Samuel.

            <p>Nor was he better in the ſole poſſeſſion, wherof ſo ill he could endure a Partner, killing his Nobles, and thoſe eſpecially next to ſucceed him; till laſtly giv'n over to unnaturall luſt, in the twentith of his Reigne, hunting in a Foreſt, he was devowr'd by Wolves.</p>

She on the ſame demand ſpares no proteſting, and the Gods muſt witneſs, that otherwiſe to expreſs her thoughts ſhe knew not, but that <hi>ſhe lov'd him above all Creatures;</hi> and ſo receavs an equal reward with her Siſter. But <hi>Cordelia</hi> the youngeſt, though hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beſt belov'd, and now before her Eyes the

rich and preſent hire of a little eaſie ſoothing, the danger alſo, and the loſs likely to betide plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet moves not from the ſolid purpoſe of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and vertuous anſwer. <hi>Father,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>my love towards you, is as my duty bids; what ſhould a Father ſeek, what can a Child promiſe more? they who pretend beyond this, flatter.</hi> When the old man, ſorry to hear this, and wiſhing her to recall thoſe words, perſiſted aſking, with a loiall ſadneſs at her Fathers infirmity, but ſomthing on the ſudden, harſh, and glancing rather at her Siſters, then ſpeaking her own mind, <hi>Two waies only,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>I have to anſwer what you require mee; the former, Your command is, I ſhould recant; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept then this other which is leſt mee; look how much you have, ſo much is your value, and ſo much I love you. Then hear thou,</hi> quoth <hi>Leir</hi> now all in paſſion, <hi>what thy ingratitude hath gain'd thee; becauſe thou haſt not reverenc'd thy aged Father equall to thy Siſters, part in my Kingdom, or what elſe is mine reck'n to have none.</hi> And without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay gives in mariage his other Daughters, <hi>Gonorill</hi> to <hi>Maglaunus</hi> Duke of <hi>Albania, Regan</hi> to <hi>Henni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> with them in preſent half his Kingdom; the reſt to follow at his Death. In the mean while Fame was not ſparing to divulge the wiſdom, and other Graces of <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that <hi>Aganippus a great King in Gaul</hi> (however he came by his Greek name) ſeeks her to Wife, and nothing alter'd at the loſs of her Dowry, receavs her gladly in ſuch manner as ſhe was ſent him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>King Leir,</hi> more and more drooping with Years, became an eaſy prey to his Daughters and thir Huſbands; who now by dayly encroachment had feis'd the whole Kingdom into thir hands: and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55158:11"/>
old King is put to ſojorn with his Eldeſt Daughter, attended only by threeſcore Knights. But they in a ſhort while grudg'd at, as too numerous and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly for continuall Gueſts, are reduc'd to thirty. Not brooking that affront, the old King betakes him to his ſecond Daughter: but there alſo diſcord ſoon ariſing between the Servants of differing Maſters in one Family, five only are ſuffer'd to attend him. Then back again he returns to the other; hoping that ſhe his Eldeſt could not but have more pity on his Gray Hairs: but ſhe now refuſes to admitt him, unleſs he be content with one only of his followers. At laſt the remembrance of his youngeſt <hi>Cordeilla</hi> comes to his thoughts; and now acknowledging how true her words had bin, though with little hope from whom he had ſo injur'd, be it but to pay her the laſt recompence ſhe can have from him, his confeſſion of her wiſe forewarning, that ſo perhaps his miſery, the prooff and experiment of her Wiſdom, might ſomthing ſoft'n her, he takes his Journey into <hi>France.</hi> Now might be ſeen a difference between the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or down-right ſpok'n affection of ſom Children to thir Parents, and the talkative obſequiouſneſs of others; while the hope of Inheritance over-acts them, and on the Tongues end enlarges thir duty. <hi>Cordeilla</hi> out of meer love, without the ſuſpicion of expected reward, at the meſſage only of her Father in diſtreſs, powrs forth true filial tears. And not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during either that her own, or any other Eye ſhould ſee him in ſuch forlorn condition as his Meſſenger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, diſcreetly appoints one of her truſted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, firſt to convay him privately toward ſom good Sea Town, there to array him, bathe him, cheriſh him, furniſh him with ſuch Attendance and State, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55158:12"/>
beſeemd his Dignity. That then, as from his firſt Landing, he might ſend word of his Arrival to her Husband <hi>Aganippus.</hi> Which don with all mature, and requiſite contrivance, <hi>Cordelia</hi> with the King her Huſband, and all the Barony of his Realm, who then firſt had news of his paſſing the Sea, goe out to meet him; and after all honourable and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full entertainment, <hi>Aganippus,</hi> as to his Wives Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Royall Gueſt, ſurrenders him, during his abode there, the power, and diſpoſal of his whole Dominion: permitting his Wife <hi>Cordeilla</hi> to go with an Army, and ſet her Father upon his Throne. Wherin her piety ſo proſper'd, as that ſhe vanquiſh'd her impious Siſters with thoſe Dukes, and <hi>Leir</hi> again, as ſaith the ſtory, three years obtain'd the Crown. To whom dying, <hi>Cordeilla</hi> with all regal Solemnities gave Burial in the Town of <hi>Leiceſtre.</hi> And then as right Heir ſucceeding, and her Huſband dead, rul'd the Land five years in Peace. Untill <hi>Marganus</hi> and <hi>Cunedagius</hi> her two Siſters Sons, not bearing that a Kingdom ſhould be govern'd by a Woman, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableſt time to raiſe that quarrel againſt a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo worthy, make War againſt her, depoſe her, and impriſon her; of which impatient, and now long unexercis'd to ſuffer, ſhe there, as is related, killd her ſelf. The Victors between them part the Land: but <hi>Marganus</hi> the Eldeſt Siſters Son, who held by agreement from the North-ſide of <hi>Humber</hi> to <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> incited by thoſe about him, to invade all as his own right, warres on <hi>Cunedagius;</hi> who ſoon met him, overcame, and overtook him in a Town of <hi>Wales,</hi> where he left his life, and ever ſince his name to the place.</p>
            <p>

Then diſplaying his own Enſignes which before he had conceal'd, and ſending notice
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55158:13"/>
to the other part of his Army what was don, adds to them new courage, and gains a final Victory. This <hi>Dunwallo was the firſt in Britain that wore a Crown of Gold; and therfore by ſom reputed the firſt King.</hi> He eſtabliſhed the <hi>Molmutine</hi> Laws, famous among the Engliſh to this day; writt'n long after in Latine by <hi>Gildas,</hi> and in Saxon by King <hi>Alfred:</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>Geofrey,</hi> but <hi>Gildas</hi> denies to have known aught of the <hi>Britans</hi> before <hi>Caeſar;</hi> much leſs knew <hi>Alfred.</hi> Theſe Laws, whoever made them, beſtow'd on Temples the privilege of Sanctuary; to Cities alſo, and the waies thether leading, yea to Plows granted a kind of like refuge: and made ſuch rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Theeves and Robbers, that all paſſages were ſafe. Forty Years he Govern'd alone, and was buried nigh to <hi>the Temple of Concord;</hi> which he, to the memory of peace reſtor'd, had built in <hi>Trinovant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His two Sons <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brennus</hi> contending about the Crown, by deciſion of Freinds came at length to an accord; <hi>Brennus</hi> to have the North of <hi>Humber, Belinus</hi> the Sovrantie of all. But the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not long ſo contented, that he, as they whiſper'd to him, whoſe valour had ſo oft repell'd the invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Ceulphus the Morine Duke,</hi> ſhould now be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Brother, upon new Deſigne fails into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> enters League and Affinitie with <hi>Elſing</hi> that King; which <hi>Belinus</hi> perceaving, in his abſence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſes him of all the North. <hi>Brennus</hi> with a Fleet of <hi>Norwegians</hi> makes toward <hi>Britain;</hi> but encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by <hi>Guithlac</hi> the <hi>Daniſh King,</hi> who laying claim to his Bride, purſu'd him on the Sea, his haſt was retarded, and he bereſt of his Spouſe: who from the fight by a ſudden Tempeſt, was by the <hi>Daniſh King</hi> driv'n on <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and brought to

               <hi>Belinus.

Bren-Brennus</hi> on the other ſide ſolliciting to his aid the Kings of <hi>Gaul,</hi> happ'ns at laſt on <hi>Seginus Duke of the Allobreges;</hi> where his worth, and comlineſs of perſon wan him the Dukes Daughter and Heir. In whoſe right he ſhortly ſucceeding, and by obtain'd leave paſſing with a great Hoſt through the length of <hi>Gaul,</hi> gets footing once again in <hi>Britain.</hi> Nor was <hi>Belinus</hi> unprepar'd, and now the Battell ready to joyn, <hi>Conuvenna</hi> the Mother of them both all in a fright, throws her ſelf between; and calling ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to <hi>Brennus</hi> her Son, whoſe abſence had ſo long depriv'd her of his ſight, after imbracements and teares, aſſails him with ſuch a motherly power, and the mention of things ſo dear and reverend, as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly wrung from him all his enmity againſt <hi>Belinus.</hi>

            <p>Then are hands joyn'd, reconciliation made firm, and Counſel held to turn thir united preparations on Foren parts.

So far from home I undertake not for the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Chronicle;</hi> which heer againſt the ſtream of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory carries up and down theſe Brethren, now into <hi>Germany,</hi> then again to <hi>Rome,</hi> purſuing <hi>Gabius</hi> and <hi>Porſena,</hi> two unheard of Conſuls. Thus much is more generally beleev'd, that both this <hi>Brennus,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther famous Captain, <hi>Britomarus,</hi> whom the Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt <hi>Florus</hi> and others mention, were not <hi>Gauls</hi> but <hi>Britans;</hi> the name of the firſt in that Tongue ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying a King, and of the other a Great <hi>Britan.</hi> However <hi>Belinus</hi> after a while returning home, the reſt of his daies rul'd in Peace, Wealth, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour above all his Predeceſſors; building ſom Cities, of which one was <hi>Caeroſe</hi> upon <hi>Oſca,</hi> ſince <hi>Caerlegion;</hi> beautifying others, as <hi>Trinovant</hi> with a Gate, a Hav'n, and a Towr, on the Thames, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet his name; on the top wherof his Aſhes are ſaid to have bin laid up in a Golden Urne.</p>
            <p>After him <hi>Gurguntius Barbirus</hi> was King, mild and juſt, but yet inheriting his Fathers Courage, he ſubdu'd the <hi>Dacian,</hi> or <hi>Dane,</hi> who refus'd to pay the Tribute Covnanted to <hi>Belinus</hi> for his enlargement.

Inſtitution of Laws. Which <hi>King Alfred</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting call'd <hi>Marchen Leage,</hi> but more truly therby is meant, the Mertian Law; not tranſlated by <hi>Alfred,</hi> but digeſted or incorporated with the Weſt-Saxon. In the minority of her Son ſhe had the rule, and then, as may be ſuppos'd, brought forth theſe Laws, not her ſelf, for Laws are Maſculin Births, but by the advice of her ſageſt Counſelors; and therin ſhe might doe vertuouſly, ſince it befell her to ſupply the nonage of her Son: elſe nothing more awry from the Law of God and Nature, then that a Woman ſhould give Laws to Men.</p>
            <p>Hir Son <hi>Siſilius</hi> comming to Yeares receav'd the Rule; then in order <hi>Kimarus,</hi> then <hi>Danius</hi> or <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his Brother. Then <hi>Morindus,</hi> his Son by <hi>Tangueſtela</hi> a Concubine, who is recorded a man of exceſſive Strength, Valiant, Liberal, and fair of Aſpect, but immanely Cruell; not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his Anger, Enemy, or Freind, if any Weapon were in his hand. A certain <hi>King of the Morines,</hi> or <hi>Picards</hi> invaded <hi>Northumberland;</hi> whoſe Army this King, though not wanting ſufficient numbers, cheifly by his own proweſs overcame: But diſhonour'd his Victory by the cruel uſage of his Priſners, whom his own hands, or others in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence put all to ſeveral Deaths: well fitted to ſuch a beſtiall Cruelty was his end; for hearing of a huge Monſter that from the Iriſh Sea infeſted the Coaſt, and in the Pride of his Strength fooliſhly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſet manly valour againſt a Brute vaſtneſs, when his Weapons were all in vain, by that horrible mouth he was catch't up and devour'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gorbonian</hi> the Eldeſt of his five Sons, then whom a Juſter man liv'd not in his Age, was a great builder
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55158:15"/>
of Temples, and gave to all what was thir due; to his Gods devout Worſhip, to men of deſert honour and preferment, to the Commons encouragement in thir Labours, and Trades, defence and protection from injuries and oppreſſions, ſo that the Land flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd above her Neighbours, Violence and Wrong ſeldom was heard of: his Death was a general loſs: he was buried in <hi>Trinovant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archigallo</hi> the ſecond Brother follow'd not his Example; but depreſs'd the ancient Nobility, and by peeling the wealthier ſort, ſtuff'd his Treaſury, and took the right way to be depos'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elidure</hi> the next Brother, ſurnam'd the Pious, was ſet up in his place; a mind ſo noble, and ſo moderat, as almoſt is incredible to have bin ever found. For having held the Scepter five Years, hunting one day in the Foreſt of <hi>Calater,</hi> he chanc'd to meet his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Brother, wandring in mean condition: who had bin long in vain beyond the Seas, importuning Foren aides to his Reſtorement: and was now in a poor Habit, with only ten followers, privatly return'd to find ſubſiſtence among his ſecret freinds. At the unexpected ſight of him, <hi>Elidure</hi> himſelf alſo then but thinly accompanied, runns to him with open Arms; and after many dear and ſincere welcomings, convaines him to the Citty <hi>Alclud;</hi> there hides him in his own Bed-Chamber. Afterwards faining himſelf ſick, ſummons all his Peers as about greateſt affairs; where admitting them one by one, as if his weakneſs endur'd not the diſturbance of more at once, cauſes them willing, or unwilling, once more to ſwear Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to <hi>Archigallo.</hi> Whom after reconciliation made on all ſides, he leads to <hi>York;</hi> and from his own Head, places the Crown on the Head of his Brother.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55158:15"/>
Who thenceforth, Vice it ſelf diſſolving in him, and forgetting her firmeſt hold with the admiration of a deed ſo Heroic, became a true converted man; rul'd worthily 10 Years; dy'd, and was Buried in <hi>Caerleir.</hi> Thus was a Brother ſav'd by a Brother, to whom love of a Crown, the thing that ſo often da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles, and vitiats mortal men, for which, thouſands of neereſt blood have deſtroy'd each other, was in reſpect of Brotherly dearneſs, a contemptible thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elidure</hi> now in his own behalf re-aſſumes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and did as was worthy ſuch a man to doe.

            <head>THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN. The Second Book.</head>
            <p>I Am now to write of what befell the <hi>Britans</hi> from <hi>fifty and three years before the Birth of our Saviour,</hi> when firſt the <hi>Romans</hi> came in, till the decay and ceaſing of that Empire; a ſtory of much truth, and for the firſt hunderd years and ſomwhat more, collected without much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. So many and ſo prudent were the Writers, which thoſe two, the civileſt, and the wiſeſt of <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean Nations,</hi> both <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> afforded to the actions of that Puiſſant Citty. For worthy deeds are not often deſtitute of worthy relaters: as by a certain Fate great Acts and great Eloquence have moſt commonly gon hand in hand, equalling and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring

each other in the ſame Ages. 'Tis true that in obſcureſt times, by ſhallow and unſkilfull Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the indiſtinct noiſe of many Battels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations, of many Kingdoms over-run and loſt, hath come to our Eares. For what wonder, if in all Ages, Ambition and the love of rapine hath ſtirr'd up greedy and violent men to bold attempts in waſting and ruining Warrs, which to poſterity have left the work of Wild Beaſts and Deſtroyers, rather then the Deeds and Monuments of men and Conquerours. But he whoſe juſt and true valour uſes the neceſſity of Warr and Dominion, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy but to prevent deſtruction, to bring in liberty againſt Tyrants, Law and Civility among barbarous Nations, knowing that when he Conquers all things elſe, he cannot Conquer <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Detraction,</hi> wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcious of this his want as well as of his worth not to be forgott'n or conceal'd, honours and hath recourſe to the aid of Eloquence, his freindlieſt and beſt ſupply; by whoſe immortal Record his noble deeds, which elſe were tranſitory, becoming fixt and durable againſt the force of Yeares and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he fails not to continue through all Poſterity, over <hi>Envy, Death,</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> alſo victorious. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the eſteem of Science, and liberal ſtudy waxes low in the Common-wealth, wee may preſume that alſo there all civil Vertue, and worthy action is grown as low to a decline: and then Eloquence, as it were conſorted in the ſame deſtiny, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and fall of vertue corrupts alſo and fades; at leaſt reſignes her office of relating to illiterat and frivolous Hiſtorians; ſuch as the perſons themſelvs both deſerv, and are beſt pleas'd with; whilſt they want either the underſtanding to chooſe better, or the innocence to dare invite the examining, and

they crave pardon. <hi>Caeſar</hi> complaining they had firſt ſought peace, and then without cauſe had begun War, yet content to pardon them, commands Hoſtages: wherof part they bring in ſtrait, others farr up in the Country to be ſent for, they promiſe in a few daies. Mean while the people diſbanded and ſent home, many Princes, and cheif men from all parts of the Ile ſubmit themſelves and thir Citties to the diſpoſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who lay then encamp'd, as is thought, on <hi>Baram down.</hi> Thus had the <hi>Britans</hi> made thir peace; when ſuddenly an accident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd for put new counſels into thir minds. Fowr daies after the coming of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> thoſe 18 Ships of burden, which from the upper hav'n had tak'n in all the <hi>Roman Horſe,</hi> born with a ſoft wind to the very Coaſt, in ſight of the <hi>Roman Camp,</hi> were by a ſudden tempeſt ſcatter'd, and driv'n back, ſome to the Port from whence they loos'd, others down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Weſt Country; who finding there no ſafety either to land, or to caſt Anchor, choſe rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelvs again to the troubl'd Sea; and as <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> reports, were moſt of them caſt away. The ſame night, it being full Moon, the Gallies left upon dry Land, were unaware to the Romans, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a Spring-tide, and the greater Ships that lay off at Anchor, torn and beat'n with Waves, to the great perplexity of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and his whole Army; who now had neither Shipping left to convay them back, nor any proviſion made to ſtay heer, intending to have winter'd in <hi>Gallia.</hi> All this the <hi>Britans</hi> well perceaving, and by the compaſs of his Camp, which without baggage appear'd the ſmaller, gueſſing at his numbers, conſult together, and one by one ſlily withdrawing from the Camp, where they were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the concluſion of a peace, reſolve to ſtop all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55158:21"/>
and to draw out the buſineſs till Winter. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> though ignorant of what they intended, yet from the condition wherin he was, and thir other hoſtages not ſent, ſuſpecting what was likely, begins to provide apace, all that might be, againſt what might happ'n: laies in Corn, and with materials fetch'd from the Continent, and what was left of thoſe Ships which were paſt help, he repairs the reſt. So that now by the inceſſant labour of his Souldiers, all but twelv were again made ſerviceable. While theſe things are doing, one of the Legions being ſent out to forrage, as was accuſtom'd, and no ſuſpicion of Warr, while ſom of the <hi>Britans</hi> were remaining in the Country about, others alſo going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely to the <hi>Roman Quarters,</hi> they who were in ſtation at the Camp Gates ſent ſpeedy word to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that from that part of the Country, to which the Legion went, a greater duſt then uſual was ſeen to riſe. <hi>Caeſar</hi> gueſſing the matter, commands the Cohorts of Guard to follow him thether, two others to ſucceed in thir ſtead, the reſt all to arm and follow. They had not march'd long, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſcerns his Legion ſore overcharg'd: for the <hi>Britans</hi> not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that thir Enemies on the morrow, would be in that place which only they had left unreap'd of all thir Harveſt, had plac'd an Ambuſh; and while they were diſperſt and buſieſt at thir labour, ſet upon them, kill'd ſom, and routed the reſt. The manner of thir fight was from a kind of Chariots; wherin riding about, and throwing Darts, with the clutter of thir Horſe, and of thir Wheels, they oft-times broke the rank of thir Enemies; then retreating among the Horſe, and quitting thir Chariots, they fought on Foot. The Charioters in the mean while ſomwhat aſide from the Battell, ſet themſelvs in ſuch order,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55158:22"/>
that thir Maiſters at any time oppreſs'd with odds, might retire ſafely thether, having perform'd with one perſon both the nimble ſervice of a Horſe-man, and the ſtedfaſt duty of a Foot Souldier. So much they could with thir Chariots by uſe, and exerciſe, as riding on the ſpeed down a ſteep Hill, to ſtop ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and with a ſhort rein turn ſwiftly, now run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the beam, now on the Yoke, then in the Seat. With this ſort of new ſkirmiſhing, the <hi>Romans</hi> now overmatch'd, and terrify'd, <hi>Caeſar</hi> with opportune aid appears; for then the <hi>Britans</hi> make a ſtand: but he conſidering that now was not fitt time to offer Battell, while his men were ſcarce recover'd of ſo late a fear, only keeps his ground, and ſoon after leads back his Legions to the Camp. Furder action for many days following was hinder'd on both ſides by foul weather; in which time the <hi>Britans</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meſſengers round about, to how few the <hi>Romans</hi> were reduc'd, what hope of priſe and booty, and now if ever of freeing themſelvs from the fear of like invaſions heerafter by making theſe an example, if they could but now uncamp thir Enemies, at this intimation multitudes of Horſe and Foot coming down from all parts make towards the Romans. <hi>Caeſar</hi> foreſeeing that the <hi>Britans</hi> though beat'n and put to flight would eaſily evade his Foot, yet with no more than 30 Horſe, which <hi>Comius</hi> had brought over, draws out his men to Battell, puts again the <hi>Britans</hi> to flight, pourſues with ſlaughter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning burns and laies waſte all about. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Embaſſadors the ſame day being ſent from the <hi>Britans</hi> to deſire peace, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as his affairs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtood, for ſo great a breach of Faith, only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes on them double the former hoſtages, to be ſent after him into <hi>Gallia:</hi> And becauſe <hi>September</hi> was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55158:22"/>
nigh half ſpent, a ſeaſon not fit to tempt the Sea with his weather-beat'n Fleet, the ſame night with a fair wind he departs towards <hi>Belgia;</hi> whether two only of the <hi>Britan</hi> Citties ſent Hoſtages, as they promis'd, the reſt neglected. But at <hi>Rome</hi> when the news came of <hi>Caeſars</hi> acts here, whether it were eſteem'd a Conqueſt, or a fair Eſcape, ſupplication of 20 days is decreed by the Senate, as either for an exploit done, or a diſcovery made, wherin both <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> gloried not a little, though it brought no benefit either to him, or the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The Winter following, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as his cuſtom was, <note place="margin">Dion.</note> going into <hi>Italy,</hi> when as he ſaw that moſt of the <hi>Britans</hi> regarded not to ſend thir Hoſtages, appoints <note place="margin">Caeſar Com. 5.</note> his Legats whom he left in <hi>Belgia,</hi> to provide what poſſible Shipping they could either build, or repair. Low built they were to bee, as therby eaſier both to fraught, and to hale aſhoar; nor needed to be higher, becauſe the Tyde ſo often changing, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to make the Billows leſs in our Sea then thoſe in the Mediterranean: broader likewiſe they were made, for the better tranſporting of Horſes, and all other fraughtage, being intended cheifly to that end. Theſe all about 600. in a readineſs, with 28 Ships of burden, and what with adventurers, and other hulks above 200, <hi>Cotta</hi> one of the Legates wrote them, as <hi>Athaeneus</hi> affirms, in all 1000, <hi>Caeſar</hi> from Port <hi>Iccius,</hi> a paſſage of ſom 30 mile over, leaving behind him <hi>Labienus</hi> to guard the hav'n, and for other ſupply at need, with five Legions, though but 2000 Horſe, about ſun ſett hoyſing ſaile with a ſlack South-Weſt, at midnight was becalm'd. And finding when it was light, that the whole Navy lying on the current, had fal'n of from the Ile, which now they could

deſcry on thir left hand, by the unwearied labour of his Souldiers, who refus'd not to tugg the Oare, and kept courſe with Ships under ſayl, he bore up as neer as might bee, to the ſame place where he had landed the yeer before; where about noon arriving, <label type="milestone">

Morning <hi>Caeſar</hi> had but newly ſent out his men in three bodies to pourſue, and the laſt no furder gon then yet in ſight, when Horſemen all in Poſte from <hi>Quintus Artrius</hi> bring word to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that almoſt all his Ships in a Tempeſt that night had ſuffer'd wrack, and lay brok'n upon the ſhoar. <hi>Caeſar</hi> at this news recalls his Legions, himſelf in all haſt riding back to the Sea-ſide, beheld with his own Eyes the ruinous proſpect. About forty Veſſels were ſunk and loſt, the reſidue ſo torn, and ſhak'n as not to be new rigg'd without much labour.

Of the Romans that day was ſlain <hi>Quintus Laberius Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> a Tribune: the <hi>Britans</hi> having fought thir fill at the very entrance of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Camp, and ſuſtain'd the reſiſtance of his whole Army entrench'd, gave over the aſſault. <hi>Caeſar</hi> heer acknowledges that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> way both of arming, and of fighting, was not ſo well fitted againſt this kind of Enemy; for that the Foot in heavy Armour could not follow thir cunning flight, and durſt not by ancient Diſcipline ſtirr from thir Enſigne; and the Horſe alone, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd from the Legions, againſt a foe that turn'd ſuddenly upon them with a mixt encounter both of Horſe and Foot, were in equall danger both follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and retiring.

This having learnt by ſuch as were tak'n, or had run to him, he firſt commands his Horſe to paſs over; then his Foot, who wadeing up to the neck went on ſo reſolutely, and ſo faſt, that they on the furder ſide not enduring the violence, retreated and fled. <hi>Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belan</hi> noe more now in hope to contend for Victorie, diſmiſſing all but 4000. of thoſe Charioters, through Woods, and intricate waies attends thir motion; where the <hi>Romans</hi> are to paſs, drives all before him; and with continuall ſallies upon the Horſe, where they leaſt expected, cutting off ſome and terrifying others, compells them ſoe cloſe together, as gave them no leave to fetch in prey or bootie without ill ſucceſs.

In order came firſt the Kings Servants, bearing his Trophies won in other Warrs, next, his Brothers, Wife, and Daughter, laſt himſelf. The behaviour of others through fear was low and degenerate: he only neither in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, word, or action, ſubmiſſive ſtanding at the Tribunal of <hi>Claudius,</hi> briefly ſpake to this purpoſe. <hi>If my mind,</hi> Caeſar, <hi>had bin as moderate in the highth of Fortune, as my Birth and Dignitie was eminent, I might have come a friend rather then a Captive into this Cittie. Nor couldſt thou have diſlik'd him for a confederate, ſo noble of deſcent, and ruling ſo many Nations. My preſent eſtate to me diſgracefull, to thee is glorious. I had Riches, Horſes, Armes, and men; no wonder then if I contended, not to looſe them. But if by Fate, yours only muſt be Empire, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie ours among the reſt muſt be ſubjection. If I ſooner had bin brought to yeild, my misfortune had bin leſs notorious, your Conqueſt had bin leſs renown'd; and in your ſevereſt determining of me, both will be ſoon forgott'n. But if you grant that I ſhall live, by me will live to you for ever that praiſe which is ſo neer divine, the clemency of a Conquerour. Caeſar</hi> mov'd at ſuch a ſpectacle of Fortune, but eſpecially at the nobleneſs of his bearing it, gave him pardon, and to all the reſt. They all unbound, ſubmiſſely thank him, and did like reverence to <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Emperors Wife, who ſat by in State: a new and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſight to the manly Eyes of <hi>Romans,</hi> a Woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſitting public in her Female pride among En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and Armed Cohorts. To <hi>Oſtorius</hi> Tryumph is decreed; and his acts eſteem'd equall to theirs, that brought in Bonds to <hi>Rome</hi> famouſeſt Kings. But the ſame proſperitie attended not his later

actions heer. For the <hi>Silures,</hi> whether to reveng thir loſs of <hi>Caractacus,</hi> or that they ſaw <hi>Oſtorius,</hi> as if now all were done, leſs earneſt to reſtrain them, beſett the Prefect of his Camp, left there with Legionarie Bands to appoint Garriſons: and had not ſpeedie aid com in from the neighbouring Holds and Caſtles, had cutt them all off; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, the <hi>Praefect with 8 Centurions,</hi> and many thir ſtoubteſt men were ſlaine: and upon the neck of this, meeting firſt with <hi>Roman</hi> Forragers, then with other Troops haſting to thir relief, utterly foyl'd and broke them alſo. <hi>Oſtorius</hi> ſending more after, could hardly ſtay thir flight; till the waighty Legions coming on, at firſt poys'd the Battel, at length turn'd the Scale: to the <hi>Britans</hi> without much loſs; for by that time it grew night. Then was the Warr ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd as it were into ſmall frayes and bickerings; not unlike ſometimes to ſo many robberies, in Woods, at Waters, as chance or valour, advice or raſhneſs led them on, commanded or without command. That which moſt exaſperated the <hi>Silures,</hi> was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of certaine words caſt out by the <hi>Emperor, that he would root them out to the verie name.</hi> Therefore two Cohorts more of Auxiliars, by the avarice of thir Leaders too ſecurely pillageing, they quite inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: and beſtowing liberally the Spoils and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whereof they took plentie; drew other Countries to joyne with them. Theſe loſſes falling ſo thick upon the <hi>Romans, Oſtorius</hi> with the thought, and anguiſh thereof ended his daies: the <hi>Britans</hi> rejoycing, although no Battel, that yet adverſe Warr had worne out ſo great a Souldier. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his place ordaines <hi>Aulus Didius:</hi> but ere his coming, though much haſtn'd, that the Province might not want a Governour; the <hi>Silures</hi> had giv'n an over-throw

to <hi>Manlius Valens</hi> with his Legion, rumor'd on both ſides greater then was true, by <hi>the Silures</hi> to amate the new Generall; by him in a double reſpect, of the more praiſe if he queld them, or the more excuſe if he fail'd. Meane time the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures</hi> forgett not to infeſt the <hi>Roman</hi> pale with wide excurſions; till <hi>Didius</hi> marching out, kept them ſomwhat more within bounds. Nor were they long to ſeek, who after <hi>Caractacus</hi> ſhould lead them; for next to him in worth and ſkill of Warr, <hi>Venutius a Prince of the Brigantes</hi> merited to be thir chief. He at firſt faithfull to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, was the Huſband of <hi>Cartiſmandua Q. of the Brigantes,</hi> himſelf perhaps reigning elſewhere. She who had betray'd <hi>Caractacus</hi> and her Countrie to adorne the Tryumph of <hi>Claudius,</hi> thereby grown powerfull and gratious with the <hi>Romans,</hi> preſuming on the hire of her treaſon, deſerted her Huſband; and marrying <hi>Vellocatus</hi> one of his Squires, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs on him the Kingdome alſo. This deed ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and full of infamie, diſturb'd the whole State: <hi>Venutius</hi> with other Forces, and the help of her own Subjects, who deteſted the example of ſo foule a fact, and with all the uncomelineſs of thir Subjection to the Monarchie of a Woeman, a peece of manhood not every day to be found among <hi>Britans,</hi> though ſhee had got by ſuttle train his Brother with many of his kindred into her hands, brought her ſoon below the confidence of beeing able to reſiſt longer. When imploring the <hi>Roman</hi> aid, with much adoe, and after many a hard encounter ſhe eſcap'd the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which was readie to have ſeis'd her. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> thus debar'd the authority of ruling his own Houſhold, juſtly turnes his anger againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves; whoſe magnanimitie not wont to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55158:32"/>
diſhonorable cauſes, had arrogantly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddl'd in his domeſtic affaires, to uphold the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belion of an adultreſs againſt her Huſband. And the Kingdome he retain'd againſt thir utmoſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and of Warr gave them thir fill: firſt in a ſharpe conflict of uncertaine event, then againſt the Legion of <hi>Caeſius Naſica.</hi> Inſomuch that <hi>Didius</hi> growing old and mannageing the Warr by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had worke anough to ſtand on his defence, with the gaining now and then of a ſmall Caſtle.

               <hi>Nero</hi> (for in that part of the <hi>Ile</hi> things continu'd in the ſame plight to the Reigne of <hi>Veſpatian)</hi> was minded but for ſhame to have withdrawn the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Forces out of <hi>Britain:</hi> In other parts whereof, about the ſame time, other things befell. <hi>Verannius,</hi> whom <hi>Nero</hi> ſent hither to ſucceed <hi>Didius,</hi> dying in his firſt Year, ſave a few inrodes upon the <hi>Silures,</hi> left only a great boaſt behind him, <hi>that in two years, had he liv'd, he would have Conquerd all.</hi> But <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Paulinus,</hi> who next was ſent hither, eſteem'd a Souldier equall to the beſt in that age, for two years together went on proſperouſly; both confirming what was got, and ſubdueing onward.

Thick upon the ſhoar ſtood ſeveral groſs bands of men well weapn'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women like furies running to and fro in diſmal habit with hair looſe about thir ſhoulders, held

Torches in thir hands. The <hi>Druids,</hi> thoſe were thir Prieſts, of whome more in another place, with hands lift up to Heav'n uttering direfull praiers, aſtoniſh'd the <hi>Romans;</hi> who at ſo ſtrange a ſight ſtood in a-maze though wounded: at length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd and encourag'd by thir Generall, not to feare a barbarous and lunatic rout, fall on, and beat them down ſcorch't and rouling in thir own fire. Then were they yoak'd with Garriſons, and the places conſecrate to thir bloodie ſuperſtitions deſtroi'd. For whom they took in Warr they held it lawfull to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and by the entrails of men us'd divination. While thus <hi>Paulinus</hi> had his thought ſtill fix'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to goe on winning, his back lay broad op'n to occaſion of looſing more behind. For the <hi>Britans</hi> urg'd and oppreſs'd with many unſufferable injuries, had all banded themſelves to a generall revolt. The particular cauſes are not all writt'n by one Author; <hi>Tacitus</hi> who liv'd next thoſe times of any to us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, writes that <hi>Praſutagus King of the Icenians</hi> abounding in wealth had left <hi>Caeſar</hi> Coheir with his two Daughters; thereby hopeing to have ſecur'd from all wrong both his Kingdom and his Houſe; which fell out farr otherwiſe. For under colour to overſee and take poſſeſſion of the Emperors new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, his Kingdome became a prey to Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, his Houſe to rav'ning Officers, his Wife <hi>Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> violated with ſtripes, his Daughters with Rape, the wealthieſt of his Subjects, as it were by the will and teſtament of thir King thrown out of thir Eſtates, his kindred made little better then ſlaves. The new Colony alſo at <hi>Camalodunum</hi> took Houſe or Land from whome they pleas'd; terming them Slaves and Vaſſals; the Souldiers complying with the Colony, out of hope hereafter to uſe the ſame
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55158:33"/>
licence themſelves. Moreover the Temple erected to <hi>Claudius</hi> as a badge of thir eternal ſlaverie, ſtood a great Eye ſore; the Prieſts whereof under pretext of what was due to the religious ſervice, waſted and imbezl'd each mans ſubſtance upon themſelves. And <hi>Catus Decianus</hi> the Procurator endeavour'd to <note place="margin">Dion.</note> bring all thir goods within the compaſs of a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation, by diſavowing the remittment of <hi>Claudius.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Books a Philoſopher, having drawn the <hi>Britans</hi> unwillingly to borrow of him vaſt ſumms upon faire promiſes of eaſy loan, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment to take thir own time, on a ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells them to pay in all at once with great extortion. Thus provock't by heavieſt ſufferings, and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by opportunities in the abſence of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> the <hi>Icenians,</hi> and by their Example the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> and as many elſe as hated ſervitude, riſe up in Armes. Of theſe enſueing troubles many foregoing ſignes appear'd: the image of Victorie at <hi>Camalodunum</hi> fell down of it ſelf with her face turn'd as it were to the <hi>Britans;</hi> certaine women in a kind of ecſtaſie foretold of calamities to come; in the Counſel-Houſe were heard by night barbarous noiſes, in the Theater hideous howlings, in the Creek horrid ſights betok'ning the deſtruction of that Colony; heerto the Ocean ſeeming of a bloody hew, and human ſhapes at a low ebb, left imprinted on the ſand, wrought in the <hi>Britans</hi> new courage, in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> unwonted feares. <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſeated themſelves to dwell pleaſantly, rather then defenſively, was not fortifi'd: againſt that therefore the <hi>Britans</hi> make firſt aſſault. The Souldiers with in were not very many. <hi>Decianus</hi> the Procurator could ſend them but 200, thoſe ill arm'd: and through the treachery of ſome among them,

But conſidering the ſmallneſs of his numbers, and the late raſhneſs of <hi>Petilius,</hi> he chooſes rather with the loſs of one Town to ſave the reſt.

The <hi>Britans</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies and Squadrons were every where ſhouting and ſwarming, ſuch a multitude as at other time never; no leſs reckon'd then 200 and 30 thouſand, ſo feirce and confident of Victorie, that thir Wives alſo came in Waggons to ſit and behold the ſport, as they made full account, of killing <hi>Romans:</hi> a folly doubtleſs for the ſerious <hi>Romans</hi> to ſmile at, as a ſure tok'n of proſpering that day: a Woeman alſo was thir Commander in Chief. For <hi>Boadicea</hi> and her Daughters ride about in a Chariot, telling the tall Champions as a great encouragement, that with the <hi>Britans</hi> it was uſual for Woemen to be thir Leaders. A deal of other fondneſs they put into her mouth, not worth recital; how ſhe was laſh'd, how her Daughters were handl'd, things worthier ſilence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirment, and a Vail, then for a Woeman to repeat, as don to hir own perſon, or to hear repeated before an hoſt of men. <hi>The Greek Hiſtorian</hi> ſetts her in the <note place="margin">Dion.</note> field on a high heap of Turves, in a looſe-bodied Gown declaming, a Spear in her hand, a Hare in her boſome, which after a long circumlocution ſhe was to let ſlip among them for lucks ſake, then praying to <hi>Andate the Britiſh Goddeſs,</hi> to talk again as fondly as

And this they do out of a vanity, hoping to embelliſh and ſet out thir Hiſtorie with the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our manners, not careing in the mean while to brand us with the rankeſt note of Barbariſm, as if in <hi>Britain</hi> Woemen were Men, and Men Woemen. I affect not ſet ſpeeches in a Hiſtorie, unleſs known for certain to have bin ſo ſpok'n in effect as they are writ'n, nor then, unleſs worth rehearſal; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch, though eloquently, as ſome Hiſtorians have done, is an abuſe of poſteritie, raiſing, in them that read, other conceptions of thoſe times and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then were true.

Hitherto what we have heard of <hi>Caſſibelan, Togadumnus, Venuſius,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractacus</hi> hath bin full of magnanimitie, ſoberneſs, and martial ſkill: but the truth is, that in this Battel, and whole buſineſs, the <hi>Britans</hi> never more plainly manifeſted themſelves to be right <hi>Barbarians;</hi> no rule, no foreſight, no forecaſt, experience or eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either of themſelves or of thir Enemies; ſuch confuſion, ſuch impotence, as ſeem'd likeſt not to a Warr, but to the wild hurrey of a diſtracted Woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with as mad a Crew at her heeles. Therefore <hi>Suetonius</hi> contemning thir unruly noiſes, and fierce looks, heart'ns his men but to ſtand cloſe a while, and ſtrike manfully this headleſs rabble that ſtood neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the reſt would be a purchaſe, rather then a toil. And ſo it fell out; for the Legion, when they ſaw thir time, burſting out like a violent wedge, quickly broke and diſſipated what oppos'd them; all elſe held only out thir necks to the ſlayer, for thir own Carts and Waggons were ſo plac'd by themſelves, as left them but little room to eſcape between.

But by farr not ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous was <hi>Agricola</hi> in bringing Warr to a ſpeedie end, as in cutting off the cauſes from whence Warr ariſes. For he knowing that the end of Warr was not to make way for injuries in peace, began reformation from his own houſe; permitted not his attendants and followers to ſway, or have to doe at all in public affairs: laies on with equallitie the proportions of corn and tribute that were impos'd; takes off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and the Fees of encroaching Officers, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier then the tribute it ſelf.

formerly bin known for many Ages. But wantonneſs and luxury, the wonted companions of plenty, grow up as faſt, and with them, if <hi>Gildas</hi> deſerve belief, all other vices incident to human corruption. That which he notes eſpecially to be the chief perverting of all good in the Land, and ſo continued in his days, was the hatred of truth, and all ſuch as durſt appear to vindicate and maintain it. Againſt them, as againſt the only diſturbers, all the malice of the Land was bent. Lies and falſities, and ſuch as could beſt invent them, were only in requeſt. Evil was embrac'd for good, wickedneſs honour'd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd as virtue. And this quality thir valour had, againſt a foren Enemy to be ever backward and heartleſs; to civil broils eager and prompt. In matters of Government, and the ſearch of truth, weak and ſhallow, in falſhood and wicked deeds pregnant and induſtrious. Pleaſing to God, or not pleaſing, with them weighed alike; and the worſe moſt an end was the weightier. All things were done contrary to public welfare and ſafety; nor on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſecular men, for the Clergy alſo, whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſhould have guided others, were as vitious and corrupt. Many of them beſotted with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual drunkenneſs; or ſwoln with pride and willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, full of contention, full of envy, indiſcreet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Judges to determine what in the practice of life is good or evil, what lawful or unlawful. Thus furniſh'd with judgment, and for manners thus qualifi'd both Prieſt and Lay, they agree to chuſe them ſeveral Kings of thir own; as neer as might be, likeſt themſelves; and the words of my Author im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as much.

the truth, put to death by thir anointers, to ſet up others more fierce and proud.

But <hi>Vortigern</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever coming to reign, is decipher'd by truer ſtories a proud unfortunate Tyrant, and yet of the people much belov'd, becauſe his vices ſorted ſo well with theirs. For neither was he skill'd in Warr, nor wiſe in Counſel, but covetous, luſtful, luxurious, and prone to all vice; waſting the public Treaſure in gluttony and riot, careleſs of the common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and through a haughty ignorance, unapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of his own. Nevertheleſs importun'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd at length by unuſual clamours of the people, he ſummons a general Council, to provide ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means than heertofore had been us'd againſt theſe continual annoyances from the North.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55158:66"/>
but civil and unjuſt War. They puniſh rigorouſly them that rob by the high way; but thoſe grand Robbers that ſit with them at Table, they honour and reward. They give alms largly, but in the face of thir Alms-deeds, pile up wickedneſs to a far higher heap.

Nothing better were the Clergy, but at the ſame paſs or rather worſe, then when the <hi>Saxons</hi> came firſt in; Unlerned, Unapprehenſive, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent; ſuttle Prowlers, Paſtors in Name, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Wolves; intent upon all occaſions, not to feed the Flock, but to pamper and well line themſelves: not call'd, but ſeiſing on the Miniſtry as a Trade, not as a Spiritual Charge: teaching the people, not by ſound Doctrin, but by evil Example: uſurping the Chair of <hi>Peter,</hi> but through the blindneſs of thir own worldly luſts, they ſtumble upon the Seat of <hi>Judas:</hi> deadly haters of truth, broachers of lies: looking on the poor Chriſtian with Eyes of Pride and Contempt; but fawning on the wickedeſt rich men without ſhame: great promoters of other mens Alms with thir ſet exhortations; but themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing ever leaſt; ſlightly touching the many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Age, but preaching without end thir own greivances, as don to Chriſt; ſeeking after prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and degrees in the Church more then after Heav'n; and ſo gain'd, make it thir whole ſtudy how to keep them by any Tyranny. Yet leſt they ſhould be thought things of no uſe in thir eminent places, they have thir niceties and trivial points to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55158:67"/>
keep in aw the ſuperſtitious multitude; but in true ſaving knowledge leave them ſtill as groſs and ſtupid as themſelves; bunglers at the Scripture, nay forbidding and ſilencing them that know; but in worldly matters, practis'd and cunning Shifters; in that only art and ſymony, great Clercs and Maiſters, bearing thir heads high, but thir thoughts abject and low. He taxes them alſo as gluttonous, incontinent, and daily Drunkards. And what ſhouldſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from theſe, poor Laity, ſo he goes on, theſe beaſts, all belly? ſhall theſe amend thee, who are themſelves laborious in evil doings? ſhalt thou ſee with their Eyes, who ſee right forward nothing but gain?

But what avail'd it <hi>Eli</hi> to be himſelf blameleſs, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niv'd at others that were abominable? who of them hath bin envi'd for his better life? who of them hath hated to conſort with theſe, or withſtood thir entring the Miniſtry, or endeavour'd zealouſly thir caſting out?

Wherby it came to paſs, that ſo fair a Victory came to nothing. Towns and Citties were not reinhabited, but lay ruin'd and waſt; nor was it long ere domeſtic War breaking out, waſted them more.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55158:67"/>
Tyrannical and bloody King, polluted alſo with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Adulteries: he got into his power, two young Princes of the Blood Royal, uncertain whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in right, or otherwiſe ſuſpected: and after ſolemn Oath giv'n of thir ſafety the year that <hi>Gildas</hi> wrote, ſlew them with thir two Governours in the Church, and in thir Mothers Arms, through the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots Coap, which he had thrown over them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the revernce of his veſture to have withheld the murderer. Theſe are commonly ſuppos'd to be the Sons of <hi>Mordred, Arturs</hi> Nefew, ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from his Uncle, giv'n him in a Battel his Deaths wound, and by him after to have bin ſlain. Which things were they true, would much diminiſh the blame of cruelty in <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> revenging <hi>Artur</hi> on the Sons of ſo falſe a <hi>Mordred.</hi> In another part, but not expreſs'd where, <hi>Aurelius Conanus</hi> was King: him he charges alſo with Adulteries, and Parricide; cruelties worſe then the former; to be a hater of his Countries Peace, thirſting after civil War and Prey. His condition it ſeems was not very proſperous; for <hi>Gildas</hi> wiſhes him, being now left alone, like a Tree withering in the midſt of a barren field, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the vanity, and arrogance of his Father, and elder Brethren, who came all to untimely Death in thir youth. The third reigning in <hi>Demetia,</hi> or <hi>South Wales,</hi> was <hi>Vortipor,</hi> the Son of a good Father; he was when <hi>Gildas</hi> wrote, grown old, not in years only, but in Adulteries, and in governing full of falſhood, and cruel Actions. In his latter dales, putting away his Wife, who dy'd in divorce, he became, if we miſtake not <hi>Gildas,</hi> inceſtuous with his Daughter. The fourth was <hi>Cuneglas,</hi> imbru'd in civil War; he alſo had divorc'd his Wife, and tak'n her Siſter, who had vow'd Widdowhood: he was a great Enemy to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55158:68"/>
the Clergy, high-minded, and truſting to his wealth. The laſt, but greateſt of all in power, was <hi>Maglocune,</hi> and greateſt alſo in wickedneſs; he had driv'n out or ſlain many other Kings, or Tyrants; and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Iſland Dragon,</hi> perhaps having his ſeat in <hi>Angleſey;</hi> a profuſe giver, a great Warrior, and of a goodly ſtature. While he was yet young, he over-threw his Uncle, though in the head of a compleat Army, and took from him the Kingdom: then touch't with remorſe of his doings, not without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation took upon him the profeſſion of a Monk; but ſoon forſook his vow, and his wife alſo, which for that vow he had left, making love to the wife of his Brothers Son then living. Who not refuſing the offer, if ſhe were not rather the firſt that entic'd, found means both to diſpatch her own Husband, and the former wife of <hi>Maglocune,</hi> to make her marriage with him the more unqueſtionable. Neither did he this for want of better inſtructions, having had the learnedeſt and wiſeſt man reputed of all <hi>Britain,</hi> the inſtituter of his youth.

            <head>THE HISTORY OF BRITAIN. The Fourth Book.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Saxons</hi> grown up now to 7 abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Kingdoms, and the lateſt of them eſtabliſh'd by ſucceſſion, finding thir power arrive well nigh at the utmoſt of what was to be gain'd upon the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and as little fearing to be diſplanted by them, had time now to ſurvey at leaſure one anothers greatneſs. Which quickly bred among them, either envy, or mutual jealouſies; till the Weſt Kingdom at length grown over powerful, put an end to all the reſt. Mean while, above others, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> who by this time had well rip'nd his young ambition, <note place="margin">Bed. Malmſ.</note> with more ability of years and experience in War,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55158:70"/>
what before he attempted to his loſs, now ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attains; and by degrees brought all the other Monarchies between <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Humber,</hi> to be at his devotion. To which deſign the Kingdom of <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> being the firmeſt of them all, at that time ſore ſhak'n by thir over-throw at <hi>Wodens-beorth,</hi> and the Death of <hi>Keaulin,</hi> gave him no doubt a main advantage; the reſt yeilded not ſubjection, but as he earn'd it by continual Victories. And to win him <note place="margin">Bed. l. 1. c. 25.</note> the more regard abroad, he marries <hi>Bertha</hi> the French Kings Daughter, though a Chriſtian, and with this condition, to have the free exerciſe of her Faith, under the care and inſtruction of <hi>Letardus</hi> a Biſhop, ſent by her Parents along with her; the King notwithſtanding and his people retaining thir own Religion. <hi>Beda</hi> out of <hi>Gildas</hi> laies it ſadly to the <note place="margin">Bed. l. 1. c. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Britans</hi> charge, that they never would voutſafe thir <hi>Saxon</hi> Neighbours the means of converſion: but how far to blame they were, and what hope there was of converting in the midſt of ſo much hoſtility, <note place="margin">Bed. l. 2. c. 1.</note> at leaſt falſhood from thir firſt arrival, is not now ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to determin. Howbeit not long after, they had the Chriſtian Faith preach't to them by a Nation <note place="margin">Malmſ. l. 1. c. 3.</note> more remote, and (as a report went, accounted old in <hi>Bedas</hi> time) upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Northumbrians</hi> had a cuſtom at that time, and many hunder'd yeares after not aboliſh't, to ſell thir Childern for a ſmall value into any Foren Land. Of which number, two comly youths were brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe fair and honeſt countnances invited <hi>Gregory</hi> Arch-Deacon of that Citty, among others that beheld them, pittying thir condition, to demand whence they were; it was anſwer'd by ſom who ſtood by, that they were <hi>Angli</hi> of the Province <hi>Deira,</hi> ſubjects to <hi>Alla</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and

Which laſt <hi>Gregory</hi> deploring, fram'd on a ſudden this alluſion to the three names he heard; that the <hi>Angli</hi> ſo like to Angels ſhould be ſnatch't <hi>de ira,</hi> that is, from the wrath of God, to ſing <hi>Haleluia:</hi> and forthwith obtaining licence of <hi>Benedic</hi> the Pope, had come and preach't heer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, had not the <hi>Roman</hi> people, whoſe love endur'd not the abſence of ſo vigilant a Paſtor over them, recall'd him then on his journey, though but deferr'd his pious intention.<label type="milestone">

Who being now on thir way, diſcouraged by ſome reports, or thir own carnal fear, ſent back <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in the name of all, to beſeech <hi>Gregory</hi> they might return home, and not be ſent a journey ſo full of hazard, to a fierce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel Nation, whoſe tongue they underſtood not. <hi>Gregory</hi> with pious and Apoſtolic perſwaſions exhorts them not to ſhrink back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo good a work, but cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to go on in the ſtrength of divine aſſiſtance.

knowledge of another God then the <hi>Saxons</hi> knew, appoints them to remain where they landed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to be provided them, conſulting in the mean time what was to be done. And after certain days coming into the Iland, choſe a place to meet them under the open Sky, poſſeſt with an old perſwaſion, that all Spells, if they ſhould uſe any to deceive him, ſo it were not within doors, would be unavailable. They on the other ſide call'd to his preſence, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for thir Standard, a ſilver croſs, and the painted image of our Saviour, came ſlowly forward ſinging the ſolemn Litanies: which wrought in <hi>Ethelbert</hi> more ſuſpition perhaps that they us'd enchantments; till ſitting down as the King will'd them, they there preach'd to him, and all in that aſſembly, the tidings of Salvation. Whom having heard attentively, the King thus anſwer'd. Fair indeed and ample are the promiſes which ye bring, and ſuch things as have the appearance in them of much good; yet ſuch as being new and uncertain, I cannot haſtily aſſent to, quitting the Religion which from my Anceſtors, with all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſo many years I have retain'd. Nevertheleſs becauſe ye are ſtrangers, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd ſo long a journey, to impart us the knowledge of things, which I perſwade me you believe to be the trueſt and the beſt, ye may be ſure we ſhall not recompence you with any moleſtation, but ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide rather how we may friendlieſt entertain ye; nor do we forbid whom ye can by preaching gain to your belief. And accordingly thir reſidence he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted them in <hi>Doroverne</hi> or <hi>Canturbury</hi> his chief Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and made proviſion for thir maintenance, with free leave to preach their doctrine where they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. By which, and by the example of thir holy life, ſpent in prayer, faſting, and continual labour in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55158:72"/>
converſion of Souls, they won many; on whoſe bounty and the Kings, receiving only what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, they ſubſiſted. There ſtood without the Citty, on the Eaſt-ſide, an ancient Church built in honour of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> while yet the <hi>Romans</hi> remain'd heer: in which <hi>Bertha</hi> the Queen went out uſually to pray: Heer they alſo began firſt to preach, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, and openly to exerciſe divine worſhip.<label type="milestone">

To whom <hi>Ethelbert</hi> indeed principally ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his favour, but compell'd none. For ſo he had bin taught by them who were both the Inſtructors <note place="margin">Bed. l. 2. c. 5.</note> and the Authors of his faith, that Chriſtian Religion ought to be voluntary, not compell'd. About this time <hi>Kelwulf</hi> the Son of <hi>Cutha Keaulins</hi> Brother reign'd over the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi>

               <hi>Ethelfrid</hi> the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> King, was not leſs bufied in far different affairs: for being altogether warlike, and covetous of fame, he more waſted the <hi>Britans</hi> then any <hi>Saxon</hi> King before him; winning from them large Territories, which either he made tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or planted with his own Subjects.<label type="milestone">

As to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which you require, be thus perſwaded of us, that in the bond of love and charity we are all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Servants to the Church of God, yea to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and every good Chriſtian to help them forward, both by word and deed, to be the Childern of God: other obedience then this we know not to be due to him whom you term the Pope; and this obedience we are ready to give both to him and to every Chriſtian continually.

But while he ſtill deferr'd, and his deferring might ſeem now to have paſt the maturity of wiſedome to a faulty lingring, <hi>Paulinus</hi> by Revelation, as was beleev'd, coming to the knowledge of a ſecret, which befell him ſtrangly in the time of his troubles, on a certain day went in boldly to him, and laying his right hand on the head of the King, ask'd him if he rememberd what that ſign meant; the King trembling, and in a maze riſeing up, ſtrait fell at his Feet.

you from your Enemies, and giv'n you the Kingdome, as you deſir'd: perform now what long ſince you promis'd him, to receave his Doctrine which I now bring you, and the Faith, which if you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, ſhall to your temporal felicity, add Eternal. The promiſe claim'd of him by <hi>Paulinus,</hi> how and wherefore made, though ſavouring much of Legend, is thus related. <hi>Redwald,</hi> as we heard before, dazl'd with the gold of <hi>Ethelfrid,</hi> or by his threatning over-aw'd, having promis'd to yeild up <hi>Edwin,</hi> one of his faithfull Companions, of which he had ſome few with him in the Court of <hi>Redwald,</hi> that never ſhrunk from his adverſity, about the firſt howr of night comes in haſt to his Chamber, and calling him forth for better ſecrecy, reveles to him his danger, offers him his aid to make eſcape; but that courſe not approv'd, and ſeeming diſhonourable without more manifeſt cauſe to begin, diſtruſt towards one who had ſo long bin his only refuge, the friend departs. <hi>Edwin</hi> left alone without the Palace Gate, full of ſadneſs and perplext thoughts, diſcerns about the dead of night, a man neither by countnance nor by habit to him known, approaching towards him. Who after ſalutation, aſk'd him why at this howr, when all others were at reſt, he alone ſo ſadly ſat waking on a cold Stone? <hi>Edwin</hi> not a little miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting who he might be, aſk'd him again, what his ſitting within dores, or without, concern'd him to know? To whom he again, think not that who thou art, or why ſitting heer, or what danger hangs over thee, is to me unknown: But what would you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to that man, who ever would befriend you out of all theſe troubles, and perſwade <hi>Redwald</hi> to the like? All that I am able anſwer'd <hi>Edwin.</hi> And he, what if the ſame man ſhould promiſe to make you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55158:77"/>
greater then any Engliſh King hath bin before you? I ſhould not doubt, quoth <hi>Edwin,</hi> to be anſwerably gratefull. And what if to all this he would inform you, ſaid the other, in a way to happineſs, beyond what any of your Anceſtors hath known? would you hark'n to his Counſel? <hi>Edwin</hi> without ſtopping promis'd he would. And the other laying his right hand on <hi>Edwins</hi> head, when this ſign, ſaith he, ſhall next befall yee, remember this time of night, and this diſcourſe, to perform what thou haſt promis'd, and with theſe words diſappeering, left <hi>Edwin</hi> much reviv'd, but not leſs fill'd with wonder, who this unknown ſhould be. When ſuddenly the friend who had bin gon all this while to liſt'n furder what was like to be decree'd of <hi>Edwin,</hi> comes back and joyfully bids him riſe to his repoſe, for that the Kings mind, though for a while drawn aſide, was now fully reſolv'd not only not to betray him, but to defend him againſt all Enemies, as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd. This was ſaid to be the cauſe why <hi>Edwin</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh't by the Biſhop of a ſign which had befaln him ſo ſtrangely, and as he thought ſo ſecretly, aroſe to him with that reverence and amazement, as to one ſent from Heav'n, to claim that promiſe of him which he perceav'd well was due to a Divinepower, that had aſſiſted him in his troubles. To <hi>Paulinus</hi> therefore he makes anſwer, that the Chriſtian Beleef he himſelf ought by promiſe, and intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave; but would conferr firſt with his Cheif Peers and Counſellers, that if they likewiſe could be won, all at once might be baptiz'd. They therfore being aſk'd in Counſel what thir opinion was concerning this new Doctrine, and well perceaving which way the King enclin'd, every one thereafter ſhap'd his reply.

wonderd how ſo many Provinces could be held in ſubjection by ſuch a little dapper man: his words were brought to the Kings Ear; he ſends for <hi>Kened</hi> as about ſome private buſineſs, and in talk drawing him forth to a ſecret place, takes from under his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two Swords which he had brought with him, gave one of them to <hi>Kened;</hi> and now ſaith he, it ſhall be try'd which ought to be the ſubject; for it is ſhamefull for a King to boaſt at Table, and ſhrink in fight. <hi>Kened</hi> much abaſh'd fell preſently at his Feet, and beſought him to pardon what he had ſimply ſpok'n, no way intended to his diſhonour or diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement: wherewith the King was ſatisfi'd. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in his deſcription of <hi>Ireland,</hi> cites a Charter of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> wherin it appears, he had in ſubjection all the Kingdomes of the Iles as far as <hi>Norway,</hi> and had ſubdu'd the greateſt part of <hi>Ireland</hi> with the City of <hi>Dublin:</hi> but of this other Writers make no mention. In his youth having heard of <hi>Elfrida,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ordgar</hi> Duke of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> much commended for her Beauty, he ſent Earl <hi>Athelwold,</hi> whoſe loyalty he truſted moſt, to ſee her; intending, if ſhe were found ſuch as anſwerd report, to demand her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55158:121"/>
told the Earl, what day he meant to come and viſit him and his fair Wife. The Earl ſeemingly aſſur'd his welcome, but in the mean while acquainting his Wife, earneſtly advis'd her to deform her ſelf, what ſhe might, either in dreſs or otherwiſe, leſt the King, whoſe amorous inclination was not unknown, ſhould chance to be attracted. She who by this time was not ignorant, how <hi>Athelwold</hi> had ſtepd between her and the King, againſt his coming arraies her ſelf richly, uſeing whatever art ſhe could deviſe might render her the more amiable; and it took effect.

Some cenſure this act as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and tyrannical, but conſiderd well, it may be judg'd more favourably, and that no man of ſenſible Spirit but in his place, without extraordinary perfection, would have done the like: for next to life what worſe treaſon could have bin committed againſt him? it chanc'd that the Earls baſe Son coming by upon the fact, the King ſternly aſk'd him how he lik'd this Game; he ſubmiſly anſwering, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pleas'd the King, muſt not diſpleaſe him; the King return'd to his wonted temper, took an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the youth, and ever after highly favour'd him, making amends in the Son for what he had done to the Father. <hi>Elſrida</hi> forthwith he took to Wife, who to expiate her former Huſbands Death, though therin ſhe had no hand, coverd the place of his blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a Monaſtery of Nuns to ſing over him.

But to digreſs no farder, <hi>Toſti</hi> the Kings Brother coming from <hi>Flanders,</hi> full of envy at his younger Brothers advancement to the Crown, reſolv'd what he might to trouble his Reign; forcing therfore them of <hi>Wight Ile</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, he ſail'd thence to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> committing Piracies on the Coaſt between. <hi>Harold</hi> then reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>London,</hi> with a great number of Ships drawn together, and of Horſe Troops by Land, prepares in perſon for <hi>Sandwich:</hi> wherof <hi>Toſti</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, directs his courſe with 60 Ships towards <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Malmſ.</note> taking with him all the Sea-men he found, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or unwilling: where he burnt many Villages, and ſlew many of the Inhabitants; but <hi>Edwin</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> Duke, and <hi>Morcar</hi> his Brother, the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumbrian</hi> Earl, with thir Forces on either ſide, ſoon drove him out of the Country. Who thence betook him to <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Scottiſh King, and with him abode the whole Summer. About the ſame time Duke <hi>William</hi> ſending Embaſſadors to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Harold</hi> of his promiſe and Oath, to aſſiſt him in his Plea to the Kingdom, he made anſwer, that by the death of his Daughter betroth'd to him on that condition, he was abſolv'd of his Oath, or not Dead, he could not take her now an out-landiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">Eadmer.</note> without conſent of the Realm; that it was preſumptuouſly done and not to be perſiſted in, if without conſent or knowledge of the States, he had ſworn away the right of the Kingdome; that what
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55158:152"/>
he ſwore was to gain his liberty, being in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then his Priſner; that it was unreaſonable in the Duke to require or expect of him the foregoing of a Kingdome, conferr'd upon him with univerſal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and acclamation of the people: to this flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall he added contempt, ſending the Meſſengers back, ſaith <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> on maim'd Horſes. The Duke thus contemptuouſly put off, addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Pope, ſetting forth the Juſtice of his cauſe, which <hi>Harold,</hi> whether through haughtineſs of mind, or diſtruſt, or that the ways to <hi>Rome</hi> were ſtop'd, ſought not to do. Duke <hi>William,</hi> beſides the promiſe and Oath of <hi>Harold,</hi> alleg'd that King <hi>Edward</hi> by the advice of <hi>Seward, Godwin</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Stigand</hi> the Archbiſhop, had giv'n him the right of ſucceſſion, and had ſent him the Son and Nephew of <hi>Godwin,</hi> pledges of the guift; the Pope ſent to Duke <hi>William,</hi> after this demonſtration of his right, a conſecrated Banner. Wherupon he having with great care and choice got an Army of tall and ſtout Souldiers, under Captains of great ſkill and mature Age, came in <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the Port of St. <hi>Valerie.</hi> Mean while <hi>Harold</hi> from <hi>London</hi> comes to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> there expecting his Navy; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo coming, he ſails to the Ile of <hi>Wight;</hi> and having heard of Duke <hi>William</hi>'s preparations and readineſs to invade him, kept good watch on the Coaſt, and Foot Forces every where in fit places to guard the ſhoar. But ere the middle of <hi>September,</hi> proviſion failing when it was moſt needed, both Fleet and Army return home. When on a ſudden, <hi>Harold</hi>

                  <hi>Harvager</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> with a Navy of more then 500 great Ships, (others leſs'n them by two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd, others augment them to a thouſand) appears
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55158:153"/>
at the mouth of <hi>Tine;</hi> to whom Earl <hi>Toſti</hi> with his Ships came as was agreed between them; whence both uniting, ſet ſail with all ſpeed and enterd the River <hi>Humber.</hi> Thence turning into <hi>Ouſe,</hi> as far as <hi>Rical,</hi> landed; and won <hi>Yorke</hi> by aſſault. At theſe tideings <hi>Harold</hi> with all his power haſts thether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but ere his coming, <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> at <hi>Fulford</hi> by <hi>Yorke,</hi> on the North ſide of <hi>Ouſe,</hi> about the Feaſt of St. <hi>Mathew</hi> had giv'n them Battel; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully at firſt, but over-born at length with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and forc't to turn thir backs, more of them periſh'd in the River, then in the Fight. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians taking with them 500 Hoſtages out of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and leaving there 150 of thir own, retir'd to thir Ships. But the fift day after, King <hi>Harold</hi> with a great and well appointed Army, coming to <hi>York,</hi> and at <hi>Stamford-</hi>Bridge, or <hi>Battell-</hi>Bridge on <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Camd.</note> aſſailing the Norwegians, after much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed on both ſides, cut off the greateſt part of them with <hi>Harfager</hi> thir King, and <hi>Toſti</hi> his own Brother. But <hi>Olave</hi> the Kings Son, and <hi>Paul</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> left with many Souldiers to guard the Ships, ſurrendring themſelves with Hoſtages and Oath giv'n never to return as Enemies, he ſufferd freely to depart with 20 Ships and the ſmall rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of thir Army. One man of the Norwegians is not to be forgott'n, who with incredible valour <note place="margin">Malmſ.</note> keeping the Bridge a long hour againſt the whole Engliſh Army, with his ſingle reſiſtance delai'd thir Victorie; and ſcorning offerd life, till in the end no man dareing to graple with him, either dreaded as too ſtrong, or contemn'd as one deſperate, he was at length ſhot dead with an Arrow; and by his fall op'nd the paſſage of perſuit to a compleat Victorie.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55158:153"/>
Wherwith <hi>Harold</hi> lifted up in minde, and forgetting now his former ſhews of popularitie, defrauded his Souldiers thir due and well deſerved ſhare of the ſpoils. While theſe things thus paſt in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Duke <hi>William</hi> lay ſtill at St. <hi>Valerie;</hi> his Ships were readie but the wind ſerv'd not for many days; which put the Souldierie into much diſcouragement and murmur, taking this for an unlucky ſign of thir ſucceſs; at laſt the wind came favourable, the Duke firſt under ſail awaited the reſt at Anchor, till all coming forth, the whole Fleet of 900 Ships with a proſperous gale arriv'd at <hi>Haſtings.</hi> At his <note place="margin">Sim. Dun.</note> going out of the Boat by a ſlip falling on his hands, to correct the Omen, a Souldier ſtanding by ſaid aloud, that thir Duke had tak'n poſſeſſion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Landed, he reſtrein'd his Army from waſt and ſpoil, ſaying, that they ought to ſpare what was thir own. But theſe are things related of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and I doubt thence borrow'd by the Monks to inlay thir ſtory. The Duke for 15 days after landing kept his men quiet within the Camp, having tak'n the Caſtle of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> or built a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs there. <hi>Harold</hi> ſecure the while and proud of his new Victorie, thought all his Enemies now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot: but ſitting jollily at dinner, news is brought him, that Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> with a great multitude of Horſe and Foot, Slingers and Archers, beſides other choice Auxiliaries which he had hir'd in <hi>France,</hi> was arriv'd at <hi>Pevenſey. Harold</hi> who had expected him all the Summer, but not ſo late in the year as now it was, for it was <hi>October;</hi> with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces much diminiſh't after two ſore conflicts and the departing of many others from him diſcontented, in great haſt marches to <hi>London.</hi> Thence not tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55158:154"/>
for ſupplies which were on thir way towards him, hurries into <hi>Suſſex</hi> (for he was always in haſt ſince the day of his Coronation) and ere the third part of his Army could be well put in order, findes the Duke about 9 mile from <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and now drawing nigh, ſent ſpies before him to ſurvey the ſtrength and number of his Enemies: them, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd ſuch, the Duke cauſing to be led about, and after well fill'd with meat and drink ſent back. They not over-wiſe, brought word that the Dukes Army were moſt of them Prieſts; for they ſaw thir faces all over ſhav'n; the Engliſh then uſeing to let grow on thir upper-lip large Muſtachio's, as did antiently the <hi>Britans.</hi> The King laughing anſwerd, that they were not Prieſts, but valiant and hardy Souldiers. Therefore ſaid <hi>Girtha</hi> his Brother, a youth of noble courage and underſtanding above his Age, Forbear thou thy ſelf to fight, who art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Duke <hi>William</hi> by Oath, let us unſworn undergo the hazard of Battel, who may juſtly fight in the defence of our Country; thou reſerv'd to fitter time, maiſt either reunite us flying, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge us dead. The King not hark'ning to this, leaſt it might ſeem to argue fear in him or a bad cauſe, with like reſolution rejected the offers of Duke <hi>William</hi> ſent to him by a Monk before the Battel, with this only anſwer haſtily deliverd, let God judge between us. The offers were theſe, that <hi>Harold</hi> would either lay down the Scepter, or hold it of him, or try his title with him by ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the ſight of both Armies, or referr it to the Pope. Theſe rejected, both ſides prepar'd to fight the next morning, the Engliſh from ſinging and drinking all night, the Normans from confeſſion of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55158:154"/>
thir ſins and communion of the hoſt. The Engliſh were in a ſtreit diſadvantagious place, ſo that many diſcourag'd with thir ill ordering, ſcarſe having room where to ſtand, ſlip'd away before the onſet, the reſt in cloſe order with thir Battel-Axes and Shields, made an impenetrable Squadron: the King himſelf with his Brothers on foot ſtood by the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Standard, wherin the figure of a man fighting was inwov'n with gold and pretious Stones. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Foot, moſt Bowmen, made the formoſt Front, on either ſide Wings of Horſe ſomewhat behind. The Duke Arming, and his Corſlet giv'n him on the wrong ſide, ſaid pleaſantly, <hi>the ſtrength of my Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be turn'd now into a Kingdom.</hi> Then the whole Army ſinging the Song of <hi>Rowland,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of whoſe exploits might hart'n them, imploring laſtly Divine help, the Battel began; and was fought ſorely on either ſide; but the main body of Engliſh Foot by no means would be brok'n, till the Duke cauſing his men to feign flight, drew them out with deſire of purſuit into op'n diſorder, then turn'd ſuddenly upon them ſo routed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which wrought thir overthrow; yet ſo they dy'd not unmanfully, but turning oft upon thir Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by the advantage of an upper ground, beat them down by heaps, and fill'd up a great Ditch with thir Carcaſſes. Thus hung the Victory wavering on either ſide, from the third hour of day to Evening; when <hi>Harold</hi> having maintain'd the fight with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable courage and perſonal valour, ſhot into the head with an Arrow, fell at length, and left his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers without heart longer to withſtand the unwearied Enemy. With <hi>Harold</hi> fell alſo his two Brothers,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55158:155"/>
                  <hi>Leofwin,</hi> and <hi>Girtha,</hi> with them greateſt part of the Engliſh Nobility. His Body lying dead a Knight or Souldier wounding on the thigh, was by the Duke preſently turn'd out of military ſervice. Of Normans and French were ſlain no ſmall number; the Duke himſelf alſo that day not a little hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his perſon, having had three choice Horſes kill'd under him. Victory obtain'd, and his dead care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully buried, the Engliſh alſo by permiſſion, he ſent the body of <hi>Harold</hi> to his mother without ranſom, though ſhe offerd very much to redeem it, which having receav'd, ſhe buried at <hi>Waltham,</hi> in a Church built there by <hi>Harold.</hi> In the mean while, <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> who had withdrawn themſelves from <hi>Harold,</hi> hearing of his Death, came to <hi>London;</hi> ſending <hi>Aldgith</hi> the Queen thir Siſter with all ſpeed to <hi>Weſt-Cheſter. Aldred</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and many of the Nobles, with the <hi>Londoners</hi> would have ſet up <hi>Edgar</hi> the right Heir, and prepar'd themſelves to fight for him; but <hi>Morcar</hi> and <hi>Edwin</hi> not likeing the choice, who each of them expected to have been chos'n before him, withdrew thir Forces and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home. Duke <hi>William</hi> contrary to his former <note place="margin">Sim.

Coming to <hi>London</hi> with all his Army, he was on
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55158:155"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> day ſollemly Crown'd in the great Church at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt giv'n his Oath at the Altar in preſence of all the people, to defend the Church, well govern the people, maintain right Law; prohibit rapine and unjuſt judgment. Thus the Engliſh, while they agreed not about the choice of thir native King, were conſtrein'd to take the Yoke of an out-landiſh Conquerer. With what minds and by what courſe of life they had fitted themſelves for this ſervitude, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> ſpares not to lay op'n. Not a few years before the Normans came, the Clergy, though in <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſors daies, had loſt all good literature and Religion, ſcarſe able to read and underſtand thir Latin Service: he was a miracle to others who knew his Grammar. The Monks went clad in fine ſtuffs, and made no difference what they eat; which though in it ſelf no fault, yet to their Conſciences was irreligious. The great men giv'n to gluttony and diſſolute life, made a prey of the common people, abuſeing thir Daughters whom they had in ſervice, then turning them off to the Stews, the meaner ſort tipling together night and day, ſpent all they had in Drunk'neſs, attended with other Vices which effeminate mens minds. Whence it came to paſs, that carried on with fury and raſhneſs more then any true fortitude or ſkill of War, they gave to <hi>William</hi> thir Conquerour ſo eaſie a Conqueſt. Not but that ſome few of all ſorts were much better among them; but ſuch was the generality. <hi>And as the long ſuffering of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits bad men to enjoy proſperous daies with the good, ſo his ſeverity oft times exempts not good men from thir ſhare in evil times with the bad.</hi>
