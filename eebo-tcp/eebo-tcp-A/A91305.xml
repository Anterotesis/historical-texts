            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Officers and Councell of the Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcontented with the Votes paſſed in
the <hi>Commons Houſe</hi> upon a long and ſerious
Debate (which continued all Munday, and
Munday night laſt, till Tueſday morning about 9 of
the clock) to this effect, <hi>That the Kings perſon was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of the Iſle of Wight by the Generals Command, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledg or conſent of the Houſe.</hi> And, <hi>That the Kings
anſwers to the Propoſitions of both Houſes upon the Treaty,
were a ſufficient ground for the houſe to proceed to the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a ſafe and wel-grounded Peace.</hi> On Wedneſday,
the ſixth of this inſtant <hi>December,</hi> 1648. placed ſtrong
Guards of the Army (as well Horſe as Foot) in the
Palace yard, <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-hall, the Court of Requeſts,
and in the ſtairs and Lobby leading to the <hi>Commons-houſe,</hi>
where Col. <hi>Pride</hi> (who commanded the Guards
that day) Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller,</hi> and other Officers, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
ſeized upon divers Knights, Citizens, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
of the Commons houſe in the Parliament ſtairs
and Lobby, as they were going to the Houſe, to ſit
and diſcharge their duties there, and by plain force
thruſt and carried them priſoners into the <hi>Queens-Court,</hi>
notwithſtanding their open proteſtations of
<hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Priviledg of Parliament,</hi> without having any
warrant for ſuch commitment but their Swords, or
aſsigning any cauſe at all but their own <hi>arbitrary wills:</hi>
and there kept them priſoners under a ſtrong Guard,
denying them liberty of acceſs to the Houſe, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:162499:3"/>
they deſired. Mr. <hi>Edward Stevens</hi> and Col. <hi>Birch</hi> being
gotten into the Houſe before their ſeizures, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the door by feared Meſſages ſent to them by
the Officers, under other mens names, and there ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on, and violently pulled out of the Houſe, though
they cryed out to the <hi>Speaker</hi> to take notice of the
horrid force upon them; and ſo were haled thence
into the <hi>Queens Court; Harry Martin</hi> the <hi>Horſe stealer,</hi>
though in actuall Rebellion againſt the Houſe, and
formerly ejected out of it, being in the mean time
admitted to ſit as a competent Member. The Houſe
being informed of this ſtrange violence offered to
their Members by thoſe who profeſſed themſelves
their Servants and Protectors, ſent the <hi>Sergeant</hi> of the
Houſe to the <hi>Queens Court,</hi> to demand the Members
there detained, and required their attendance in the
Houſe: Which Meſſage, though delivered, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed,
wherewith he acquainting the Houſe:
Thereupon the Houſe ſent the Serjeant forth with
the Mace, to fetch away the impriſoned Members, but
the Soldiers and Officers violently kept him back at
the Door, and would not ſuffer him to execute their
command. Hereupon the Houſe reſolved not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
till theſe Members were reſtored; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Officers ſtil proceeded to ſeiz more Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as they came to, or went from the Houſe, carrying
them all Priſoners to the Court aforeſaid. About three
of the clock in the afternoon, <hi>Hugh Peter</hi> with a ſword
by his ſide, like a boiſterous Souldier came ruſhing in
to ſee the Priſoners, and take a liſt of their names, by
order from the <hi>Generall,</hi> as he alledged; where ſome of
the Priſoners demanding of him, by what authority
they were thus impriſoned and kept from their duty, he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:162499:3"/>
anſwered, <hi>By the power of the Sword;</hi> and returning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoon after, he releaſed Sir <hi>Benjamin Ruddier</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> (as he ſaid) by the like power of
the Sword.</p>
            <p>Night drawing on, the Priſoners deſired the Capt.
who guarded them, to deſire Col. <hi>Pride</hi> to ſpeak with
them, to the end they might know by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and for what cauſe they were thus detained by
him, being Members. The proud Colonel returned
this Anſwer, That he had other imployment for the
preſent, that he could not wait upon them. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Hugh Peter</hi> and ſome other Officers acquainted
them, that they ſhould all be removed to <hi>Wallingford</hi>
Houſe, where they ſhould have all fitting accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
provided for them, and where the General
and Lieut. Gen. would come and ſpeak with them,
and that Coaches were provided to carry them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
upon this aſſurance, the Priſoners went all
from the <hi>Queens Court,</hi> to take coach at the <hi>Lords ſtairs;</hi>
where Coaches attending them, in ſtead of being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
to <hi>Wallingford</hi> Houſe as was promiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
they were ſtayed at the back-gate of <hi>Hell,</hi> (a
common Victualling-houſe ſo called) and there thruſt
all into the common dining-Room, and after that
tranſlated into two upper <hi>Chambers.</hi> When it grew
late, Sir <hi>Robert Pye</hi> and ſome ſix more were offered li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to go to their lodgings (being neer) upon their
paroll, to <hi>appear before the General the next morning:</hi> who
conceiving it inconſiſtent with the Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and a prejudice to their Cauſe, refuſed to
give any other paroll, then to appear in the Houſe
the next morning; which being not accepted, they
were all inforced to remain in <hi>Hell</hi> that night, moſt of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:162499:4"/>
them having no other beds to reſt their heads on
(though ancient and infirm, and Gentlemen of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
but the floor of the Room, and Benches and
Chairs: yet they patiently underwent this affront
and dureſſe in <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf (culled out of purpoſe to put
a meer ſignal brand of contempt and infamy upon
them and the Parliament) reading and ſinging Pſalms
to God, ſpending moſt of the night in Diſcourſes and
walking, without taking one minutes reſt or ſleep. It
was a very ſad ſpectacle to ſee ſo many eminent and
Honourable Members of Parliament ſo uncivilly and
diſcourteouſly uſed by their domineering <hi>Servants,</hi>
who exceeded all Regal and Prelatical Tyranny in
former times; which afforded convenient lodgings
and accommodations to their Priſoners. The Provoſt
Marſhal (under whoſe cuſtody they were unworthily
put as Malefactors) was ſo aſhamed of this diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
uſage, that after ſome conference concerning it,
he repaired to the General to <hi>White-hall,</hi> to acquaint
him with it, and receive his further Order.</p>
            <p>The next morning (being Thurſday) the Priſoners
expecting the iſſue, he returned to them about 11 of
the clock, and acquainted them, that it was the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
pleaſure they ſhould all wait forthwith upon him
and his Councel of War at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to conferr with them: whereupon, they were
preſently put into Coaches and carried to <hi>White Hall</hi>
like Traytors or Felons, with ſtrong Guards of Horſe
and Foot attending them, and there brought into the
Kings Lodgings faſting, and tired out with watching
the night before: where arriving about 12 of the
clock, they expected a preſent Anſwer. But our new
Grandees and great Councel of the Army took ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:162499:4"/>
much Royal State upon them, as to make them wait
their leiſure til it was night before they vouchſafed
to ſend them any anſwer; at which time, diſdaining to
call the impriſoned Members in, or to honour them
with their more them Lordly preſence, they ſent out
3 Officers to acquaint then with this dilatory anſwer,
That other intervenient affairs of great concernment
were now in agitation before the General and his
Councel, ſo as they could not admit them to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
that night, as was expected; and that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and his Councel, for their better accommodation,
had given order that they ſhould be lodg'd at 2 Inns
in the <hi>Strand,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Swan</hi> and the <hi>Kings Head,</hi> for
that night, where they ſhould receive from them the
next morning ſome Propoſitions to be conſidered of.
After which, the Provoſt Marſhal taking the names of
thoſe who were to be lodged at the <hi>Kings Head,</hi> and a
liſt of thoſe who were to be conducted to the <hi>Swan,</hi>
carried them all priſoners to the ſaid Inns thorow the
ſtreets in the dirt on foot (except ſome 6 or 7 onely,
who were lame and aged) with a Muſketier attending
upon every one of them in particular, and a ſtrong
Guard marching before, behinde, and on one ſide of
them, like ſo many Traytors and capital Malefactors,
to the great admiration and diſcontent of all perſons
wel affected to the Parliament, and joy &amp; rejoycing
to all <hi>Malignants, Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> who, had they
been conquerors of the Parliament, could not have
uſed them with more rigour, ſcorn and diſdain then
theſe pious Saints and Grandees of the Army have
done, before they have attainted them of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
crime or breach of truſt; whereof the whole
Kingdom can declare all or moſt of them innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:162499:5"/>
Being brought Priſoners to the ſaid Inns, they had
ſtrong Guards ſet upon them, and a Sentinel at every
chamber door all night. Thus do theſe new uſurpers
of a more then Regal and Tyrannical power, trample
upon the Members of the Houſe of Commons (their
former Maſters) as if they were no better then the dirt
in the ſtreet; and to exaſperate the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon <hi>ſouldiers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, have ſlandered the impriſoned <hi>Members,</hi>
to be the only detainers of their pay; when as none
of them ever fingered one penny of their moneys: and
if any Members be guilty of ſuch a crime, it muſt be
thoſe who have moſt relation to the Army, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
themſelves their greateſt friends.</p>
            <p>Thurſday morning the Officers and Army guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Houſe in the ſame manner as on Wedneſday,
ſome of their Officers ſtanding at the Commons door
with a Liſt of Parliament mens names in their hands,
demanded every Members name as he came to the
door to enter the Houſe, and thoſe whoſe names were
in their Liſt, they forcibly excluded the Houſe, and
turned down the ſtairs, though they earneſtly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for entrance: and ſome of them acquainted the
Speaker by Letter with the high affront and breach
of Priviledge; but could finde no redreſſe, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
admitting onely ſuch who were not in the Liſt:
About 40 Members were thus forcibly excluded, but
not impriſoned; onely Mr. <hi>Gewen</hi> was ſeiſed upon
by one of Col. <hi>Hewſons</hi> Officers, carried priſoner to
the Queens Court, and from thence to <hi>White-hall</hi> to
the reſt of the impriſoned Members, who were there
attending upon the General and his Councel: This
day the Great Conqueror Lieut. Gen. <hi>Cromwel</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Commons Houſe, and received thanks for his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:162499:5"/>
great ſervices, which had been more Honourable for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in a full and free Houſe, then in an empty and forced; the
Houſe (by reaſon of the reſtrained and excluded Members, with
others driven away by this horrid violence) being not above 80.
in Number, having formerly reſolved not to proceed till their
Members were reſtored, and the force upon them removed; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome debate and oppoſition, the Houſe was divided upon
this Queſtion, whether they ſhould now proceed or not? which
was carryed in the affirmative, 50. voting in the affirmative, and
28. or 30. in the negative, that they ſhould not; who preſently
left the Houſe, moſt of them reſolving to come no more till
the Houſe and Members were righted; this done, to abuſe
and mock as well God as men, they appointed Friday for a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Humiliation, to be kept in that Houſe, not to expiate the
Armies open violation of their Priviledges, force and breach of
Faith, both to God and the Parliament, which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
but to procure a bleſſing on the forcible and unparlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
proceedings, for the ſubverſion of Monarchy, Religion,
Lawes, Liberties, and three Kingdomes in a moment: dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and beheading the King, and deſinheriting his Poſterity, and
introducing a popular Anarchy and Tyranny under the power
of a perfidious Army, worſe then any ſlavery under the great
Turk: The Lord humble them in good earneſt for theſe crying
ſins and treaſons, and either convert their hearts, or confound all
their treaſonable deſtructive devices of this kind, which will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them infamous to the preſent and all future Generations,
and bring them unto ſpeedy ruine, notwithſtanding all their
preſent uſurped power. It is beleived by divers underſtanding
men of great experience, that the Jeſuits have laid this plot, and
fomented theſe diſtempers in the Army, by the Agitators, ſome of
them being Jeſuits, others Anabaptiſts, leavened with Jeſuiticall
principles; who over-reach the honeſt-minded and plain-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Chriſtians in the Army by their ſpeciall pretences of Juſtice,
and ſpeedy ſetling of the Common-Weale, but in ſuch a way as
will bring all to ſuddain confuſion, and make our three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
a prey to the Popiſh party; and our forraign Popiſh ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who will make Bonefires of joy in <hi>Italy, Spain, France, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and other forraign parts for this unparaleld force upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:162499:6"/>
the Houſes, and the deſignes of the Army now in proſecution.</p>
            <p>Friday morning the impriſoned Members expected a Meſſage
from the Generall and his Councell, according to promiſe; but
they received none, ſuch is their dilatorineſſe and fidelity in point
of promiſe, onely one came with a meſſage from the Generall to
Sir <hi>Robert Harley</hi> to this effect, that he might go home to his
houſe, and continue there, ſo as he would give his word not to
oppoſe the preſent actings and proceedings of the Houſe or
Army, varying in his expreſſions; at which Sir <hi>Robert</hi> deſired
time to adviſe with his fellow priſoners, being a matter which
equally concerned them; the like offer was ſince made to Sir
<hi>John Merrick,</hi> by which it is apparent, that all theſe priſoners
crime is onely the diſcharge of their duty, in oppoſing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
deſignes and actions of the Army, to ſubvert the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Lawes, Liberties and Government of the Kingdome, and
the ancient forme of Parliaments; for which treaſon <hi>Strafford</hi>
&amp; <hi>Canterbury</hi> loſt their heads by judgment of this very Parliament.</p>
            <p>By all theſe paſſages, compared with the Armies late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
and Declaration, it is moſt perſpicuous to all the
Kingdome,</p>
            <p>1. That the Officers and Army have offered far greater vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Priviledges, Houſes, and Members of Parliament,
and acted more towards the diſſolution of this preſent, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of all future Parliaments, then ever the King or his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,
the Gunpowder traytors, <hi>Germyn</hi> or <hi>Percy</hi> did; or the
Reformadoes and London Apprentices did, whom yet the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Army declared againſt, and proſecuted as Traytors,
though they neither impriſoned nor kept back any Member
from the Houſes.</p>
            <p>2. That they have violated their Covenants, Oaths, Truſts,
and ſolemne ingagements to the Parliament, City, Country and
Kingdome, in as high or higher degree as ever the King and his
evill Counſellors did, in invading the priviledges, forcing the
Houſes, impriſoning the Members of Parliament, and indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
by open force to ſubvert the fundamentall Government,
Lawes, Liberties and Cuſtomes of the Realme, and the Ancient
frame and being of Parliaments, for defence of all which they
were raiſed, and covenanted to fight for and maintain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:162499:6"/>
That they have uſurped a far greater and more dangerous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
and tyrannicall power, over both Houſes of Parliament,
and their Members, and over the perſons and eſtates of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects,
then ever the King, or the worſt of his Counſellors
did, and that under the feigned pretences of preſent neceſſity, and
common ſafety, of which they make themſelves the only ſupreme
Iudges, not the Parliament, as the King did in the caſe of Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
and therefore they muſt either juſtifie or acquit the King &amp;
his party from all thoſe charges &amp; objections againſt him in their
late Remonſtrance, for which they preſſe the Houſes in point of
juſtice, both to depoſe and execute him as a Traitor to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
or els incur the ſelf-ſame crime and guilt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themſelves to the ſame judgment and execution, which they
deſire to be inflicted upon Him and His.</p>

                     <salute>Deare Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Was exceeding glad to receive the Doctors lines, that
intimated your recovery from that diſtemper that had
ſeized upon you; I doubt not but it had this effect upon
you, to let you ſee, what a fraile thing our bodies are, and
what need we have to be ſure of our building not made
with hands, reſerved in heaven for us.</p>
                  <p>I am at preſent (praiſed be God) indifferent well, the
place where I am, in reſpect of all outward accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
very well agreeing with me, and very much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>England,</hi> onely defective in this, that I cannot find
a <hi>M. Weſtrow,</hi> nor <hi>Doctor Stanes</hi> here, to make a boſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend;
and yet in that it is not altogether ſo barren as I
did, and you may well imagine it: I am fallen into the
acquaintance of three or foure <hi>Catholikes</hi> of very great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
and in their way of much Religion: <hi>undoubtedly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:162499:7"/>
it is an error to look at all Papiſts through the ſame perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;
for they are more to be differenced then Engliſh Papiſts
can be.</hi> I find their opinion of, and dependence upon the
<hi>Pope,</hi> little, or nothing what we imagine it to be, and <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
principled to make members of a Commonwealth, then the
most Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their oppoſition to the King is not to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled;
their hopes are now upon the Army, to whom they wiſh
all proſperity, as to the ſetling of a Repreſentative, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
diſtaſted with Regall hereditary power throughout the

                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems my Lord <hi>Say</hi> hath undertaken to procure a
Paſſe from the Houſe for Sir <hi>Kellam Digby</hi> to come over
to <hi>England;</hi> he is not, according to your rule, a <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>
but it ſeems came over into <hi>France</hi> by the Houſe of
<hi>Commons Licence,</hi> acquitted from any crime. Let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you when it comes to be moved in your Houſe, give
it the beſt promotion you can; one would think a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſo reaſonable ſhould find no oppoſition: <hi>But to ſuch

He never was in Armes, and I believe, can eaſily anſwer
any thing that can be objected (ſave his Religion) why
he ſhould be from under Sequeſtration. Let me intreat
you to ſpeak to as many of your acquaintance as you can,
that when it comes to be moved, it may not be repulſed.
I could heartily wiſh you and Mrs. <hi>Weſtrow,</hi> and the <hi>Doctor</hi>

By this Letter it is apparent,</p>
            <p>That the Jeſuited Papiſts in <hi>France</hi> are in ſuch oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our King for his compliance with his Houſes of
Parliament to ſettle the Kingdome, and extirpate <hi>Maſſe</hi>
and <hi>Popery,</hi> that they are not to be reconciled to him; and
therefore indeavour to depoſe and bring him to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and diſinherit his poſterity.</p>
            <p>That their hopes to effect this their deſigne againſt, and
execute this their revenge upon the King, are now upon
the <hi>Army,</hi> to whom they wiſh all proſperity.</p>
            <p>That they foment, and proſecute with their prayers
and advice, the Armies <hi>new Modell</hi> for ſetling of a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
in Parliament,</hi> of purpoſe to diſſolve this preſent
Parliament, (which hath acted ſo much againſt them and
their Popiſh Religion, and is now giving it its finall and
fatall blow, if they and the King ſhall cloſe) and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
all Parliaments for the future, for feare of falling into
the like danger by them.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Independents,</hi> and friends of the <hi>Army</hi> have a far
better opinion of <hi>Roman Catholikes,</hi> then <hi>Engliſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi>
as being better <hi>principled to make members of a free
Commonwealth then they:</hi> And therefore are more likely
to favour, and cloſe with <hi>Roman Catholikes,</hi> then <hi>Engliſh
Proteſtants,</hi> in carrying on their new deſignes, expreſſed in
their late Remonſtrance.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholikes</hi> are <hi>extremely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſted
with Regall hereditary power throughout the world,</hi>
the onely obſtacle to their deſignes, in ſubverting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, and making all Kingdoms meere vaſſalls
to the Pope and Sea of Rome; and therefore the Officers
and Army in proſecuting their Remonſtrance, and new
intended Repreſentative, and ſubverting Regall heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power, do moſt apparently carry on nought elſe but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:162499:8"/>
the very Jeſuites and <hi>Roman Catholikes</hi> Intereſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
and accompliſh their deſires, either wittingly or
willingly, as acting by their principles, if not counſells,
and aiming at their very ends; which is high time
for all wiſe and well-affected Proteſtants both in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
Parliament and City, and our three Kingdoms, moſt
ſeriouſly to conſider and prevent the imminent ruine and
deſtruction even of our Reformed Religion it ſelf, and our
hereditary Monarchy, the preſent and all ſucceeding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments;
our Lives, Liberties and Kingdomes, all now
drawing to their fatall period, by the heady violence, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
and diſobedience of that very Army, which hath
been raiſed, cried up, and truſted upon too much, as their
<hi>onely Saviours,</hi> for which God in juſtice may now make
