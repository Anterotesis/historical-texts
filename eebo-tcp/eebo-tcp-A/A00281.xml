            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>As for their working discorde, the case would quickly be determined, if contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rebellious natures would submit themselues to quiet discipline.

So played the Romanes in prescribing twelue Sergeantes, at corners to gyue attendaunce vpon the Consuls, after that the Kinges were quite displaced, bicause so many were wonte to wayte vpon them while they lyued in chiefest authoritie.

Suche simple soules are as well fed with séeing, as hearing, so muche the better, as nature hathe more sufficiently enhabled them by outwarde sense to discerne the one, than knowledge, skill, or experience to iudge of the other. But séeing nothing will content them, but the very Canon of the Scripture, marke whether the same course were not obserued by the kings of Israell and Iuda, whiche may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Romanes historie.

For other questions of his fauour, linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, or stature, were not in that place demaunded. For confirmation of thys probable coniecture, maye be alleaged, that not onely Elias ware a mantell himselfe in execution of his office, but

But for a conclusion, to make shorte worke, I woulde gladly vnderstande, whether of them selues suche thinges be indifferent, or not: if they graunte them indifferent, both the Prince may lawfully commaunde them, and by this commaundement procéeding from Gods Lieuetenant generall, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are enforced to weare them, the Princes Iniunction quite remouing the indifferencie, and restrayning the libertie of the thyng, and byndyng the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of hym whiche of pretensed malice breaketh it, for this is, <hi>to giue vnto Cesar</hi>

But put the case equalitie were approued &amp; allowed among the Apostles, séeing that all they were chosen after one maner, by one person, and to one voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extraordinarie, séeing they were all so plentifully and aboundantly inspired

was a difference among the legall priests in honour, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there oughte to be the lyke among the Christians. But here me thinkes I heare a muttering, that for as muche as the highe Prieste in the lawe bare a figure of our sauiour Christ, whiche vanished at his comming, the lyke preheminence cannot be continued in our Christian Cleargie. No manne doubteth I suppose, but the legall priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood beyng a shaddow of the truthe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at the passion and eternall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Melchisedech, whiche was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered once for all. But that the highe Prieste was more a figure than the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Priestes discharging the same due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though for honours sake he be after named, or that the Prieste were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a figure partly in respect of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not onely for his office, is more than euer the aduersarie shall be able to mayntayne. I knowe S. Paule to the Hebrues compareth the sacrifice vppon <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 9. 10.</note> the Crosse made for oure redemption, with the highe Priestes oblation among the Iewes, and rather matcheth Christe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1225:32"/>
with the high priest than the other, for the more honorable comparison, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mutuall prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, than bicause the other vsing the same sacrifice which he did, bare not as well the figure of Christe as he: wherfore as they will haue no high minister bicause the high priest represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christe in figure, so may we in like sorte reiect the meaner ministers, bicause the inferiour Priestes were likewise fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of our Sauiour Christe and of his office. And as strong is the argument of the one side, as of the other. But if we shoulde graunt them that the high Priest onely were a figure of Christ to come, and therfore the office beyng now decayed the degrée must like wise perish: yet seyng the ministers of Christ represent him nowe paste (vnlesse our sauiour beyng glorified haue loste some of his glory) I knowe not why his ministers may not shine in as perfect glory, &amp; so muche greater as truth excéedeth shaddowes. Wherefore eyther must they now denie that ministers are the deputies of our sauiour Christ (which were to great absurditie) or els alleadge
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1225:32"/>
some reason why the nearer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth they drawe, the further they shoulde be from dignitie. For euen as obseruing of the paschall lambe was a figure of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christe and quite abolished by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Crosse, notwithstanding the same matter be yet kepte in memory by an other figure, which is the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Christes body and bloud: Euen so, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the legall priesthood be now abolished &amp; quite displaced, yet why the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence may not yet remayne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of the highe priest glorified whiche was kepte in figure of the highe priest not yet incarnate, no reason hath bene yet alleaged. Sure I am that the same proportion that is betwene the one figure and the other, is betwene one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister and another. Wherefore by good reason ought he whiche representeth that which Christ hath done, be of as great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as he whiche figured that whiche Christ should do: and so muche more as our benefite is greater. And to proue that of necessitie the honour is not linked or annexed to the office, I can proue that S.

Neyther can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuate house be well directed, where the meaner sort stand not in awe of some speciall officer.

And whereas they can brooke in no respecte the direction of a Dioces, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no mention is made of any such by Christ our sauiour, I can likewise saye, that seeing Christ our sauiour before hys departure hence, tooke speciall order for no calling, but onely of the Apostles, nor in any of the foure Euangelistes mention is made of any minister tyed to a certayn congregation, but lefte at large to choose a place wherein to sounde the gladsome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, as appeareth by the last commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Math. 28. Therfore euery congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Math. 28 Mar. 16.</note> maye not haue their minister. But some man will alleage that touching this poynt order was after taken by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. I graunt there was, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there would haue béene for gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dioceses, if the Apostles traueil had béene blessed with so great encrease in their owne time, as that Prouinces as faste as Parishes would haue embraced sincere religion. For seeing that to Peter was committed the Churche of all the Iewes, as Paule had speciall care and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1225:40"/>
ouersight of all the Gentiles. I can not <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> thinke that these Apostles woulde haue indged the gouernment and direction of a shire or two, to be a matter of so great importance, but that by Gods assistance the viligence of a diligent and watchefull pastor might easily ouercome it. In deede if any man will vndertake to be the only preacher in a shire, or <hi>vniuersus Episcopus, <hi>vniuersall Bishop</hi>
                  </hi> in a Prouince, as Iohn the Ambitious prelate of Constantinople woulde haue beene in Gregories time, there were good reason to abate so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a tyrannie: but seeing euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe is nowe furnished of an able and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient pastor, and Bishops onely kéepe the place of Moses, to whome the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magistrates referred the causes of greatest weighte, as the Scripture sayth, <hi>Leuiora tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modo iudicantes, <hi>iudging onely</hi>

                  </hi> I neyther sée any reason of abridging their authoritie, nor spoyling the Churche of so necessarie and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instrumentes. To chalenge this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regatiue is not (as same deuise) to striue for Monarchies, but to maynteyne that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1225:40"/>
regimente and pollicie whiche euer hathe beene reckened of greatest value, and moste long continuance. We know that euery famous Citie had a territorie annexed vnto it, as a braunch and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the common wealth, which as well in spirituall causes muste be ruled by the Bishop of that Sea, as in ciuill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, guided by the ciuill Magistrate. For let our discoursing Preachers quarel as long as they list, and with as good right as sometyme the Phariseys dyd boast and vaunt them selues of <hi>verbum Domini, <hi>the worde of the Lorde,</hi>
                  </hi> yet neuer shall it bée thoughte expediente for any state to exempte the smaller Uillages from the iurisdiction of the greatest Cities. For myne owne parte (as one desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to bée taughte) fayne woulde I heare some reason alleaged, why Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie béeyng Byshop at Ephesus (as no doubte he was) hadde not aswell the ouersighte of the Prouince belonging to the citie, as the citie it selfe, or if any man will be so malicious as to quarrell wyth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1225:41"/>
so playne a president, and allowe himselfe for his parte no more, bicause no more is mentioned, I woulde gladly heare what could be sayde to Titus, that had committed to his charge not one Citie as Ephesus, but one whole Ilande, as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande is, and that in as large and ample manner as can be deuised. If S. Paule had mentioned any speciall Towne, for the gouernment of whiche he left Titus there, it mighte be thought that the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and limites of his iurisdiction neuer could haue reached further than the firste appoyntment. But séeing he nameth no particular, but cleaueth to the generall, séeing he sayth not, <hi>ideò reliqui te Egubii, <hi>I haue therefore lefte thee at Egubium,</hi>
                  </hi> but <hi>ideò reliqui te Cretae, <hi>I haue therfore left thee in Creta,</hi>
                  </hi> I am persuaded in conscience that not any one citie only, but the whole countrey was allotted to his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Of this opinion are diuers excellent and learned Fathers, the very sound of whose authoritie without further stresse, were sufficient to shake M. Cartwright out of his paynted and disguised plumes, with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1225:41"/>
derision of all the auditorie. Neyther doth the Bishops iurisdictions anye more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the regiment of Christ our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in his Churche (whatsoeuer be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out to make the cause more odious) than Moses, Iosua, or Gedeon did among the Iewes, the latter of whiche number, though he were the guyde and leader of the people, yet playnly and openly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that neyther he woulde rule them, <note place="margin">Iud. 8.</note> nor his sonne, but God him selfe shoulde gouerne them. And in this respect the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of God, considering whose lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants they are, and whose charge they occupie, haue oftentimes accepted those curtesies at Princes hands, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they coulde not iustly, nor of duetie chalenge. So did Elizeus suffer king Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">2. Reg. 13.</note> to visite him in the time of his sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Samuell refused not the honor <note place="margin">1. Sam. 13</note> done him by king Saule, in comming foorth to méete him.</p>
               <p>But some man will say perhaps, a dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse is to large a Prouince for one man to gouerne: so could I answere, a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is to great a burden for one Prince
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1225:42"/>
to discharge. But as the one maye be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a wise and vertuous gouernour, so keeping those two grounds that euery particular congregation haue an able pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and only the greatest matters be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Bishop (as with vs they are) the other may aswell be ruled by a godly and zelous Bishop. It is straunge that one highe Priest was able to resolue all doubtes, decide controuersies, attend cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and exercise all other iurisdiction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to the Church and Gods religion, without omitting one day the dayly and continuall sacrifice at Ierusalem: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as twentie and thrée Bishops are nowe thoughte vnsufficiente to ouersée an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, scante in quantitie comprehending a thirde parte of that auncient iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Surely I can not better compare the manner of these fellowes skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, than to the serpent <hi>Hydra,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Hercules</hi> somtime encountred: for euen as for euery head that he stroke off two or three starte vp vpon the sodayne in the selfe same place, euen so our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries striuing to behead the Pope,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1225:42"/>
bring in ten thousande heades or Popes into his place, and exempting euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate minister from any superiour within his owne precinct, shape out a monster more vgly to beholde a thousande times than euer it was before. I would be lothe to presse their consciences to examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too déepely vpon this poynte, Howe they can disgest a Princes gouernment ouer many states, that wyll not allowe a Bishops iurisdictions ouer a few shires. I am sure it is more harde to discharge one than the other. And where soeuer in the Scripture they can proue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of a godly Prince euer many countreys, I will proue the superioritie of a Bishop or highe Priest ouer those shyres. God graunte that this plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme béeing squared out by the president of the Heluetians discipline, carrie not a smacke or sauour of their pollicie, which hathe bereft and spoyled aswell first the Clergie men, then after the Nobilitie and gentlemen of their honour and authoritie, as the Bishops of their dignitie, and by equall authoritie iustifie bothe attempts.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1225:43"/>
No man I think is ignorant but as great care and warinesse is requisite in a king, as in a Bishop, or if any oddes appeare betwéene them, the Prince susteyneth the greater burden, in as much as he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth both with causes spirituall and ciuil, directing both Priest and people. It were pity these Crocodiles egges should be hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to soone: if wisedome preuente the worst, no doubt the best will prouide and care for it selfe. And as it is an ill argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proue that the Princes charge shoulde be diminished, bicause it is very great, &amp; rather inferreth this consequent, that bicause it is greate, therefore more paynes must be taken in discharge of so waightie an office: so maye we answere for the Cleargie.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1225:45"/>
what néedes any other to supply y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> roome? But now the Apostleship is quite extinct, and yet the same necessitie of a superiour, for preseruing of vnitie and good order, dothe yet remayne. Neyther may thys degrée be thought vnaduisedly appoynted by our auncestors, nor spared without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst al godly Christians: and though the worde <hi>Archiepiscopus, <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi>
                  </hi> be not in the law, yet words of the same effect, as <hi>summus sacerdos, princeps sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, princeps prophetiae, <hi>the highe priest, the chief priest, the chief of prophecie,</hi>
                  </hi> and such like, are not wanting. But séeing nothing but the very worde it selfe will please them, what if a man should reason thus? The same that <gap reason="foreign">

I maruell what coulde be answered: where fynde they in the lawe the name of Deacon, as it is nowe vsed? and yet I am sure they wyll not vanishe it for lacke of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authoritie: wherefore the Church béeing guyded by offices, and not by ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1225:46"/>
as it was lawfull for the Apostles at the first beginning of the Churche, to deuise a newe name for a newe office: so likewyse, séeing this quiet and securitie in religion craueth another kind of regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, than those stormes and persecutions dyd, I would be answered, why the office bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tolerable, and as the world goeth now very necessarie and expediense, a name may not be coyned, according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the calling, without any former president?

For surely to beléeue that in matters of forme we ought to be tyed or fettered to the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Christes Church, and neuer learne to walke alone, or still to féede on milke, and neuer taste any stronger foode, is as ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1225:46"/>
that God hathe quite debarred hys Church, either from inuenting, disposing, altering, or reforming of suche things as were not at the first more profitable, than nowe they séeme pernicious. Them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues haue dubbed some petie doctours by the name of Superintendents, and yet no suche name read or mentioned in the scripture. For the proofe of Primates or Archbishops functions out of the worde of God, hath very learnedly béene allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the president of Titus, whome both Erasmus and other learned wryters thinke to haue béene an Archbishop. But this can not agrée with M. Cartwrights stomake, least the cause should begin now to faynt or hang downe head, wheron he hath already layd so many lustie wagers.

               <p>Now to S Ambrose, I will not denie but in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der grasse &amp; spring of Christs religion, for want of godly and religious Magistrates, bicause all questions and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious articles, were for the moste parte ended and determined before vnfaithfull iudges, I will not denie, I say, but vpon the Apostles charitable admonition, a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

more euidently for iustifying of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the Admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where it proues by sound authoritie, that Seniors were more néedful at the first tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now? What can be more strong, I saye, for prouing that conclusion, than that <hi>ratio finalis, <hi>the finall cause,</hi>

               <p>Now, if this be true that euery congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had their seniors, it is not like that Antioch, where Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s first tooke their name, was vnprouided of so necessarie an office.

occasion of their errour, springes not so much by other mens example, as by their owne persuasion, reteyning yet a smacke of that realitie, whiche sometime they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued, and can not lightly be remoued. So that in myne opinion, the very way to bring them from this errour, is not to sitte, as vsually we doe at common meat, nor to come and gadde vp and downe the Churche, as men doe at the market, snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching bread héere, and wyne there: but with good authoritie to persuade them to a better iudgement. For no reason it is that we to bring other from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, should detract due reuerence from Gods holy Sacraments. The answere to the Admonition very learnedly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that bicause this Sacrament is a thankesgiuing for all the benefites of our redemption, therefore kneelyng is the fittest site and position of the body. Master Cartwrighte replyeth, that then our knéeling shoulde come after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing, bicause in the very action our mindes ought wholly to be occupied in meditations of the benefite, which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

I coulde very well allowe, if there were a meditation voyd of thankfulnesse. But our mouthes béeing ful, sayth he, we are vnfit to speake. Wel reasoned surely, &amp; like a Bacheler of Diuinitie. Is no man thankful vnlesse he doe expresse his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning verbally? or, doth God respecte our speach more than the zeale &amp; sinceritie of our heart? The ende of M. Cartwrightes meditation is, that afterward we may be the more inflamed. And I thinke rather that presently we may be kindled: séeing in the breaking of bread the passion of Christ béeing represented, oughte in one moment to stirre vp all our powers and senses to be thankfull for our deliuerance out of Egypte. Wherefore, as I lyke of meditations in receyuing, so can I not allowe any of that kind, which is not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thankefulnesse. And whereas grace at meate is compared with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing at the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion (though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison make me blushe in his behalfe, yet seing he must be folowed) I answere, the benefite not to be equall, and therfore the forme &amp; maner of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

Wherefore (seeing the more playnly we discerne the resurrection, the greater is our libertie) it followeth, that much more vnto vs, than those which liued vnder the lawe, this mourning for the dead is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But who tolde M. Cartw. that our sight is clearer in the resurrection, than the fathers was whiche lyued vnder the lawe? In déede Christ had not yet rysen for example, whome S.

And as I can not denie but the fayth of godly persons was greatly strengthned in this article by the rising of our sauiour, so was there nothing added to the soundnesse of their opinion, no more than his comming made those which embraced him, to thinke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his power, than they did expecte in hope, before they could enioy the fruition of his presence.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1225:83"/>
vnto oure matter whence wée haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed: nowe that Scripture dothe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to fayle the aduersarie, common reason or rather priuate fantasies muste supplie the wante of learning. Twoo freshe argumentes therefore are allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to exclude this mournyng: one, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause oftentimes it happeneth, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mourning gowne lurketh a mery harte: another, for that it séemeth daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous by suche instrumentes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke our double sorrowe. Suche trifling circumstances were not vnfitte to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie a yong mans tale in a schoole of Rhetoricke, but howe they will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Churche of Christe, for the ouerthrowyng of a custome so auncient, godly, ciuile, and vniuersally receyued, I referre to euery mans pryuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. But to be shorte, I answere to the firste, that by the same reason wee may aswell forbidde assemblies in the Churche, and publike prayer, bycause many are more busilie occupied in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of theyr haruest, than harkenyng to the Scripture, and though there be some
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1225:84"/>
greater necessitie in comming to the Churche than wearing mournyng gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, yet seyng the one is aswell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, and iustifiable by the worde of God, as the other, the abuse ought to be of no greater force for remouing one, than another. If hypocrisie in some may condemne simplicitie in others, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders bée neglected, bycause some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time vnder a pleasaunt rose there lurkes a prini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What soeuer hath bene sayde touching abuse in other things before, may serue this turne agayne. And therefore to the seconde poynt I answere, that who so euer is not pinched with griefe vpon the very chaunce it selfe, will lesse bée moued with the garment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it cannot grounde a sorrowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be procured by some other meane, no more can it encrease a sorrowe where
