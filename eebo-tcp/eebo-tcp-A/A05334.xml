            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O begin by that is first necessaryly to be vnderstood, albeit I haue sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly treated of it in another booke ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to this, which containeth an easie instruction to the plaine Tabletur of the Lute, and the ordering of the hand theruppon, the Reader must vnderstand that the fiue lynes represent the fiue stringes of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the space last belowe the sixt or great basse.</p>
               <p>Mine entent is now to teach them that are desirous to playe on the Lute, how they maye without great knowledge of Musicke set vppon that instrument all Ballets or songes, which they shall thinke good, so as they can onely sing, <hi>vt, re, my, fa, sol, la,</hi> &amp; know the valuation or time of notes, without that that it shalbe néedefull for them any farther to wade for the knowledge of any composition or concordes, that is to say, that it shall suffise them to knowe that this note <gap reason="music">

                  </gap> called a sembrief, in the measure of two signified by this figure <gap reason="music">

               <p>To enter then into the ground of this present Art: all our Musicke consisteth in eight tunes although <hi>Glarian</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would deuide them into a greater number, as farre as twelue. The first whereof as consequently of all the rest we will treate of by rules and examples.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>The first Chapter of the first Tune of Musicke.</head>
               <p>FOR the first tune we wil take for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple the song of <hi>Orland de Lassus</hi> beginning <hi>Quand mon mary vie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t de dehors,</hi> in which we must firstly set the treble: the first note wherof being in <hi>gsolreut</hi> must be set on the second string of the Lute open, that is to lay, so as the finger of the left hand do not toutch vpon that string: although we sée in other tunes that the treble ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> serueth for <hi>Gsolreut,</hi> and sometime for <hi>Ffaut,</hi> as in the sixt tune. True it is that such as be cunning in this Art, do dispose of them diuersly at their pleasure: but it is not to them that I direct my present worke. Now of these eight tunes there is made a difference of foure called the Master or principall tunes, that is to say, the first, the third, the fift, the seuenth, and of foure called their sequels or seruants, which be the second, the fourth, the sixt &amp; the eight. Of these eight the first &amp; second end in <hi>re,</hi> the third and fourth in <hi>my,</hi> the fift and sixt in <hi>fa,</hi> the seuenth and eight in <hi>sol:</hi> notwithstanding that there may be a changing or trasposition, as in the first and second tune from <hi>Re</hi> of <hi>Gsolreut,</hi> and from <hi>Re</hi> of <hi>Dlasolre,</hi> and so in the other of diuers <hi>My, Fa, sol.</hi> To retorne then to the discourse of the first tune, we haue to giue a reason wherfore we haue before ordered, that the second string of the Lute open
<pb facs="tcp:7055:6"/>
shal serue for <hi>Gsolreut,</hi> which is because this first tune hath his retche or compasse a fourth or foure notes higher then the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as contrariwise the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hath his retch or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe a fourth lower. So is it of the other six tunes, that euery Mastertune hath alwaies his retch or compasse higher by a fourth and the sequeles or seruaunt tunes, the base likewise contrary. Now must bée vnderstood the cause why herebefore we haue layed for foundation, that in setting songs to the Lute, we procéede by sembreues, Which is by occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature &amp; dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this instrument, as it is likewise in that of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Uirginalles, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary in Orga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For in Orga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the tune may hold a Maxim being as long as eight sembreues, yea and longer by meanes of the wind continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> by the bellowes. But in the other two instruments their sound, which dependeth altogither by the toutch of the fingers, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure longer then a sembreue: if the string on the one, or the key on the other, be not touched againe by the hand: which is the reason in consequence, that forceth vs when we set in Tablature, to deuide Maxims alwayes in eight partes, Longes in foure, Breues in two, and so forth of other great notes which are augmented with pricks. Herein lieth the reason for the Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie of the woord.</p>
               <p>To omit nothing of the whole instruction of the Tablature of the Lute, I haue diuised this foundacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be thereunto neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: that is to saye, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of musick to set a song by setting forth the retch or compasse of all the notes in euery one of the foure partes, by examples of the first Tune in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> song <hi>Qand mon mary vient de dehors,</hi> where I haue set forth all the notes as far as they did retch in the whole making of that song. In the which I haue to aduertise you, that there is first to be seen, the letters of the tablature, aunswerable to the note of the song, and the vnissons which maye chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strings of the Lute.</p>
               <p>Also the reader shall find in the example of the Base, that in the first note we were dryue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue recours to the eight aboue, as yt appereth in the Retche or compas: which must serue herafter for a generall rule in all other songs here giuen for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: that is to wete, aswell for refuge to the said eights, as to the compasse of the note. Which I wold to be vnderstood for all songs of the first Tune, which ar to be set on the Lute: in which it cannot be often found that they excede this compasse aboue one note higher or lower. And so shall it be presupposed of the other Tunes following, and likewyse of the compasse of them. Here I will not forgette to tell that the learner of this Arte, may not faile after he hath set out his Treble in Tablature to tel diligently all the measures of the same, for feare of this Inconuenience, which chaunceth oftentymes, yea to the most expert for Lacke of this diligence, to goo ouer and beginne againe the woorke nowe already half doon, for that there maye happen to muche or to littell: so as if the foundacion be not good, all that is Laied vpon must nedes goo to ruyne.</p>

In this example of the Treble, I haue to aduertise you vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fowerth distaunce, in which ye se a marke of the value of a Minim, without any other letter in the Tablature vnder it, that thesame procedeth because of the pricke, whiche is in the Musick ioyned to a Semibreue of the third <abbr>distauce</abbr>: and that folowyng a rule, which we haue giuen you before, that the Lute strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out once, could not hold the sound aboue the time of one semibreue: whiche must bee vnderstoode for the perfection of the more greater harmonie: albeit that the sounde of the stryng, might partly endure the value of a pricke added, or of the half more, but the sound towards the ende is alwaies naturally of lesse force, as the seconde sounde of an Echo in his doublyng. So maie the pricke of the Semibreue (as it shall like hym that setteth, be left out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beyng marked with any letter in Tablature, or els be marked by the discretion, and iudgement of the eare. For it is certain that the sounde is more strong, and of longer tariyng, accordyng to the goodnes of the Lute.</p>

I will not here forget to tell you, that cunnyng Maisters (to giue remedie to this defecte) heighten their plaie vpon the Tablature, as many notes as thei thinke good.

Of whiche Tune I giue you here for example, the Song of <hi>Orland,</hi> beginnyng, <hi>En vu lieu ou l'on ne voit goutte,</hi> whiche endeth in <hi>Ffaut,</hi> to the whiche the greate Base of the Lute serueth open, notwithstandyng, that in many of the other Tunes, it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for <hi>Gsolreut,</hi> and for other also, whereof I will not make you a certaine rule, and speciall determination, because thesame passeth by the discrecion of the maister, who to make hymself sporte in his plaie, or to ioyne with some other Instrumentes, whereof he would make a noise, doeth sette hym high or lowe, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng any scruple for the losyng sometyme of some little note. Wee will not repete here the rule for Tripler, whereof this song is full in many places, that there three muste bee obserued for twoo vnder one measure, because we haue sufficiently declared it in former Chapiters. The scholer maie not thinste it straunge, if while the Treple dure, he findeth but Minims marked in the Tablature in steade of Semibreues. The reason is, for that where there should be so many Breues, thei must be stricken twise, whiche were but a foolishe maner. For we haue alreadie tolde, that a good Lute will holde his sounde, as long as a Semibreue, and his pricke, and the Brief in Triple is no more in valewe, wherefore to make plaine this hardnes, I haue marked the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breues into Minims, whiche for all that, shall goe no faster nor slower, then if thei were Semibreues, beyng no difference nor perfection, more in the one, then in the other.</p>

Because that this Tune of his ordinarie propertie, is not accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to extende to those twoo loste notes, so lowe as the Musician would here for the poursuite and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his pastyme. Now is there in this song present, many thynges worthie to bee noted, in certaine distaunces of thesame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that in the example better poolished followyng, there is remedie to bee perceiued for all the difficulties, but the reader could not perceiue them, because the knowledge could not be had but in the setting. The first is in the seuenth space, where the highest <hi>C.</hi> must holde a whole Semibreue for the Countertenour, if the diuision in the Treble did not take awaie one quauer from him whiche thou shalt finde the meanes to saue vnto hym in the .22. distaunce folowyng. In the .16. distaunce there is a runnyng point whiche is made to obserue the letters with the Musick: whereby bothe the Tenour and the Base bee letted, wherefore it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there to make that pointe all plaine, then so muche to hinder those twoo partes, although it bee not to bee seen so in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce (alreadie by me amended there) as it is set out in the Musicke. In the .31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> distaunce is laste the pricke of the Countertenor in the beginnyng of the measure, where there is place to haue set him, but wee haue tolde before that the pricke is not stricken, wherefore it is better lefte out then stricken againe. In the .65. distaunce, the seconde Minim leeseth half his valure, by reason of a Cratchet in the Treble, and cannot be otherwise doen, for the constraine of the other partes.</p>

For so muche as this Tune, of the whiche there bee founde sondrie songes and ballettes, doeth ende in <hi>Alamire,</hi> without transposition, and beyng transposed in <hi>Dlasolre,</hi> by <hi>b.</hi> sharpe. In this example here sette forthe vnto you, there is seen in the 13. distaunce (whiche hath been often seen in some other of the former examples) that is to saie the laste halfe of the Minime of the Base, by reason of the commyng of a certaine passage trauersyng, as it is ordinarily founde in all Musicke. In the .35. distaunce there is founde a like difficultie in that, that of necessitie, the halfe of the laste Minim must be loste of the Treble, or of the Countertenour. But the beste is to leaue out the laste Cratchette of the Countertenour, whiche is cause of this trouble, as you maie see that I haue lefte hym out in the seconde Tablature of thesame song, more cunnyngly sette forthe. In the .82. distaunce is loste the pricke of the first Minim of the Base, but the place of this pricke is voide, whiche I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For ende and conclusion of this woorke, wee haue none other thyng to holde you with, but that it hath not been by negligence, or not takyng heede, that wee haue not added yet more examples of son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ballettes of three, fiue, sixe, seuen, and eight partes. But I haue doen it by reason, that who shalbe diligently exercised in the Tablature of fower partes onely: whiche I haue set forthe in this boke, shall not finde any newe difficultie, in that he would sette mo partes: that is to saie, that there is no further thyng to bée considered and obserued, but the rules largely set forthe and desciphered by our Chapiters, as aboue all, the chaunge and alteration of the value of notes of one parte, in the commyng in and ioynyng with the other partes Also that there must bee excused some leauyng out of accordes, sometyme for the necessitie of the bearyng of the instrument, whiche is not for all that, to condempne the Lute alone of imperfection: the Harpe, Uirginals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made of like harmonie, hauyng all nede of like excuse.</p>
