            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O diſcourſe of the excellency and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the noble <hi>Game of Cheſſe,</hi> would require a farre larger volume then my occaſion will permit to write, my intention being onely at the expreſſion of this Kingdomes affaires, which fitly may be Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically deſcribed by the battaile of the <hi>Cheſſe;</hi> yet cannot I omit to tell you, that this <hi>Cheſſe</hi> is the ancienteſt of all games of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being invented (as is credibly affirmed) by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> many yeeres before the nativity of our Saviour, to avoid idleneſſe among his ſouldiers, when hee led thoſe great and ſtupendious armies that levelled mountaines, and drunke up rivers in their paſſage into <hi>Greece:</hi> and indiſputably, it is allowed to be the moſt excellent and ingenious of all games, being far ſuperior to Cards or Tables, which depend as much on the uncertaine diſpoſition of chance, as upon the game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters skill or cunning, when this of <hi>Cheſſe</hi> is meerly directed by the ſtrength of wit and judgement: the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> whoſe

gravity in carriage is famous above all Nations, having it in ſo much eſteeme, that they will allow any ſtranger to be a Gentleman that can play at the <hi>Cheſſe.</hi> But according to my promiſe, to avoyd prolixity, I ſhall briefly to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Allegory.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt take into conſideration, who are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall combatants in this battell, and wee ſhall finde to be two different armies, Black and White; over each of which is a King, and Queen; their aſſiſtants, <hi>Biſhops, Knights, Rooks,</hi> and <hi>Pawnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt for the King, Hee is the principall leader on of his men, the Queen as his Lievtenant Generall, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> his Counſellors, the <hi>Knights</hi> his ſupreme Officers, the <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Pawnes</hi> his Gentlemen or Cavaliers, and mercenary ſouldiers. This being preſuppoſed, the application of this Allegoricall Game will be very eaſily alluded to the preſent buſineſſe of this Realme.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the blacke Army at <hi>Cheſſe,</hi> ſignifies juſtly and aptly his Majeſties, which bath produced ſo many blacke and bloody effects in this Kingdome, and ſo many plunderings, rapines and murthers, that the beautious face of this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Land is beſtained and bedewed with blood; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof beaten and terrified out of their peaceful dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, their goods diſpoyled and taken away by his Majeſties <hi>Rooks,</hi> namely the Cavaliers: and if the Euxine ſea is called the blacke ſea, out of its blacke effects, certainly by the ſame reaſon that may be termed the blaoke Army.</p>
            <p>The white Army, which is the Enſigne and Badge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, betokens the Parliaments Army, raiſed for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ſafety of the Common-wealth, againſt the ſaid blacke Army of Malignants.

this Kingdome firſt gave life to thoſe fearefull and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Monopolies, begging ſuch things to themſelves as were deſtructive to the eſſence of the peoples liberties, and the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome; and when they, like common ſouldiers, or forlorne hopes, had led the way to this game of death and deſtruction, forward ſteps the <hi>Rooks, viz.</hi> the Cavaliers, young Gentlemen of as deſperate fortunes as conditions, and they fall pell mell into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, perceiving the white <hi>Knights, viz.</hi> the honourable the high Court of Parliament aſſembled to ſtop the violent torrent of the <hi>Pawnes</hi> proceedings, inſtill into his Majeſtie, that there was no ſafety for him, againſt the endevours of the white <hi>Knights,</hi> if he did not ſtraight forſake their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, and betake himſelfe to open hoſtility and armes, that ſo this Kingdome, which in the precedent yeeres of his father, and his owne peacefull raigne, had beene gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Lawes and Juſtice; might fall into the hands of the ſouldiery, that they whoſe armes had long time ruſted in eaſe might againe be put into uſe, that they who had no eſtates at all might have a military licencious priviledge to prey upon the eſtates of others, which how they have done is to the whole Kingdome perſpicuous; and communicating their intents with the blacke <hi>Knights,</hi> namely, ſuch of his Majeſties Cabinet-Councellors and the diſcontented Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (as either ambition, or their owne paſſed crimes had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered obnoxious to the juſt cenſure of the white <hi>Knights)</hi> they found them ready to aſſiſt their malevolent and ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purpoſes, and they in their degree, as they are at <hi>Cheſſe,</hi> being neere the King, with open out-cryes, inſtill into his Majeſties too credulous eares unheard jealouſies, feares and ſuppoſitions, and intimated to him, that the white <hi>Knights</hi> intended to abridge his Royall prerogative, and quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the dignity of Kings to confine the Regall power to limits, and leſſen his authority deſcendent to him from his Anceſtors; but fearing their owne perſwaſions would not be prevalent enough to ſet him into open hoſtility with

the white <hi>Knights</hi> they draw into their confederay the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> who apted for innovations readily joyned in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, telling his Majeſty, that the purity of Religion was perverted; that divers new and unheard of Schiſmes and Hereſies were crept up in the Church, of which he was bound to be the Defendor; that the white <hi>Knights</hi> by reducing an <hi>Annarchy</hi> upon the Church, ſought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſame upon the ſoveraignty, that their power Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall being <hi>de jure Divino,</hi> was correlative and conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Majeſty; and if that the one were taken away, the other could not ſtand, uſing all the ſubtile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions ambition and malice (which are two pernitious counſellors) could invent, to ſet afire the aduſt melancholy in His Majeſty: the Queen too (wrought upon by their means) incenſing the King to this diſſention with the white <hi>Knights,</hi> namely, his Parliament, at laſt it tooke effect according to their wiſhes, and his Majeſty pretending hee could not be in ſafety at his owne Palace, withdrew himſelfe thence into the North, (after the tranſportation of his Queene) who, as his Lievtenant Generall, was to furniſh him from beyond the Seas with forraigne ſupplies, and from the North, as the Proverb teſtifies, can come no goodneſſe, and there drew his army of <hi>Pawnes</hi> and <hi>Rooks,</hi> Cavaliers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> diſcontented, Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Clergy together, and with banner diſplayed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to bid the white <hi>Knights</hi> battell; who ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo endangered by the malice of their enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to beſtir themſelves, ſummoning their <hi>Pawnes,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well-affected ſouldiers, their <hi>Rooks,</hi> valiant Gentlemen and loyall ſubjects; their <hi>Knights,</hi> thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry, that ſtood for the good of the Kingdome, and liberty of the Subject; their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the religious and untainted Clergie, they created themſelves in ſtead of a King and Queene, a Lievtenant Generall, and a Generall to mannage their army, and fight the Lords battells againſt that blacke Regiment of Cavaliers, and ſo advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the Enemy. The game at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> being now begun, firſt fell to it the <hi>Pawnes</hi> on both ſides, the <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Knights</hi> ſighting with much fortitude and courage; the innocence of the cauſe on the white <hi>Knights</hi> ſide ſo animating their valiant <hi>Pawnes</hi> and <hi>Rooks,</hi> that on the black <hi>Rooks,</hi> the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, they fell with much force and violence, diſordering their Rankes, taking divers of them priſoners, and ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others; for the blacke <hi>Biſhops,</hi> they were taken priſoners by the white ones, and their <hi>Knights;</hi> and according to the cuſtome of <hi>Cheſſe,</hi> put into a bag, divers of them being impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and the wings of their authority which ſoared ſo high, clipt ſo neare, that they can now fly no more then tame Jack-dawes. But yet the fight was not ended, thoſe ſturdy Knaves, the blacke <hi>Rooks,</hi> the Cavaliers, rallying themſelves againe together, and as it were leading His Majeſty captive to <hi>Oxford,</hi> have there intrenched themſelves, and made ſince divers attempts upon the white <hi>Knights</hi> forces, whoſe Generall (vigilant on all occaſions that might advantage this parties cauſe, and ſecure the Common-wealth) hath met thoſe miſchievous <hi>Rooks</hi> divers times, and given them ſtrange and advantagious overthrowes; yet they according to their naturall condition, perverſe and malignant, will not be perſwaded to ſubmit to authority, or to ſuffer the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be in peace, but with continuall excurſions and inrodes, they invade the Subjects Eſtates and Perſons that continue firme in their Allegiance to the King and the white <hi>Knights,</hi> plundering their Houſes, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their wives and daughters to their luſts; ſo that the cry of their iniquity hath even aſcended up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and called out on the divine omnipotence for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt their beſtiall and abominable cruelties. The blacke Biſhops in the meane time ſtirring up the people to their part, by wreſting Texts of Scripture to ſerve their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo that when this battell at the <hi>Cheſſe</hi> between the white and blacke Houſes will be ended, ſurpaſſes my skill in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123817:5"/>
propheſie, to determine. The only way to end this deſperate conflict in my opinion, were if His ſacred Majeſty would be pleaſed to hearken to the counſels of the white <hi>Knights,</hi> and re-aſſociate himſelfe with them; giving up his blacke <hi>Pawnes</hi> and <hi>Rooks,</hi> His Cavaliers and Malignants, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall hands of <hi>Gregory,</hi> who would finiſh all their machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and deſignes with a comfortable halter. If His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would pleaſe to put the reſidue of His blacke <hi>Biſhops</hi> into the ſame bag where their fellowes are; and for His black <hi>Knights,</hi> give them up to be judged by their Peers, who would cenſure them with all equity according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and ſo returne to His proper reſidence with His Queen to <hi>London,</hi> and then no doubt this fatall game at <hi>Cheſſe</hi> would be finiſhed, till when, it is likely to continue in full force and vigor.</p>
