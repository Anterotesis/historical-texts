            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Fyrst as the blessed Virgine dyd conceaue Iesus Christ by fyue woordes, as is it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Gospell of Luke. <hi>Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum</hi>: So lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse the Prieste maketh the true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Christ, by these fyue woordes, <hi>Hoc est enim corpus meum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke i. Math. xxvi.</hi>
                  </note> And as whole Christ immediatly after the consent of Mary, was in her wombe: so lykewyse immediatly after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pronunciation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1499:178"/>
wordes of consecration, the breade is transsubsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated &amp; turned into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true body of Christ. Secondly as the blessed Virgine after shee had broughte forth Christ, dyd beare hym in her handes, &amp; layde hym in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maunger: so likewyse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest after the consecration immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly lyfteth vp the body of Christ, and laieth him down again, &amp; beareth him, &amp; handleth him in his hands. Thirdly, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blessed Virgine was sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wombe, before she conceaued Christ: so likewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest receaueth orders &amp; is annoynted, before he consecrateth.</p>
               <p>For without taking orders he could consecrate nothing: and therfore a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man although he be neuer so holy can do nothing in this matter, although he should pronounce the wordes of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. In consideration whereof, we must know,<note place="margin">A massing priest is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than an Aungel. Note.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the dignitie of priests af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certayne manner doth farre excel the dignitie of Angels. For power to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to none of the Angells, so that the baseste and moste inferioure prieste in the worlde can doe that, whiche the greatest and highest Aungell in heauen can not do.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1499:178"/>
Therefore Barnarde sayeth: O the worshipfull dignitye of priestes, in whose handes the Sonne of God as in the Virgines wombe is incarnate. Wherefore Austen sayeth, that in the consecration of the holy hoste all the heauenly courte serueth hym, that is to say, the priest: and the Lorde of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen commeth downe vnto hym. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose therefore also sayth writing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Luke:<note place="margin">Priests ar to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aboue all Kyngs.</note> Doubte thou not, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Angels are there present, when Christ is present vpon the altare: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> priests are to be honoured aboue all Kinges,<note place="margin">☜</note> Princes, Knyghtes and men of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For a prieste is higher than Kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, more blessed and happye than Aungells, beyng the maker of hys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and therefore he is worthye to bee honoured, &amp;c. Yea let it be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the priest bee euill: yet is he to be honoured for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignitye of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, as it is declared in the decrees.

                  <hi>Fyrst,</hi> Priestes are aboue all Kynges and Princes of the earth, as God say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Ieremye: I haue set thee thys daye ouer Nations and Kingdomes. And this to bee true, appeareth thus. The dignitye of the prieste is such and so great, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it lyeth in his power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate and make Kinges: but all the Kynges of the worlde are not able to make one Priest.

Therefore God oute of hands exalted the Priestes aboue al men, and aboue all creatures, as a certaine Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor sayth, speakyng of Priestes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by nature ye bee men: yet in dignitye ye excell all men. Agayne: A Prieste is hygher than Kynges, more blessed and happye than Aungells, and

               <p>

and vnto men, as the Apostle saith: All Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels are ministring spirits. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is it the dutye of priestes to serue God day &amp; night,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Eyghtly,</hi> God hath honored y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priests in this, that they are in some poyntes like to the most blessed virgine Mary. First, as the most blessed virgin Mary did conceaue thorowe fyue wordes the true body of Christ, <hi>Fiat mihi secundum
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1499:182"/>
verbum tuum,</hi> so likewise the priest tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row fiue words.<note place="margin">

And as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlye after the consent of Marye, whole Christe was in her wombe: so likewise out of hande after the wordes of consecration be pronounced by the priest, the bread is turned into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the very body of Christ, seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the blessed virgine, after she had brought forth Christe, bare hym in her handes, and layde him in the cribe and tooke hym vp agayne: so likewyse the priest after the consecration lifteth vp Christ, and layeth him downe agayne, and beareth hym vnto the sicke, and handleth him with his handes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the blessed virgine was sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified in her wombe,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> God hath honored the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes aboue Aungels, yea, and somwhat also aboue the dignitie of blessed Mary the virgine.<note place="margin">☞</note> First in the dignitie of ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. For a priest is bound to kepe ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny soules, as the Byshop is bounde to looke vpon al the diocesse, and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe the whole worlde, and the Curate hys parishe, as Bernarde saith: O how worthy kepers are they, which so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watche, that they may kepe the soules that are committed vnto them from euerlastyng death. But an Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell hath but one soule committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym for to kepe, as Bernarde testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth: Great is the dignitie of soules, that euery one of them euen from the very tyme of their birth, shoulde haue an aungel appointed for to kepe them. Secondly, in taking and touchyng the body of Christ. The angels doe but see God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 18. The priest maketh God, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth God, and cateth God.</note> as it is written: Their aungels see the face of my Father, whiche is in heauen. But in this is the priest grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gell: for he doth but see God, but the priest handleth hym, yea and eateth him, which was neuer giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any Aungell so to do, but it sufficeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1499:183"/>
hym to beholde God. Thirdly, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secratyng the bodye of Christe. And in this point the priest doth not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the Aungels, but also after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne manner Marye the Mother of Christ: so that the lessest priest on earth is able to do that, whiche the greatest Aungell in Heauen can not doe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith Barnarde: O the dignitie of priestes worthy to be had in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, in whose handes as in the wombe of the Virgine the Sonne of God is incarnate. Austen also saith: In the consecration of the holye host the whole court of Heauen doth seruice to the priest, yea, and the Lorde of heauen commeth downe vnto him. Likewyse saith Ambrose vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luke: Doubt thou not, but that Aungels are there prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t when Christ is present on the altare, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is offered: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ may well say to euery priest, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Esay:<note place="margin">

But contrary to this do all they, that dishonour priestes: and in this they greuouslye offende God, as <hi>Henricus de vrimaria</hi> writing vpon the fourth commaundement saith: Wo be vnto them and euerlasting damnation hangeth ouer their heades, that do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour priestes, speake euill of them, diffame &amp; backbite them:<note place="margin">Against the backbiters of Priests.</note> for they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Sonne of God againe.

An other reason also ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1499:288"/>
for this purpose. For both corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meate &amp; drinke is made fleshe and bloud by the meanes of nature, It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth therfore much more stronglye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the self nature, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to saye, God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble immediatly to make, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread should be tourned into hys bodye, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine into hys bloud.<note place="margin">A wise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and a cupstantial.</note> The second miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bread is daily transsubstantiated into the bodye of God, &amp; yet there is no augmentation or increasing in God. Reason proueth this thing to be true. For al though I know any secret mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I publish to many: although al they thorowe my declaration know it: yet in me alone or in my mynd there is neuer the more augmentation for al this. The thyrde miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of God is dayly receaued and eaten, &amp; yet is there made no dimunicion or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing therof. The reason. If a thousand candles be lighted at my candle, yet is there neuer the lesse light in my candle The widowe of Sarepta also did eate &amp; yet was there neuer the lesse meale in her pot nor oyle in her pytcher.<note place="margin">4, <hi>Reg. iiii.</hi>
                  </note> The fourth miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thyng which is indiuisible and can not bee deuided,

is notwithstanding deuided &amp; remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whole &amp; perfect in euery part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament. This is proued by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The fift miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of God taken &amp; receaued of the wicked, is not defiled. The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this. For neither is the sunne shining vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fylthy places defiled, or made anye thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worse. The sixt miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the body of Christ, which is the meate of life, bringeth death to sinners. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proueth this to be true. For those meats, which ar good &amp; wholesome, as capons &amp; good wine are hurtfull to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are sicke &amp; feble in body. The seuenth miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bodye of Christ being receaued of the priest, or of any other, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mouth of the receauer being shut, is ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proueth this For Christ came out of the body of the virgine vncorrupt. He rose also out of the graue being shut. Agayn, he came into the house, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Disciples wer gathered, the doores being shut. The eyght miracle is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although the body

Therfore when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament is holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tasted, and eaten: Christ is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally present in sight, in touching, in sauour. And so long as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corporal sense is affected, the corporal presence is not taken away. But after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the corporall sense in receauing fayleth: the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall presence is no more to be soughte, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirituall presence is to be retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dispensation is ended, Christ goeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth to the heart.
