         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THou ſhalt not be detained with any flouriſhing Preface. 'Tis
true; whether we conſider the Perſon or Cauſe, ſo much
might pertinently be ſaid, as (were the Pen of ſome ready
Writer imployed therein) a large Preamble might ſeem to
need but a very ſhort Apol<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gy, if any at all. Yet, by that time we
have well weighed what this Sufferer hath ſaid for himſelf, and left
behind him in writing, it will appear, that there needed not any tongue
of the Learned, to form up an Introduction thereunto, but meerly the
hand of a faithful Tranſcriber of his own Obſervations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in defence of
himſelf and his Cauſe. Reſt aſſured of this, thou haſt them here fully
and clearly repreſented.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of this courſe for thy information, as to the truth of
his Caſe, be pleaſed to conſider on theſe following accounts. He was
much over-ruled, diverted, interrupted, and cut ſhort in his Plea (as
to a free and full delivery of his mind upon the whole matter at the
Bar) by the Judges of the Kings-Bench, and by the Kings Counſel.
He was alſo denyed the benefit of any Counſel to ſpeak on his behalf.</p>
            <p>And what he did ſpeak at the Bar and on the Scaffold, was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful
to ſome, that the Books of thoſe that took Notes of what paſſed
all along in both places, were carefully called in and ſuppreſſed. It is
therefore altogether unpoſſible to give thee a full Narrative of all he
ſaid, or was ſaid to him, either in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or on <hi>Tower-Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defendant foreſeeing this, did moſt carefully ſet down in
writing the ſubſtance of what he intended to enlarge upon, the three
dayes of his appearance at the Kings-Bench Bar, and the day of his
Execution. Monday <hi>June</hi> 2. 1662, was the day of his Arraignment.
Friday <hi>June</hi> 6. was the day of his Tryal, and the Jurors Verdict.
Wedneſday <hi>June</hi> 11. was the day of his Sentence. Saturday <hi>June</hi> 14.
was the day of his Execution on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> where limitations were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93090:3"/>
put upon him, and the interruptions of him by many hard ſpeeches and
diſturbing carriages of ſome that compaſſed him about upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
as alſo by the ſounding of Trumpets in his face to prevent his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heard, had many eye and ear witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe conſiderations, I doubt not, it will appear undiſpenſably
neceſſary, to have given this faithful Tranſcript of ſuch Papers of his,
as do contain the moſt ſubſtantial and pleadable grounds of his publick
actings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any time this twenty years and more, as the only means left
of giving any tolerable account of the whole matter, to thy ſatisfaction.
Yet ſuch Information as could be picked up from thoſe that did preſerve
any Notes, taken in Court or at the Scaffold, are here alſo recorded
for thy uſe, and that, faithfully, word for word.</p>
            <p>Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> doth right worthily commend the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as the beſt now extant and in force, in any Nation of the world,
affording (if duely adminiſtred) juſt outward liberty to the People,
and ſecuring the meaneſt from any oppreſſive and injurious practices of
Superiours againſt them. They give alſo that juſt Prerogative to
Princes, that is convenient or truly uſeful and advantagious for them
to have; that is to ſay, ſuch as doth not enterfere with the Peoples
just Rights, the intire and moſt wary preſervation of which, as it is
the Covenant-duty of the Prince, ſo is it his beſt ſecurity and greateſt
honour. 'Tis ſafer and better for him to be loved and rightly feared
by free Subjects, than to be feared and hated by injured ſlaves.</p>
            <p>The main fundamental Liberties of the free People of <hi>England,</hi> are
ſummed up and comprehended in the 29th Chapter of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
Theſe be the words;</p>
            <p>No freeman ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or be diſſeized of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
or Liberties, or free-cuſtoms, or be out-lawed or exiled, or any
otherwiſe deſtroyed. Nor will we paſs upon him, or condemn him,
but by lawful Judgement of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.
We will ſell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man, either
Juſtice or Right.</p>
            <p>Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> obſerves here nine famous branches of the
Law of <hi>England,</hi> couched in this ſhort Chapter, and diſcourſes upon
them to good purpoſe. He ſaith alſo, that from this Chapter, as out
of a root, many fruitful branches of the Law of <hi>England</hi> have ſprung.</p>
            <p>As for the very leading injury to other wrongings of the Subject,
(to wit, the reſtraint or impriſonment of his perſon) ſo curious and
tender is the Law in this point, that (ſayes <hi>Cook</hi>) no man is to be
attached, arreſted, taken, or reſtrained of his liberty, by petition or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93090:3"/>
ſuggeſtion to the King or to his Council, unleſs it be by Indictment or
Preſentment of good and lawful men (of the neighbourhood) where
ſuch deeds be done.</p>
            <p>This great Charter of <hi>Englands Liberties,</hi> made 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and ſet
in the front of all ſucceeding Statute-Laws or Acts of Parliament, (as
the Standard, Touch-ſtone or Jury for them to be tryed by) hath been
ratified by about two and thirty Parliaments, and the Petition of
Right, 3. <hi>Caroli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two moſt famous Ratifications hereof, entituled, <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
Chartarum, &amp; Articuli ſuper Chartas,</hi> were made 25 and 28
of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>All this ſtir about the great Charter, ſome conceive very needleſs,
ſeeing that therein are contained thoſe fundamental Laws or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Nation, which are ſo undeniably conſonant to the Law of
Nature, or Light of Reaſon, that Parliaments themſelves ought not
to abrogate, but preſerve them. Even Parliaments may ſeem to be
bounded in their Legiſlative Power and Juriſdiction, by divine Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Reaſon, which is an eternal and therefore unalterable Law.
Hence is it, that an Act of Parliament that is evidently againſt
common Right or Reaſon, is null and void in it ſelf, without more
ado. Suppoſe a Parliament by their Act ſhould conſtitute a man Judge
in his own cauſe, give him a meer Arbitrary power; ſuch Act would
be in it ſelf void.</p>
            <p>This is declared to be the ground of that exemplary Juſtice done
upon <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> (as acting contrary to the Peoples Liberties
in <hi>Magna Charta</hi>) whoſe Caſe is very memorable in this point. For,
though they gratified <hi>Hen. 7th</hi> in what they did, and had an Act of
Parliament for their Warrant, made the 11th of his Reign, yet met
they with their due reward from the hands of Juſtice, that Act being
againſt Equity and common Reaſon, and ſo, no juſtifiable ground or
apology for thoſe infinit Abuſes and Oppreſſions of the People, they were
found guilty of.</p>
            <p>The Statute, under colour whereof they acted, ran to this effect.
<hi>Be it enacted, that the Juſtices of the Aſſizes, and Juſtices of the
Peace upon Information for the King, before them to be made, have
full power and authority by their diſcretion, to hear and determine all
offences and contempts.</hi> Having this ground, they proceeded againſt
the People, upon meer Information, in the execution of Penal Laws,
without any Indictment or Preſentment by good and lawful men, but
only by their own Promoters or Informers, contrary to the 29th of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93090:4"/>
               <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which requires, That no free-man be proceeded againſt,
but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Act allowed them to hear and determine arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
by their own diſcretion, which is not according to the Law and
Cuſtom of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>Cook</hi> ſayes, 'tis the worst (and most ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated)
oppreſſion of all, that is done under the colour of Law, or
diſguiſe of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such a Statute or Act of Parliament, is, not only againſt the light
of Reaſon, but against the expreſs letter of unrepealed Statute-Law;</hi>
42. Edw. 3. 1. <hi>It is aſſented and accorded,</hi> That the great Charter,
and the Charter of Foreſt be holden and kept in all points, and if any
Statute be made to the contrary, that ſhall be holden for none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This alſo is conſonant to the first chapter of the great Charter it
ſelf, made</hi> 9. Hen. 3. We have granted to all the free-men of our
Realm, theſe Liberties under-written, to have and to hold to them and
their heirs, of Us and our Heirs, for ever.</p>
            <p>But what if this great Charter it ſelf had never been made? had
<hi>England</hi> been to ſeek for righteous Laws and just Liberties? nothing
leſſe. The ſame Liberties and Laws were ratified before that, in the
great Charter made the ſeventeenth year of King <hi>John,</hi> and mentioned
(among others) by <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to what yet amounted the matter of all theſe Grants, but what
the Kings themſelves were bound before to obſerve, by their Coronation
Oaths, as the antient fundamental Laws or Cuſtoms of this Land? This
we may find in Mr. <hi>Lambard's</hi> Tranſlation of the Saxon Laws, from
the time of King <hi>Ina,</hi> who began <hi>anno</hi> 712; to <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. who began
1100. Amongst the Saxons, King <hi>Alfred</hi> is reputed the moſt famous
and learned Compiler of our Laws, which were ſtill handed along from
one King to another, as the unalterable Customs of the Kingdom. In
the 17th chapter of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor's Laws, The mention of the
duty of a King (which, if not performed, <hi>nec nomen Regis in eo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabit</hi>)
is remarkable. And Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> tells us, that even <hi>William</hi>
the Conqueror, did ratifie and obſerve the ſame Laws that his kinſman
<hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor did, as obliged by his Coronation Oath.</p>
            <p>So then, neither the great Charter in King <hi>John's</hi> time, nor that
of 9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. were properly a new Body of Law, but a Declaration of
the antient fundamental Laws, Rights and Liberties of this Nation,
in Brittiſh, Saxon, Daniſh and Norman times, before. This, <hi>Cook</hi> in
his Proem to the ſecond part of his Inſtitutes, obſerves; where he
notes alſo, that this Charter is not called great, for quantity of words,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93090:4"/>
(a ſheet of Paper will contain it) but for the great importance and
weight of its matter.</p>
            <p>Through the advice of <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,
Edward</hi> the firſt, in the eleventh year of his Reign, did, in a Council
held at <hi>Oxford,</hi> unjuſtly cancel this great Charter, and that of Foreſt:
<hi>Hubert</hi> therefore was juſtly ſentenc'd according to Law, by his Peers,
in open Parliament. Then, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. The Statute, called, <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationes
Charrarum</hi> was made, in the firſt chapter whereof, the <hi>Mag.
Charta</hi> is peculiarly called the Common Law. 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. cap. 2. <hi>Any
Judgment given contrary to the ſaid Charter, is to be undone and
holden for naught</hi> And cap. 4. <hi>Any that by word, deed, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
go contrary to the ſaid Charter, are to be excommunicated by the
Biſhops; and the Arch-Biſhops of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> York <hi>are bound
to compel the other Biſhops to denounce ſentence accordingly, in caſe

            <p>The next famous ſticklers to <hi>Hubert de Burgo,</hi> for Arbitrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
were the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> father and ſon, by whoſe raſh and
evil counſel (ſayes <hi>Cook) Edward</hi> the ſecond was ſeduced to break
the Great Charter, and they were baniſhed for their pains.</p>
            <p>By theſe paſſages we may obſerve, how the People would ſtill be
ſtrugling (in and by their Repreſentatives) for their Legal Rights
and Juſt Liberties; to obviate the Encroachers whereof, they procured
ſeveral new Ratifications of their old Laws, which were indeed in
themſelves unrepealable, even by Parliaments, if they will act as men,
and not contradict the Law of their own Reaſon, and of the common
Reaſon of all mankind.</p>
            <p>By 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. cap. 1. Juſtices, Sheriffs, Majors, and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that have the Laws of the Land to guide them, are required
to allow the ſaid Charter to be pleaded in all its points, and in all cauſes
that ſhall come before them in Judgment.</p>
            <p>This is a clauſe (ſayes <hi>Cook</hi>) worthy to be written in letters of gold;
<hi>That the Laws to be the Judges guides,</hi> (and therefore not the
Judges, the guides of the Laws, by their arbitrary gloſſes) which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet miſguided any that certainly knew and truly followed them. In
conſonancy herewith, the Spaniard ſayes, Of all the three learned
Profeſſions, The Lawyer is the only letter'd man, his buſineſs and duty
being to follow the plain literal conſtruction of the Law, as his guide,
in giving Judgment. Pretence of mystery here, carries in the bowels
of it, intents, or at leaſt a deep ſuspition of arbitrary domination. The
mind of the Law is not ſubject to be clouded, diſturbed or perverted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93090:5"/>
by paſſion or intereſt. 'Tis far otherwiſe with Judges; therefore 'tis
fitter and ſafer the Law ſhould guide them, than they the Law. <hi>Cook</hi>
on the laſt mentioned Statute affirms, That this great Charter, and
the Charter of Foreſt, are properly the Common Law of this Land, or
the Law that is common to all the People thereof.</p>
            <p>2 Ed. 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. Exact care is taken, that no Commands by the
Great or Little Seal, ſhall come to diſturb or delay Common Right.

            </p>
            <p>If any force come to diſturb the execution of the Common Law,
ye ſhall cauſe their bodies to be arreſted and put into Priſon. Ye ſhall
deny no man Right by the King's Letters, nor counſel the King any
thing that may turn to his dammage or diſheriſon.</p>
            <p>The late King in his Declaration at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> 1641, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Law to be the Rule of his Power. And his Majeſty that

It took its riſe and had its root in the Being, Authority Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

not onely authorized and commiſſionated in the ordinary and

was conſtituted in its continuance and exerciſe of its Power free
from that ſubjection, and made therein wholly to depend upon their
own will, to be declared in an Act of Parliament, to be paſſed for that
purpoſe, when they ſhould ſee cauſe. To ſpeak plainly and clearly in
this matter; That which is endeavoured to be made a Crime and an
Offence of ſuch an high nature in my perſon, is no other than the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and unavoidable Actings of the Repreſentative Body of the
Kingdom, for the preſervation of the good People thereof, in their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and duty to God and his Law, as alſo from the imminent
dangers and deſtruction threatned them, from God's and their own
Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This made both Houſes in their</hi> Remonſtrance (May 26. 1642.)
<hi>proteſt;</hi> If the Malignant ſpirits about the King, ſhould ever force

must be wholly cast upon their account, God and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
telling them, that they were clear; and would not doubt, but
that God and the whole world would clear them therein.</p>
               <p>In his Majeſties <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the two Houſes, (<hi>May</hi>
19. 1642.) he acknowledgeth his going into the Houſe of Commons
to demand the five Members, was an errour: And that was it, which
gave the Parliament the firſt cauſe to put themſelves in a poſture of
defence, by their own Power and Authority, in commanding the
Trained-Bands of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to guard and ſecure them from
Violence, in the diſcharge of their Truſt and Duty, as the two Houſes
of Parliament, appointed by Act, to continue, as above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>The next cauſe was, his Majeſties raiſing Forces at <hi>York,</hi> (under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a Guard) expreſſed in the humble Petition of the Lords and
Commons, (<hi>May</hi> 23. 1642.) wherein they beſeech his Majeſty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 20. 1642, The two Houſes of Parliament gave their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in theſe Votes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it appears, that the King (ſeduced by wicked Counſel)
intends to make War againſt the Parliament, who in all their Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Actions have propoſed no other end to themſelves, but the
Care of his Kingdoms, and the performance of all Duty and Loyalty to
his Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whenſoever the King maketh War upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
it is a breach of Truſt repoſed in him by his People, contrary
to his Oath, and tending to the diſſolution of this Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That whoſoever ſhall ſerve or aſſist him in ſuch Wars, are
Traytors by the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, and have been ſo
adjudged by two Acts of Parliament, and ought to ſuffer as Traitors.</p>
               <p>Die Jovis, Octob. 8. 1642., <hi>In the Inſtructions agreed upon by the

                  <hi>And by the Judgment and Reſolution of both Houſes, bearing date</hi>
Aug. 13. 1642, <hi>upon occaſion of his Majeſties</hi> Proclamation <hi>for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the preſent Rebellion under the Command of</hi> Robert <hi>Earl of</hi>
Eſſex, <hi>They do unanimouſly publiſh and declare,</hi> That all they who
have adviſed, declared, abetted, or countenanced, or hereafter ſhall
abet and countenance the ſaid <hi>Proclamation,</hi> are Traytors and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God, the King and Kingdom, and guilty of the highest degree
of Treaſon that can be committed against the King and Kingdom, as
that which invites his Majeſties Subjects to deſtroy his Parliament,
and good People, by a Civil War; and by that means, to bring ruine,
confuſion and perpetual ſlavery upon the ſurviving part of a then wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Law is acknowledged by the King, to be the <hi>onely Rule,</hi> by
which the People can be iuſtly governed; and that as it is his duty,
ſo it ſhall be his perpetual, vigilant care, to ſee to it: Therefore he
will not ſuffer either or both Houſes by their Vo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, without or againſt
his Conſent, to enjoyn any thing that is forbidden by the Law, or to
forbid any thing that is enjoyned by the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King does aſſert in his Anſwer to the Houſes Petition,</hi> (May
23. 1642.) That He is a part of the Parliament, which they take
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93090:7"/>
upon them to defend and ſecure; and that his Prerogative is a part
of, and a defence to the Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Remonſtrance of both Houſes,</hi> (May 26. 1642.) <hi>They do
aſſert;</hi> That if they have made any Precedents this Parliament, they
have made them for poſterity, upon the ſame or better grounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Law, than thoſe were, upon which their Predeceſſors made any
for them; <hi>and do ſay,</hi> That as ſome Precedents ought not to be Rules
for them to follow, ſo none can be limits to bound their Proceedings,
which may and muſt vary, according to the different condition of
times.</p>
               <p>And for the particular, with which they were charged, of ſetting
forth Declarations to the People who have choſen and entruſted them
with all that is deareſt to them, if there be no example for it in former
times; They ſay, <hi>it is becauſe there never were ſuch Monſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that attempted to diſaffect the People towards a Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They further ſay; <hi>His Majeſties Towns are no more his care than
his Kingdom, nor his Kingdom than his People, who are not ſo his
own, that he hath abſolute power over them, or in them, as in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Goods and Eſtate; but fiduciary, for the Kingdom, and in the
paramount right of the Kingdom.</hi> They alſo acknowledge the Law,
to be the ſafeguard and cuſtody of all publick and private Intereſts.
They alſo hold it fit, to declare unto the Kingdom, (whoſe Honour and
Intereſt is ſo much concerned in it) what is the Priviledge of the great
Council of Parliament, herein; and what is the Obligation that lies
upon the Kings of this Realm, as to the paſſing ſuch Bills as are offered
to them by both Houſes, in the name, and for the good of the whole
Kingdom, whereunto they ſtand engaged, both in Conſcience and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
to give their Royal Aſſent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In Conſcience;</hi> in reſpect of the Oath that is, or ought to be
taken by them, at their Coronation, as well to confirm by their
Royal Aſſent, all ſuch good Laws as the People ſhall chuſe, (whereby
to remedy ſuch inconveniencies as the Kingdom may ſuffer) as to keep
and protect the Laws already in being.</p>
               <p>The form of the <hi>Oath</hi> is upon Record, and aſſerted by Books of
good authority, Unto it relation is had, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. entitiled, <hi>The
Statute of Proviſors of Benefices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon, The ſaid Commons prayed our ſaid Lord the King,
(ſith the Right of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the Law of the ſaid
Realm, is ſuch, that upon the miſchiefs and dammages which happen
to this Realm, he ought and is bound by his Oath, with the accord
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93090:7"/>
of his People in Parliament, to make Remedy and Law, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
thereof) That it may pleaſe him to ordain Remedy.</p>
               <p>This Right, thus claimed by the Lords and Commons, the King
doth not deny, in his Anſwer thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In Juſtice</hi> the Kings are obliged as well as in <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
in reſpect of the Truſt repoſed in them, to preſerve the Kingdom
by the making of new Laws, where there ſhall be need, as well as by
obſerving of Laws already made; a Kingdom being many times as
much expoſed to ruine for want of a new Law, as by the violation of
thoſe that are in being.</p>
               <p>This is a moſt clear Right, not to be denyed, but to be as due from
his Majeſty to his People, as his Protection. In all Laws framed by
both Houſes, as <hi>Petitions of Right,</hi> they have taken themſelves to be ſo
far Judges of the Rights claimed by them, That when the King's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
hath not been in every point, fully according to their deſire, they
have ſtill inſiſted upon their Claim, and never given it over, till the
Anſwer hath been according to their demand, as was done in the late
<hi>Petition of Right,</hi> 3. Caroli.</p>
               <p>This ſhews, the two Houſes of Parliament are <hi>Judge</hi> between the
King and the People in queſtion of Right, as in the Caſe alſo of <hi>Ship-money</hi>
and other illegal Taxes; and if ſo, why ſhould they not alſo
be Judge in the Caſes of the Common Good and Neceſſity of the
Kingdom, wherein the Kingdom hath as clear a Right to have the
benefit and remedy of the Law, as in any other matter, ſaying Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Grants of Favour?</p>
               <p>The Malignant Party are they, that not only neglect and deſpiſe,
but labour to undermine the Law, under colour of maintaining it. They
endeavour to deſtroy the Fountain and Conſervators of the Law, the
<hi>Parliament.</hi> They make other Judges of the Law, than what the Law
hath appointed. They ſet up other Rules for themſelves to walk by,
than ſuch as are according to Law; and diſpence with the Subjects
obedience, to that which the Law calls Authority, and to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
and Reſolutions, to whom the Judgment doth appertain
by Law: Yea, though but private perſons, they make the Law to be
their Rule, according to their own underſtanding only, contrary to
the Judgment of thoſe that are the competent Judges thereof.</p>
               <p>The King aſſerts, That the Act of Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> was <hi>levying
War againſt the King,</hi> by the letter of the Statute, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cap. 2.</p>
               <p>The Houſes ſtate the Caſe, and deny it to be within that Statute;
ſaying, If the letter of that Statute be thought to import this; That
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93090:8"/>
no War can be levied againſt the King, but what is directed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt his Perſon; Or, that every levying of Forces for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the King's Authority, and of his Kingdom, againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Commands of the King, oppoſed thereunto, (though accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with his preſence) is Treaſon, or levying War againſt the King;
Such Interpretation is very far from the ſenſe of that Statute, and ſo
much the Statute it ſelf ſpeaks, beſide the authority of Book-caſes. For
if the clauſe of levying War had been meant only againſt the King's
Perſon, what need had there been thereof, after the other branch in
the ſame Statute, of compaſſing the King's death, which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
have implied this? And becauſe the former doth imply this, it
ſeems not at all to be intended, at leaſt not chiefly, in the latter branch,
but the levying War againſt his Laws and Authority; and ſuch a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
War, though not againſt his Perſon, is a levying War againſt
the King; whereas the levying of Force againſt his perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
though accompanied with his Preſence, and not againſt his
Laws and Authority, but in the maintenance thereof, is no levying of
War againſt the King, but for him, eſpecially in a time of ſo many
ſucceſſive plots and deſigns of Force againſt the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
of probable Invaſion from abroad, and of ſo great diſtance and
alienation of his Majeſties affections from his Parliament and People,
and of the particular danger of the Place and Magazine of <hi>Hull,</hi> of
which the two Houſes ſitting, are the moſt proper Judges.</p>
               <p>In proclaiming Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> Traitor, they ſay, The breach of
the Priviledge of Parliament was very clear, and the ſubverſion of the
Subjects common Right. For though the Priviledges of Parliament
extend not to theſe caſes, mentioned in the Declaration of Treaſon,
Felony, and breach of the Peace. ſo as to exempt the Members of
Parliament from Puniſhment, or from all manner of Proceſs and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
yet it doth priviledge them in the way and method of their Tryal
and Puniſhment, and that the Parliament ſhould firſt have the Cauſe
brought before them, that they may judge of the Fact, and of the
grounds of their Accuſation, and how far forth the manner of their
Tryal may or may not concern the Priviledge of Parliament: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
under this pretext, the Priviledge of Parliament in this matter,
may be ſo eſſentially broken, as thereby the very Being of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
may be deſtroyed. Neither doth the ſitting of a Parliament
ſuſpend all or any Law, in maintaining that Law, which upholds the
Priviledge of Parliament, which upholds the Parliament, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93090:8"/>
They further aſſert; That in ſome ſenſe, they acknowledge the
<hi>King</hi> to be the only perſon, againſt whom Treaſon can be committed,
that is, as he is <hi>King,</hi> and that Treaſon which is againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is more againſt the <hi>King,</hi> than that which is againſt his Perſon;
becauſe he <hi>is King:</hi> For Treaſon is not Treaſon, as it is againſt him <hi>as
a man,</hi> but <hi>as a man that is a King,</hi> and as he hath, and ſtands in that
relation to the Kingdom, entruſted with the Kingdom, and diſcharging
that Truſt.</p>
               <p>They alſo a vow, That there can be no competent Judge of this or
any the like caſe, but a <hi>Parliament;</hi> and do ſay, that if the wicked
Counſel about the King could maſter this Parliament by force, they
would hold up the ſame power to deprive us of all Parliaments, which
are the ground and pillar of the Subjects Liberty, and that which only
maketh <hi>England</hi> a free Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The Orders of the two Houſes carry in them <hi>Law for their limits,
and the Safety of the Land for their end.</hi> This makes them not doubt
but all his Majeſties good Subjects will yeeld obedience to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Authority, ſignified therein by both Houſes of Parliament: for
whoſe encouragement, and that they may know their Duty in matters
of that nature, and upon how ſure a ground they go, that follow the
Judgement of Parliament for their guide; They alledge the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ground of that Statute, 11. <hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 1. printed at large
in his Majeſties Meſſage, <hi>May</hi> 4; This Statute provides, that none
that ſhall attend upon the King and do him true ſervice, ſhall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
or forfeit any thing.</p>
               <p>What was the ſcope of this Statute?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To provide, that men ſhould not ſuffer as Traitors for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the King in his Wars, according to the duty of their Allegiance.
But if this had been all, it had been a very needleſs and ridiculous
Statute. Was it then intended (as they ſeem to make it, that print it
with his Majeſties Meſſage) that thoſe ſhould be free from all crime
and penalty, that ſhould follow the King and ſerve him in War, in
any caſe whatſoever, whether it were for or againſt the Kingdom or
the Laws thereof? That cannot be: for that could not ſtand with the
duty of their Allegiance, which, in the beginning of this Statute, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
to be, <hi>to ſerve the King for the time being in his Wars, for
the defence of him and the Land.</hi> If therefore it be againſt the Land,
(as it muſt be, if it be againſt the Parliament, the Repreſentative Body
of the Kingdom) it is a declining from the duty of Allegiance, which
this Statute ſuppoſes may be done, though men ſhould follow the Kings
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93090:9"/>
Perſon in the War. Otherwiſe, there had been no need of ſuch a
<hi>Proviſo</hi> in the end of the Statute, that none ſhould take benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that ſhould decline from their Allegiance.</p>
               <p>That therefore which is the Principal Verb in this, is <hi>the ſerving of
the King for the time being,</hi> which cannot be meant of a <hi>Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi>
or any that ſhould call himſelf <hi>King,</hi> but ſuch a one, as (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Title might prove, either in himſelf or in his Anceſtors) ſhould
be received and acknowledged for ſuch, by the Kingdome, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
whereof cannot be diſcern'd but by Parliament; the Act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is the Act of the whole Kingdom, by the perſonal Suffrage of
the Peers, and the Delegate Conſent of the Commons of <hi>England.
Henry</hi> 7th therefore, a wiſe Prince, to clear this matter of conteſt,
happening between Kings <hi>de facto</hi> and Kings <hi>de jure,</hi> procured this
Statute to be made, <hi>That none ſhall be accounted a Traitor for ſerving
in his Wars, the King for the time being;</hi> that is, him that is for the
preſent allowed and received by the Parliament in behalf of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And as it is truly ſuggeſted in the Preamble of the Statute;
It is not agreeable to reaſon or conſcience, that it ſhould be otherwiſe,
ſeeing men ſhould be put upon an impoſſibility of knowing their duty,
if the Judgment of the higheſt Court ſhould not be a Rule to guide
them. And if the Judgment thereof is to be followed, when the
queſtion is, <hi>who is King?</hi> much more, when the queſtion is, <hi>what is
the beſt ſervice of the King and Kingdom?</hi> Thoſe therefore that ſhall
guide themſelves by the Judgment of Parliament, ought (what ever
happen) to be ſecure and free from all account and penalties, upon the
ground and equity of this Statute.</p>
               <p>To make the Parliament countenancers of Treaſon, they ſay, is
enough to have diſſolv'd all the bands of ſervice and confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Majeſty and his Parliament, of whom the Law ſayes, a
diſhonourable thing ought not to be imagined.</p>
               <p>This Concluſion then is a clear Reſult from what hath been argued;
That in all Caſes of ſuch difficulty and unuſualneſs, happening by
the over-ruling Providence of God, as render it impoſſible for the
Subject to know his duty, by any known Law or certain Rule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
his relying then, upon the Judgment and Reaſon of the whole
Realm, declared by their Repreſentative Body in <hi>Parliament,</hi> then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and adhering thereto, and purſuing thereof, (though the ſame
afterwards be by ſucceeding Parliaments, judged erroneous, factious
and unjuſt) is moſt agreeable to right Reaſon and good Conſcience;
and in ſo doing, all perſons are to be free and ſecure from all Account
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93090:9"/>
and Penalties, not only upon the ground and equity of that Statute,
11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. but according to all Rules of Juſtice, natural or moral.</p>

               <head>The day of Arraignment, being Monday <date>June 2. 1662.</date>
               </head>
               <p>Reader, The beſt account thou canſt yet be furniſhed with, as to
this dayes proceedings in Court, is, as followeth.</p>
               <p>SIR <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was the laſt Term, indicted of High Treaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Middleſex</hi> Grand Jury, and the Bill being found by
them, he was upon Monday the ſecond of <hi>June</hi> this Term, arraigned,
to this effect.</p>
               <p>That you as a falſe Traitor againſt his moſt excellent Majeſty King
<hi>Charles the ſecond,</hi> your ſupream and natural Lord, not having the
fear of God before your eyes, and withdrawing that your duty and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
which a true Subject ought to have and bear to our ſaid Leige
and ſovereign Lord, thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> in the eleventh year of our
ſaid ſovereign Lord the King, at the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields
in the Country of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> did compaſs and imagine the Death of our
ſaid ſovereign Lord the King, and the ancient frame of Government
of this Realm, totally to ſubvert and keep out our ſaid ſovereign Lord
from the exerciſe of his Regal Government; and the ſame the better
to effect, the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> the ſaid thirteenth day of <hi>May,</hi> in
the ſaid eleventh your, &amp;c. at St. <hi>Martins</hi> aforeſaid, together with
other falſe Traitors, to the Jurors unknown, did traiterouſly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
aſſemble and ſit together, and then and there conſulted to
bring the King unto deſtruction, and to hold him out from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Regal Authority, and then and there uſurped the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and appointed Officers, to wit, Colonels and Captains of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Army, raiſed againſt the King, againſt the Peace of our ſovereign
Lord the King his Crown and Dignity, and contrary to the form of
the Statute in that caſe made and provided.</p>
               <p>And the better to effect this, the twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> in the
ſaid eleventh year, with a multitude, to the number of a thouſand
perſons, to the Jurors unknown, in warlike manner aſſembled, and
arrayed with Guns, Trumpets, Drums, &amp;c. did levy War againſt the
Peace, &amp;c. and contrary to the form of a Statute.</p>
               <p>Which being read, he prayed to have it read a ſecond time, which
was granted him. He then prayed to have it read in Latine, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93090:10"/>
all the Court denyed, and <hi>Keeling</hi> the King's Serjeant ſaid, That
though all Pleas and Entries are ſet down on Record in Latine, yet
the agitations of Cauſes in Court, ought to be in Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner moved ſeveral Exceptions to the Indictment, as that
the 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is not purſued; that he had levied no ſuch force as
amounted to a levying of War; Alſo, the place in which, perſons with
whom, are both uncertain; and the particular acts of levying War,
being not ſet forth, he thought therefore the Indictment was <hi>inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi>
Alſo, he ſaid, here is a long time of Action for which I am
charged, and I may be concern'd for what I acted as a Member in
that ſovereign Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and if any thing concerns the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of that Court, I ought not to be judged here; at which the
Court and King's Counſel took great offence.</p>
               <p>He ſaid alſo; There hath been an Act of General Pardon, ſince
that time, whereby all Treaſons are put in utter oblivion, and though
Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> were excepted, yet none conſent that he was that Sir
<hi>Henry Vane.</hi> But the King's Counſel ſaid, If he would plead that
Plea, they would joyn that Iſſue with him, if he pleaſed, which if it
ſhould be found againſt him, it would be too late to plead, <hi>not guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Court ſaid, in favour of life, a man may plead a double
Plea, and give in his Exception, and plead over to the Felony or
Treaſon, <hi>not guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to the Exceptions taken to the Indictment, they gave little
heed to them, but preſſed him to plead or confeſs.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he pleaded, <hi>Not guilty;</hi> and had four dayes, to wit,
till Friday next, for his Tryal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From another hand, take, as followeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner did much preſs for Counſel to be allowed him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
with about any further Exceptions to the Indictment, beſides thoſe
by him exhibited, and to put all into form, according to the cuſtomary
proceedings and language of the Law, as alſo to ſpeak to them at the
Bar, on his behalf, he not being verſ'd in the punctilio's of Law-writings
and Pleas. He further ſaid. That the Indictment, which ſo
nearly concern'd his Life, being long, and his memory ſhort, it could
not well be imagined that he ſhould upon the bare hearing it read, be
able in an inſtant to find out every material Exception againſt it, in form
or matter. He pleaded a good while on this account, but Counſel
was finally denied him till he ſhould plead <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> unto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93090:10"/>
which, being a third time urged, he pleaded <hi>Not guilty;</hi> The Court
having aſſured him beforehand, that after pleading, Counſel ſhould be
aſſigned him, which yet never was performed.</p>
               <p>Here followeth a Tranſcript of the Priſoners own Papers, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain Memorandums pleadable upon his Arraignment.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Memorandums for, and towards my Defence.</head>
               <p>Upon hearing the Indictment read, and before pleading.</p>
               <p>FIrſt, To lay before the Court the impoſſibility that he humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,
is already in view, as to the having any ſuch indifferent and
equal Tryal, as the Law intends him, and doth require and command
on the behalf of all the free-People of <hi>England.</hi> The Riſe for this
Conception he takes from what hath been already done in relation to
the Priſoner himſelf, unheard, unexamined, and yet kept cloſe Priſoner
for near two whole years. This he ſhall leave to the Judgment of the
Court, after he hath made known the particulars thereof unto
them, as neceſſary to precede the thing demanded of him, in pleading
<hi>guilty,</hi> or <hi>not guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What is the indifferency which the Law requires and
appoints throughout, as well in matters that go before the Tryal, as
in the proceedings at the Tryal if it ſelf?</p>
               <p>Before the Tryal, and in the firſt ſtep to it, which is the keeping and
ſecuring his perſon, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is clear, and gives this Rule,
cap 29. <hi>Nullus liber homo capiatur, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No free-man ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or be diſſeiſed of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
or liberties, or free-cuſtoms, or be outlawed or exiled, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
deſtroyed; Nor we will not paſſe upon him, nor condemn him, but
by lawful Judgement of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land: We
will ſell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Juſtice
or Right.</p>
               <p>Out of this Chapter, as out of a root (ſaith Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi>) do
many fruitful branches of the Law of <hi>England</hi> ſpring. It contains nine
branches; ſome whereof I ſhall inſiſt upon in my Caſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That no man be taken or impriſoned but <hi>per Legem Terrae,</hi>
that is, by the Common Law or Cuſtom of <hi>England;</hi> which words,
<hi>per Legem Terrae,</hi> though put laſt, refer to all the precedent branches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Goods of any Offender cannot regularly be taken
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93090:11"/>
and ſeized to the King's uſe before Conviction, nor be Inventoried,
nor the Town charged therewith, before the owner be indicted of
Record.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, No man ſhall be exiled or baniſhed out of his Country,
not be in any ſort deſtroyed but by the verdict of his Peers.</p>
               <p>This appears by <hi>Bracton</hi> and other ancient Writers, quoted by <hi>Cook,</hi>
in the third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> fol. 228.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter ſaith <hi>Cook,</hi> theſe two Concluſions are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
proved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That before Indictment, the Goods or other things of any
Offender cannot be ſearched, inventoried or in any ſort ſeized, nor
after Indictment, ſeized, removed, or taken away, before Conviction
or Attainder.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the begging of the Goods or Eſtate of any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent,
accuſed or indicted of any Treaſon, Felony, or other offence,
before he be convicted and attainted, is utterly unlawful; <hi>Stat. Ri. 1.
cap.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And beſides, it maketh the proſecution againſt the Delinquent, more
precipitant, violent and undue, than the quiet and equal proceedings of
the Law and Juſtice would permit: Or elſe, by ſome under-hand
Agreement, ſtops or hinders the due courſe of Juſtice, and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
both Judge, Juror and Witneſs to do their duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Judges are not to give ſo much as their Opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
concerning the Offence, whether it prove that Offence in
that Caſe.</p>
               <p>Cook <hi>in the chap. of</hi> Petty Treaſon, <hi>fol. 29. expreſly ſaith;</hi> And
to the end the Tryal may be the more indifferent, ſeeing the ſafety of
the Priſoner conſists in the indifferency of the Court, the Judges ought
not to deliver their Opinions before-hand, of any Criminal Caſe, that
may come before them judicially. <hi>And he there cites</hi> Humphrey
Staffords <hi>Caſe that Arch Traitor, in which</hi> Huſſey <hi>Chief Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought</hi>
Hen. 7. <hi>not to demand of them their Opinions before-hand.
And in the 4th of his</hi> Inſtitutes, <hi>in the chap. of the</hi> High Court of
Parliament, <hi>fol. 37, he fully ſhews the evil of asking the Judges Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
before-hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But inſtead of this, The Judges being aſſiſtant in the Lords houſe,
when all Acts of Parliament paſſe, and whoſe Advice is taken in them,
have (as appears by what is declared in the ſaid Acts) prejudg'd by
their Opinions and the Opinions of the Parliament before-hand, the
merit of the Cauſe that now appears to be put upon the Iſſue in my
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93090:11"/>
Tryal. Hereby the Judges are rendred <hi>ex parte,</hi> and the indifferency
the Law requires, impoſſible to be afforded.</p>
               <p>Nor is this all; but by the Rules declared in the <hi>Act of Indempni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
all are diſenabled to plead, or make uſe of the Ordinances, Orders
and Votes of both, or either Houſes of Parliament, that may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereof; and then by excepting the Priſoner and his fellow out of
the ſaid Act, and all benefit thereby, a door is left open to Arraign,
bring to Tryal and Sentence the whole Cauſe from the beginning to
the ending, in the perſon of the Priſoner, and at the ſame time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of all means and poſſibility of Juſtification and Defence.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is obſervable how early hard meaſure appeared in the
way wherein the Priſoner became excepted out of the Act of Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
when the Commons, his proper Judges, declared him in their
thoughts, not fit to be endangered in the point of Life; yet unto the
Judgment of the Lords, (that ought not to judge Commoners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brought
before them by the Commons, much leſs, in oppoſite Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Commons) The Commons were neceſſitated to yeeld,
leſt otherwiſe the Act of Indempnity to the whole Nation ſhould ſtop
upon this diſpute and eſſential difference between the two Houſes; A
Competition, eaſily over-ruled; although (as it proves by the ſequel)
That Act of <hi>Indempnity</hi> is like to become <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> or a deſtroyer of
it ſelf, if your Lordſhips ſhall conceive your ſelves at liberty, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that Act) not only to bring anew into memory upon the
ſtage, the ſtate of all the paſſed differences, from firſt to laſt, but to try
and judge the merit of them in my perſon, and therein call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
the validity of that whole Act, and make void the benefit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by it, in caſe the War undertaken and managed by both or
either of the Houſes of Parliament, be judged unlawful, and within
the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. For this adjudges all the People of <hi>England</hi>
morally guilty of the evil of a ſin and offence againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which once done, what ever promiſed Indempnity be granted
for the preſent, the Evil of the Action remaining upon Record; not
only to the Infamy of the whole People of <hi>England,</hi> but their future
danger, upon pretence they have forfeited the very Indempnity
granted.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The length of time taken to ſearch out matter againſt the
Priſoner, and the undue practices and courſes to find out Witneſſes, do
further evidence how unlike the Priſoner is to have an equal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Tryal. He doubts not, this will appear in his two years cloſe
Impriſonement, (ſix months whereof was Baniſhment) during which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93090:12"/>
time, he was never ſo much as once examined, or had any queſtion put
to him, whereby he might conjecture wherefore he was committed to
Priſon, any further than was expreſſed in the Warrants of Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now theſe were ſo general, that nothing certain or particular could
be gathered out of them. But upon the received opinion, that he was
excepted out of the Act of Indempnity, and in the ſence of both
Houſes, a great Delinquent, his Eſtate was attempted to be invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
his Rentals demanded, his Rents were actually ſeized in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
hands, and they forbidden to pay them. His very Courts were
prohibited by Officers of great Perſonages, claiming the Grant of the
Eſtate, and threatning his Officers from doing their duty. By theſe
kind of undue proceedings, the Priſoner had not wherewithal to
maintain himſelf in Priſon, and his Debts, to the value of above ten
thouſand pounds, were undiſcharged, either Principal or Intereſt. The
hopes of private lucre and profit hereby, was ſuch, in the Tenants and
other perſons, ſought out for far and near, to be Witneſſes, that it is
no wonder at laſt, ſomething by way of Charge comes to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
               <p>And as this is the Caſe of the Perſon before his appearance at this
Bar, with reſpect to the foreſaid unequal proceedings towards him,
and the great diſadvantages put upon him, and all theſe, as it were, in
a continued ſeries of Deſign; ſo, the matters and things themſelves
with which it now appears he is charged in the Indictment, make his
Caſe ſtill very extraordinary and unuſual, involving him in difficulties
that are inſuperable, unleſs God's own immediate Power do ſhew it
ſelf in working his deliverance.</p>
               <p>The things done, are for many years paſt, in a time of Differences
between King and Parliament, and Wars enſuing thereupon. Many
extraordinary Changes and Revolutions in the State and Government
were neceſſitated in the courſe of God's Providence, for wiſe and
holy ends of his, above the reach of humane wiſdom.</p>
               <p>The Authority by which they are done, is prejudged. The Orders,
Votes and Reſolutions of Parliament are made uſeleſs, and forbidden
to be produced. Hereby, all manner of defence is taken away from the
Priſoner; and that which was done according to Law, as the Laws of
thoſe times were, is endeavoured to be made unlawful, and ſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
acting according to ſuch Laws, are brought to puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The Judges (as hath been ſhewed) are foreſtalled in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by the declared ſence of Parliaments, given <hi>ex poſt facto.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:93090:12"/>
The Jurors are put upon difficulties never known before, for twelve
Commoners to judge the Actions of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> in
whom they are included, as to whoſe Judgment is the right, the one
or the others; and whether their Repreſentatives be truſty.</p>
               <p>The Party indicted is under an incapacity to bring Witneſſes, as well
from the nature of the place wherein the things were done, within the
Walls of the Houſe, as from the ſhortneſs of time, having heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his Charge, and being kept a cloſe Priſoner to the laſt day.
His Solicitors and perſons imployed in his Law-buſineſſes, were alſo
reſtrained from him.</p>
               <p>It is alſo moſt evident, that the matters for which he is queſtioned,
being the Product of ſo many years Agitations of Parliamantary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and Arms, cannot be of a ſingle concern, nor be reputed as the
actions of a private man, done of his own head, nor therefore come
within any of the ſix Claſſes of Treaſon, contained in 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>It is a Caſe moſt unuſual, and never happening before in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
yet it is alledged in the Indictment to be a levying War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Statute, and ſo comes to have the name of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> put
upon it, thereby (if poſſible) to deprive him of the uſe and benefit of
Counſel, as alſo of competent time to prepare for his Defence, and all
fitting and requiſit means for the clearing of his Innocency. Unto this,
unleſs ſome remedy be afforded by the juſtice, candor and favour of
this Court, it may be better for the Priſoner (for ought he yet knows)
to be immediately deſtroyed by ſpecial Command (if nothing elſe will
ſatisfie) without any form of Law, as one to whom Quarter, after at
leaſt two years cool blood, is thought fit to be denied in relation to the
late Wars. This may ſeem better, than under a colour and form of
Juſtice, to pretend to give him the benefit of the Law and the King's
Courts, whoſe part it is, to ſet free the Innocent, upon an Equal and
Indifferent Tryal had before them, if their Cauſe will bear it: but it
is very viſible beforehand, that all poſſible means of Defence are taken
and withheld from him, and Laws are made <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
the merit of the Cauſe, the Party being unheard.</p>
               <p>And when he hath ſaid all this, that as a rational man, does occur
to him, and is fit for him to repreſent in all humility to the Court, he
craves leave further to adde; That he ſtands at this Bar not only as
a man, and a man clothed with the Priviledges of the moſt Sovereign
Court, but as a Chriſtian, that hath Faith and reliance in God, through
whoſe gracious and wiſe appointment, he is brought into theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and unto this place at this time, whoſe Will he deſires to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93090:13"/>
found reſigned up into, as well in what He now calls him to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> as
in what He hath called him formerly to <hi>act,</hi> for the good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and of the People of God in it. Upon this bottom (he bleſſes the

and the more all things carry the face of certain ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
unto all that is near and dear to him in this world, the more
will divine deliverance and ſalvation appear; to the making good of

               <p>Far be it therefore from me, to have knowingly, maliciouſly or

leſs, to have done any thing that is <hi>malum per ſe,</hi> or that is morally
evil. This is that I allow not as I am a Man, and what I deſire
with ſtedfaſtneſs to reſiſt, as I am a Chriſtian. If I can judge any
thing of my own Caſe, The true reaſon of the preſent difficulties and
ſtraits I am in, is becauſe I have deſired to walk by a juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rule in all my Actions, and not to ſerve the luſts and paſſions of
men, but had rather die, than wittingly and deliberately ſin againſt
God and tranſgreſs his holy Laws, or prefer my own private Intereſt

                  <head>The Attorney-General's Speech to the Jury.</head>
                  <p>The Indictment is, <hi>for traiterouſly imagining and intending, &amp;c.
the Death of the King.</hi> This very imagination and compaſſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is Treaſon. Yet, foraſmuch as the intentions of the heart are ſecret;
the Law cannot take notice of them, till they are declared by Overt
Act. Therefore we ſhall give in Evidence, That for the accompliſhing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93090:13"/>
of theſe Intentions, the Priſoner ſate with others in ſeveral Councils, or
rather Confederacies, incroached the Government, levied Forces,
appointed Officers, and at laſt, levied open and actual War, in the head
of a Regiment. If any of theſe crimes be proved, it is ſufficient to make
him guilty within this Indictment. And the open levying of War, and
appearing in the head of a Regiment, is not only a Treaſon of it ſelf,
but an evidence of all thoſe other Treaſons he ſtands charged with in
the Indictment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things happening before the Act of Oblivion, you will take
notice of that Act,<note place="margin">☜</note> and that the Priſoner being excepted by name from
the benefit of that Pardon, though he be chargeable for any crime of
Treaſon ſince the beginning of the late War, yet we ſhall confine the
Facts for which we charge him, to the Reign of his now Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>After the Houſe had voted the late King's Conceſſions in the Iſle of
<hi>Wight</hi> to be a good ground for Peace, many of the Members were
kept out by force, others turned out; the Peers laid aſide, and at laſt,
the King murdered. The firſt thing then that we ſhall lay to the charge
of the Priſoner, is, That that very day, wherein that horried Act was
committed, we find his hand and ſeal to a Warrant to the Officers of
the Navie, to iſſue out Stores for a Summers Guard of the <hi>Narrow
Seas.</hi> This was the firſt day of the Reign of his now Majeſty; and ſo
he enumerated all the Particulars which he intended to charge him
with, and proved them, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1. The Warrant of the 30th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 48, was proved to be the
hand of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> by <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> and <hi>Thomas Turner,</hi> as
they believe, neither of them affirming that they ſaw him write it,
but knowing his hand, believed it to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Ralph Darnel,</hi> an Under-Clerk of the Houſe of Commons,
proved the Journal Book of the Houſe, and ſaid, though he will not
take upon him to ſay, when Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was there, and when he
was abſent, yet he ſaid poſitively, that at what time ſoever he is ſet
down in the Journal, to have acted or reported any thing, he was
there. In which Book, <hi>Febr.</hi> 7. 1648. fol. 653, was the Order to
ſet up a <hi>Council of State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fol. 684. 13th <hi>Feb.</hi> were the Inſtructions preſented to the Houſe,
upon which the Council of State was to act.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The firſt was,</hi> That you, or any four or more, are to ſuppreſs all
and every perſon and perſons pretending Title to the Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Nation, from or by the late King; <hi>Charles Steward,</hi> his
ſon; or any claiming from or by them or either of them, or any other
Single Perſon whatſoever.</p>

                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93090:14"/>
This the Attorney ſaid, was in the firſt part of that Inſtruction, to
deſtroy the King's Perſon, and in the ſecond part, the Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>2. That you, &amp;c. are appointed to direct the Forces of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
for the preventing and ſuppreſſing of Tumults and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
at home, or Invaſions from abroad; and for theſe ends, to
raiſe Forces, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>3. That Febr. 14. 1648. fol. 695; Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was choſen a
Member of the Council of State, and acted upon theſe Inſtructions,
which they proved thus; To wit,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> as (fol. 893) 23d of <hi>March</hi> 1648,
Reported from the Council of State, an Eſtimate of the number of
Ships for the Summers Guard of the <hi>Narrow Seas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>March</hi> 30. 1649, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> reports from the
Council of State, That ten thouſand pounds, parcel of the twenty
thouſand pounds, aſſeſſed upon <hi>South Wales</hi> for their Delinquency, be
allowed towards the ſetting out of this Fleet, for the ſervice of the
Parliament; which was Ordered accordingly, and to be paid to Sir
<hi>Henry Vane,</hi> as Treaſurer of the Navie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That Sir <hi>Hen. Vane</hi> uſually ſate in Council, but this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,
being never admitted to go in, after the Council was ſate,
proves, that he often ſaw him go in at the fore-door and back-door,
and often continue there all the time the Council was ſitting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Dobbins</hi> and <hi>Matthew Lock</hi> ſay, That they ſeveral times
ſaw Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> ſit in a Committee of the Council, in the years
1651 and 1652, which conſiſted only of Members of the Council,
and particularly at the Committee for Scotiſh and Iriſh Affairs, where
Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was often in the Chair, and produced ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

of that Committee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Febr.</hi> 12. 1649, A new Council of State was choſen, of
which Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was one, fol. 720.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 13. 1649, All the Inſtructions of the former year were read
and aſſented to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 22. 1649. fol. 760, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> reported the form of an
Oath of <hi>Secreſie</hi> to be adminiſtred to every of the Members of the
Council, which was, to keep all things which ſhould be tranſacted in
Council, <hi>ſecret,</hi> and to be true and faithful to their <hi>Inſtructions;</hi>
which the Attorney ſaid, (ſince their firſt Inſtruction was, <hi>to ſuppreſs
all perſons pretending Title from the King</hi>) was in effect, an Oath of
<hi>Abjuration.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93090:14"/>
Fifthly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1652, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of State, and ſeveral Warrants were produced, to wit, <hi>May</hi> 20.
1652, and 22d of <hi>May -</hi> 52; to deliver to Major <hi>Wigan,</hi> two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Firelocks, and ten Drums. The other, for the delivery of five
hundred Foot-Arms, for Recruit of Col. <hi>Ingoldsbyes</hi> Regiment; and
theſe were ſubſcribed by Order of the Council, <hi>H. Vane,</hi> Preſident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 2. 1653. A Warrant of that date was produced by the
Commiſſioners of the Navy, of which he was one, for furniſhing out
the <hi>Hampſhire</hi> Frigat, with Proviſions and Ammunition for the uſe of
the State.</p>
                  <p>From this time to 1659, they charge him with nothing, and then
the Journal-Book was produced and atteſted by <hi>Ralph Darnel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<hi>May</hi> 7. 1659, an Order was made for appointing a <hi>Committee of
Safety</hi> (whereof Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was one) <hi>That they, or any four or
more of them, ſhould take care of the Safety of this Commonwealth,
and they to ſit for eight dayes and no longer,</hi> fol. 36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Die Ven.</hi> May 13. 1659, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> reported, That they
had conferred with all the Foreign Ambaſſadors. That the Common-wealth
is in Amity with all Foreign Princes, but <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolved, That</hi> Ch. Fleetwood, J. Lambert, J. Disbrough, Jam.
Berry, Arthur Haſlerigg, Edmund Ludlow, <hi>and Sir</hi> Henry Vane <hi>be
Commiſſioners to nominate Commiſſion-Officers for the Army of this
Commonwealth.</hi> By vertue hereof they proceeded, <hi>June</hi> 17. 1659, to
nominate Commiſſion-Officers, appointed <hi>Robert Moſſe</hi> a Colonel,
preſenting a Liſt of his Commiſſion-Officiers; and <hi>John Maſon</hi> to be
Governour of <hi>Jerſey.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Die Ven.</hi> May 31. fol. 158. Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> reports, concerning
affairs between the two Northern Kings, in the <hi>Zound,</hi> wherein the
affairs of this Commonwealth are concerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Die Ven.</hi> Sept. 2. 1659. At the Committee of State at <hi>White-hall,</hi>
An Order was produced for the redelivery of the City-horſes to their
reſpective owners, Signed, <hi>H. Vane,</hi> Preſident.</p>
                  <p>A Warrant was produced under the hand of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Thomas Lewis</hi> and one <hi>Falconer,</hi> for ſo many Hangers to Col.
<hi>Tompſon,</hi> as he ſhall require for his Regiment.</p>
                  <p>Three ſeveral Letters, to deliver 1200 Arms for the uſe of my
Regiment; to wit, To <hi>Sam. Linn</hi> my Capt. Leiutenant, 30 Arms for
my Company; To Maj. <hi>Tho. Shurman,</hi> Major of my Regiment, four
or five barrels of Powder.</p>
                  <p>Then one <hi>Marſh</hi> was produced a Witneſs, who proves, That Sir
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93090:15"/>
                     <hi>Henry Vane</hi> propoſed the new Model of Government, <hi>Whitlock</hi> being
in the Chair, in theſe particulars;</p>
                  <p>1. That the Supream Power, delegated by the People to their
Truſtees, ought to be in ſome Fundamentals not dispenſed with.</p>
                  <p>2. That it is deſtructive to the Peoples Liberties (to which by
God's bleſſing they are reſtored) to admit any earthly King or ſingle
perſon, to the Legiſlative or Executive Power over this Nation.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Supream Power delegated, is not on truſted to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Trustees, to erect matters of Faith or Worſhip, ſo as to exerciſe
compulſion therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tho. Pury</hi> proves, That he was at the debating of the two laſt of
theſe Propoſitions, and believes they were propoſed to the Chairman
<hi>Whitlock,</hi> by Sir <hi>Henry Vane;</hi> but affirms confidently, that Sir <hi>Hen.
Vane</hi> gave Reaſons to maintain them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tho. Wallis</hi> produced, proves Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and Col. <hi>Rich</hi> in the
head of a Company, in <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Park in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and that the
Capt. Leiutenant <hi>Linn</hi> ſaid to the Souldiers, that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> had
given them five pounds to drink; that the ſaid <hi>Linn</hi> ſent home a key
to his wife, to ſend him four pounds out of his trunk, to give the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Cook</hi> depoſeth, That he was ſent to the <hi>Horſeſhoe-ſtairs,</hi> to
meet Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> and that Sir <hi>H. Vane</hi> delivered
five pound to Capt. <hi>Linn,</hi> to reward the Souldiers. This was all the
Evidence given by the King's Counſel; To which, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>
was required to make his Defence; and to go through with his Caſe
all at once, and not to reply again upon the King's Counſel, who
reſolved to have the laſt word to the Jury.</p>

                  <head>Sir HENRY VANE.</head>

                     <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> fol. 6. ſaith, <hi>King</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

Authority and badges of Government, were viſibly in another name

name.</p>
                  <p>The Court told him, He ſhould firſt make his Caſe out in point of
Suit, and it would be then ſeaſonable to ſtand upon matter of Law; for
(ſaid they) it is a good Rule, <hi>in facto jus Oritur,</hi> and enjoyn'd him to

To which Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> deſired Proceſs of Court, to ſummon
them; and a further time, to anſwer the Charge. But it was told him,
The Jury were to be kept without meat, drink, fire or candle, till their
Verdict was delivered in; and therefore that could not be granted.</p>
                  <p>He then cited the 4th part of <hi>Cook's Inſtitutes,</hi> concerning the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Parliament, and that many of theſe things, being tranſacted
there—</p>
                  <p>The Court here interrupted him, and ſaid; If the things charged,
were done; juſtifie them: if not, excuſe them. So he went to give
anſwer to the Fact.</p>
                  <p>And as to the firſt Warrant, <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1648; He ſaid, that his hand
had been oftentimes counterſeited, and amongſt other occaſions, for
two great ſums, to the value of ten thouſand pounds; and that he had
great reaſon to believe, that this Warrant was forged, and produced
two Witneſſes to prove it.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaid <hi>Windham,</hi> Juſtice; It may be your hand may have been
forged for receiving of Money, but it is not to be conjectured that it

and knowledge; and being demanded to take an Oath of Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what had been done to the late King, he refuſed, and cauſed it
to be expunged. That theſe Actings in Council, (if any were) were
by Authority of Parliament, of a Parliament conſtituted in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
manner, made indiſſolvable but by Act of Parliament. He
inſiſted much on the Preamble of that Act, ſo as that Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
co-ordinate with the King, (for the Government was in the King
and the two Houſes) what-ever he acted by Them or their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
cannot be Treaſon within the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>He cited an Ordinance of Parliament in 1642, and ſaid, That he
hoped theſe things had been laid aſleep by the Act of Oblivion, and
if they ſhould now riſe in Judgment againſt him, he feared they would
ſhake that Security which the People promiſed themſelves under that
Act. But if he ſhould be now called in queſtion for thoſe things which
were tranſacted in that Parliament, of which he was a Member, he ſhal
have the comfort and peace of thoſe Actions to ſupport him in his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93090:16"/>
greateſt ſufferings. He added, That if he were excepted, then muſt
he be judged for the crime of the whole Nation, and that crime muſt
be ravelled into through him. That the Caſe is ſuch, as never yet fell
out, to wit, that the Government being entruſted to three Eſtates, they
ſhould ſo fall out among themſelves, as the People cannot tell which to
obey; That where theſe great Changes fall out, it is not poſſible for
any man to proceed according to all formalities of Law. That there
was a Political Power by this Act of 17. <hi>Caroli</hi> co-ordinate with the
King; and where theſe Powers are not in conjunction, but enmity to
each other, no Court inferiour to the Parliament, by whoſe Authority
theſe things were acted, ought to be Judges of this Caſe, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
never happened before.</p>
                  <p>He farther ſaith, he was not the firſt mover in theſe actions, and that
he ſhould be called in queſtion for theſe matters, by a King that was
out of poſſeſſion at the time when theſe things were acted, would be
inconvenient, to ſay no more; That when the three Eſtates were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
he thought it the beſt policy, to preſerve the Government in
its root, to wit, the <hi>Commons:</hi> by whom it was preſerved and at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to its former courſe. That as to the Regiment that paſſed under
his name, he diſown'd it. That Reports of Meſſages are not the fault
of the Reporter, for his judgment does not always go along with them,
but he is bound to deliver his Meſſage. That he alwayes loved the
Government, as it is ſet forth in our ancient Law-Books; and that
that <hi>Parliament</hi> (ſo much decried) at laſt reſtored affairs to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſture
in which they now are.</p>
                  <p>As to the Warrants ſigned by him, he ſaid, they appear to be ſigned
in the Name and by Order of the Council, and his hand that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes,
is not ſo much active as paſſive, to the Commands of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
If the Council, who commanded the ſigning, were unwarrantable,
The Parliament who appointed the Council, muſt be much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable.</p>
                  <p>And here he offered theſe points to be conſidered, and pray'd ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to have Counſel aſſigned him, to ſpeak to them.</p>
                  <p>1. Whether the collective body of the Parliament can be impeached
of High Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>2. Whether any perſon acting by Authority of Parliament, can (ſo

                  <p>3. Whether matters acted by that Authority, can be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion

be given in evidence to a <hi>Middleſex</hi> Jury?</p>
                  <p>As to the laſt Exception, the Court ſaid,</p>
                  <p>That he was indicted for compaſſing and imagining the King's
Death in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and any overt act, to prove this Imagination, may
be given in evidence whereſoever it be acted. To which Sir <hi>Hen.
Vane</hi> prayed the benefit of a Bill of Exception, upon the Statute of
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. cap. 31. and prayed that the Juſtices might ſeal it,
which they all refuſed, and held, it lay not in any caſe of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>The King's Counſel deſired he might call his Witneſſes, (if any he
had) for if they once came to reply to him, he muſt then be ſilent, and
conſented, that (if it would aid him) they would allow his Actings
to be in the Name and by the Authority of the Council of State, and
the Actings of the Council of State to be by Authority of what he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Hen. Vane</hi> replyed; Then what I acted in the <hi>Council of State,</hi>
and <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> conſtituted by the Parliament to endure for
eight dayes, you will allow me. Then you muſt prove that I ever
acted in the other Council of State, after the Parliament was turned
out.</p>
                  <p>Then the King's Counſel produced a Warrant, dated <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3.
1659, which was ſent in purſuance of an Order of the <hi>Committee of
Safety,</hi> by Sir <hi>Hen. Vane,</hi> as Treaſurer of the Navie. This Warrant
was, for the ſending of divers Arms Northwards, after Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi>
who was gone down to oppoſe the now Duke of <hi>Albemarle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Hen. Vane</hi> produced <hi>Will, Angel, Briſco, Middleton,</hi> &amp;c. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of that Regiment which went under his name, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
unto him for Orders, about <hi>Octob.</hi> 1659, he bad them deſiſt,
and declared his diſ-ſatisfaction in their proceedings; and this, after
their ſeveral importunities to have Orders from him. And thus he
cloſed his Defence.</p>

                  <p>As to pretence of the power of Parliament, It is to be known, that
it was not the eighth part of the Houſe of Commons, ſuch as were let
in to do all that hath been complained, and the acting under Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ſuch an End of a Parliament, under ſuch a Violation, was no
Excuſe, but an Aggravation; but that the Parliament was in Law,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93090:17"/>
ended, by the death of the late King, notwithſtanding that Act of 17.
<hi>Caroli primi,</hi> appears thus;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The King's Writ for a Parliament is <hi>ad tractandum nobiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;</hi>
which is intended as well of the natural capacity of the King,
as of his politick.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis abſurd to ſay, that the Acts of Parliament of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, ſhould be his Acts, in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A Commiſſion of Sewers, enacted to be on foot for ten
years, expires by the death of the King, and the authority of the
Commiſſioners is at an end.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is not poſſible for one King to impoſe a Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſucceſſor. So much for his acting by colour of authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Queſtion, <hi>Whether an Houſe of Parliament can
commit Treaſon?</hi> If they depart from that Allegiance which they
have ſworn, at their firſt meeting, they are impeachable for it.</p>
                  <p>As to a Co-ordination in the Parliament, he denied it.</p>
                  <p>As to the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the King being out of actual poſſeſſion,
can have Treaſon committed againſt him?</hi> he affirmed it: And ſaid,
otherwiſe, if Rebellion ſhould be ſo proſperous, as to depoſe or oppreſs
the King in Battel, the Offenders are not to be called in queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they prevailed. He ſaid, it was the Plea of <hi>Watſon</hi> the Jeſuite,
who, being Indicted for compaſſing the death of King <hi>James,</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
after he was declared King of <hi>England,</hi> and before his actual
entring into this Realm, made this Defence; That the King was

                  <p>
                     <hi>Windam</hi> Juſtice. As to the Act of 17. <hi>Caroli,</hi> and the Preamble
of that Act, ſo much inſiſted upon by the Priſoner. 1. He held
that the Parliament had not greater Authority by it, but were onely
made more durable than other Parliaments have been; but he held,
that the Parliament was abſolutely diſſolved by the death of the King;
and put this caſe: If it ſhould be enacted that ſuch a Marriage ſhould
continue, till it was diſſolved by Act of Parliament, If one dies, it is a
determination of it in Fact, ſo as no man can ſay, but it is abſolutely
diſſolved. 2. It muſt continue in the degree and dignity of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If the Houſe be under a force, and ſome kept out, ſome let in,
to ſerve a Turn, what-ever they act is a Nullity in Law. For Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is the principal eſſence and honour of a Parliament; yet though
the Houſe be under a Force, the Houſe is not diſſolved by ſuch Force,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93090:17"/>
but the proceedings are to be ſuſpended, till it require its former Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
and this as well by the Common Law, as by the Civil and
Canon Laws of all other Countries. 3. The Parliament is the King's
great Council, The Peers are <hi>Conſiliarii nati;</hi> If they be forc'd away,
or laid aſide, as here they were, all the reſt is but <hi>Magni Nominis
Umbra.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Twiſden</hi> held the ſame opinion, That it is not the ſitting of a few
Members within thoſe Walls, that will continue it a Parliament.</p>
                  <p>And though another Parliament, a great many years after the Kings
death, declared it to be at an end, yet that Act was but Declaration,
it was at an end before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether a Parliament may commit Treaſon,</hi> is not the Queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but, Whether a few of the Houſe, ſhutting out their Fellows, and
uſurping the Government, were not Traitors?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foſter</hi> held the ſame opinion, and ſaid, The diſtinction between the
Politick and Natural capacity of the King, was the Treaſon of the
two <hi>Spencers;</hi> That Priviledge of the Parliament is no ſhelter for
breach of the Peace, much leſs for Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twiſden</hi> added, That to compaſs the Death of the King as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
perſon, was Treaſon; to compaſs his Death in his Politick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
as to depoſe him, was Treaſon, and both provided for by the
Act of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That in the ſame inſtant the late King expired, in
the very ſame his now Majeſty was King <hi>de facto,</hi> and affirmed the
caſes of <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Cleark 1. Jac.</hi> If an Army be raiſed againſt the

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ended the queſtions of Law, propoſed.</p>
                  <p>The Sollicitor ſpake after to the Jury, concerning the Fact, which
after, they withdrew to conſider, and being withdrawn about half an
hour, returned with their Verdict, which being delivered by the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the name of his fellows, with their conſent, found the Priſoner
guilty of High Treaſon from <hi>Januar.</hi> 30. 1648.</p>
                  <p>They not only found him guilty according to the Indictment, which
was laid for what the Priſoner did, 1659; but for a long ſeries of
High Treaſon (as they reckon) from <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1648. By which it
may appear, they were a well-prepared Jury for their work. The
Judges oft, if not alwayes, pretend, that the Jury is to paſs Verdict only
as to matter of Fact, according to the Evidence given by the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
thereof. But a general Verdict evidently involves both, that he is
guilty of ſuch fact, and that the fact is Treaſon, as they in this Verdict
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93090:18"/>
openly undertake to determine, taking in the full ſence of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and much more. Unleſs a Jury diſtinguiſh themſelves out of this
uſually impoſed ſnare, by giving a ſpecial Verdict concerning the Fact
only, they undeniably have a ſhare with their Tutors and Inſtructors
in the ſhedding of innocent blood, in caſe matter of Law be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſtated.</p>
                  <p>For a Jury to reſolve a Caſe of Law, that ſo eminent a Subjects life
was concern'd in, and that in leſs than half an hour, which never yet
came before any Bench of Judicature in <hi>England,</hi> may ſeem a very
ſtrange and bold adventure.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Reader,</hi> How far this falls ſhort of a full Account of all that
was ſpoken by the Priſoner (though much interrupted by the <hi>King's
Bench</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi>) in thoſe ten hours, which on this day of his Tryal
he ſtood at the Bar, (pleading and anſwering for his Life, and the
Cauſe he had with many thouſands been engaged in) I leave to thee
to imagine, till a fuller and compleater Account thereof can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
than is yet come to hand.</p>
                  <p>This was remarkable; That never being indulg'd the liberty of any
repoſe to his body, all that while, (which indeed, he asked not) nor
receiving any creature-refreſhings, though ſent him, for his ſupport;
yea, and though after all his moſt rational Plea, in his Defence, the
Jury gave their Verdict againſt his Life, he came chearfully and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
from the Bar, as thought worthy to ſuffer for the Name of
Chriſt; and was ſo raiſed and full of rejoycing that evening, at the
place of his confinement in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that he was a wonder to any
that were about him. This ſpiritual rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, and his
heavenly raiſedneſs of ſpirit, increaſed more and more, to the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his death; inſomuch, that meer ſtrangers to his perſon, yea,
very foreigners, wondred at his triumphant diſſolution.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93090:18"/>
and having in purſuance thereof, taken my ſeat in the ſaid Parliament,
I was obliged by Law, to give my attendance upon the ſaid Truſt, as
well as upon grounds of Duty and Conſcience.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Parliament was not onely called and aſſembled after the
uſual manner, and had the Power and Priviledges incident to that high
Court, but was by expreſs Statute and Conſent of the three Eſtates,
ſo conſtituted, as to its Continuance, Adjournment, Prorogation and
Diſſolution, that in none of theſe particulars they were ſubject to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
but by their own common Aſſent, declared by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to be paſſed by themſelves for that purpoſe, with the Royal
Aſſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Preamble to the Act for continuance of the ſaid Parliament,
theſe words are contained:</hi> Whereas great ſums of Money muſt of
neceſſity be ſpeedily advanced and provided, for the relief of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Army and People in the Northern parts of this Realm, and
for preventing the imminent danger this Kingdom is in, and for ſupply
of his Majeſties preſent and urgent occaſions, which cannot be ſo
timely effected as is requiſit, without Credit for raiſing the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys;
which Credit cannot be obtained until ſuch obſtacles be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
as are occaſioned by fears, jealouſies and apprehenſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
his Majeſties loyal Subjects, That this preſent Parliament may
be Adjourned, Prorogued or Diſſolved, before Juſtice ſhall be duely
executed upon Delinquents, Publick Grievances redreſſed, a firm
Peace between the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> concluded,
and before ſufficient Proviſion be made for the repayment of the ſaid
Moneys ſo to be raiſed, &amp;c. <hi>By all which, the very work that was
between the three Eſtates agreed to be done for the Good and Safety
of the Kingdom, was in ſundry particulars declared and expreſſed;
and not only ſo, but as is acknowledged by the late King himſelf in his
Anſwer to the</hi> nineteen Propoſitions; <hi>The Power which thereby was
legally placed in both Houſes, was more than ſufficient to prevent and
reſtrain Tyranny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, by what hath been ſhewed, the Law it ſelf is with me,
and for me, enjoyning my continued attendance on the Truſt which by
this means was committed to me, and authorized me in particular to
effect the things contained in the ſaid Preamble; and to act in all
matters belonging to the high Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the Good and
Safety of the Kingdom in time of imminent danger, I had been liable
to great puniſhment by the Law, for diſ-attendance and deſerting my
ſtation therein, till lawfully or by force diſmiſſed there-from: and this,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93090:19"/>
whatever occaſions others might have, by a voluntary or forc'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from attendance upon that Truſt.</p>
               <p>The actions therefore done by me in this capacity, and according to
the Law, Priviledges, Cuſtoms and Power of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that,
ſuch a one as was thus extraordinarily conſtituted, neither are nor can
be brought within the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 2. nor are to be
queſtioned, tried, much leſs judged and ſentenc'd in any inferior Court.
Nay, ſo far is it from this, that by a Declaration and Reſolution of
<hi>Parliament, Aug.</hi> 13. 1642, it is adjudged to be committing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the higheſt degree, to bring both or either Houſes of Parliament
under that or ſuch like Imputations.</p>
               <p>Nor, till of late, have I ever heard but that thoſe who took the
Judgment of <hi>Parliament</hi> for their rule and guide, (however tortuous
or erroneous it might afterwards be accounted in ſucceeding times)
and they that acted by and under the countenance of their declared
Judgments, Orders or Ordinances, (ever acknowledged binding du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſitting of the Parliament) were ſafe and indempnified from all
puniſhment. And for Government-ſake it ſelf, it is requiſit it ſhould
be ſo; becauſe none are Judges of the Power and Priviledges of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
but themſelves. For admit once, that their Judgment may be
called in queſtion, and diſputed by private perſons, or by inferiour
Courts, (whoſe Votes are included in theirs) the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of
Government are plucked up by the roots. <hi>Par in pares non habet
Imperium, multó minus in eos qui majus Imperium habent;</hi> An
Equal has no command over his Equal, much leſs over thoſe that have
a greater command or authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His late Majeſty, in his Anſwer to the</hi> nineteen Propoſitions, <hi>does
very briefly and exactly ſtate the nature and kind of Government, that
is exerciſed in this Kingdom, ſaying,</hi> The Laws in this Kingdom are
made by a King, a Houſe of Peers, and a Houſe of Commons, choſen
by the People, all having free Votes, and particular Priviledges. Theſe
three Eſtates, making one incorporate body, are they, in whom the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
and Supream Power is placed, as to the making and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
of Laws. And the Government, according to theſe Laws, is
truſted to the King, who in the Interval of Parliaments, is ſole in
the exerciſe of Government, which (the Parliament ſitting) he is to
exerciſe in conjunction with the two Houſes.</p>
               <p>And his ſaid Majeſty aſſerting three ſorts of Government, <hi>Abſolute
Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> does moſt rightly diſtinguiſh
the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> from all thoſe three, and commends the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93090:19"/>
Conſtitution of this Kingdom, as it is a mixture of all three, having the
conveniencies of them all, without the inconveniencies of any one, as
long as the ballance hangs even between the three Eſtates, that they
run joyntly on in their proper channels, and that the overflowing of
either on either ſide, raiſe no deluge nor inundation.</p>
               <p>By the paſſing of the foreſaid Act, for the continuance of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Parliament, the Intervals of Parliament were no longer, as
before, at the will and pleaſure of the <hi>King,</hi> but the Power to continue
the ſaid <hi>Parliament,</hi> without Adjournment, Prorogation, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
reſided in the two Houſes with the <hi>King,</hi> joyntly, and in none
of them ſeverally; ſo that in effect, the Government of the Kingdom,
during the continuance of that Parliament, was in conjunction of the
three Eſtates, and in their common conſents and agreements among
themſelves, given in Parliament, the aſſembling and meeting whereof
was appointed and fixed to a place certain, by Law.</p>
               <p>By reaſon hereof, it is not the attendance of any of the Members in
Parliament (for diſcharge of the Truſt repoſed in them, confirm'd and
enlarged by the ſaid Act) that is faulty or cenſurable by the Law, but
thoſe that unwarrantably depart and deſert that their Truſt and ſtation,
are to be blamed; 6. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 16.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> in conjunction with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> is <hi>maxime Rex,</hi>
and is ſupported in the Throne and exerciſe of his Regal Power, by
the joynt concurrence of both Houſes. And becauſe (as his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
well obſerved) the happineſs and good of the Conſtitution of this
Government, lies in keeping the ballance even between the three Eſtates,
containing themſelves within the bounds of their proper channels, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in attempts of either to overflow thoſe bounds, (they being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate)
the Office of a <hi>Parliament</hi> is by the very fundamental conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Government, to keep this ballance well poiſed. And to
that end (as was before mentioned) his Majeſties own words are in
his ſaid Anſwer to the <hi>nineteen Propoſitions; That there was legally
placed in both Houſes, a Power more than ſufficient to prevent and
reſtrain the Power of Tyranny.</hi> If ſo, then are they the legal Judges,
when there is danger of Tyranny; and have legal power to require
their Judgment and Reſolves to be obeyed, not only when Arms are
actually raiſed againſt them, but when they diſcern and accordingly
declare a preparation towards it: elſe, they may find it too late to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the power of Tyranny. There is no greater attempt of Tyranny,
than to arm againſt the Parliament; and there is no viſible way for the
reſtraining ſuch Tyranny, but by raiſing Arms in their own and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93090:20"/>
Kingdoms defence. Leſs than this is not ſufficient, and therefore far
from more than ſufficient, for the puniſhment of Delinquents and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Unto the King in conjunction with his two Houſes, according as is
provided by the Law, in this capacity of his as <hi>maxime Rex,</hi> was
the duty of Allegiance to be yeelded by his Subjects, during the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
ſtate of that Parliament. For they were the King's great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and ſupream Court, exerciſing the known Power and Priviledges,
that time out of mind have appertained to them, and been put forth by
them, as the Exigents of the Kingdom have required, when differences
have happened about the very title of the Crown, in declaring the
duty of the Subject, by yeelding their Allegiance to Kings <hi>de facto,</hi>
when Kings <hi>de jure</hi> have been kept out of poſſeſſion. This our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
and the Hiſtories of former times, do plentifully inform.</p>
               <p>The cauſes that did happen, to move his late Majeſty to depart from
his Parliament, and continue for many years, not only at a diſtance and
in a diſjunction from them, but at laſt, in a declared poſture of Enmity
and War againſt them, are ſo well known and fully ſtated in print (not
to ſay, <hi>written in characters of blood</hi>) on both parts, that I ſhall only
mention it, and refer to it.</p>
               <p>This matter was not done in a corner. The Appeals were ſolemn,
and the deciſion by the Sword, was given by that God, who being
the Judge of the whole World, does Right, and cannot do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>By occaſion of theſe unhappy differences, thus happening moſt great
and unuſual Changes and Revolutions, like an irreſiſtible Torrent, did
break in upon us, not only to the diſjoynting that Parliamentary Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
among themſelves, (the head from the members, the co-ordinates
from each other, and the houſes within themſelves) but to the creating
ſuch formed diviſions among the people, and to the producing ſuch a
general ſtate of Confuſion and Diſorder, that hardly any were able to
know their duty, and with certainly to diſcern who were to command
and who to obey. All things ſeemed to be reduced, and in a manner
reſolved into their firſt elements and principles.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, as dark as ſuch a ſtate might be, the Law of <hi>England</hi>
leaves not the Subjects thereof (as I humbly conceive) without ſome
glimpſes of direction what to do, in the cleaving to, and purſuing of
which, I hope I ſhall not be accounted nor judged an offender; or if
I am, I ſhall have the comfort and peace of my Actions to ſupport me
in and under my greateſt ſufferings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93090:20"/>
The Reſolutions of all the Judges in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, entituled, <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi>
in the 7th Book of <hi>Cook</hi>'s Reports, and the learned Arguments
thereupon, afforded me inſtruction even in this matter. It may be 'tis
truly thence affirmed, that Allegiance is due only to the King, and how
due, is alſo ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The King is acknowledged to have two capacities in him; one a
<hi>natural,</hi> as he is deſcended of the Blood Royal of the Realm; and the
Body natural he hath in this capacity, is of the creation of Almighty
God and mortal: The other is a <hi>politick</hi> capacity, in reſpect of which
he is a Body politick or myſtical, framed by the policy of man, which
is immortal and inviſible. To the King, in both theſe capacities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd,
Allegiance is due; that is to ſay, to the natural perſon of the
King, accompanied with his politick capacity, or the politick appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the natural.</p>
               <p>The politick capacity of the King hath properly no body nor ſoul:
for it is framed by the policy of man.</p>
               <p>In all Indictments of Treaſon, when any one does intend the death
and deſtruction of the King, it muſt needs be underſtood of his natural
body, the other being immortal. The Indictment therefore concludes
<hi>contra Legiantiae ſuae debitum,</hi> againſt the duty of his Allegiance, ſo
that Allegiance is due to the natural body.</p>
               <p>Admitting then that thus by Law, Allegiance is due to the King (as
before recited) yet it is alwayes to be preſumed, that it is to the King in
conjunction with the Parliament, the Law, and the Kingdom, and
not in diſjunction from, or oppoſition to them; and that, while a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is in being and cannot be diſſolved, but by the Conſent of the
three Eſtates.</p>
               <p>This is therefore that, which makes the matter in queſtion, a new
Caſe, that never before happened in the Kingdom, nor was poſſible to
happen, unleſs there had been a Parliament conſtituted, as this was, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjected
to Adjournment, Prorogation or Diſſolution, by the King's
will. Where ſuch a power is granted, and the co-ordinates thereupon
diſagree and fall out, ſuch effects and conſequents as theſe that have
happened, will but too probably follow. And, if either the Law of
Nature, or <hi>England,</hi> inform not in ſuch caſe, it will be impoſſible for the
Subjects to know their duty, when that Power and Command which
ought to flow from three in conjunction, comes to be exerciſed by all
or either of them, ſingly and apart, or by two of them againſt one.</p>
               <p>When new and never-heard-of Changes do fall out in the Kingdom,
it is not like that the known and written Laws of the Land ſhould be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93090:21"/>
the exact Rule, but the Grounds and Rules of Juſtice, contained and
declared in the Law of Nature, are and ought to be a Sanctuary in
ſuch caſes, even by the very Common Law of <hi>England:</hi> For, thence
originally ſpring the unerring Rules, that are ſet by the Divine and
Eternal Law, for Rule and Subjection in all States and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>In contemplation hereof, as the Reſolve of all the Judges, it
was agreed,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That Allegiance is due to Soveraignty by the Law of Nature,</hi>
to wit, that Law which God at the creation of Man, infuſed into his
heart, for his preſervation and direction, the Law eternal. Yet, is it
not this Law, as it is in the heart of every individual man, that is bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over many, or legiſlative, but as it is the Act of a Community, or
an Aſſociated People, by the right dictates and perſwaſions of the
work of this Law in their hearts. This appears in the Caſe of the
<hi>Iſraelites, Judg.</hi> 20, &amp; 21 chapters, cited in the 4th part of <hi>Cook's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,</hi>
where mention is made of a Parliament without a King, that
made War, and that with their Brethren. They met as one man to
do it, in vindication of that Juſtice unto which they were obliged even
by the Law of Nature. This is that which Chancellor <hi>Forteſcue</hi> calls
<hi>Political Power,</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi> by which, as by the Ordinance of
man, in purſuance of the Ordinance of God, the Regal Office conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
or the King's Politick Capacity, and becomes appropriated to
his natural perſon.</p>
               <p>Thus Politick Power is the immediate Efflux and Off-ſpring of the
Law of Nature, and may be called a part of it. To this, <hi>Hooker</hi> in
his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity</hi> agrees, and <hi>Selden</hi> on that ſubject.</p>
               <p>The Law of Nature thus conſidered, is part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi>
as is evident by all the beſt received Law-Books, <hi>Bracton, Fleta, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>
upon the <hi>Saxon Laws,</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue</hi> in the praiſe of the <hi>Laws of
England.</hi> This is the Law that is before any judicial or municipal
Law, as the root and fountain whence theſe and all Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God and his Law do flow.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Politick Power,</hi> as it is exerciſed in conjunction with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Eternal Law, partakes of its moral and immutable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and cannot be changed by Act of Parliament. Of this Law it is
that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Charter of Foreſt,</hi> with other Statutes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
in the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> are for the moſt part declaratory. For
they are not introductive of any new Law, but confirmations of what
was good in all Laws of <hi>England,</hi> before. This agrees with that
Maxime, <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema Lex;</hi> that being made due and binding
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93090:21"/>
by this Law, which in the Judgment of the Community, declaring
their mind by their own free choſen Delegates and Truſtees, in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
with the Eternal Law, appears profitable and neceſſary for the
preſervation and good of the whole Society.</p>
               <p>This is the Law, which is put forth by the common conſent of the
whole Realm, in their Repreſentative; and (according to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Conſtitutions of this Kingdom) is that, with which the Kings
of this Land, by the joynt co-operation of the three Eſtates, do make
and repeal Laws.</p>
               <p>But through the diſorders and diviſions of the times, theſe two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
the <hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Political,</hi> (which, according to the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
make up but one and the ſame ſupream Authority) fell aſſunder,
and found themſelves in diſjunction from, and oppoſition to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I do not ſay, The queſtion is now, which of theſe is moſt
rightly, (according to the principles of the Law of Nature and the Law
of <hi>England</hi>) to be adhered unto and obeyed, but unto whether Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
adherence is a crime, in ſuch an Exigent of State? Which, ſince
it is ſuch a new and extraordinary Caſe, evidently above the Track of
the ordinary Rules, contained in the poſitive and municipal Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> there can be no colour to bring it within the Statute of 25.
<hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 2. foraſmuch as all Statutes preſuppoſe theſe two Powers,
<hi>Regal</hi> and <hi>Political,</hi> in conjunction, perfect unity and ſubſerviency,
which this Caſe does not, cannot admit. So exceeding new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
a Caſe is it, that it may be doubted whether, and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
how far, any other Parliament, but <hi>that</hi> Parliament it ſelf that
was privy to all its own Actings and Intentions, can be an indifferent
and competent Judge. But however, the point is of ſo abſtruſe and
high conſideration, as no inferiour Court can, or ought to judge of it,
as by Law-Books is moſt undeniable; to wit, <hi>Bracton</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>This then being the true ſtate of the Caſe, and the ſpring of that
Conteſt that enſued, and received its deciſion by the late War; The
next Conſideration is, how far I have had my ſhare and part therein,
that by the Laws is not warrantable, or by what appears in way of
proof, to the Jury.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I ſhall crave leave to give you this account of my ſelf,
who have beſt known my own mind and intentions throughout, and
would not now, to ſave my life, renounce the principles of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cauſe, which my conſcience tells me, was my duty to be faithful
unto.</p>
               <p>I do therefore humbly affirm, That in the afore-mentioned great
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93090:22"/>
Changes and Revolutions, from firſt to laſt, I was never a firſt mover,
but alwayes a follower, chuſing rather to adhere to <hi>things</hi> than <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi>
and (where Authority was dark or dubious) to do things juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
by the Light and Law of Nature, as that Law is acknowledged
part of the Law of the Land; things, that are <hi>in ſe bona,</hi> and ſuch,
as according to the grounds and principles of the Common Law, as
well as the Statutes of this Land, would warrant and indempnifie me,
in doing them. For I have obſerved by Precedents of former times,
when there have ariſen diſputes about Titles to the Crown, between
Kings <hi>de facto</hi> and Kings <hi>de jure,</hi> the People of this Realm wanted
not directions for their ſafety, and how to behave themſelves within
the duty and limits of Allegiance to the King and Kingdom, in ſuch
difficult and dangerous ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> is very clear in this point, in his Chap. of Treaſon,
<hi>fol.</hi> 7. And if it were otherwiſe, it were the hardeſt caſe that could be,
for the people of <hi>England:</hi> For then they would be certainly expoſed
to puniſhment, from thoſe that are in poſſeſſion of the ſupream power,
as Traitors, if they do any thing againſt them, or do not obey them;
and they would be puniſhable as Traitors, by him that hath right,
and is King <hi>de jure,</hi> in caſe they do obey the Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> and ſo
all the people of <hi>England</hi> are neceſſarily involved in Treaſons, either
againſt the Powers <hi>de facto,</hi> or <hi>de jure,</hi> and may by the ſame reaſon
be queſtioned for it, as well as the Priſoner, if the <hi>Act of Indempnity</hi>
and the <hi>King's Pardon</hi> did not free them from it. The ſecurity then
and ſafety of all the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is by this means, made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a <hi>Pardon,</hi> (which might have been granted or denied) and
not upon the ſure foundations of <hi>Common Law;</hi> an opinion ſure, which
(duly weighed and conſidered) is very ſtrange, to ſay no more.</p>
               <p>For I would gladly know that perſon in <hi>England</hi> of eſtate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and of age, that hath not counſelled, aided or abetted, either by
his perſon or eſtate, and ſubmitted to the Laws and Government of the
Powers that then were; and if ſo, then by your Judgments upon me,
you condemn (in effigies, and by neceſſary conſequence) the whole
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And if that be the Law, and be now known to be ſo, it is worth
conſideration, whether, if it had been generally known and underſtood
before, it might not have hindred his Majeſties Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>Beſides, although, until this Judgement be paſſed upon me, the
people have apprehended themſelves, as free from queſtion, and out of
danger, by reaſon of the <hi>Act of Indempnity and General Pardon;</hi> yet
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93090:22"/>
when it ſhall appear to them, that ſuch their ſafety is not grounded on
the Common Law, nor upon the Law of Nature, but that againſt
both theſe in their actions, they are found faulty, and tainted with a
moral guilt, and that as principals; alſo, (ſince in Treaſon there are
no Acceſſories) what terrifying Reflexions muſt this needs ſtir up in
the mind of every man, that will be apt to believe his Turn will come
next, at leaſt once in two years, as hath befallen me in my p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſon,
who (however I have been miſjudged and miſunderſtood) can truly
affirm, that in the whole ſeries of my Actions, that which I have
had in my eye, hath been to preſerve the ancient, well-conſtituted
Government of <hi>England</hi> on its own <hi>baſis</hi> and primitive righteous foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
moſt learnedly ſtated by <hi>Forteſcue</hi> in his Book, made in praiſe
of the <hi>Engliſh Laws.</hi> And I did account it the moſt likely means for
the effecting of this, to preſerve it, at leaſt in its root, whatever changes
and alterations it might be expoſed unto in its branches, through the
bluſtrous and ſtormy times that have paſſed over us.</p>
               <p>This is no new doctrine, in a Kingdom acquainted with <hi>Political
Power,</hi> as <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſhews ours is, deſcribing it to be in effect, the
Common Aſſent of the Realm, the Will of the People or whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Kingdom, repreſented in Parliament. Nay, though this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
(as hath fallen out) be reſtrained for a ſeaſon, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Houſe, in their ſingle actings, into which (as we have ſeen) when
by the inordinate fire of the times, two of the three Eſtates have for a
ſeaſon been melted down, they did but retire into their Root, and
were not hereby in their Right, deſtroyed, but rather preſerved,
though as to their exerciſe, laid for a while aſleep, till the ſeaſon came
of their Revival and Reſtoration.</p>
               <p>And whatever were the intents and deſigns of others, (who are to
give an account of their own actions) It is ſufficient for me, that at a
time critical and deciſive, (though to my own hazard and ill uſage) I
did declare my Refuſal of the Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> which was intended
to be taken by all the Members of Parliament, in reference to Kingly
Government, and the Line of his now Majeſty in particular. This I
not only poſitively refuſed to take, but was an occaſion of the ſecond
thoughts which the Parliament reaſſumed thereof, till in a manner,
they came wholly at laſt to decline it; a proof undeniable of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs
of any intentions or deſigns of mine, as to the endeavouring
any alteration or change in the Government, and was that which gave
ſuch jealouſie to many in the Houſe, that they were willing to take the
firſt occaſion to ſhew their diſlike of me, and to diſcharge me from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93090:23"/>
But to return to what I have before affirmed, as to my being no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or firſt Actor in any Change, it is very apparent by my deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the time when that great Violation of Priviledges happened to
the Parliament, ſo as by force of Arms ſeveral Members thereof were
debarred coming into the Houſe and keeping their ſeats there. This
made me forbear to come to the Parliament for the ſpace of ten weeks,
(to wit, from the third of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648, till towards the middle of
<hi>February</hi> following) or to meddle in any publick tranſactions. And
during that time, the matter moſt obvious to exception, in way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Government, did happen. I can therefore truly ſay,
that as I had neither conſent nor vote, at firſt, in the Reſolutions of the
Houſes, concerning the <hi>Non-Addreſſes</hi> to his late Majeſty, ſo neither
had I, in the leaſt, any conſent in, or approbation to, his Death. But on
the contrary, when required by the Parliament, to take an Oath, to give
my approbation <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> to what was done, I utterly refuſed,
and would not accept of ſitting in the Council of State upon thoſe
terms, but occaſioned a new Oath to be drawn, wherein that was
omitted. Hereupon, many of the Council of State ſate, that would not
take the other.</p>
               <p>In like manner, The Reſolutions and Votes for changing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> or <hi>Free-State</hi> were paſſed, ſome weeks
before my return to Parliament. Yet afterwards (ſo far as I judged
the ſame conſonant to the principles and grounds, declared in the
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> for upholding that Political Power, which hath given
the riſe and introduction in this Nation, to Monarchy it ſelf, by the
account of antient Writers) I conceived it my duty, as the ſtate of
things did then appear to me, (notwithſtanding the ſaid Alteration
made) to keep my ſtation in Parliament, and to perform my Allegiance
therein, to King and Kingdom, under the Powers then <hi>regnant,</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my principles before declared) yeelding obedience to their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Commands. And having received Truſt, in reference to the
ſafety and preſervation of the Kingdom, in thoſe times of imminent
danger, (both within and without) I did conſcientiouſly hold my
ſelf obliged, to be true and faithful therein. This I did upon a publick
account, not daring to quit my ſtation in Parliament, by vertue of my
firſt Writ. Nor was it for any private or gainful ends, to profit my ſelf
or enrich my Relations. This may appear as well by the great Debt I
have contracted, as by the deſtitute condition my many Children are
in, as to any proviſion made for them. And I do publickly challenge
all perſons whatſoever, that can give information of any Bribes or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93090:23"/>
wayes, uſed by me, during the whole time of my publick acting.
Therefore I hope it will be evident to the Conſciences of the Jury, that
what I have done, hath been upon principles of Integrity, Honour,
Juſtice, Reaſon and Conſcience, and not as is ſuggeſted in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by <hi>inſtigation of the Devil,</hi> or <hi>want of the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond great Change that happened upon the Conſtitution of the
Parliament, and in them, of the very Kingdom it ſelf and the Laws
thereof (to the plucking up the Liberties of it by the very roots, and
the introducing of an Arbitrary Regal Power, under the name of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi>
by force, and the Law of the Sword) was the Uſurpation of
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> which I oppoſed from the beginning to the end, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of ſuffering, and with that conſtancy, that well near had coſt me
not only the loſs of my Eſtate, but of my very Life, if he might have
had his will, which a higher than he hindred. Yet I did remain a
Priſoner, under great hardſhip, four months, in an Iſland, by his
Orders.</p>
               <p>Hereby, That which I have aſſerted, is moſt undeniably evident, as
to the true grounds and ends of my actions all along, that were againſt
Uſurpation on the one hand, or ſuch extraordinary Actings on the
other, as I doubted the Laws might not warrant or indempnifie, unleſs
I were inforced thereunto, by an over-ruling and inevitable neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The third conſiderable Change, was the total diſappointing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of the ſaid Uſurpation, and the returning again of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament to the exerciſe of their primitive and original Truſt,
for the good and ſafety of the Kingdom, ſo far as the ſtate of the times
would then permit them, being ſo much as they were, under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of an Army, that for ſo long a time had influenced the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Towards the recovery therefore of things again into their own
channel, and upon the legal Root of the Peoples Liberties, to wit, their
Common Conſent in Parliament, given by their own Deputies and
Truſtees, I held it my duty to be again acting in publick Affairs, in the
capacity of a Member of the ſaid Parliament, then re-entred upon the
actual Exerciſe of their former Power, or at leaſt ſtrugling for it. In
this ſeaſon I had the opportunity of declaring my true intentions, as to
the Government, upon occaſion of refuſing the Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned.</p>
               <p>And whereas I am charged with keeping out his Majeſty that now
is, from exerciſing his Regal Power or Royal Authority in this his
Kingdom; through the ill-will born me by that part of the Parliament
then ſitting, I was diſcharg'd from being a Member thereof, about
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93090:24"/>
                  <hi>Jan.</hi> 9. 1659, and by many of them was charged, or at leaſt ſtrongly
ſuſpected to be a <hi>Royaliſt:</hi> Yea, I was not only diſcharged from my
attendance in Parliament, but confined as a priſoner at mine own houſe,
ſome time before there was any viſible power in the Nation that thought
it ſeaſonable to own the King's Intereſt. And I hope my ſitting ſtill,
will not be imputed as a failer of duty, in the condition of a priſoner,
and thoſe circumſtances I then was in. This I can ſay, that from the
time I ſaw his Majeſties Declarations from <hi>Breda,</hi> declaring his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Reſolutions as to his Return to take upon him the actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of his Regal Office in <hi>England,</hi> and to indempnifie all thoſe that
had been Actors in the late Differences and Wars, (as in the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
doth appear) I reſolved, not to avoid any publick queſtion,
(if called thereto) as relying on mine own Innocency and his Majeſties
declared Favour, as beforeſaid. And for the future I determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
my ſelf with that inoffenſiveneſs and agreeableneſs to my duty, as
to give no juſt matter of new provocation to his Majeſty in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
All this on my part, hath been punctually obſerved, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my ſufferings have been. Nor am I willing, in the leaſt, to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
any diſcouraging thoughts in my mind, as to his Majeſties Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
and Favour towards me, who have been faithfull to the Truſt I
was engaged in, without any malicious intentions againſt his Majeſty,
his Crown or Dignity, as before hath been ſhewed. And I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
for the future, to walk peaceably and blameleſly.</p>
               <p>Whatever therefore my perſonal ſufferings have been, ſince his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Reſtoration, I rather impute them to the falſe reports and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of mine enemies and miſjudgers of my actions, than reckon
them as any thing that hath proceeded from his Majeſties proper incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
whoſe favour and clemency I have had juſt reaſon with all
humility to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Firſt, with regard to his Majeſties Speech made the 27th of <hi>July,</hi>
1660, in the Houſe of Peers, wherein his Majeſty expreſly declared it
to be no intention of his, that a perſon under my circumſtances ſhould
be excepted out of the <hi>Act of Indempnity,</hi> either for Life or Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And, ſecondly, however it was the Parliaments pleaſure (my ſelf
unheard, though then in the Tower, and ready to have been brought
before them) to except me out of the common Indempnity, and ſubject
me to queſtion for my actions, yet they themſelves, of their own accord
(admitting the poſſibility that in ſuch queſtioning of me, I might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted)
made it their humble deſire to his Majeſty, that in ſuch caſe,
Execution, as to my Life, might be remitted. Unto this his Majeſty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93090:24"/>
readily gave his Grant and Aſſent. And I do firmly believe, if the
Houſes had pleaſed to give me the opportunity and leave of being
heard, they would never have denied me the Indempnity granted to
the reſt of the Nation.</p>
               <p>That which remains of further Charge yet to me, is the buſineſs of
a Regiment, an imployment, which I can in truth affirm, mine own
inclinations, nature and breeding little fitted me for, and which was
intended onely as honorary and titular, with relation to Volunteers,
who, by their application to the Council of State, in a time of great
Commotions, did propound their own Officers, and (without any
ſeeking of mine, or my conſidering any farther of it, than as the uſe of
my Name) did (among others) nominate me for a Colonel, which
the Council of State approved, granting Commiſſions to my ſelf and
all other Officers relating thereunto. And the Parliament confirmed
my ſaid Commiſſion, upon report thereof made to them.</p>
               <p>This will appear by ſeveral Witneſſes I have to produce in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that will be able to affirm, how little I took upon me, or at all,
to give any Orders, or make uſe of ſuch my Commiſſion, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than in name only.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, that at a certain time, when I was ſummoned to
appear at the Committee of the Militia in <hi>Southwark,</hi> whereof I was
a Member; That which was called my own Company of Foot (from
the reſpect which they and their Officers pretended to me) were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be in a poſture, fit for me to ſee them, and as I paſſed by, I
took the opportunity at their deſire to ſhew my ſelf to them, and only
(as taking notice of their reſpect) in ſome few words, expreſſing the
reaſon I had to receive it in good part, I told them I would no longer
detain them from their other occaſions. After I was gone from them,
I appointed my Capt. Lieutenant to give them from me ſomething to
drink, as might be fitting on ſuch an occaſion, which, to my beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
was five pounds, and he laid it out of his own money.</p>
               <p>More than this (as I remember) was not done by me, ſo much as
to the ſeeing any more, the Companies of that Regiment gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or giving Orders to them, which I publickly and avowedly
declined, perſwading the Officers to lay down their Charges, in mine
own example, ſo ſoon as I diſcern'd the intentions of the ſitting down
of the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> and the exorbitant power committed to
them to exerciſe, and the way of proceedings by the Army, in intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves in the Civil Government of the Nation, which I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſliked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:93090:25"/>
And although I forbore not to keep my ſtation, in reference to the
Council of State while they ſate, or as a Commiſſioner of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
during the time by them appointed to act by Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and ſo, had occaſion to be daily converſant with the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> (whereof my ſelf, with others that
would not accept, were named) yet I perfectly kept my ſelf diſ-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
from all thoſe Actings of the Army, as to any Conſent or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of mine, (however in many things by way of diſcourſe, I
did not decline converſe with them) holding it my duty, to penetrate
as far as I could into their true Intentions and Actions, but reſolving
within my ſelf to hold true to my Parliamentary Truſt, in all things
wherein the Parliament appeared to me to act for the ſafety and good
of the Kingdom, however I was miſ-interpreted and judged by them,
as one that rather favoured ſome of the Army and their power.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, There is not any precedent, that ever both
or either of the Houſes of Parliament did commit Treaſon. For
though Priviledge of Parliament does not ſo hold in Treaſon, but that
particular Members may be puniſhed for it, yet it is unprecedented,
That both or either Houſes of Parliament, as a collective Body, ever
did or could commit Treaſon.</p>
               <p>All the Acts done in Parliaments, have been reverſed indeed, and
repealed, as what was done 11. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. was repealed, 21. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2;
and what was done 21. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. was repealed 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 3; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the printed Statutes. Yet I do not find, that both or either
Houſe of Parliament were declared Traitors for what they did in thoſe
Parliaments; Or that any which acted under them, ſuffered for the
ſame in any inferiour Courts. And ſurely, the reaſon is obvious: For
they had a co-ordinacy in the Supream or Legiſlative Power, for
the making, altering and repealing Laws. And if ſo, <hi>Par in parem
non habet imperium;</hi> and by authorities out of <hi>Bracton, Fleta,</hi> and
others, it may appear what Superiours the King himſelf hath, (who
yet hath no Peer in his Kingdom, <hi>niſi Curium Baronum</hi>) God, Law,
and Parliament.</p>
               <p>And if either or both Houſes cannot commit Treaſon. Then thoſe
that act by their Authority, cannot: For, <hi>plus peccat Author quam
Actor,</hi> the Author offends more than the Actor. If thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
do not, not can commit Treaſon, how can thoſe that act by
their Authority, be guilty of it?</p>
               <p>Further, I muſt crave leave to aſſert, by reaſon of what I ſee opened
upon the Evidence; That what is done in Parliament, or by their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93090:25"/>
Authority, ought not to be queſtioned in any other Court. For every
offence committed in any Court, muſt be puniſhed in the ſame, or in
ſome higher, and not any inferiour Court. Now, the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath no ſuperiour Court, as is ſaid in <hi>Cook's</hi> Juriſdiction of
Courts. And the reaſon there given, that Judges ought not to give any
opinion in a matter of Parliament, is, becauſe it is not to be decided
by the Common Laws, but <hi>ſecundum Legem &amp; Conſuetudinem Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenti.</hi>
This, the Judges in divers Parliaments have confeſſed.
And that reaſon is not to be waved, which the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> gives: That
a man can make no defence; for what is ſaid and acted there, is done
in Council, and none ought to reveal the ſecrets of the Houſe: Every
Member hath a Judicial Voice, and can be no Witneſs.</p>
               <p>The main ſubſtance of theſe Papers was read and enlarged upon by
the Priſoner, this day of his Tryal. He was often interrupted, but his
memory was ſtill relieved by his Papers, ſo as after whatever diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cauſed by the Court or Counſel, he could recover himſelf again,
and proceed. Yet the edge and force of his Plea, as to the influencing
of the Jurors Conſciences, may appear to have been much abated by
ſuch interruptions, as doubtleſs was intended, and will more at large
appear, when it ſhall pleaſe God to afford us a full Narrative of the
Proceedings of the King's Judges, Counſel and Jurors about him, and
of all that he occaſionally ſaid, upon the digreſſions by them cauſed.</p>

               <p>AFter ſome little skirmiſhings with the Priſoner, to daſh all the
humane weapons of Law and Reaſon out of his hands, by force
or noiſe, for half an hour or more they finally refuſed to hear his
following Plea and Reaſons for an <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> or forbearing
their ſudden and raſh proceeding to Sentence. They had promiſed
him before Verdict, they would hear any thing in that kind he had to
offer, as they had alſo before his pleading <hi>not guilty,</hi> promiſed him
Counſel, which never was granted, neither. They drew him on, ſtep
by ſtep, firſt, to plead, on his Arraignment-day, then to admit the
Juries Verdict on his Tryal-day (ſo called, for he never owned it for
a Legal Tryal to his laſt breath) and after that, out comes the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Sentence of Death againſt him, (pronounced by the Lord

Robbers.</p>
               <p>But in the Order for his Execution, (for reaſons beſt known to them
that made it) the manner of his death was altered, into a beheading
only, on <hi>Tower-hill;</hi> to which place they carried him on a Sled,
drawn with horſes, a circumſtance very ſingular, and never uſed for
thoſe that die there, and which he was kept ignorant of till the very
time; one of the Sheriffs men having that morning, a little before, told
him, there was to be no Sled, but that he was to walk on foot.</p>

               <head>Some farther Remarques of this laſt dayes Proceedings of the Court
with him, beſides what is already mentioned, (received from
one that was preſent, and did hear and ſee all, being what he
could beſt remember) take as followeth.</head>
               <p>After the cuſtomary formalities of the Court,</p>
               <p>The Clerk demanded of Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> what he had to ſay, why
Sentence of Death ſhould not be paſſed upon him?</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> firſt alledged, that he had not yet heard the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
read in Latine. The debate upon this, took up ſome time.
At length ſome of the King's Counſel deſired that the Priſoner might
be ſatisfied in that point. Sir <hi>Henry</hi> deſired that Counſel then might
alſo be aſſigned him, to make Exceptions thereto, if they found cauſe,
otherwiſe he valued not the hearing of it read in Latine: This was
over-ruled by the Court; he ſoon therefore deſiſted from any further
urging it.</p>
               <p>The next thing Sir <hi>Henry</hi> offered in his own defence, was the Bill
of Exceptions, which he brought with him ready drawn, and offered
it to the Judges, deſiring them according to the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſt.</hi> 2.
31. made 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. to ſign it. This he urged ſo home, that the
Statute was conſulted and read in open Court, running in favour of the
Priſoner, to this effect, <hi>That if any man find himſelf aggrieved by the
proceedings againſt him before any Juſtices, let him write his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and deſire the Juſtices to ſet their ſeals to it.</hi> 
                  <q>This Act was
made (ſayes <hi>Cook</hi>) that the party wronged might have a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a legal Proceſs againſt the Juſtices, by a Writ of Error, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Exception entred upon Record in the Court where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
is done, which through the Juſtices over-ruling it, they could
not before procure; ſo the party grieved was without remedy, for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93090:26"/>
whoſe relief this Statute was made: The Juſtices refuſing to ſet to
their ſeals, the party grieved may have a Writ grounded on this
Statute, commanding them to ſet their ſeals to his Exception. This
Exception extends not only to all Pleas, dilatory and peremptory &amp;c.
but to all Challenges of any Jurors, and any material Evidence,
given to any Jury, which by the Court is over-ruled:</q> As in this
Priſoners Caſe, the Teſtimony about falſifying of his hand to writings,
&amp;c. was, by what was offered to the Jury by Juſtice <hi>Windham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, ſayes <hi>Cook</hi> on this Statute, <q>If the Juſtice (or Juſtices)
die, their Executors or Adminiſtrators may be proceeded againſt,
for the injury done. And if the Judge (or Judges) deny to ſeal the
Exception, the party wronged, may in the Writ of Error take Iſſue
thereupon, if he can prove by Witneſſes, the Judge or Judges denied
to ſeal it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, the Judges over-ruled this Plea alſo, by
ſuch interpretation as themſelves put upon that Statute, to wit, that it
was not allowable in Criminal Caſes for Life. This makes the Law
leſs careful for the preſervation of a man's Life, than any particulars of
his Eſtate, in controverſies about which, this Statute is affirmed by them
to hold; whereas Life is the greater, and innocent Blood when ſpilt is
irreverſible, as to the matter, it cannot be gathered up again; the Eſtate
is the leſſer, and if an erroneous Judgment paſs about it, 'tis reverſible
upon Traverſe, Writ of Error, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon they alledged for their pretended Opinion, was this;
That if it be held in Criminal Caſes for Life, every Felon in <hi>Newgate</hi>
might plead the ſame, and ſo there would be no Goal-delivery.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> anſwered, his Caſe was not the Caſe of common Felons,
alledging the Grant of his Majeſty to the Petition of both Houſes for
his Life, in caſe he ſhould be attainted; There is no need therefore
ſure (ſaid he) of fearing the conſequence of ſpinning out the time a little
with a perſon in his circumſtances. Beſides (he ſaid) he had been a
Priſoner two years, and never call'd on to give any account of himſelf
and his actions, (ſo is it not with Felons) which with other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
may ſufficiently evince, that there is no need of ſuch haſting
his Death. He told them withal, that he deſired not this, for his own
ſake only, but for theirs, and for poſterity, that they might on a more
leiſurely and unprejudiced hearing of what may be ſaid on all hands,
prevent the bringing of innocent Blood upon themſelves and the Land.</p>
               <p>But being in this alſo over-ruled by the Court, (ſay what he could)
He only deſired, he might underſtand whether they would all give it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93090:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as their Common Judgment they would ſtand to, That what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
was not his due by the Law? By this means they were all put
upon it, one by one, to declare themſelves in that point, unanimouſly
denying him the benefit of that Act. To the by-ſtanders their chief
Reaſon ſeemed to be, that it had not been practiſed this hundred or
two of years.</p>
               <p>The third thing Sir <hi>Henry</hi> deſired, was, That the <hi>Petition</hi> of both
Houſes, with his Majeſties <hi>Anſwer</hi> thereunto, might be read in the
Court, which, after ſome diſpute, was concluded to be a thing they
were not bound to take notice of, not being an Act of Parliament. Yet
what is any Act of Parliament, but a Bill preſented with the Petition
of both Houſes to his Majeſty, with his Royal Aſſent thereto, upon
Publick Record? At length they condeſcended to reade it, and that
was all.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt thing Sir <hi>Henry</hi> offered to the conſideration of
of the Bench, was this; That in regard there were queſtions touching
matter of Law, in his Caſe, which muſt receive their determination in
Parliament, he deſired he might have Counſel aſſigned him, to argue
them before their Lordſhips. Some of theſe points he inſtanced in,
to wit,</p>
               <p>1. Whether a Parliament were accountable to any inferiour Court?</p>
               <p>2. Whether the King, being out of poſſeſſion, and the Power Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in others—</p>
               <p>Here they ſtopt him, not ſuffering him to proceed, nor admitting
that the King was ever out of poſſeſſion. To which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> replied,
The words of his Indictment ran thus, <hi>that he endeavoured to keep
out his Majeſty;</hi> and how could he keep him out of the Realm, if he
were not out?</p>
               <p>But when he ſaw they would over-rule him in all, and were bent
upon his Condemnation, he put up his Papers, appealing to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Judgment of God, who (he told them) muſt judge them as well
as him, often expreſſing his ſatisfaction to die upon this Teſtimony;
which <hi>Keeling,</hi> one of the King's Counſel, inſultingly anſwered, <hi>So
you may, Sir, in good time, by the grace of God.</hi> The ſame perſon
had often before ſhewed a very ſnappiſh property towards the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſometimes anſwered him according to his folly:
For when he would have had the Book out of the Priſoner's hand,
wherein was the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> told him, <hi>he had a very officious Memory, and when he
was of Counſel for him, he would find him Books.</hi> (Whereby was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93090:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what was ſaid to be ſpoken by him, at firſt, in anſwer to one of
his Brethren, on the Arraignment day, <hi>Though we know not what to
ſay to him, we know what to do with him</hi>)</p>
               <p>After Sentence given, Chief Juſtice <hi>Forſter</hi> endeavoured to take off
the King from any Obligation by that Grant to the Petition of both
Houſes, ſaying, <hi>That God, though full of mercy, yet intended his mercy
only to the penitent.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reaſons for an Arreſt of Judgment: writ by the Priſoner,
but refuſed to be heard by the Court.</head>
               <p>I. I Have been denied ſo much as to hear the Indictment read in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
as it is the Original Record of the Court; yea, ſo much as
a Copy of it in Engliſh hath been denied me, during the whole time of
my Tryal, by the fight whereof I might be able to aſſign the defects
of Law that may be in it.</p>
               <p>Counſel alſo hath been denied, not only before I pleaded, but after;
and all points by me offered in Law, to the Judges of the Court, have
been over-ruled, without admitting me Counſel to argue the ſame, and
better inform the Judgment of the Court. I have demanded, that I
might put in a Bill of Exceptions, upon the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſt. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.
cap.</hi> 31. This likewiſe is denied me, over-ruled and judged, as out of
that Statute. Neither will Counſel be allowed me in this, to ſhew
cauſe, why it ought to be admitted as of Right. And as no Counſel
was allowed, ſo neither were the Judges Counſel to me, as they ſaid
themſelves, they would, and ought to be, but rather ſuffered me to
wrong and prejudice my ſelf, ſome of them ſaying, <hi>Let him go on,
the worſt will be his own at laſt.</hi> And they neither checked nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
the King's Counſel, in their high and irritating expreſſions to
the Jury, to find me guilty, One of whom were ſeen to ſpeak pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
with the Foreman of the Jury, immediately before the Jurors
went from the Bar, after he had ſpoken openly, <hi>That the Priſoner was
to be made a publick Sacrifice, in reference to the Actions done againſt
his Majesty that now is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is very far from that Indifferency in Tryal, and from that
Equality which the Law requires, and they are bound by their Oath
to afford me; beſides the undue proceedings in the buſineſs of the
Petty Jury. A Liſt of forty eight perſons was preſented to me, who
being to me unknown, and no time allowed me to gain any knowledge
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93090:28"/>
of them, though I was permitted to challenge and refuſe three Juries,
without ſhewing cauſe, yet could not that refuſal be upon ſuch rational
grounds as the Law ſuppoſes, which doubtleſs intends ſubſtantial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to the Priſoner, in allowing him the liberty of ſuch refuſal: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
through my ignorance of the perſons, I might refuſe the beſt, and
chuſe the worſt, as to my ſafety. And then, whereas the Law further
allows me the refuſal of any other beyond the thirty five, on juſt and
exceptionable cauſe ſhewen; what juſt exception was I capable to
alledge in a ſudden hurry, againſt perſons to me altogether unknown,
unleſs it would be taken for a juſt one, that they were unknown to me?</p>
               <p>All theſe things, being ſo contrary to the Right which the Judges
ſtand obliged to do to every one, as they are for that purpoſe entruſted
by God and the King, is juſt cauſe for an <hi>Arreſt of Judgment;</hi> and
a good Reaſon why they ſhould yet at length allow me a Copy of the
Indictment, and aſſign Counſel to argue for the Priſoner, againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in Law that may be found therein. Without this, Law is denied
me, which is my Birthright and Inheritance; the beſt Birthright the
Subject hath, ſayes <hi>Cook</hi> on <hi>Mag. Charta,</hi> for thereby (ſayes he) his
Goods, Lands, Wife, Children, his Body, Life, Honour and Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are protected from injury. The Life, Birthright or Inheritance
we have from our parents, may ſoon be gone, if this Fence thereof be
broken down. How great a wrong then it is for the Court to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it from me, is manifeſt. Are they not therefore in effect, charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with my Blood, by ſuch unequal Proceedings as I have had in
my Tryal?</p>
               <p>II. My ſecond Reaſon for an <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> is drawn from
the Iſſue that is joyned in my Caſe, which ſeems to depend chiefly
upon matter of Law, and that in ſuch tender and high points, as are
only determinable in the high Court of Parliament.</p>
               <p>For it is become the queſtion, Whether I am guilty, or not guilty,
according as theſe Propoſitions following, are truly or erroneouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved?</p>
               <p>1. Whether the Parliament, that began <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. 1640, were
diſſolved by the King's Death? and whether this Court may judge
things done in Parliament?</p>
               <p>2. Whether the Powers <hi>regnant,</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> that ſucceſſively
were in being, from <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1648, to <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20, 1659, were ſuch
Powers <hi>de facto,</hi> as are the King, or <hi>Seigneur le Roy,</hi> within the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the Stat. 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. having the exerciſe of Regal Power in
all the particulars of it, though not the name?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:93090:28"/>
3. Whether during that time fore-mentioned, his Majeſty that now
is, were properly King <hi>de facto?</hi> or whether he were not out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and without all exerciſe of his Regal Authority within the
Realm?</p>
               <p>4. Whether the Caſe now in queſtion, be a Treaſon literally within
the words of the Statute, 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. or at moſt, any other, than an
interpretative and new Treaſon, not declared before the very time of
my Tryal; and that only by the Judgment of the Court, or opinion of
my Judges, eleven years after ſome of the things charged on me, are
alledged to have been committed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the firſt of theſe; The Act for Continuance of the</hi> Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<hi>is expreſs;</hi> That all and every thing or things whatſoever,
done or to be done, for the Adjournment, Proroguing or Diſſolving of
that Parliament, contrary to that Act, ſhall be utterly void and of
none effect. <hi>I then thus argue;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judges do upon occaſion of this Tryal, reſolve, That the King's
Death diſſolv'd that Parliament. No Act of Parliament hath yet
declared it to be ſo; and the Judges ought to have ſome Law for their
guide, as <hi>Cook</hi> well ſayes. To be ſure, if in proceſs of time, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhall expreſly declare, That not the King's Death, but the Act
for the Diſſolution of that Parliament, did diſſolve it; In ſuch caſe,
theſe Judges Reſolution by vertue of ſuch Act, is abſolutely void. But
innocent Blood in the mean time may be ſhed, and an Eſtate wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
taken away. And in caſe what the Judges aſſert herein, were
Law, 'tis Law not known or declared till many years after the Fact
committed. At this rate, who is ſecure of Eſtate or Life?</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond and third Queries or Propoſitions; It does appear
out of the third part of <hi>Cook's Inſtitutes,</hi> fol. 7. and the Statute, 11.
<hi>Hen. 7. cap.</hi> 1. That Actings for the King in <hi>Fact,</hi> are not to be
queſtioned by the King in <hi>Right.</hi> If it be ſaid, That there was no
King in this caſe; it may be replied, That they who had the Power
and Exerciſe of the Royal Juriſdiction, as to Peace and War, Coynage
of Money, power of Life and Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the higheſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of Regal Authority, muſt needs be the Powers <hi>regnant,</hi> though
not under the name of <hi>King,</hi> and are within the Statute, 25. <hi>Edw. 3.
cap.</hi> 2. as a <hi>Queen</hi> alſo is adjudged, and any ſovereign Prince, though
under the title only of <hi>Lord,</hi> as was the caſe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before it was
a Kingdom. And if ſo, why not in more ſuch perſons as well as one,
that <hi>de facto</hi> exerciſe the Royal Power and Sovereign Authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what name or title ſoever? If upon this Nicety, Judgment be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93090:29"/>
given againſt me, becauſe the Powers <hi>regnant</hi> wanted the name and
formality of a King, I ſhall doubtleſs have very hard meaſure. For
the reaſon and equity is the ſame, if the Powers <hi>regnant</hi> had the thing,
though not the Title. And where there is the ſame Reaſon, there is
the ſame Law, as is a known Rule. Now there is the ſame Reaſon
the Subject ſhould be equally indempnified, that acteth under any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Authority that hath not the name of a King, as if it had. If
there had been many Kings, as a <hi>Heptarchy</hi> hath been in <hi>England</hi>
heretofore, thoſe would have been underſtood to be within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
and the reaſon and equity of the Statute is the ſame in all caſes.
For the Law is made for the benefit and ſecurity of the Subject, whom
the Law requires not to examine the right of Soveraignty. Nor is the
danger leſs under one Government than another.</p>
               <p>The Statute is, for ſecuring the Subject from all dormant Titles, that
they may ſafely pay their Allegiance when they receive Protection, and
that they may not be in danger of being deſtroyed by two Powers at
the ſame time. For that Power which is ſupream and <hi>de facto,</hi> will be
obeyed, and make it Treaſon to do otherwiſe, be it right or wrong.
And if the Subject be at the ſame time in danger of committing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
againſt the Power <hi>de jure,</hi> then is he in a miſerable condition and
ſtate of unavoidable neceſſity, which is provided againſt by the Laws
of the Land. Otherwiſe, if he be loyal to the King <hi>de jure,</hi> he ſhall be
hanged by the King <hi>de facto;</hi> and if he be faithful to the King <hi>de facto,</hi>
he ſhall die by the King <hi>de jure,</hi> when he recovers poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Againſt this it was, that the Statute of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. was provided,
in the difference betwixt the two houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> My
Caſe is either the ſame with that, and then I deſire the benefit of that
Statute; or elſe, it is new, and then I deſire, as is provided, 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
that it be referred to the Parliament. So that it is either within the
Equity of the Statute, 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. or elſe it is a new Caſe, and not
to be judged by this Court.</p>
               <p>If the Judges in the Reſolves by them delivered, upon any of the
particulars before-alledged, have not declared that Law that ought to
guide them, but their particular Judgments or Opinions, as undertaking
to guide the Law, and that in points of ſo grand concern as touch the
Subjects Life, in caſe their Judgments after ſhould prove erroneous, the
Verdict given upon ſuch Errors, muſt needs be illegal and void. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therefore ought to be ſuſpended till ſuch time as the truth and
certainty of the Law may be fully argued and cleared, and that, in
the proper Court for the hearing and judging of this Caſe. If this be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93090:29"/>
not done, but I be forthwith proceeded againſt (notwithſtanding any
thing however rationally or legally alledged to the contrary) by ſuch
undue precipitation and giving Sentence, I am (contrary to <hi>Magna
Charta,</hi> or Law of the Land) run upon and deſtroyed, without due
form and courſe of Law. And I am like to be deprived of Eſtate and
Life upon no Law or certain Rule, which was declared before the Fact;
no, nor before the Tryal.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe Conſiderations, I deſire an <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> and
that <hi>Counſel</hi> may be aſſigned me, and competent time allowed to make
good my <hi>Averrements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As an Argument to preſs this, I deſire leave of the Court, That
the <hi>Petition</hi> of the two Houſes, and the King's <hi>Aſſent</hi> to it, may be
read in open Court, atteſted by one that is preſent, who examined and
compared it with the Book of Record in the Lords Houſe, by which
it evidently appears, that as well the King as both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were agreed, that admitting I were attainted, yet Execution, as
to my Life, ſhould be remitted. And if ſo, there is no cauſe to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
the paſſing Sentence; eſpecially, when alſo ſuch weighty points
in the Law are yet to be argued and cleared, unleſs the Judges will
evidently charge themſelves with my innocent Blood.</p>
               <p>III. My third Reaſon for an <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> is the manifeſt
newneſs of this Caſe, being ſuch as never happened before in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
which withal, is of ſo vaſt a conſequence to people of all ſorts
and conditions within this Realm, as nothing more. And being ſo, (as
I doubt not with your Lordſhips patience I ſhall make it appear) It
is the known Law, witneſſed by <hi>Bracton</hi> and antient approved Law-Books;
That in ſuch Caſes, the Judges in the inferiour Courts ought
not to proceed, but bring it before the high Court of Parliament.</p>
               <p>To prove therefore the newneſs of this Caſe, (beſides what I have
already alledged in my Defence, before the Verdict) give me leave to
adde that, which yet further ſhews the newneſs and extraordinarineſs
thereof. And I beſeech your Lordſhips to let me go on without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
in my endeavouring to make it out as clearly, as God ſhall
enable me, and as briefly alſo, not to ſpend too much of your time.</p>
               <p>In general, I do affirm of this Caſe; That it is ſo comprehenſive,
as to take in the very Intereſts of Heaven and Earth: Firſt, Of God
the Univerſal Soveraign and King of Kings; Secondly, That of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Soveraigns, who are God's Vicegerents; as alſo the Intereſts of all
Mankind, that ſtand in the relation of Subjects to the one or both
thoſe ſorts of Soveraigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93090:30"/>
This is general. More particularly; within the bowels of this Caſe
is that Cauſe of God, that hath ſtated it ſelf in the late Differnces and
Wars, that have happened and ariſen within theſe three Nations, and
have been of more than twenty years continuance: which for the
greater certainty and ſolemnity, hath been recorded in the form of a
<hi>National Covenant,</hi> in which the generality of the three Nations have
been either implicitly involved, or expreſly concern'd, by the ſigning
of their Names.</p>
               <p>The principal things contained in that Covenant, were the known
and commonly received Duties, which either as Men or as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
we owed and ſtood obliged to perform either to God, the higheſt
and univerſal King in Church and State, or to our natural Lord and
Sovereign, the Kings of this Realm, in ſubordination to God and his
Laws.</p>
               <p>Again, It contains as well the Duties which we owe to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and individual perſon, in their ſeveral ſtations and callings, as to
the King in general, and our Repreſentative Body in Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
Theſe Duties we are thereby obliged to yeeld and perform, in
conſiſtency with, and in a juſt ſubordination and manifeſt agreeableneſs
to, the Laws of God, as is therein expreſſed: And this alſo, in no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement
to the Laws of the Land, as they then were.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>ſolemn Covenant</hi> and <hi>Agreement</hi> of the three Nations,
giving up themſelves in ſubjection to God and to his Laws, in the firſt
place, as the Allegiance they owe to their higheſt Soveraign, (as the
Creator, Redeemer, Owner and Ruler of all Mankind) they have ſo far
intereſted the Son of God in the the Supream Rule and Government
of theſe Nations, that nothing therein ought to be brought into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
contrary to his revealed Will in the holy Scriptures, and his
known and moſt righteous Laws.</p>
               <p>This Duty which we owe to God, the univerſal King, Nature and
Chriſtianity do ſo clearly teach and aſſert, that it needs no more than
to be named. For this ſubjection and allegiance to God and his Laws,
by a Right ſo indiſputable, all are accountable before the Judgment-ſeat
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, men may <hi>de facto</hi> become open Rebels to God
and to his Laws, and prove ſuch as forfeit his Protection, and engage
him to proceed againſt them as his profeſſed Enemies. But (with your
Lordſhips favour) give me leave to ſay, that that which you have
made a Rule for your proceedings in my Caſe, will indeed hold, and
that very ſtrongly, in this; that is to ſay, in the ſence wherein Chriſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93090:30"/>
the Son of God is King <hi>de jure,</hi> not only in general, over the whole
World, but in particular, in relation to theſe three Kingdoms. He
ought not to be kept out of his Throne, nor his viſible Government,
(that conſiſts in the Authority of his Word and Laws) ſuppreſſed and
trampled under foot, under any pretence whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And in the aſſerting and adhering unto the Right of this higheſt
Soveraign, (as ſtated in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> before mentioned) The Lords
and Commons joyntly, before the year 1648, and the Commons alone
afterwards, to the very times charged in the Indictment, did manage
the War and late Differences within theſe Kingdoms. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
defections did happen by Apoſtates, Hypocrites, and Time-ſerving
worldlings, there was a party amongſt them, that continued firm, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and chaſt unto the laſt, and loved it better than their very lives;
of which number I am not aſhamed to profeſs my ſelf to be; not ſo
much admiring the form and words of the Covenant, as the righteous
and holy ends therein expreſſed, and the true ſenſe and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which I have reaſon to know.</p>
               <p>Nor will I deny, but that, as to the manner of the proſecution of the
Covenant to other ends than it ſelf warrants, and with a rigid op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
ſpirit, (to bring all diſſenting minds and tender Conſciences
under one Uniformity of Church-diſcipline and government) it was
utterly againſt my Judgment. For I alwayes eſteemed it more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Word of God, that the Ends and Work declared in the
Covenant, ſhould be promoted in a ſpirit of love and forbearance to
differing Judgments and Conſciences, that thereby we might be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our ſelves <hi>in doing that to others, which we deſire they would do
to us;</hi> and ſo, (though upon different principles) be found joynt and
faithful advancers of the Reformation contained in the Covenant, both
publick and perſonal.</p>
               <p>This happy Union and Conjunction of all Intereſts in the reſpective
duties of all relations, agreed and conſented to by the common ſuffrage
of the three Nations (as well in their publick Parliamentary capacity,
as private ſtations) appeared to me a Rule and meaſure approved of,
and commanded by Parliament, for my action and deportment, though
it met with great oppoſition, in a tedious, ſad and long War; and this,
under the name and pretext of Royal Authority. Yet, as this Caſe
appeared to me in my conſcience, under all its circumſtances of Times,
of Perſons, and of Revolutions inevitably happening, by the hand of
God and the courſe of his wiſe Providences, I held it ſafeſt and beſt
to keep my ſtation in Parliament to the laſt, under the guidance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93090:31"/>
and protection of their Authority, and in purſuance of the Ends before
declared, in my juſt Defence.</p>
               <p>This general and publick Caſe of the Kingdoms, is ſo well known
by the Declarations and Actions that have paſſed on both ſides, that I
need but name it, ſince this matter was not done in a corner, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
contended for in the high places of the Field, and written even
with characters of Blood. And out of the bowels of theſe Publick
Differences and Diſputes, doth my particular Caſe ariſe, for which I
am called into queſtion. But admitting it come to my lot to ſtand
ſingle, in the witneſs I am to give to this Glorious Cauſe, and to be left
alone, (as in a ſort I am) yet being upheld with the Authority before
aſſerted, and keeping my ſelf in union and conjunction therewith, I
am not afraid to bear my Witneſs to it in this great Preſence, nor to
ſeal it with my Blood, if called thereunto. And I am ſo far ſatisfied
in my conſcience and underſtanding, that it neither is nor can be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
either againſt the Law of Nature, or the Law of the Land, either
<hi>malum per ſe,</hi> or <hi>malum prohibitum;</hi> that on the contrary, it is the
duty I owed to God the univerſal King, and to his Majeſty that now
is, and to the Church and People of God in theſe Nations, and to
the innocent Blood of all that have been ſlain in this Quarrel. Nothing
it ſeems will now ſerve, unleſs by the Condemnation paſſed upon my
perſon, they be rendred to poſterity Murderers and Rebels, and that
upon Record in a Court of Juſtice in <hi>Weſtminster-hall.</hi> And this
would inevitably have followed, if I had voluntarily given up this
Cauſe, without aſſerting their and my Innocency, by which I ſhould
have pulled that Blood upon my own head, which now I am ſure muſt
lie at the door of others, and in particular, of thoſe that knowingly
and precipitately ſhall embrew their hands in my innocent Blood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whatever form or pretext of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>My Caſe is evidently new and unuſual, that which never happened
before; wherein there is, not only much of God and of his Glory,
but all that is dear and of true value to all the good People in theſe
three Nations. And (as I have ſaid) it cannot be Treaſon againſt the
Law of Nature, ſince the duties of the Subjects in relation to their
Soveraigns and Superiours, from higheſt to loweſt, are owned and
conſcientiouſly practiſed and yeelded by thoſe that are the Aſſertors
of this Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be Treaſon within the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3; ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what hath been ſaid of no King in poſſeſſion, and of being under
Powers <hi>regnant</hi> &amp; Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> as alſo of the Fact in its own nature,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93090:31"/>
and the Evidence as to Overt Acts pretended, it is very plain it cannot
poſſibly fall within the purview of that Statute. For this Caſe, thus
circumſtantiated, (as before declared) is no Act of any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
of his own head, as that Statute intends; nor in relation to the
King there meant, that is preſumed to be in the exerciſe of his Royal
Authority in conjunction with the Law and the two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if they be ſitting, as the fundamental Conſtitutions of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do require.</p>
               <p>My Lords, If I have been free and plain with you in this matter, I
beg your Pardon: For it concerns me to be ſo, and ſomething more
than ordinarily urgent, where both my Eſtate and Life are in ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
peril; nay, more than my Life, the Concerns of thouſands of
Lives are in it, not only of thoſe that are in their graves already, but
of all poſterity in time to come. Had nothing been in it, but the care
to preſerve my own Life, I needed not have ſtayed in <hi>England,</hi> but
might have taken my opportunity to have withdrawn my ſelf into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts, to provide for my own ſafety. Nor needed I to have been
put upon pleading, as now I am, for an <hi>Arreſt of Judgment,</hi> but
might have watch'd upon advantages that were viſible enough to me,
in the managing of my Tryal, if I had conſulted only the preſervation
of my Life or Eſtate.</p>
               <p>No, my Lords, I have otherwiſe learned Chriſt, than to fear them
that can but kill the Body, and have no more that they can do. I
have alſo taken notice, in the little reading that I have had of Hiſtory,
how glorious the very Heathens have rendred their names to poſterity,
in the contempt they have ſhewed of Death, (when the laying down
of their Life has appeared to be their Duty) from the love which they
have owed to their Country.</p>
               <p>Two remarkable examples of this, give me leave to mention to you
upon this occaſion. The one is, of <hi>Socrates</hi> the divine Philoſopher, who
was brought into queſtion before a Judgment-Seat, as now I am, for
maintaining, that there was but one onely true God, againſt the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of the ſuperſtitious Heathen gods; and he was ſo little in love
with his own Life upon this account, (wherein he knew the Right was
on his ſide) that he could not be perſwaded by his friends, to make
any defence, but would chuſe rather to put it upon the conſcience and
determination of his Judges, to decide that wherein he knew not
how to make any choice of his own, as to what would be beſt for him,
whether to live or to die; he ingenuouſly profeſſing, that for ought he
knew, it might be much to his prejudice and loſs, to endeavour longer
continuance in this bodily Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93090:32"/>
The other example, is that of a chief Governour, that (to my beſt
remembrance) had the Command of a City in <hi>Greece,</hi> which was
beſieged by a potent Enemy, and brought into unimaginable ſtraits.
Hereupon the ſaid Governor makes his addreſs to the Oracle, to know
the event of that danger. The anſwer was; That the City ſhould be
ſafely preſerved, if the chief Governour were ſlain by the Enemy. He,
underſtanding this, immediately diſguiſ'd himſelf and went into the
Enemies Camp, amongſt whom he did ſo comport himſelf, that they
unwittingly put him to death; by which means, immediately ſafety
and deliverance aroſe to the City, as the Oracle had declared. So little
was his Life in eſteem with him, when the Good and Safety of his
Country required the laying of it down.</p>

only in Parliament, and I ought not to be queſtioned for them in any
inferiour Court; As <hi>Cook</hi> ſhews in the 4th part of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> chap.
1. concerning the high Court of Parliament. For the Parliament is
not confined in their Actings, by the Law which inferiour Courts are
tied up to, but in divers caſes are priviledged to act extraordinarily
and unaccountably to any but themſelves, or ſucceeding Parliaments.
Moreover, That Parliament was extraordinarily commiſſioned, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and authorized by expreſs Act of Parliament, beyond all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Parliaments, for the Cauſes and Ends declared in the Preamble of
the Act for their Eſtabliſhment, accorded and paſſed by the joynt
Conſent of King, Lords and Commons, whereby they became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubjected
to Adjournment, Prorogation or Diſſolution, but by their

to prevent and reſtrain the Power of Tyranny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, The bringing of this Caſe under the Juriſdiction of this
Court, or of any other, but a Parliament, may prove of very dangerous
conſequence, in point of Precedent, and moſt diſagreeing to all Rules
of Juſtice. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the ſame reaſon that I am queſtioned in this Court, not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93090:33"/>
only every Member of Parliament, but the very Houſes themſelves,
with all their Debates, Votes and Orders, may not only be queſtioned,
but referred to a Petty Jury, and ſo come to be judged and ſentenc'd
by a Court inferiour to themſelves, which Judges in all times have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
and acknowledged to be out of their power, according to the
known Rule, <hi>Par in pares non habet imperium, multo minus in eos,
qui majus imperium habent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In ſuch caſe, the Parties accuſed, will be debarred of
Evidence or Witneſs for their Juſtification and Defence. For no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
&amp;c. preſent at Debates in Parliament, (who are the onely eye
and ear-witneſſes of what is ſaid and done there) ought to diſcover
the Counſels of the Houſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Fourthly, Concerning the Indictment.</head>
                  <p>1. I have not been permitted to have a copy or ſight of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor ſo much as to hear it read in Latine, which is the original
Record of the Court, and ought to be the foundation of their whole
proceeding with me. I often deſired theſe things of the Court; yea,
or at leaſt, to have but the Tranſcripts of ſome particular clauſes in the
Indictment, to enable me to ſhew the deficiencies thereof in Law, (all
which, others in ſuch caſes have often obtained) but nothing would be
granted herein.</p>
                  <p>This then was my hard lot and uſage; I was put (after two years
cloſe Impriſonment) to anſwer for my Life, to a long Indictment, read
in Engliſh, which whether it were rightly tranſlated how ſhould I
know, that might not hear the Original Record in Latine? Counſel
alſo learned in the Law, were denied me, though preſſed for by me,
again and again, before I pleaded. And had they been granted, what
could they have ſaid as to defects of Law in the Indictment, unleſs they
might have a Copy of it? What can any Counſel ſay to any petty bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
concerning any part of a man's Eſtate that's in controverſie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they may have a leiſurely view and peruſal of the Writings therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts?
much more ſure will it appear requiſit, to the reaſon of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
when a man's whole Eſtate, Life and all are at ſtake. 'Tis true,
before I pleaded, this Court promiſed I ſhould have Counſel aſſigned
me after pleading, (<hi>God forfend elſe,</hi> ſaid the Lord Chief Juſtice) but
'tis as true, I never could yet ſee that promiſe made good. All things
tending to a fair Tryal, were promiſed me in general before pleading,
but every material particular for the juſt defence of my Life, hath been
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93090:33"/>
denied me ever ſince. And my Tryal for Life was hudled up the next
day of my appearing before you; The Jury as was told me) muſt
not eat or drink, till they had done their work; (ſo the more than
forty <hi>Jewry-men</hi> that reſolved to kill <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 23. 21.) But why
ſuch haſte and precipitancy for a man's Life, that's more than Meat or
Eſtate, when you can let Civil Cauſes about mens Eſtates depend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years? and if an erroneous Judgment be paſſed in ſuch matters, 'tis
reverſible; But if innocent Blood be ſpilt, it cannot be gathered up
again, as the wiſe woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>2. But ſecondly then, As to defects in the Indictment, which I
was in ſome meaſure enabled to obſerve from that broken hearing
thereof, that was afforded me here in the Court; I ſay, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and thoſe very conſiderable; and by the Law of <hi>England</hi> I ought
not to have been urged to plead or make anſwer to ſuch an illegal and
defective Indictment.</p>
                  <p>1. There is no ſufficient Overt Act therein alledged, of the Priſoner's
imagining the King's Death, or that he had any the leaſt intention
that way.</p>
                  <p>2. The Levying of a War, is alledged in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and cannot
therefore be tryed by a Jury of <hi>Middleſex; Dyer,</hi> fol. 234. and the
3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part of <hi>Cook's Inſtitutes,</hi> fol. 34.</p>
                  <p>3. There is uncertainty and obſcurity in the main thing alledged
againſt me in the Indictment; to wit, <hi>That I, together with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of perſons, to the number of a thouſand, unknown to the Jury, &amp;c.</hi>
whereas no Criminal Act can be tryed that is not certain; <hi>Certa res
debet eſſe quae deducitur in Judicium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Treaſon laid to my charge, is alledged to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
with a multitude of other falſe Traitors, which were pardoned
by the Act of Indempnity; ſuch ſuppoſed crimes therefore of theirs
cannot be remembred or alledged, without a manifeſt breach of the
Act of Indempnity and Oblivion.</p>
                  <p>The Indictment is, or ought to be founded on ſome clauſe or branch
of 25. <hi>Ed. 3. chap.</hi> 2. But no ſuch Overt Act is alledged in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or proved by Witneſſes, as doth diſcover that I had any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to kill, depoſe or hold out the King from the poſſeſſion and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his Regal Power.</p>
                  <p>Whereas I am accuſed of <hi>compaſſing or imagining the Death of the
King;</hi> this muſt be underſtood of his natural or perſonal, not politick
capacity; for in this latter ſence, the Law ſayes, <hi>the King cannot die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then, to compaſs only the Depoſition of the King, is not within
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93090:34"/>
the words of that Statute, (ſeveral Kings have been depoſed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
ſince the Conqueſt) and as to my compaſſing or deſigning
the natural death of the King's Perſon, with what colour can I be
accuſed of ſuch intentions, in the circumſtances the King at that time
was in beyond the Seas?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The aſſembling of men together, without any hoſtility or
injury offered to any perſon, but for a man's own ſecurity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in a time of confuſion and diſtraction, is not Levying War, or
Treaſon at the Common Law, or by that Statute. Yea, in this Caſe,
and at the ſeaſon wherein ſuch an Act as this is alledged, it might be
ſuppoſed to be done for the King's Reſtoration as well as in oppoſition
thereunto; and the moſt favourable and advantagious conſtruction
ought to be made and put upon the Priſoner's actings or words, where
there is ambiguity, ſo that they may be taken or interpreted divers
wayes. For the Law alwayes preſumeth actions to be innocent, till the
contrary be manifeſtly proved. However, in a time of vacancy or an
<hi>Interregnum,</hi> when the Foundations of Government are out of courſe,
by the Law of Reaſon, Nature, and Common Prudence, every man
may ſtand upon his own guard, endeavouring his own ſecurity and
protection from injury and violence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To be adherent to the King's Enemies within his Realm,
&amp;c. cannot, ought not to be underſtood of any adhaeſion to a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein the King by Law is ſuppoſed alwayes preſent, as a
part thereof. Nor can the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> be called the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
without overthrowing the Act of Indempnity, which the King
hath declared to be the Foundation of the Nations preſent Peace and
Security.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, The Treaſons alledged in the Indictment, are ſaid to have
been committed when the King was out of poſſeſſion; So the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
runs,</hi> to keep out the King, &amp;c. <hi>Now my Lord</hi> Cook <hi>in the
third part of his</hi> Inſtitutes, <hi>fol. 7. ſaith,</hi> A King <hi>de jure,</hi> and not <hi>de
facto,</hi> is not within this Statute; Againſt ſuch a one no Treaſon can
be committed. For if there be a King <hi>regnant</hi> in poſſeſſion, though he
be <hi>Rex de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> yet is he <hi>Seignior le Roy,</hi> within the
purview of this Statute; and the other that hath Right, and is out
of poſſeſſion, is not within this Act. Nay, if Treaſon be committed
againſt a King <hi>de facto, &amp; non de jure,</hi> and after the King <hi>de jure</hi>
cometh to the Crown, he ſhall puniſh the Treaſon done to the King <hi>de
facto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after, in the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>That by Law there is alwayes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93090:34"/>
a King, in whoſe Name the Laws are to be maintained and executed;
otherwayes Juſtice would fail.</hi> The Act alſo of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. was
made for ſecurity of the Subject on this behalf. The word <hi>King</hi> alſo
may and ought to be taken largely for any Sovereign Power, in a King
or Queen, as <hi>Cook</hi> in the place fore-quoted, ſhews; and why not by
the ſame reaſon, in a <hi>Protector,</hi> though a Uſurper, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
one or more, in whom Soveraignty is lodged, or that have all the
badges of Soveraignty, as the calling of Parliaments, enacting of Laws,
coining of Money, receiving Forreign Ambaſſadors, &amp;c.? His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
that now is, is granted by the very Indictment to have been then
out of poſſeſſion: If ſo, then was there either ſome other King, or what
was equivolent, ſome Sovereign Power in actual poſſeſſion and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
or none. If the former, then was there a King <hi>de facto,</hi> ſo no
Treaſon could be committed againſt him that was King <hi>de jure</hi> only:
If the latter, then the Government was diſſolved, no allegiance was
due to any perſons, and ſo no offence could be properly Treaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Statute.</p>
                  <p>But had the late <hi>Protector</hi> had the name and ſtile of a King, no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
could have been committed againſt the King <hi>de jure</hi> only. Now
God forbid that you ſhould give away my Life upon ſuch niceties,
becauſe a uſurping Protector was not clothed with the Title as well
as Power of a King. The Protector or any Uſurper's taking or not
taking the Title of a King, in caſe he have the Power, cannot alter the
ſtate of my ſuppoſed crime. You ought not to be byaſſed by popular
Reports concerning me. 'Tis eaſier to be innocent, than ſo reported.
The one is in our own power, not the other.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Fifthly, Concerning the Evidence.</head>
                  <p>1. No allegation was directly proved by two poſitive lawful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
as in this caſe it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>2. One of the Witneſſes for the King, confeſſed in open Court, that
to his knowledge my hand had been counterfeited, to my prejudice
and dammage, in great Sums of Money; yet Orders pretended to be
ſigned by me, (wherein my hand may as well be counterfeited) are
taken as Evidence againſt me.</p>
                  <p>3. The Iſſue of the whole Cauſe depended on the ſolution of ſome
difficult Queſtions, of ſo high a nature and great importance, as could
not ſafely be determined but in the high Court of Parliament; As,</p>
                  <p>1. Whether the Long Parliament, called in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1640, were
diſſolved by the late King's Death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93090:35"/>
2. Whether the ſucceſſive remaining Powers, that exerciſed the
Royal or Supream Authority from 1648, to the Reſtoration of his now
Majeſty, were not within the true ſenſe and meaning of 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
and 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7?</p>
                  <p>As to other pertinent Queries, thou mayeſt ſee them, Reader, in
other parts of this Tryal.</p>
                  <p>That which remains, as an <hi>Appendix to this Bill of Exceptions,</hi> is
to lay before thee the Grounds which plainly ſhew that there was a
downright Conſpiracy in Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s Tenants and others, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
him for Life and Eſtate, under colour and pretence of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>1. Preſently after I was committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> for High Treaſon,
and made a Cloſe-Priſoner, Mr. <hi>Oneale,</hi> Sir <hi>William Darcy</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Cradock</hi> obtained an Order from the King, to ſeize and take into their
poſſeſſion, all the Eſtates of ſuch perſons, that were already or ſhould
be forfeited to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the ſaid Mr. <hi>Oneale</hi> and Sir <hi>Will. Darcy</hi> appointed ſome
under them in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> (by name, <hi>Thomas Bowes</hi>
Eſ<expan>
                        <am>

who thereupon went to <hi>Raby Caſtle,</hi> and demanded the Rent-Books
of <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> my Steward, offering him his place under
them, which he refuſed.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this proceeding, Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> expreſly declares,
<q>That before Indictment, the Goods or other things of any Offender,
cannot be ſearched, inventoried, or in any ſort ſeized; nor after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
ſeized, removed, or taken away, before Conviction or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder.</q>
                     <hi>Inſtitut.</hi> 3d part, chap. 133. concerning the Seizure of
Goods, &amp;c. for Offences, &amp;c. before Conviction.</p>
                  <p>2. At the Inſtance and Proſecution of my Tenants and others, an
Order was made by the Houſe of Commons (not of the Lords) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the Tenants of ſuch perſons as were excepted out of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pardon,</hi> to detain their Rents in their own hands. By pretence of
this Order, (though that Parliament that made it, were diſſolved) The
Tenants refuſed to pay their reſpective Rents, as they grew due, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Law and Equity; and joyned together in open defiance
and conſpiracy againſt their Landlord.</p>
                  <p>3. The ſaid Tenants, (when legally proſecuted in his Majeſties
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for the recovery of the ſaid Rents out of their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93090:35"/>
hands) did petition the late Houſe of Commons to put a ſtop to ſuch
legal Proſecution and Suits; which Motion of theirs, put the Houſe
into a great heat and violence againſt me, inſomuch that they had no
moſt paſſed a Vote to ſequeſter all my Eſtate, though unheard or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convicted.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>William Watſon</hi> of <hi>Cock-field,</hi> and other of the ſaid Tenants,
have continued in <hi>London</hi> to carry on this Conſpiracy againſt me, by
whoſe means, with others, the King hath been importuned to ſend for
men from the Iſle of <hi>Silly,</hi> in order to this Tryal.</p>
                  <p>5. By common fame (which, at leaſt, affords a ſtrong preſumption)
my Goods and Eſtate have been long begg'd by ſeveral perſons, and
granted: whereas the begging of the Goods and Eſtate of any Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
accuſed or indicted of Treaſon, before he be Convicted and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
is utterly unlawful; becauſe till then, nothing is forfeited to the
King, and ſo, not his to diſpoſe of; as Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> ſhews, in the
fore-mentioned Chapter about the Seizure of Goods, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>6. I am credibly informed, that about <hi>December</hi> laſt, a certain Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
came from the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> to Capt. <hi>Linn,</hi> with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
language, that if he would not confeſs things againſt Sir <hi>Henry
Vane,</hi> he ſhould be fetch'd up before the Council and made to do it.
<hi>Linn</hi> anſwered, he knew nothing againſt Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> nor had
any Orders from him, but from the Parliament and Council.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Captain came again, about a fortnight after, from the
Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> with a parcel of fine words, that if he the ſaid
<hi>Linn</hi> would teſtifie, that Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> was in the head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that he received Orders from him, the Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi>
would gratifie him with any civility he ſhould deſire. <hi>Linn</hi> replied,
he knew no Regiment Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> had, but that it was the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
and Council of States Regiment. The ſame Captain came
again to him, from the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and told him, The Duke
deſired him to teſtifie Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s being in the head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that he received Orders from him, to fight Sir <hi>George Booth;
Linn</hi> replied, he knew no ſuch things. The Captain told him, as
from the Duke, he ſhould have any Place or Office in the Court. Be
not afraid to ſpeak, ſaid he, I warrant you, we ſhall hang Sir <hi>Henry
Vane,</hi> for he is a Rogue.</p>
                  <p>7. I am credibly informed, that one of the Grand Jury declared,
that after the Bill of Indictment againſt me, was brought in, ſome from
the King's Counſel came to deſire them, they would pleaſe to come
into the inward Court of Wards; Upon which, one of the Jury ſaid,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93090:36"/>
they were there to judge of matters brought before them, and ought
not to go in thither; but if the Counſel had any thing to ſay, they
ought to come to them. This was ſeconded by ſome; others ſaid,
They were the King's Counſel, and it was but matter of civility to
grant them their Requeſt: whereupon they went into the inward
Court of Wards, where the King's Counſel were, to wit, Attorney-General
<hi>Palmer,</hi> Sollicitor-General <hi>Fynch,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Glyn</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<hi>Keeling.</hi> After a while, they cauſed all to withdraw but the
Jury. Then the Clerk read the Indictment in the uſual form for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
War from 1659. After it was read, one of the Counſel told
them, It was a Bill of High Treaſon againſt his Majeſty, and they
were to conſider of it according to their Evidence. Then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to examine their Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jefford</hi> ſaid, Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> offered him a Commiſſion to go againſt
Sir <hi>George Booth;</hi> which, ſaid Serjeant <hi>Keeling,</hi> was to go againſt
the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wright,</hi> being examined whether he ſaw Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> in the
Council, ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi> The Attorney-General replied, that if he was
amongſt them, they might find the Bill upon that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon this, the Jury withdrew, and were by themſelves. Then Sir</hi>
John Croply, <hi>the Foreman, ſaid,</hi> We muſt paſs this Bill; <hi>at which all
the Jury were ſilent. At laſt, one ſtood up and ſaid;</hi> This Bill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
matter of Fact, and matter of Law. Some of this Jury, to my
knowledge, were never of any Jury before, as well as I, therefore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Law, (in ſo difficult and unuſual a point as this is) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
could not give in their Verdict, as to Law, but only Fact.
<hi>Several others of the Jury ſeconded him in this, and proteſted againſt
giving in their Verdict, as to matter of Law; notwithſtanding all
which, the Bill was carried up to the King's Bench.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. On the day of my Arraignment, an eminent perſon was heard to
ſay, I had forfeited my head, by what I ſaid that day, before ever I
came to my Defence: what that ſhould be, I know not, except my
ſaying in open Court, <hi>Soveraign Power of Parliament,</hi> which the
Attorney-General writ down, after he had promiſed at my requeſt,
no exception ſhould be taken at words. And whole Volumns of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
Books paſs up and down the Nation with that Title, <hi>Soveraign
Power of Parliaments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. Six moderate men, that were like to conſider what they did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would throw away my Life, were ſummoned to be of my
Petty Jury, which the King's Counſel hearing, writ a Letter to one
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93090:36"/>
of the Sheriffs, to unſummon them; and a new Liſt was made, the
night immediately before the day of Verdict, on purpoſe that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
might not have any knowledge of them, till preſented to his
view and choice in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall.</hi> Yet one of the fourty eight of
this Liſt, (who ſaid he would have ſtarv'd himſelf before he would
have found Sir <hi>Hen. Vane</hi> guilty of Treaſon) was never called, though
he walked in the Hall all the while. And in that Hurry of thoſe that
compaſſed him about, he being alone, ſtripp'd of all aſſiſtance, Sir
<hi>William Roberts</hi> Foreman, and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Abdy,</hi> were ſworn by
the Court, before I was aware; ſo my challenging them, might ſeem
a perſonal diſobliging and exaſperation of them againſt me, after they
were ſworn and fixed.</p>
                  <p>The Sollicitor alſo had a long whiſper with the Foreman of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in the Court, before they went to Verdict, telling him, <hi>The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
muſt be a Sacrifice for the Nation, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suddenly after which I am here called to receive my Sentence.</p>
                  <p>10. After the day of my Tryal, the Judges went to <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. None were more forward to abſolve the King from his Grant
about my Life, than they that had appeared moſt forward in promoting
the Bill by way of Petition to the King, for it. This Grant, being
upon Record, may ſeem to have the ſame validity that other Acts of
Parliament have, which are ſtill but the two Houſes Petition to the
King for his Aſſent to the Bills by them drawn up and paſſed. They
uſed this, as a means to induce the King to exempt me from all benefit
of the Act of Indempnity and Oblivion, and then at laſt perſwade
and abſolve him from making good this Grant alſo, thereby depriving
me of all viſible relief for my Life. I conceived my Life as ſecure by
that Grant, as others Lives or Eſtates are by the Act of Indempnity
it ſelf; for what is that but the Bill of both Houſes, with the King's
Aſſent to it, upon their Petition?</p>

they (as they were to be) would be his Counſel. They are
the King's Commiſſary Judges, preferred and paid for their work by
the King, who (in this caſe) was, through evil and falſe ſuggeſtions,

the Court, as to the injury done him on the day of his Tryal, by
his large and bitter Invective, which he had not liberty to reply to,
(for the vindicating of his own Innocency, and unpejudicing the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
underſtanding) in the fitteſt ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The Judges that had promiſed him (before pleading) they would
be his Counſel (inſtead of relieving him herein, as in all reaſon they
ought) afforded him no other anſwer, but a ſharp Rebuke, for cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
and ſcandalizing the Court, together with ſome threatning
expreſſions. But what need had he to regard their threatnings, that
he ſaw reſolved to paſs a Sentence of Death upon him, ſay what he
would?</p>
               <p>The main thing he charged the Sollicitor with, was his ſaying open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Court, <hi>that he muſt be made a publick Sacrifice,</hi> (ſhewing no
reaſon why) and of whiſpering to the Foreman of the Jury, in the
Court, before they went to Verdict; a thing notoriouſly againſt all
Law and Reaſon. Amongſt other things, he had alſo ſaid, <hi>What
Counſel did the Priſoner think would (or durſt) ſpeak for him, in
ſuch a manifeſt Caſe of Treaſon, unleſs he could call down the heads
of thoſe his fellow-Traitors</hi> (Bradſhaw <hi>or</hi> Cook) <hi>from the top of
Weſtminſter-Hall?</hi> (or to that effect) when as there were able heads
in the bottom of <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> ready to have ſpoken to his Caſe,
if they might have been aſſigned by the Court. But what may not be
ſaid, when nothing may be replied? For a perſon, that is deſigning
his own Intereſt, Honours, Advantages and Preferments, to have the
laſt word to the Jury, againſt a Priſoner that ſtands at the Bar in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of his Life, (and that, a perſon of ſo generally acknowledged
worth and publick concern) and to perform it with impertinent flaſhes
of Wit, and declamatory flouriſhes of Rhetorick, (ſending away the
Jury with the freſh and laſt impreſſions of all that noiſe and buzze of
his gloſſes upon the whole matter, and having with irritating expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93090:38"/>
miſrepreſented and aggravated the ſuppoſed crimes) is a thing to be
hiſſed oft the ſtage of this earth, by the common Reaſon of all mankind.</p>
               <p>What worſe circumſtances can a Priſoner be in, than to ſtand at a
Bar of Juſtice to be tryed, and there hear his profeſſed Accuſer and
Adverſary, miſrepreſenting, miſcalling, and aggravating the actions
he is queſtioned for, preſſing all upon the Jurors conſciences with the
greateſt edge and flouriſh of all the Art, Wit and Eloquence he is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with (as <hi>Tertullus</hi> ſerved <hi>Paul</hi>) and then be deprived of all
poſſible defence againſt his ſlanderous and injurious ſuggeſtions? <hi>Paul</hi>
was not ſo ſerved; he had the laſt word to his Jury, when <hi>Tertullus</hi>
had done, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. But the children of this world are wiſe in their
generation; they knew well they had to deal with one, that had been
experienced for twenty years together, to be a perſon of a very happy
and unparallel'd dexterity in taking off the paint and falſe appearances
that others (by premeditated Speeches) could put upon ill matters,
with an extemporary breath.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, he had fair warning beforehand, to ſay all that he had
to mind the Jury of, and that he was not to ſpeak after the King's
Counſel. It is anſwered; Though this were hard at beſt, and indeed,
not at all ſutable to the true and lawfull Liberties of Engliſh-men, yet
were it more tolerable, in caſe the King's Counſel had ſtarted no new
thing againſt the Priſoner, uſed no provoking and unworthy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
or made no new and unforeſeen gloſſes upon the matter he ſtood
charged with. For then the Priſoner might be preſumed to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
obviated beforehand, any thing that would be ſaid by the
Counſel, (had they only recapitulated) and ſo (probably) might
have rendred his Jury ſomewhat uncapable of being prejudiced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
againſt him, unleſs they were as willing to abuſe him as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.
But here were many things ſaid at random, againſt all Senſe, Law
and Reaſon, (as if <hi>Tully</hi> had been charactering a treacherous <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne</hi>)
and the innocent Priſoner muſt be mute, and ſuffer the Jury to be
diſmiſſed, and ſent to paſs their Verdict on his Life, without the leaſt
poſſibility of Remedy.</p>
               <p>Put this and all the reſt together, (to wit, that the Jury themſelves
were of the oppoſit party to him in the late Wars and whole Cauſe
in queſtion, depending before them) and it had been far better for the
Priſoner, to have caſt lots on a Drum-head for his Life, as a Priſoner
of War, than to be ſo tryed in a time of Peace, unleſs it can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
preſumed, that they that would have killed him any time this
twenty year in the field, ſhould now be like to ſpare his Life at the Bar.</p>

and precious Promiſes are yet in ſtore to be accompliſhed, in and upon
Believers here on Earth, to the making of Chriſt admired in them.
And if we cannot live in the power and actual fruition of them, yet
if we die in the certain foreſight and imbracing of them by Faith, it
will be our great bleſſing. This dark night and black ſhade, which
God hath drawn over his work in the midſt of us, may be (for ought

               <p>
                  <hi>When he came from his Tryal, he told a Friend,</hi> he was as much
overjoyed, as a chast Virgin that had eſcaped a Rape: for, <hi>ſaid he,</hi>
neither flatteries before, nor threatnings now, could prevail upon me;

               <p>
                  <hi>On this day, liberty being given to Friends to viſit him in the</hi> Tower,
<hi>he received them with very great chearfulneſs, and with a compoſed
frame of ſpirit, having wholly given up himſelf to the will of God. He
did occaſionally let fall many gracious expreſſions, to the very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing,
and ſtrengthning of the hearts of the hearers. To wit,</hi> That
he had for any time theſe two years made Death familiar to him, and
being ſhut up from the World, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> he had been ſhut up with God,
and that he did know what was the mind of God to him in this great
matter; but, that he had not the leaſt recoyl in his heart, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or manner of what was done by him; And though he might have
had an opportunity of eſcaping, or by policy might have avoided his
Charge, yet he did not make uſe of it, nor could decline that which
was come upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It being told him by a Friend, that his Death would be a loſs to
the People of God: He anſwered,</hi> that God would raiſe up other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
to ſerve him and his People. <hi>And being deſired to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93090:39"/>
to take off that charge of</hi> Jeſuitiſm, <hi>that was caſt upon him;
He ſaid,</hi> That he thought it not worth the taking notice of; for if it
were ſo, he ſhould never have been brought to this. <hi>A Friend ſaid,
Sir, the Lord hath ſaid,</hi> Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give
thee a Crown of Life. <hi>The Lord enable you to be faithful. He replied,</hi>
I bleſs the Lord, I have not had any diſcompoſure of ſpirit theſe two
years, but I do wait upon the Lord, till he be pleaſed to put an end
to theſe dayes of mine, knowing that I ſhall change for the better: For
in Heaven there is an innumerable company of Angels, the Spirits of
Juſt men made perfect, and JESUS the bleſſed Mediator of the
New Covenant. There are holy and juſt Laws, a pure Government,
bleſſed and good Company, every one doing their duty; herr we want
all theſe. This is that City ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 1, 2. That ſtrong City,
that cannot be moved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. Why therefore ſhould we be unwilling
to leave this eſtate to go that? And although I be taken from
hence, yet know aſſuredly, God will raiſe up unto you Inſtruments out
of the duſt. <hi>Another ſaid to him; Sir, There is nothing will ſtand
you in ſtead, but juſtifying Faith in the Blood of Jeſus. To which he
ſaid,</hi> There are ſome, that through Faith in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> do
eſcape the pollutions of the world, yet afterwards are entangled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
again; others there be, that are carried through the greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
by a more excellent, ſpiritual ſort of Faith in the Blood of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> and endure them with the greatest joy.</p>
               <p>He further ſaid, We were lately preaching a Funeral Sermon to our
ſelves, out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 16. where thoſe bleſſed Witneſſes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
themſelves to be pilgrims and ſtrangers on the Earth, and do
deſire a better Country, that is, a heavenly; <hi>Wherefore God is not
aſhamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi>
And if God (ſaid he) be not aſhamed to be called my God, I hope I
ſhall not be aſhamed to endure his Croſs, and to bear his Reproach,
even whatſoever it be that man can impoſe upon me, for his ſake. Yea,
he will enable me not to be aſhamed. I have not the leaſt reluctancy
or ſtrugling in my ſpirit againſt Death. I deſire not to live; but my
will is reſigned up to God in all. Why are you troubled? I am
not. You have need of Faith and Patience to follow the Lord's Call.
This ought chiefly to be in our eye, <hi>the bringing Glory to our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father.</hi> Surely God hath a glorious Deſign to carry on in the
world, even the building up of <hi>David</hi>'s Throne to all Generations.
For he is compleating all his precious Stones, making them Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
and then laying them together in the Heavenly Manſions, with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93090:39"/>
the Spirits of the Juſt, till it be a compleat City. When the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone

               <p>This day, is a day wherein Chriſt appears in the Clouds. Oh, that
every one of our eyes may ſee him, and conſider how we-have pierced
him in his Members, that we may mourn! Our Lord Jeſus ſaid,
<hi>Father, I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do, and now
(Father) glorifie me with the ſame Glory I had with thee before the
world was.</hi> Our Lord was capable of his Glory beforehand; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we be not ſo capable as he, yet this we know, he wills the ſame
to us, <hi>that where he is, we may be alſo, that we may behold his Glory.</hi>
And he is our Head, in whom we are made capable, being choſen in
him before the foundation of the world; and he hath ſet us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places in Chriſt Jeſus. The hope of this Glory ſweetens all our
Sufferings.</p>
               <p>I know, a day of deliverance for Sion will come. Some may think
the manner of it may be, as before, <hi>with confuſed noiſe of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
and garments rolled in Blood;</hi> but I rathe think it will be with
<hi>burning, and fewel of fire.</hi> The Lord will ſend a fire, that ſhall burn
in the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of his Enemies, <hi>a worm that ſhall not die, and a
fire that ſhall not go out.</hi> Men, they may fight againſt; but <hi>this</hi> they

               <p>
                  <hi>It being told him by a Friend, that he had delivered him up unto
God as a Sacrifice, though (ſaid he) I have day and night prayed that
this cup might paſs from you. He replied,</hi> That he bleſſed God, he
had offered himſelf up firſt to God, and it was a rejoycing to him that
others had given him up alſo. And why, <hi>ſaid he (ſpeaking before all
the company</hi>) ſhould we be frighted with Death? I bleſs the Lord, I
am ſo far from being affrighted with Death, that I find it rather
ſhrink from me, than I from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Children being then preſent, to take their leave of him, he ſaid,</hi>
I bleſs God, by the eye of Faith I can ſee through all my Relations to
Mount Sion, and there I ſhall need none of them. I have better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in Heaven. Theſe Relations are nothing to thoſe I ſhall
meet with there. <hi>Then kiſſing his Children, he ſaid,</hi> The Lord bleſs
you, he will be a better Father to you: I muſt now forget that ever
I knew you. I can willingly leave this place and outward enjoyments,
for thoſe I ſhall meet with hereafter, in a better Country. I have made
it my buſineſs, to acquaint my ſelf with the ſociety of Heaven. Be not
you troubled, for I am going home to my Father.</p>
               <p>I die in the certain faith and forefight, That this Cauſe ſhall have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93090:40"/>
its Reſurrection in my Death. My Blood will be the Seed ſown, by
which this glorious Cauſe will ſpring up which God will ſpeedily raiſe.</p>
               <p>The laying down this earthly tabernacle is no more, but throwing
down the mantle, by which a double portion of the Spirit will fall on the
reſt of Gods People. And if by my being offered up, the Faith of many
be confirmed, and others convinced and brought to the knowledge of
the Truth, how can I deſire greater honour and matter of rejoycing?</p>
               <p>As for that glorious Cauſe, which God hath owned in theſe Nations,
and will own, in which ſo many Righteous ſouls have loſt their lives,
and ſo many have been engaged by my countenance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſhall I now give it up, and ſo declare them all Rebels and
Murderers? No, I will never do it: That precious Blood ſhall never
lie at my door. As a Teſtimony and Seal to the Juſtneſs of that
Quarrel, I leave now my Life upon it, as a Legacy to all the honeſt
Intereſt in theſe three Nations. Ten thouſand Deaths, rather than
defile my Conſcience, the chaſtity and purity of which I value beyond
all this world; and God is not a little concern'd on my behalf. He
will certainly judge my Caſe, wherein is the bowels of this good Cauſe,
and in the bowels of that, the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, which will
ſpeedily be ſet on foot in theſe Nations. I would not for ten thouſand
Lives, part-with this Peace and Satisfaction I have in my own heart,
(both in holding to the Purity of my Principle, and to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this good Cauſe) and the aſſurance I have that God is now
fulfilling all theſe great and precious Promiſes, in order to what he
is bringing forth. Although I ſee it not, yet I die in the faith and
aſſured expectation of it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 13. And the eternal bleſſedneſs
God hath prepared for me, and is ready now to receive me into, will
abundantly make up all other things. Through the power and goodneſs
of God, I have had in this Tryal of mine, ſuch a proof of the integrity
of my own heart, as hath been no ſmall joy to me.</p>
               <p>The expreſſions of grief from his Friends, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> were but ſo many
lets and hindrances to him, in the view he had of that Glory he was
going to poſſeſs, that heavenly City and Commonwealth, where he ſhould
behold the face of God and of his Son, in a ſociety of Angels, and the
Spirits of Juſt men made perfect.</p>
               <p>Some few dayes before his Suffering, his thoughts were much fixed
upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 27. where are theſe words; <hi>God is the Lord, which
hath ſhewed us light; bind the Sacrifice with cords, even unto the
horns of the Altar.</hi> From this, he ſaid, that God gives light, and is
light to his People, under their darkeſt circumſtances and ſufferings;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93090:40"/>
and when he calls them forth to ſuffer, he binds them as Sacrifices with
cords, in three reſpects: Firſt, by the Cord of his Love to us, for he
loved us firſt. Secondly, by the Cruelty of our Enemies. Thirdly,
by our Reſignation-duty and love to him. Theſe three Cords have
bound me ſo faſt, I cannot ſtir.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon Friends perſwading him, to make ſome ſubmiſſion to the King,
and to endeavour the obtaining of his Life; he ſaid,</hi> If the King did
not think himſelf more concern'd for his Honour and word, than he
did for his Life, he was very willing they ſhould take it. Nay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
(<hi>ſaid he</hi>) that I value my Life leſs in a good Cauſe, than the
King can do his Promiſe. <hi>And when ſome others were ſpeaking to
him, of giving ſome thouſands of pounds for his Life; he ſaid,</hi> If a
thouſand farthings would gain it, he would not give it: And if any
ſhould attempt to make ſuch a bargain, he would ſpoil their market:
For I think the King himſelf is ſo ſufficiently obliged to ſpare my Life,
that it is fitter for him to do it, than my ſelf to ſeek it.</p>
               <p>He rejoyced exceedingly, that God aſſiſted him ſo eminently in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Teſtimony with faithfulneſs even unto Death; and that he as
willingly laid down his Life, and with as much ſatisfaction, as ever he
went to bed. For in a natural ſickneſs, Death ſeized on the body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſent of the mind; but this was a free action of his mind,
without any conſtraint upon his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mention being made to him of the cruel proceedings againſt him;</hi>
Alas (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) what ado they keep to make a poor creature like his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour!
<hi>In diſcourſe he ſaid,</hi> If the ſhedding of my Blood, may prove an
occaſion of gathering together in one, the diſperſed Intereſts and Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Adherers to this Cauſe (of whatever differing perſwaſions)
I ſhould think ten thouſand Lives (if I had them) well ſpent in ſuch
a ſervice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was much pleaſed in this conſideration,</hi> That he was haſtening
to a place where God nor none of his, would be aſhamed to own and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him. Here is nothing in this world (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) but reproaching
and deſpiſing God's precious Saints; but in Heaven there is a good
reception for them, where are Manſions prepared from the beginning
of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaid,</hi> You will ſhortly ſee God coming forth with Vengeance upon
the whole Earth, Vengeance upon the outward-man of his Saints, and
Vengeance upon the inward-man of his and their Enemies; and that
ſhall perform greater execution, than was heretofore.</p>
               <p>After his Sentence, he ſaid to ſome Friends, God brought him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93090:41"/>
on three ſtages, (to wit, before the Court) and was now leading him to
the fourth (his Execution-place) which was far eaſier and pleaſanter
to him than any of the other three.</p>

               <p>MOſt holy and gracious Father, look down from the habitation of
thy Holineſs; viſit, relieve and comfort us thy poor Servants,
here gathered together in the Name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Thou art rending this
Vaile, and bringing us to a Mountain that abides firm. We are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
interrupters of our own joy, peace and good, by the workings
and reaſonings of our own hearts. Thou haſt promiſed, that thou wilt
be a Mouth to thy People in the hour of Tryal: for thou haſt required
us, to forbear the preparatory agitations of our own minds, becauſe it is
not we that are to ſpeak, but the Spirit of our heavenly Father that
ſpeaketh in us, in ſuch ſeaſons. In what ſeaſons more, (Lord) than
when thou calleſt for the Teſtimony of thy Servants to be writ in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Blood? Shew thy ſelf in a poor weak Worm, by enabling him
to ſtand againſt all the power of thy Enemies. There hath been a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
fought with garments rouled in blood, in which (upon ſolemn Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
on both ſides) thou didſt own thy Servants, though through the
ſpirit of Hypocriſie and Apoſtacy, that hath ſprung up amongst us, theſe
Nations have been thought unworthy any longer to enjoy the fruits of
that Deliverance. Thou haſt therefore another day of deciſion, to come,
which ſhall be wrought by fire. Such a battel is to begin, and be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by the Faith of thy People, yea, is in ſome ſort, begun by the
Faith of thy poor Servant, that is now going to ſeal thy Cauſe with his
Blood. Oh that this deciſion of thine may remarkably ſhew it ſelf in
thy Servant at this time, by his bold Teſtimony and ſealing it with his
Blood. We know not what interruptions may attend thy Servant, but
Lord, let thy Power carry him in a holy Triumph over all difficulties.</p>
               <p>Thou art the great Judge and Law-giver; for the ſake of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
therefore, O Lord, return on high, and cauſe a righteous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to come forth from thy preſence, for the relief of thy despiſed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93090:41"/>
People. This, thy Servants with Faith and Patience wait for. The
working of this Faith in us, cauſeth the Enemy to give ground already.
If Death be not able to terrifie us from keeping a good Conſcience, and
giving a good Teſtimony againſt them, what can they do but ſtumble
and fall backwards? The day approaches in which thou wilt decide
this Controverſie, not by Might nor by Power, but by the Spirit of the
living God. This Spirit will make its own way, and run through the
whole Earth. Then ſhall it be ſaid, <hi>Where is the fury of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor?</hi>
Who is he that dares or can ſtand before the Spirit of the Lord,
in the mouth of his Witneſſes? <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, and let thine Enemies
be ſcattered.</hi> Thy poor Servant knows not how he ſhall be carried
forth by thee this day, but, bleſſed be thy great Name, that he hath
whereof to ſpeak in this great Cauſe. When I ſhall be gathered to thee
this day, then come thou in the Miniſtry of thy holy Angels that excel
in ſtrength. We have ſeen enough of this World, and thou ſeeſt, we
have enough of it. Let theſe my Friends, that are round about me,
commit me to the Lord, and let them be gathered into the Family of
<hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and become faithful Witneſſes
of thoſe principles and Truths that have been diſcovered to them,
that it may be known, that a poor weak Prophet hath been amongst
them, not by the words of his mouth onely, but by the voice of his
Blood and Death, which will ſpeak when he is gone. Good Lord, put
words into his mouth that may daunt his Enemies, ſo that they may be
forced to ſay, God is in him of a Truth, and that the Son of God is in
his heart, and in his mouth. My hour-glaſs is now turned up, the ſand
runs out apace, and it is my happineſs that Death doth not ſurprize
me. It is Grace and Love thou doſt ſhew thy poor Servant, that thou
haſteneſt out his time, and letteſt him ſee it runs out with Joy and
Peace. Little do my Enemies know (as eager as they are to have me
gone) how ſoon their breaths may be drawn in.</p>
               <p>But let thy Servant ſee Death ſhrink under him. What a glorious
ſight will this be in the preſence of many Witneſſes, to have Death
ſhrink under him, which he acknowledgeth to be only by the power of
the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, whom the bands of Death could not
hold down? Let that Spirit enter into us that will ſet us again upon
our feet, and let us be led into that way, that the Enemies may not
know how to deal with us.</p>
               <p>Oh! what abjuring of Light, what Treachery, what meanneſs of
ſpirit has appeared in this day? What is the matter? Oh! Death
is the matter. Lord, ſtrengthen the Faith and Heart of thy poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93090:42"/>
to undergo this dayes work with Joy and Gladneſs, and bear it
on the Heart and Conſciences of his Friends that have known and
ſeen him, that they alſo may ſay, <hi>the Lord is in him of a truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh that thy Servant could ſpeak any bleſſing to theſe three Nations.
Let thy Remnant be gathered to thee. Prosper and relieve that poor
handful that are in Priſons and Bonds, that they may be raiſed up and
trample Death under foot. Let my poor Family that is left deſolate,
let my dear Wife and Children be taken into thy Care, be thou a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
Father and Maſter to them. Let the Spirits of thoſe that love
me, be drawn out towards them. Let a Bleſſing be upon theſe Friends
that are here at this time, ſtrengthen them, let them find Love and
Grace in thine Eyes, and be increaſed with the Increaſings of God.
Shew thy ſelf a loving Father to us all, and do for us abundantly,
above and beyond all that we can ask or think, for Jeſus Chriſt his
ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several Friends being with him in his Chamber this morning, he oft
encouraged them to chearfulneſs, as wel by his example as expreſſion.
In all his deportment, he ſhewed himſelf marvellouſly fitted to meet
the King of Terrors, without the leaſt affrightment. But to ſhew where
his ſtrength lay, he ſaid, <hi>he was a poor unworthy wretch, and had
nothing but the Grace and Goodneſs of God to depend upon.</hi> He ſaid,
moreover, <hi>Death ſhrunk from him, rather than he from it.</hi> Upon the
occaſion of parting with his Relations, he ſaid, <hi>There is ſome fleſh
remaining yet, but I muſt caſt it behind me, and preſs forward to my
Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then one of the Sheriffs men came in and told him, There was
no Sled to come, but he was to walk on foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He told his Friends, the Sheriffs Chaplain came to him at twelve
of the clock that night, with an Order for his Execution, telling him,
he was come to bring him that fatal Meſſage of Death.</hi> I think
(Friends) that in this Meſſage was no diſmalneſs at all; After the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of which, I ſlept four hours ſo ſoundly, that the Lord hath made
it ſufficient for me, and now I am going to ſleep my laſt, after which
I ſhall need ſleep no more.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Sheriff coming into the Room, was friendly ſaluted by
him, and after a little pauſe, communicated a Prohibition that he ſaid
he had received, which was, That he muſt not ſpeak any thing againſt
his Majeſty, or the Government. His Anſwer to this he himſelf
relates on the Scaffold. He further told Mr. Sheriff, he was ready
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93090:42"/>
but the Sheriff ſaid, he was not, nor could be this half hour yet;
<hi>Then Sir, it reſts on you, not on me</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Henry) for I have been
ready this half hour.</hi> Then the Shriff, at his requeſt, promiſed him
his ſervants ſhould attend him on the Scaffold and be civilly dealt with,
neither of which were performed, for (notwithſtanding this promiſe)
they were beaten and kept off the Scaffold, till he ſaid, <hi>What? have
I never a ſervant here?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, one of the Sheriffs men came and told him, there muſt
be a Sled; to which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> replied, <hi>Any way, how they pleaſe,
for I long to be at home, to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which
is beſt of all.</hi> He went very chearfully and readily down the ſtairs from
his Chamber, and ſeated himſelf on the Sled, (Friends and Servants
ſtanding about him) then he was forthwith drawn away towards the
Scaffold. As he went, ſome in the <hi>Tower</hi> (Priſoners as well as others)
ſpake to him, praying the Lord to go with him. And after he was out
of the <hi>Tower,</hi> from the tops of houſes and out of windows, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
uſed ſuch means and geſtures as might beſt diſcover at a diſtance,
their reſpects and love to him, crying aloud, <hi>The Lord go with you,
The great God of Heaven and Earth appear in you, and for you;</hi>
whereof he took what notice he was capable in thoſe circumſtances,
in a chearful manner accepting their reſpect, putting off his Hat and
bowing to them. Being asked ſeveral times, how he did, by ſome
about him, he anſwered, <hi>Never better in all my life.</hi> Another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
How ſhould he do ill that ſuffers for ſo glorious a Cauſe? To
which a tall black man ſaid. Many ſuffered for a better Cauſe; <hi>and
may for a worſe,</hi> ſaid Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> wiſhing, <hi>That when they come to
ſeal their</hi> better Cauſe (<hi>as he called it) with their Blood (as he was
now going to ſeal his) they might not find themſelves deceived; And
as to this Cauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it hath given Life in Death, to all the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it, and Sufferers for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being paſſed within the Rails on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> there were many loud
acclamations of the people, crying out, <hi>The Lord Jeſus go with your
dear Soul, &amp;c.</hi> One told him, that was the moſt glorious Seat he ever
ſate on; he anſwered, <hi>It is ſo indeed,</hi> and rejoyced exceedingly.</p>
               <p>Being come to the Scaffold, he chearfully aſcends, and being up, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the crowd on the Scaffold was broken in two pieces, to make way
for him, he ſhewed himſelf to the People on the front of the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
with that Noble and Chriſtian-like deportment, that he rather
ſeemed a looker-on, than the perſon concerned in the Execution, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that it was difficult to perſwade many of the People, that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93090:43"/>
was the Priſoner. But when they knew that the Gentleman in the
black Sute and Cloak (with a Scarlet ſilk Waſtcoat (the victorious
colour) ſhewing it ſelf at the breaſt) was the Priſoner, they generally
admired that Noble and great Preſence he appeared with. How chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
he is! ſaid ſome; he does not look like a dying-man! ſaid others;
with many like ſpeeches, as aſtoniſhed with that ſtrange appearance he
ſhined forth in.</p>
               <p>Then (ſilence being commanded by the Sheriff) lifting up his hands
and eyes towards Heaven, and then reſting his hands on the Rails, and
taking a very ſerious, compoſed and majeſtick view of the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
about him, he ſpake as followeth.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>VVHen Mr. Sheriff came to me this morning, and told me he
had received a Command from the King, that I ſhould ſay
nothing reflecting upon his Majeſty or the Government; I anſwered,
I ſhould confine and order my Speech, as near as I could, ſo as to
be leaſt offenſive, ſaving my faithfulneſs to the Truſt repoſed in me,
which I muſt ever diſcharge with a good Conſcience unto Death;
for I ever valued a man, according to his faithfulneſs to the Truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in him, even on his Majeſties behalf, in the late Controverſie.
And if you dare truſt my diſcretion, Mr. Sheriff, I ſhall do nothing but
what becomes a good Chriſtian and an Engliſhman; and ſo I hope I
ſhall be civilly dealt with.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Sheriffs Chaplain came to me laſt night about twelve
of the clock, to bring me, as he called it, the fatal Meſſage of Death,
it pleaſed the Lord to bring that Scripture to my mind, in the third of
<hi>Zechary,</hi> to intimate to me, that he was now taking away my filthy
garments, cauſing mine iniquities to paſs from me, with intention to
give me change of raiment, and that my mortal ſhould put on Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe you may wonder when I ſhall tell you that I am not
brought hither according to any known Law of the Land. It is true,
I have been before a Court of Juſtice, (and am now going to appear
before a greater Tribunal, where I am to give an account of all my
actions) under their Sentence I ſtand here at this time. When I was
before them, I could not have the liberty and priviledge of an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the grounds, reaſons, and cauſes of the Actings I was charged
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93090:43"/>
with, duly conſidered: I therefore deſired the Judges, that they would
ſet their Seals to my Bill of Exceptions; I preſſed hard for it again
and again, as the Right of my ſelf, and every free-born Engliſh-man,
by the Law of the Land; but was finally denied it.—</p>
               <p>Here Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> (Lieutenant of the Tower) interrupted
him, ſaying, Sir, you muſt not go on thus, and (in a furious manner,
generally obſerved, even to the diſ-ſatisfaction of ſome of their own
attendants) ſaid, that he railed againſt the Judges, and that it was a
lye, and I am here (ſayes he) to teſtifie that it is falſe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> replied, God will judge between me and you in
this matter. I ſpeak but matter of Fact, and cannot you bear that?
'Tis evident, the Judges have refuſed to ſign my Bill of Exceptions—Then
the Trumpets were ordered to ſound or murre in his face, with a
contemptible noiſe, to hinder his being heard. At which Sir <hi>Henry</hi>
(lifting up his hand, and then laying it on his breaſt) ſaid, What mean
you Gentlemen? is this your uſage of me? did you uſe all the reſt ſo?
I had even done (as to that) could you have been patient, but ſeeing
you cannot bear it, I ſhall only ſay this, <hi>That whereas the Judges
have refuſed to ſeal that with their hands, that they have done; I am
come to ſeal that with my Blood, that I have done.</hi> Therefore leaving
this matter, which I perceive will not be born, I judge it meet to give
you ſome account of my Life.</p>
               <p>I might tell you, I was born a Gentleman, had the education, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and ſpirit of a Gentleman, as well as others, being (in my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
dayes) inclined to the vanities of this world, and to that which
they call <hi>Good-fellowſhip,</hi> judging it to be the only means of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
a Gentleman. But about the fourteenth or fifteenth year of
my age, (which is about thirty four or five years ſince) God was
pleaſed to lay the foundation or ground-work of Repentance in me,
for the bringing me home to himſelf, by his wonderful rich and free
Grace, revealing his Son in me, that by the knowledge of the onely
true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, I might (even whilſt
here in the body) be made partaker of Eternal Life, in the firſt-fruits
of it.</p>
               <p>When my Conſcience was thus awakened, I found my former courſe
to be diſloyalty to God, prophaneneſs, and a way of ſin and death,
which I did with tears and bitterneſs bewail, as I had cauſe to do.
Since that foundation of Repentance laid in me, through Grace I have
been kept ſteadfaſt, deſiring to walk in all good Conſcience towards
God and towards men, according to the beſt light and underſtanding
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93090:44"/>
God gave me. For this, I was willing to turn by back upon my
Eſtate, expoſe my ſelf to hazards in Forreign parts; yea, nothing
ſeemed difficult to me, ſo I might preſerve Faith and a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which I prefer before all things; and do earneſtly perſwade all
people rather to ſuffer the higheſt contradictions from men, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
God, by contradicting the light of their own Conſcience. In this,
it is, I ſtand with ſo much comfort and boldneſs before you all this
day, and upon this occaſion; being aſſured, that I ſhall at laſt ſit
down in Glory with Chriſt, at his right hand. I ſtand here this day, to
reſign up my Spirit into the hands of that God that gave it me. Death
is but a little word, but 'tis a great work to die, it is to be but once
done, and after this cometh the Judgment, even the Judgment of the
great God, which it concerns us all to prepare for. And by this Act,
I do receive a diſcharge, once for all, out of Priſon, even the Priſon of
the mortal body alſo, which to a true Chriſtian is a burdenſom
weight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all reſpects, wherein I have been concerned and engaged as to
the Publick, my deſign hath been to accompliſh Good things for theſe
Nations. Then (lifting up his eyes, and ſpreading his hands) he
ſaid,</hi> I do here appeal to the great God of Heaven, and all this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
or any other perſons, to ſhew wherein I have defiled my hands
with any mans Blood or Eſtate, or that I have ſought my ſelf in any
publick capacity or place I have been in.</p>
               <p>The Cauſe was three times ſtated.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In the</hi> Remonſtrance of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
               <p>2. In the <hi>Covenant, the Solemn League and Covenant</hi>—Upon
this the Trumpets ſounded, the Sheriff catched at the Paper in his
hand, and Sir <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> who at firſt had acknowledged that he
had nothing to do there, wiſhing the Sheriff to ſee to it, yet found
himſelf ſomething to do now, furiouſly calling for the Writers-Books,
and ſaying, <hi>he treats of Rebellion, and you write it.</hi> Hereupon ſix
Note-Books were delivered up. The Priſoner was very patient and
compoſed under all theſe injuries and ſoundings of the Trumpets ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times in his face, only ſaying, <hi>'Twas hard he might not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to ſpeak;</hi> but ſayes he, <hi>my uſage from man is no harder than
was my Lord and Maſters; And all that will live his life this day,
muſt expect hard dealing from the worldly ſpirit</hi>—The Trumpets
ſounded again, to hinder his being heard. Then again <hi>Robinſon</hi> and
two or three others, endeavoured to ſnatch the Paper out of Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi>
hand, but he kept it for a while, now and then reading part of it;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93090:44"/>
afterwards, tearing it in pieces, he delivered it to a Friend behind him,
who was preſently forced to deliver it to the Sheriff. Then they put
their hands into his pockets for Papers (as was pretended) which bred
great confuſion and diſſatisfaction to the Spectators, ſeeing a Priſoner
ſo ſtrangely handled in his dying words. This was exceeding remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
in the midſt of all this diſorder, the Priſoner himſelf was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be of the moſt conſtant, compoſed ſpirit and countenance,
which he throughout ſo excellently manifeſted, that a Royalliſt ſwore,
<hi>he dyed like a Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner, ſuſpecting beforehand the diſorder afore-mentioned,
writ the main Subſtance of what he intended to ſpeak on the
Scaffold, in that Paper they catched at, and which he tore in
pieces, delivering it to a Friend, from whom the Sheriff had it
as above-ſaid; the true Copy whereof, was by the Priſoner care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
committed to a ſafe hand before he came to the Scaffold,
which take as followeth.</p>
               <p>THe Work which I am at this time called unto, in this place, (as
upon a Publick Theater) is, to Die, and receive a Diſcharge,
once for all, out of Priſon; to do that, which is but once to be done;
the doing or not doing of which <hi>well,</hi> and as becomes a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
does much depend upon the life we have been taught of God to lead,
before we come to this: They that live in the Faith, do alſo die in it:
Faith is ſo far from leaving Chriſtians in this hour, that the work of it
breaks forth then into its greateſt power; as if till then, it were not
enough at freedom to do its office, that is, to look into the things
that are unſeen, with moſt ſteadfaſtneſs, certainty, and delight;
which is the great Sweetner of Death, and Remover of its Sting.</p>
               <p>Give me leave therefore in a very few words, to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my Life, and of the wonderful great Grace and Mercy of
God, in bringing me home to himſelf, and revealing his Son in me;
that by the knowledge of the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom
he hath ſent, I might (even whilſt here in the body) be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of Eternal Life, in the firſt fruits of it; and at laſt ſit down
with Chriſt in Glory, at his right-hand.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall mention ſome remarkable paſſages and changes of my
Life; In particular, how unſought for by my ſelf, I was called to be
a Member of the <hi>Long Parliament;</hi> what little advantage I had
by it; and by what ſteps I became ſatisfied with the Cauſe I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in, and did purſue the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93090:45"/>
What the Cauſe was, did firſt ſhew it ſelf, in the <hi>firſt Remonſtrance
of the Houſe of Commons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, in the</hi> Solemn League and Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, in the</hi> more refined purſuit of it by the Commons Houſe,
in their Actings ſingle: <hi>with what Reſult they were growing up into,
which was in the breaſt of the Houſe, and unknown; or what the</hi>
three Propoſals, <hi>mentioned in my Charge, would have come to at laſt,
I ſhall not need now to ſay; but only, from all put together, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,</hi>
That this Cauſe which was owned by the Parliament, was the
CAUSE of GOD, and for the Promoting of the Kingdom of his
dear Son, <hi>JESUS CHRIST;</hi> wherein are comprehended our
Liberties and Duties, both as Men and as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And ſince it hath pleaſed God, who ſeparated me from the womb
to the knowledge and ſervice of the Goſpel of his Son, to ſeparate
me alſo to this hard and difficult ſervice at this time, and to ſingle
me out to the defence and juſtification of this his Cauſe, I could not
conſent by any words or actions of mine, that the innocent Blood
that hath been ſhed in the defence of it, throughout the whole War,
(<hi>the Guilt and moral evil of which, muſt and does certainly lye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where</hi>)
did lye at my door, or at theirs that have been the faithful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herers
to this Cauſe. This is with ſuch evidence upon my heart, that I
am moſt freely and chearfully willing, to put the greateſt Seal to it I am
capable, which is, the pouring out of my very Blood in witneſs to it;
which is all I ſhall need to ſay in this place, and at this time, having
ſpoken at large to it in my Defence at my Tryal, intending to have ſaid
more the laſt day, as what I thought was reaſonable for <hi>Arreſt of the
Judgment,</hi> but I was not permitted then to ſpeak it; Both which
may with time and God's providence, come to publick view.</p>
               <p>And I muſt ſtill aſſert, That I remain wholly unſatisfied, that the
courſe of proceedings againſt me at my Tryal were according to Law,
but that I was run upon and deſtroyed, contrary to Right, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> under the form only of Juſtice: which I
leave to God to decide, who is the Judge of the whole World, and to
clear my Innocency; Whilſt in the mean time, I beſeech him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, and all that have had a hand in my Death; and that the
Lord in his great mercy will not lay it unto their charge.</p>
               <p>And I do account this Lot of mine no other, than what is to be
expected by thoſe that are not of the World, but whom Chriſt hath
choſen out of it; for the Servant is not greater than his Lord; And if
they have done this to the green tree, they will do it much more to the
dry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93090:45"/>
However, I ſhall not altogether excuſe my ſelf. I know, that by many
weakneſſes and failers, I have given occaſion enough of the ill uſage I have
met with from men, though, in the main, the Lord knows the ſincerity and
integrity of my heart, whatever Aſperſions and Reproaches I have or do
lye under. I know alſo that God is juſt, in bringing this Sentence and
Condemnation upon me, for my ſins; there is a body of ſin and death in
me, deſerves this Sentence; and there is a ſimilitude and likeneſs alſo,
that, as a Chriſtian, God thinks me worthy to bear with my Lord and
head, in many circumſtances in reference to theſe dealings I have met with,
in the good I have been endeavouring for many years to be doing in theſe
Nations, and eſpecially now at laſt, in being numbred amongſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
and made a publick Sacrifice, through the wrath and contradictions
of men, and in having finiſhed my courſe, and fought the good fight of
Faith, and reſiſted in a way of ſuffering (as you ſee) even unto blood.</p>
               <p>This is but the needful preparation the Lord hath been working in me,
to the receiving of the Crown of Immortality, which he hath prepared
for them that love him, The proſpect whereof is ſo chearing, that through
the Joy (in it) that is ſet before the eyes of my Faith, I can, through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>endure this Croſs, deſpiſe this Shame,</hi> and am become <hi>more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,</hi>
through Chriſt that hath loved me.</p>
               <p>For my Life, Eſtate and all, is not ſo dear to me as my Service to God,
to his Cauſe, to the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the future welfare of my
Country; and I am taught according to the Example, as well as that
moſt Chriſtian ſaying of a Noble Perſon that lately died after this publick
manner in <hi>Scotland;</hi> 
                  <q>How much better is it to chuſe Affliction and the
Croſs, than to ſin or draw back from the Service of the Living God,
into the wayes of Apoſtacy and Perdition.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That Noble Perſon, whoſe Memory I honour, was with my ſelf at the
beginning and making of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> the Matter
of which, and the holy Ends therein contained, I fully aſſent unto, and
have been as deſirous to obſerve; but the <hi>rigid</hi> way of proſecuting it, and
the <hi>oppreſſing Uniformity</hi> that hath bin endeavored by it. I never approved.</p>
               <p>This were ſufficient to vindicate me from the falſe Aſperſions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
which have been laid upon me, of <hi>Jeſuitiſm</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
what not, to make my Name of ill ſavour with <hi>good men;</hi> which
dark miſts do now diſpel of themſelves, or at leaſt ought, and need no
pains of mine in making an Apology.</p>
               <p>For if any man ſeek a proof of Chriſt in me, let him reade it in his
action of my Death, which will not ceaſe to ſpeak when I am gone;
<hi>And henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks
of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:93090:46"/>
I ſhall not deſire in this place to take up much time, but only, as my
laſt words, leave this with you: <q>That as the preſent ſtorm we now lie
under, and the dark Clouds that yet hang over the Reformed Churches
of Chriſt, (which are coming thicker and thicker for a ſeaſon) were
not un-fore-ſeen by me for many years paſſed, (as ſome Writings of
mine declare:) So the coming of Chriſt in theſe Clouds, in order to
a ſpeedy and ſudden Revival of his Cauſe, and ſpreading his Kingdom
over the face of the whole Earth, is moſt clear to the eye of my Faith,
even that Faith in which I dye, whereby the Kingdoms of this world
ſhall become the Kingdom of our Lord, and of his Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>THe Heaven is thy Throne, O Lord, and the Earth is thy footſtool,
but to this man wilt thou look, <hi>even to him that is poor, and of a
contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at thy Word.</hi> Thou, O Lord, art the great
God of Heaven and Earth, thou filleſt all places with thy preſence, art the
Judge of the whole World, and doſt Righteouſneſs. We are poor unworthy
ſinful creatures, by nature children of wrath as well as others: We are
wiſe to do evil, but to do good we have no knowledge. If to will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with us, yet how to perform and go through with that which is good,
and not be weary of well-doing, we find not.</p>
               <p>Bring us, O Lord, into the true mystical Sabbath-ſtate, that we may
ceaſe from our own works, reſt from our labors, not think our own thoughts,
find our own deſire, or walk in the way of our own hearts, but become a
meet habitation of thy Spirit by the everlaſting Covenant, the place of thy
Reſt. Let the Spirit of God and of Glory, that is greater than he that is
in the world, reſt upon us, work in and by us mightily, to the pulling down
of fleſh and blood, the ſtrong holds of Sin and Satan in our ſelves and
others, cauſing us ſo to ſuffer under the Fire-Baptiſm thereof, as that we
may ceaſe from ſin for ever, or from that fleſhly, mutable, &amp; temporary ſtate
of life and righteouſneſs, which at beſt is liable to roul back into ſin again,
to be intangled, overcome, and finally triumphed over by the pollutions of
this world. Deliver us, O Lord, from the Evil One, deliver us from our
ſelves, take us out of our own dispoſe, our own liberty and power, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

doing all things for the Truth, and a diſability brought upon us as to the
doing of any thing againſt the Truth, in the ſingle power and freedom of our
own ſpirit. Then the prince of this world coming to us, will find nothing in
us; at leaſt, no prevailing activity of ſelf, nature or fleſh, which at beſt, is
capable to be made by him an ergin of oppoſition to the Kingdom of Chriſt,
and our own true bleſſedneſs. Thou haſt laid on thy Son the iniquities

whether it be good or whether it be evil. He will bring every ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

Thine eyes, O Lord, run to and fro through the whole earth. <hi>Thine
eyes do behold, thine eye-lids try the children of men. The wicked and
him that loveth violence, thy ſoul hateth. But thou upholdeſt the poor and
needy, him that is of a broken heart and of a contrite ſpirit. The humble
and lowly thou wilt teach, the meek thou wilt guide in Judgment; thou
wilt beautifie the meek with Salvation.</hi> Thou art the ſupream dispoſer of
all the Kingdoms of men, giving them to whomſoever thou wilt. Whatever
croſs-blows thou ſufferest to be given thy People for a ſeaſon, thou ordereſt
all, to thy own glory, and their true advantage. But thou haſt a ſet time

the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom.
Let the exceeding near approach of this, bear up the ſpirits of thy poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
ones, in this day of extremity and ſuffering, from ſinking and deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
Carry them through their ſuffering part, with a holy triumph, in thy
Chariots of Salvation. How long, O Lord, holy and true? make haſt to
help the Remnant of thy People. Break the Heavens and come down,
touch the Mountains of prey, the Kingdoms of this evil world, and let
them ſmoak. Let the mouth of all Iniquity be ſtopped. Silence every one
that ſtands up againſt thee. Rebuke the debauched prophane ſpirits of
men, that ſet themſelves to work wickedneſs, running with greedineſs into
all filthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs. <hi>They eat thy People as they
eat bread. They are profound to make ſlaughter, skilful to deſtroy, though

Thou knoweſt O Lord, that in the Faith of Jeſus, and for the Truth as
it is in Jeſus, thy Servant deſires to die, walking in the ſteps of our father
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and for Righteouſneſs and Judgment, following the Lord in all
his wayes whitherſoever he goes, worſhipping the God of his believing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in that way which men call Hereſie. In
this Faith, dear Lord, I have lived, and in this Faith and Profeſſion I die,
as one that hath herein ſtood up for the Teſtimony of JESUS againſt all
Idolatry, Superſtition, Prophaneſs and Popery, or whatever is unſound or
unfit to be brought before the Throne of ſo great and glorious a Majesty.
'Tis in this Faith that thy Servant dies. Now ſet thy Seal to it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the reproaches and calumnies with which thy Servant is reproached,
for thou knowst his innocency. Dear Father, thou ſentest us into this world,
but this world is not our home, we are ſtrangers and pilgrims in it, as all
our fathers were. We have no abode here, but there is a houſe, not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens, that when this tabernacle is diſſolved,
we may enter into. In our Fathers houſe are many manſions; Oh! what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the curſes and condemnations of the Law are, be thou near to us, and
ſpread the Righteouſneſs of Christ over us, and we ſhall be ſafe. <hi>Bleſſed is
he, whoſe tranſgreſſions are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered.</hi> Who wil
ſpeak, who will take on him to ſay any thing, or to plead with Thee, upon any
other terms but in the Name and Merits of the mighty Redeemer, on whom
our help is laid. We deſire to lie low, to be abaſed and take ſhame &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of face to our ſelves, as that which properly belongs to us, that Thou
alone maist be exalted and advanced. 'Tis of meer Grace, O Lord, that
thy Servant hath now ſome ſign of thy ſpecial Salvation, even thy free-Grace,
O God, whereby thou doſt accept him in thy Son. Lay him low and
humble &amp; abaſe his ſoul for his ſins, and all his unworthineſſes before thee.
Men cannot ſpeak evil enough of our ſins. In this perſwaſion, this abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and humiliation, thy Servant deſires to die. And, dear Lord, thou
ſeeſt &amp; knowst all things, and art able to witneſs to the truth &amp; integrity
of thy Servant. When his blood is ſhed upon the Block, let it have a voice
afterward, that may ſpeak his Innocency, and ſtrengthen the Faith of thy
Servants in the Truth. Let it alſo ſerve for conviction to the worst of thy
Enemies, that they may ſay, Surely the Lord knows, and the Lord owns his
Servant, as one that belongs to him. The deſire of our ſoul is to haſten to
thee, O God, to be diſſolved, that we may be with Chriſt. Bleſſed be thy
Name, that this great ſtrait that we were before in, is now determined;
that there is no longer abode for me in this mortal body. Our great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the great General of our ſouls, did go in a way of affliction before us,
to Heaven. Come, Lord, declare thy Will, that thy poor Servant may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest

a readineſs to come to Thee; Prepare his heart, that in his acceſs to
Thee may, he be brought down at thy feet, in ſhame &amp; confuſion for all the
evil is ſo of hul; but Thou art his ſalvation. Let thy Servant ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
on the behalf of the Nation wherein he hath lived; Lord, did we
not exceed other Nations in our day? Great things have been done by thee
in the midst of us. Oh, that thou wouldst look down in pity &amp; compaſſion,
and pardon the ſins of this whole Nation, and lay them not to their charge;
ſhew them what is thy good and acceptable Will, and bring them into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
thereunto. We humbly pray thee, O Lord, look down with compaſſion
upon this great &amp; populous City, cleanſe away the impurity, ſinfulneſs and
defilements thereof; cauſe their ſouls to delight in thy Word, that they may
live. Let a ſpirit of Reformation and Purity ſpring up in and amongst them
with power; make them willing to lay down all that is dear to them for
thee, that Thou mayſt give them a Crown of Life; that they may always
deſire &amp; chuſe affliction, and to be expoſed to the worſt condition &amp; hardeſt
circumſtances, that can be brought upon them in this world, rather than
ſin againſt him that hath loved them and bought them with a price, that
they might live to him in their bodies and in their ſpirits.</p>
               <p>We are aſſured Thou knoweſt our ſuffering caſe and condition, how it is
with us. We deſire to give no juſt occaſion of offence, nor to provoke any,
but in meekneſs to forgive our Enemies. Thy Servant that is now falling
aſleep, doth heartily deſire of thee, that thou wouldeſt forgive them, and
not lay this ſin to their charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before the ſtroke, he ſpake to this effect;</hi> I bleſs the Lord who hath

               <p>It was obſerved, that no ſigns of inward fear appeared by any trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
or ſhaking of his hands, or any other parts of his body, all along

he obſerved that his Countenance did not in the leaſt change: and
whereas the Heads of all he had before ſeen, did ſome way or other move

Soveraings.</p>
               <p>A Soveraign in the firſt ſenſe, none is nor can be, but God, who
is of himſelf moſt abſolute. And he that is firſt of all others in the
ſecond ſence, is the Man Chriſt Jeſus, to whom the Power of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
in the Right of the Father is committed, over all the
Works of Gods hands. Chriſt exerciſed the ſame in the capacity of
<hi>David's</hi> Root from before the beginning of the World. He owne;
himſelf thus to be, long before he became <hi>David's</hi> Seed; This his
being in Spirit, or hidden being, even as a Creature, the firſt of all
Creatures in perſonal Union with the Word, <hi>David</hi> ſaw and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 1. Thus Chriſt may be called God's Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Soveraign, or General Vicegerent of his Supremacy over
all in Heaven and in Earth. He therefore is the true Univerſal
King and Root of all Soveraign and juſt Governing Power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven or on Earth.</p>
               <p>His Soveraignty is unqueſtionable and unaccountable, becauſe
of the Perfection of his Perſon, carrying in it an aptitude and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
to Govern, without poſſibility of Error or Defect of any
kind. Soveraign and Governing Power doth neceſſarily relate to
Subjects, that are to be the Ruled, and Subjects capable of ſuch
Government. Therefore when God himſelf purpoſes within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to be Supream Legiſlator and Governour, he doth withal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Being and Creation of both Worlds, as the Subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Kingdom. He propounds to Govern his Subjects by and
with their own conſent and good liking; or, without and againſt
it, in the way of his revenging Juſtice; Governing by Laws, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtating and aſcertaining the Duty or the Offence, as alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Penalties.</p>
               <p>Herein Juſt Government conſiſts, or the Juſtice of Government;
for he that Rules over others, muſt be Juſt; and indeed ſhould be
ſeen to be ſo in all his Commands: ſo ſeen, as to render the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of the Ruled, and thoſe whoſe duty it is to Obey, inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
before God and before Men, if they Diſſent or Reſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93090:49"/>
Inexcuſable they are before God, becauſe the matter Commanded
is the matter of God's Law, &amp; therefore juſt to be obeyed. They are
alſo Inexcuſable before Men, that which is required of them being
generally acknowledged and affirmed (by thoſe in whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
conſent of the Subjects is intruſted to that end) to be Juſt,
and Reaſonable, and therefore to be Obeyed. For the end of all
Government, being for the Good and Welfare, and not for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Ruled; God who is the Inſtitutor of Government,
as he is pleaſed to Ordain the Office of Governors, intruſting them
with Power to command the Juſt and Reaſonable Things, which
his own Law Commands, that carry their own evidence to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reaſon and Senſe, at leaſt, that do not evidently contradict
it, ſo he grants a Liberty to the Subjects, or thoſe that by him are
put under the Rule, to refuſe all ſuch Commands as are contrary
to his Law, or to the judgement of common Reaſon and Senſe,
whoſe trial he allows, by way of aſſent or diſſent, before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Ruler ſhall be Binding or put in Execution; and this
in a Co-ordinacy of Power with Juſt Government, and as the due
Ballance thereof. The Original Impreſſions of Juſt Laws are in
Mans Nature and very Conſtitution of Being. Man hath the Law
in his Mind, (or the Superior and Intellectual part of him) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
and bringing that into obedience and ſubjection to the
Law of God, in Chriſt himſelf. He hath alſo that which is a Law
in his Members that are on the Earth, (or his earthly and ſenſual
part) whoſe Power is Co-ordinate with the other, but ſuch, that
if it be not gained into a Harmony and Conjunction with its Head,
the Spirit or Mind of man, hath ability to let and hinder his Mind
or Ruling part, from performing and putting in execution, that
which is good, juſt, fit, and to be acknowledged as the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dictates of the Mind, which ought to be the Ruling Power, or
Law to the Man. So in the outward Government over Man, the
ſecondary or co-ordinate Power, concurring with that which is the
chief ruling Power, is eſſential to Juſt Government; and is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be ſo, by the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> as well as in the Legal Being and Conſtitution
of Parliaments, whether that which hath been uſual and ordinary,
according to the Common Law; or that which of late hath been
Extraordinary, by expreſs Statute, for the continuance of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
17. <hi>Car.</hi> until diſſolved by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>For together with the Legal Being which is given to Regal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93090:49"/>
Power and the Prerogative of the Crown, there is the Legal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Being reſerved alſo unto that Body, which is the Peoples or
Kingdoms Repreſentative, who are the Hands wherein that which
is called Power Politick is ſeated, and are intruſted with giving
or with holding the common Conſent of the whole Nation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the beſt of their Underſtandings, in all matters coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and are to keep this Liberty Inviolate and Entire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Invaſions or Encroachments upon it, whatſoever.</p>
               <p>This ſecond Power in the very Writ of Summons for calling a
Parliament, is declared to be of that Nature, that what the firſt
doth without obtaining the Conſent and Approbation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
in Parliament, is not binding but ineffectual. And when
the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom, (in and with whom, this
Power is intruſted, as the Due and Legal Ballance and Boundary
to the Regal Power, ſet and fixed by the Fundamental Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
is made a ſtanding Court, and of that Continuance, as not to
be diſſolvable but by its own conſent; during ſuch its continuance,
it hath right to preſerve it ſelf from all violent and undue Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and to maintain and defend its own Juſt Priviledges, a
chief of which is, to binde or looſe the People, in all matters
good or hurtful to them, according to their beſt Judgement and
diſcretion.</p>
               <p>In the exerciſe of this their Truſt, they are Indemnified by
Law, and no hurt ought to come unto them; that Governing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which is originally in God, and ſlowes at firſt from him, as the
ſole and proper Fountain thereof, is brought into exerciſe amongſt
men, upon a differing and diſtinct account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it is a Truſt and Right derived conditionally from God
to his Officers and Miniſters, (which therefore may be loſt) who
being called by him, and in the courſe of his Providence, to the
exerciſe of it, are to hold it of him the Univerſal King, and to own
themſelves in the exerciſe thereof, as his Vicegerents, to cut off
by the Sword of Juſtice evil-doers; and to be a Protection and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to them that do well. But becauſe it is part of God's
Call of any perſon to this high Truſt, to bring him into the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and free Exerciſe thereof, by the common conſent of the Body
of the People, where ſuch Soveraign Power is ſet up, unleſs they
have forfeited this Liberty. Therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God doth allow and confer by the very Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
upon the Community or Body of the People (that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93090:50"/>
to, and concerned in the right of Government, placed over
them) the Liberty by their common Vote or Suffrage duely given,
to be Aſſenters or Diſſenters thereunto, and to Affirm and make
Stable, or Diſallow and render Ineffectual, what ſhall apparently
be found by them to be for the good or hurt of that Society, whoſe
welfare next under the juſtice of God's Commands and his Glory,
is the Supream Law, and very end of all Subordinate governing
Power.</p>
               <p>Soveraign Power then comes from God, as its proper Root, but
the reſtraint or enlargement of it, in its Execution over ſuch or
ſuch a Body, is ſounded in the common conſent of that Body.</p>
               <p>The Office of chief Ruler, or Head over any State, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
or Kingdom, hath the Right of due Obedience from the
People inſeparably annexed to it. It is an Office, not onely of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtitution, but for the Safety and Protection of the whole
Body or Community, and therefore juſtly and neceſſarily draws to
it, and engages their Subjection.</p>
               <p>This Office of the Soveraign, according to the Laws, and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Conſtitutions of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> is miniſtred
by the King in a twofold Capacity, as his Will and perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is in Conjunction and Agreement with his People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(during the Seſſion thereof) or as it is in Conjunction and
Agreement with the Law, the Parliament not Sitting. But his
Will and Perſonal Command ſingle, in diſ-junction and diſagree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
from the Parliament or the Laws, hath not the force of a Law,
ſaith <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> and gives the Reaſon of it, <hi>Becauſe this is a limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Monarchy, where the King's Power (as to the exerciſe of it) is
onely a Power Politick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Obedience then which from the Subject is due to the
King, and which they are ſworn to perform by the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
is to him, in the miniſtry of the Royal Office, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the reaſon and intent of the Fundamental Compact and
Conſtitution, and according to his own Oath, which is to Govern
by Law; that is, to Exerciſe his Rule or Royal commanding Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
in Conjunction and Agreement with the Parliament when ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and in Conjunction, and Agreement with the Laws of the
Land, they not ſitting. To exerciſe his Power otherwiſe, is and
hath been alwayes judged a grievance to the People, and a
going againſt that which is the original Right and juſt Liberty of
the Community, who are not to be bound to ſuch perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93090:50"/>
at will and pleaſure, nor compelled to yield Obedience
thereunto.</p>
               <p>The contrary hereunto was the Principle at bottom of the Kings
Cauſe, which he endeavoured to uphold and maintain, in order to
decline and lay aſide the Legal Reſtraints as aforeſaid, which the
Government of <hi>England</hi> by the Fundamental Conſtitution, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
unto, as to the exerciſe and miniſtery of the Royal
Office.</p>
               <p>From the Obſervation and Experience which the Pople of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
had, and made many years together, by their Repreſentatives
in Parliament, of a deſire in the King to ſhake off theſe Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
in the Exerciſe of the Regal Power, and on their having
tried the beſt wayes and means that occurred to their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to prevent the ſame, and to ſecure to themſelves the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Juſt Rights and Liberty, they at laſt pitch'd upon
the deſiring from the King, the continuance of the ſitting of the
Parliament called, <hi>November</hi> 3d 1640, in ſuch ſort as is expreſſed
in that Act, 17. <hi>Car.</hi> wherein it is provided, <hi>That it ſhall not be
Diſcontinued or Diſſolved, but by Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was judged by them, the greateſt Security imaginable, for
keeping the miniſtry of the Royal Office within its due Bounds;
and for quieting the People in the enjoyment of their Rights. But
experience hath ſhewed, that this yet could not be done without a
War, the worſt and laſt of Remedies. For although their Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom, with the Right
to exerciſe the Power and Priviledges inherent in, and inſeparable
from that Supream Court and Chief Senate (whereof the King is
Head, both making but one Perſon or Politick Body in Law) yet
they themſelves, as well as the King, were bound by the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Conſtitution or Compact, upon which the Government
was at firſt built; containing the Condition upon which the King
accepted of the Royal Office, and on which the People granted
to him the Tribute of their Obedience and due Allegiance. This
Condition, (as the Lawes and Experience declare) is, that
the King ſhall exerciſe his Office of Rule over them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Laws, as hath been ſhewed, and as he and his People
ſhall from time to time agree in Common Council in Parliament,
for that end aſſembled. In reſpect hereof, the Laws ſo made, are
called the Concords or Agreements paſſed between the King and
the Subject, in the 3d part of <hi>Cooks Inſtitutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93090:51"/>
Theſe Agreements then are the Standard unto the Kings Rule
and the Peoples Obedience, ſignifying the juſtice of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and the dueneſs of their Allegiance.</p>
               <p>But the caſe ſo happening, that this Conjunction and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ought to be found between the perſonal Will of the
King, and Repreſentative Will of the Kingdom, failing, and theſe
two Wills declaring themſelves in Contrariety and Oppoſition,
both of them becoming ſtanding Powers, Co-ordinate and diſtinct
parts of the Supremacy, as the two Channels wherein the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is placed and appointed to run, as to its exerciſe, by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Conſtitution; hence ſprang the War, each aſſerting and
endeavouring to defend and maintain their own part and right,
which ought not to be kept up in diſ-junction and contrariety, but
in Unity and Agreement each with other. Theſe two Parties with
their Adherents, in this Caſe, may be according to the Law, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarients
one towards another, as the Law affords an Example, in
the Preamble to <hi>Cook's</hi> 4th Part of his Inſtitutes (not properly
Traytors) being co-ordinate Powers, parts of the Supremacy, that
are the Heads to each Party; and by conſequence have a right of
making a War, as their laſt Appeal, if they cannot otherwiſe
agree.</p>
               <p>Being once entred thus into a ſtate of War and actual Enmity,
they do as it were become two Nations, and ceaſe to be under the
Obligations they were in before, for during this ſtate of War and
Enmity, the ſtanding Laws (in a ſort) ceaſe, and a new way of
Rule each Party Forms to himſelf and his Adherents, as may beſt
conſiſt for each of their Safeties and Preſervations.</p>
               <p>Upon this Diſ-junction of the two Wills, in the Harmony and
Agreement whereof, the Supremacy is placed, theſe following
Queries do naturally ariſe;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which, or Whether of theſe by Law is the Allegiance required as
due? Is it to be yeilded to the Perſonal Will of the King ſingle, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
from the Will of the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom, or to
the Will of the People, in diſ-junction from the Will of the King? Or is
it to the Perſonal Will of the King, in conjunction with the Laws, though
in oppoſition and contrariety to the Will of the Kingdoms Repreſentative
in Parliament Aſſembled? Or is it to the Will of the Kingdomes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative,
in conjunction with the Laws, though in oppoſition to the
Perſonal Will of the King?</p>

               <p>In whoſe Judgement in this caſe are the People by Law to acquieſce,

Judge? Alſo, whether the Laws be not perfectly ſilent, as never ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch a Caſe poſſible to happen, by reaſon that the Power uſed by
the one for Diſſolving the other, never before ſuffered the Oppoſition to
riſe ſo high?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fourth Querie is,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether he, in this Caſe, that keeps his Station and place of Truſt,
wherein God and the Law did ſet him, with care to demean himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt of his Vnderſtanding, agreeably to the Law and
Cuſtomes of Parliament, and purſuant to their Votes and Directions,
(ſo long as they ſit and affirm themſelves to be a Parliament) and uſes
his beſt endeavours in the exerciſe of that publick Truſt, that no Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the general come unto the Common-wealth by the failer of
Juſtice, and the neceſſary Protection due from Government, without any
deſigning or intending the Subverſion of the Conſtitution, but onely the
ſecuring more fully the Peoples Liberties and juſt Rights, from all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Invaſions and Oppreſſions, be not ſo far from deſerving to be judged
Criminal in reſpect of any Law of God or Man, that he ought rather to
be affirmed One that hath done his Duty, even the next beſt that was
left to him, or poſſible for him to do, in ſuch a dark ſtormy ſeaſon, and
ſuch difficult Circumſtances?</p>
               <p>As to the Right of the Cauſe it ſelf, it ariſeth out of the matter of
Fact that hath happened, and by the Juſt and Wiſe Providence of
God, hath been ſuffered to ſtate it ſelf, in the Conteſt between
the Perſonal Will and declared Pleaſure of the King, on the one
Hand, and the publick Will or Vote of the People in Parliament,
on the other, declaring it ſelf either in Orders or Ordinances of
both Houſes, or in the ſingle Act of the Houſe of Commons, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf a Parliament, upon the Grounds of the Act, 17 <hi>Car.</hi>
providing againſt its diſſolution.</p>
               <p>This will appear with the more evidence and certainty, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
wherein either part had a wrong Cauſe, or did or might do
that which was not their Duty; taking the meaſure of their Duty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93090:52"/>
from what as well the King as the Peoples Repreſentative are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
unto, by the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Government,
which binds them in each of their Capacities and diſtinct Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of their Truſt, to intend and purſue the true good and welfare
of the whole Body or Community as their End. This (in effect)
is to detain the People in Obedience and Subjection to the Law of
God, and to guide them in the wayes of Righteouſneſs unto God's
well-pleaſing: and to avoid falling out or diſagreeing about the
Way or Means leading to that End.</p>
               <p>Hence that party which in his or their actings was at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
diſtance from, or oppoſition unto this end, and wilfully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily
diſagreed and divided from the other, in the Ways and
Means that were moſt likely to attain this End; they were aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Fault, and had a Wrong Cauſe to mannage, under what
ever Name of Face of Authority it was Headed and Upheld. And
ſuch a Wrong Cauſe was capable of being eſpouſed and mannaged
under the face of Authority, as might be pretended unto by either
part. For as the King (inſiſting upon his Prerogative, and the
binding force which his perſonal Will and Pleaſure ought to have,
though in diſtinction from, and oppoſition to his Parliament) might
depart from the end of Government, anſwerable to his Truſt, and
yet urge his Right to be obeyed; So the publick Will of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
exerciſed in and by the Vote of their Repreſentative in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
aſſerting it ſelf to be of a binding force alſo, and to have
the place of a Law, though in diſtinction from the King and Laws
alſo, (as ſaith the King) whatever otherwiſe by them is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
might alſo depart from the true end of Government, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their Truſt, and yet inſiſt upon their Right to be Obeyed
and ſubmitted unto; and having Power in their hands, might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely
go about alſo to compel Obedience. It is not lawful either for
King or Parliament to urge Authority and compel Obedience as
of Right in any ſuch Caſes, where (according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
the People are at Liberty, and ought to have a Freedom
from yeelding Obedience, as they are and ought to have when ever
any would compel them to diſobey God, or to do things that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
in the eye of Reaſon and common ſenſe, are to their hurt
and deſtruction. Such things Nature forbids the doing of, having
for that very purpoſe, armed Man with the defenſive Weapon of
refuſing to conſent and obey, as that Priviledge, whereby Man is
diſtinguiſhed from a Beaſt; which, when he is deprived of, he is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93090:52"/>
made a Beaſt, and brought into a ſtate of perfect Servitude and
Bondage.</p>
               <p>Such a ſtate of Servitude and Bondage may by God's juſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be inflicted upon man for ſin and the abuſe of his Liberty,
when by God reſtored. The Liberty which man was at firſt created
in, is that Priviledge and Right which is allowed to him by the Law
of Nature, of not being compelled under any pretence whatſoever
to ſin againſt God, or to go againſt the true good and welfare of
his own Being; that is to ſay, of his inward or outward man, but
in both theſe caſes, to have and to uſe his juſt Liberty, to Diſſent
and refuſe to Obey.</p>
               <p>For this every man hath that in himſelf, which by God is made
a proper and competent Judge. For, as to all ſin againſt God, and
the righteouſneſs of his Law, the Light of Conſcience, that is to
ſay the Work of the Law, in and upon the Mind or inward Senſe,
and in conjunction with it, doth lighten every one that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World, accuſing or excuſing, if it be but hearkened unto,
and kept awake. And for all ſuch actings, as tend to the ruine
and deſtruction of man, in his outward and bodily concerns,
and as he is the Object of Magiſtratical Power and Juriſdiction, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man hath a Judgement of common Senſe, or a way of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and being ſenſible thereof, common to bruit Beaſts, that take in
their Knowledge by the door of their Senſes, but is much height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and enobled in man, by the perſonal union it is taken into,
with his intellectual part, and intuitive way of diſcerning things,
through the inward reflectings of the mind, compared with the Law
of God. This inferiour Judgement in man, when it is conjoyned
with, and confirmed by the Judgement of his Superiour part, is that
which we call Rational, or the dictates of right Reaſon, that man
hath a natural right to adhere unto, as the ordinary certain Rule,
which is given him by God to walk by, and againſt which he ought
not to be compelled, or be forced to depart from it, by the meer
Will and Power of another, without better Evidence; that is, a
higher, a greater, or more certain way of diſcerning. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in Scripture is called, <hi>Man's Judgement,</hi> or <hi>Man's Day,</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
from the <hi>Lord's Judgement,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Day.</hi> And this
is that, in every individual man, which in the collective Body of
the People, and meeting of Head and Members in Parliament, is
called, <hi>The Supream Authority,</hi> and is the publick reaſon and will
of the whole Kingdon; the going againſt which, is, in Nature as
well as by the Law of Nations, an offence of the higheſt rank,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93090:53"/>
amongſt men. For it muſt be preſumed, that there is more of the
Wiſdom and Will of God in that publick Suffrage of the whole
Nation, than of any private Perſon or leſſer collective Body, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
not better quallified and principled. For Man is made in
God's Image, or in a likeneſs, in Judgement and Will, unto God
himſelf, according to the meaſure that in his nature he is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and made capable to be the receiver and bearer thereof.
Therefore it is, that the reſiſting and oppoſing either of that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Will, which is in it ſelf Supream, and the Law to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(or which bears ſo much proportion and likeneſs to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Will, as is poſſible for a Society and community of Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
together for that end, to contrive and ſet up for an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
thereof unto them) is againſt the duty of any member
of that Society, as well as it is againſt the duty of the Body of the
whole Society, to oppoſe its Judgement and Will to that of the
Supream Law-giver, their higheſt Soveraign, God himſelf.</p>
               <p>The higheſt Judgement and Will, ſet up by God, for Angels and
Men in their particular beings, to hold proportion with, and bear
conformity unto, (in the capacity of Ruled, in relation to their
chief Ruler) ſinnes forth in the perſon of Chriſt, the engrafted
Word. And when by the Agreement or common Conſent of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or State, there is ſuch a Conſtitution and Form of Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pitched upon, as in a ſtanding and ordinary way, may derive and
conveigh the neareſt and greateſt likeneſs in humane Laws, or Acts
of ſuch a Conſtitution, unto the Judgement and Will of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Legiſlator, as the Rule and declared Duty for every one in
that Society to obſerve; It is thereby, that Government, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power comes to receive Being in a Nation or State, and is
brought into exerciſe according to God's Ordinance, and Divine
Inſtitution. So then, it is not ſo much the Form of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the thing Adminiſtred, wherein the good or evil of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
doth conſiſt; that is to ſay, a greater likeneſs or unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
unto Judgement and Will of the higheſt Being, in all the Acts
or Laws, flowing from the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that common Conſent, lawfully and rightfully given
by the Body of a Nation, and intruſted with Delegates of their
own free choice, to be exerciſed by them, as their Repreſentatives,
(as well for the Welfare and good of the Body that truſts them, as
to the Honour and Well-pleaſing of God the Supream Legiſlator)
is the Principle and Means, warranted by the Law of Nature and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93090:53"/>
Nations, to give Conſtitution and Admiſſion to the exerciſe of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Supream Authority, over them and amongſt them:
Agreeable hereunto, we are to ſuppoſe, that our Anceſtors in this
Kingdom did proceed, when they conſtituted the Government
thereof, in that form of Adminiſtration, which hath been derived
to us, in the courſe and channel of our Cuſtomes and Laws; amongſt
which, the Law and Cuſtomes in and of the Parliaments, are to be
accounted as chief. For,</p>
               <p>Hereby <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Directive or Legiſlative Power (having the
Right to State and Give the Rule for the Governors Duty, and the
Subjects Obedience) is continued in our Laws, which as well the
King as People are under the Obſervation of; witneſs the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Oath, and the Oath of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Coercive or Executive Power is placed in one
Perſon, under the Name and Style of a King, to be put forth not by
his own, ſingle, perſonal Command, but by the ſignification of his
Will and Pleaſure, as the Will of the whole State, in and by his
Courts of Juſtice, and ſtated publick Counſels and Judicatures,
agreed on for that purpoſe, between him and his People, in their
Parliamentary Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>The Will of the whole State, thus ſignified, the Law it ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
before the perſonal Will of the King, in diſtinction from the
Law, and makes the one binding, the other not. So that the publick
Will of the State, (ſignified and declared by the publick Suffrage
and Vote of the People or Kingdom in Parliament Aſſembled) is
a Legal and Warrantable ground for the Subjects Obedience, in the
things commanded by it, for the good and welfare of the whole
Body, according to the beſt Underſtanding of ſuch their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Body, by it put forth, during the time of its ſitting.</p>
               <p>The Body with whom the Delegated Vote and publick Suffrage
of the whole Nation is Intruſted, being once Aſſembled, with
Power not to be Diſſolved but by their own conſent, in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
the higheſt Vote and Truſt (that can be) is exerciſed, and
this by Authority of Parliament, unto <hi>ex Officio,</hi> or by way of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
are the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> or of the People,
by the ſaid Authority, for which they are accountable if they do not
faithfully diſcharge that their duty. This Office of keeping the
Liberty, which by the Law of God and Nature is due to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
or whole Body of the People, is, by way of Truſt, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by themſelves to their own Delegates, and in effect amounts
unto this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:93090:54"/>
1. That they may of right keep out and refuſe any to exerciſe
Rule and Command over them, except God himſelf, who is the
Supream and Univerſal King and Governour; or, ſuch as ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in their Actings, to bear his Image, (which is, to be Juſt)
and ſhew for the Warrant of their Exerciſe of Soveraignty, both a
likeneſs in Judgement and Will, unto him, who is Wiſdom and
Righteouſneſs it ſelf; and the Approbation and common Conſent
of the whole Body, rationally repoſing that Truſt in them, from
what is with viſible and apparent Characters manifeſt to them, of
an aptneſs and ſufficiency in them, to give forth ſuch publick Acts
of Government, that may bear the Stamp of God's Impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them in the Judgements they do and execute; eſpecially, being
therein helped with a National Counſel of the Peoples own chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from time to time.</p>
               <p>2. They may of right, keep, hold, and reſtrain him or them, with
whom the Coercive or Executive Power is intruſted, unto a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
performance of Duty, according to the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the Oath of the Ruler, and the Laws of the Land. And if
they ſhall refuſe to be ſo held and reſtrained by the humble Deſires,
Advice and common Conſent in Parliament, and the Peoples De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates
be invaded and attempted upon by force, to deter them from
the faithful diſcharge of this their Duty; they may, in aſſerting
their Right, and in a way of their own juſt Defence, raiſe Armes,
put the iſſue upon Battel, and Appeal unto God.</p>
               <p>3. Such Appeal anſwered, and the iſſue decided by Battel, the
Peoples Delegates ſtill ſitting, and keeping together in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
Body, may of right, and according to reaſon refuſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion
or new-admiſſion of the Exerciſe of the former Rulers,
or any new Rulers again over the whole Body, till there be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Satisfaction for the former Wrongs done, the expence and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the War, and Security for the time to come, that the like
be not committed again. Until this be obtained, they are bound in
duty, in ſuch manner as they judge moſt fit, to provide for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Government of the whole Body, that the Common-weal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no detriment.</p>
               <p>4. In this which is the proper Office of the Peoples Delegates,
and concerns the keeping and defending the Liberty and Right of
the whole People and Nation, they may and ought, (during their
ſitting) to Exerciſe their own proper Power and Authority (the
Exigents of the Kingdom requiring it) although the other two
Eſtates joyntly inſtructed with them, (in the exerciſe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93090:54"/>
Authority) ſhould deſert their ſtation, or otherwiſe ſail
in the Execution of their Truſts; yea, or though many or moſt
of their own Members (ſo long as a lawful <hi>Quorum</hi> remains) ſhall
either voluntarily withdraw from them, or, for juſt cauſe become
excluded. In this diſcharge of their truſt, for the common welfare
and ſafety of the whole, their Actings (though extraordinary and
contrarient to the right of the other two) cannot be treaſonable or
criminal, (though they may be tortious, and erroneous) ſeeing
they are equals and co-ordinate, in the exerciſe of the Legiſlative
Power, and have the Right of their own proper Truſt and Office to
diſcharge and defend, though their fellow Truſtees ſhould fail in
theirs. Nor can, nor ought the People, as Adherents to their own
Delegates and Repreſentatives, to be reputed criminal, or blame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
worthy, by the Law.</p>
               <p>In the exerciſe of one and the ſame Legiſlative power (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Government of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>)
there are three diſtinct publick Votes, allowed for Aſſent
or Diſcent, in all matters coming before them; the Agreement of
which is eſſential and neceſſary to the paſſing of a Law: the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Vote of the King; the perſonal Votes of the Lords in a Houſe
or diſtinct Body; and the Delegated Vote and Suffrage of the
whole People, in their Repreſentative Body, or the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
Unto each of theſe, appertains a diſtinct Office and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
proper to them.</p>
               <p>1. The Regal Office, and the Prerogative thereof to the
King.</p>
               <p>2. The Judicial Office, to the Lords, as the higheſt Judicature
and Court of Juſtice under the King, for the exerciſing Coercive
Power, and puniſhing of Malefactors.</p>
               <p>3. The Office of the Keepers of the Liberties and Rights of the
People, as they are the whole Nation, incorporated under one
Head, by their own free and common Conſent.</p>
               <p>The Regal Office is the Fountain of all Coercive and Executive
Power, purſuant to the Rule, ſet to the ſame by Law, or, the
Agreement of the three Eſtates in Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Rule which is ſet, is that of Immutable Juſt and Right, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which, penalties are applicable, and become due, and is
firſt ſtated and aſcertained, in the declared Law of God, which is
the ſignification or making known by ſome ſign, the Will of the
Supream Legiſlator, proceeding from a perfect Judgement and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
that is without all Error or Defect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:93090:55"/>
The Will that flowes from ſuch a Judgement, is in its nature Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative,
and binding, and of right to be obeyed for its own ſake,
and the perfection it carries in it, and with it, in all its actings.
This Will is declared by Word, or Works, or both. By Word we
are to underſtand, either the immediate Breath and Spirit of
Gods mouth or mind, or the Inſpiration of the Almighty, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
by the holy Ghoſt, in and by ſome creature, as his veſſel and
inſtrument, through which the holy Scriptures of the old and new
Teſtament were compoſed. By works that declare God's Will,
we are to underſtand the whole Book of the Creature, but more
eminently and eſpecially, the particular Beings and Natures of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, who bear the name and likeneſs of God in and upon
their Judgements and their Wills; their directing Power, and their
executive Power of mind, which are eſſential to their Being, Life,
and Motion.</p>
               <p>When theſe direct and execute, in conjunction and harmony with
God's Judgement and Will, made known in his Law, they do that
which is right; and by adhering and conforming themſelves unto
this their certain and unerring Guide, do become Guides and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
unto others, and are the Objects of right choice, where Rulers
are wanting in Church or State.</p>
               <p>The Rule then to all action of Angels or Men, is that of moral
or immutable Juſt and Right, which is ſtated and declared in the
Will and Law of God. The firſt and higheſt imitation of this Rule,
is the Creature-being in the perſon of Chriſt. The next is the
Bride the Lambs Wife. The next is the innumerable Society of
the holy Angels. The next is the Company of Juſt Men, fixed in
their natural Obedience and Duty, through Faith, manifeſting it
ſelf not onely in their Spirits, but in their outward Man, redeemed
even in this World, from the body of corruption, as far as is here
attainable. The Power which is directive, and ſtates and aſcertains
the morallity of the Rule for Obedience, is in the Law of God.
But the original, whence all juſt executive Power ariſes, which is
Magiſtratical and Coercive, is from the will or free gift of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who may either keep the Power in themſelves, or give up their
Subjection into the hands and will of another, as their Leader and
Guide, if they ſhall judge that thereby they ſhall better anſwer
the end of Government, to wit, the welfare and ſafety of the whole,
then if they ſtill kept the Power in themſelves. And when they
part with it, they may do it conditionally or abſolutely; and whilſt
they keep it, they are bound to the right uſe of it. In this Liberty,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93090:55"/>
every man is created, and it is the Priviledge and juſt Right which
is granted unto Man by the Supream Law-giver, even by the Law
of Nature, under which man was made.</p>
               <p>God himſelf leaves man to the free exerciſe of this his Liberty,
when he tenders to him his ſafety and immutability, upon the well
or ill uſe of this his Liberty, allowing him the choice, either to be
his own guide and ſelf-ruler, in the ability communicated to him, to
know and execute Gods Will, and ſo to keep the Liberty he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of, in giving away his ſubjection or not; or elſe upon God's
Call and Promiſe, to give up himſelf in way of ſubjection to God,
as his Guide and Ruler, either abſolutely or conditionally. To
himſelf he expects abſolute Subjection; to all ſubordinate Rulers,
conditional.</p>
               <p>While mans Subjection is his own, and in his own keeping, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſtowed
and ungiven out of himſelf, he is not, nor cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
by way of crime or offence, againſt his Ruler and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
but may do with his own what he pleaſe; but ſtill at his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
if he uſe not this his Liberty as he ſhould, to the end for which
it is given him, which is by voluntary and entire reſignation to
become an obedient Subject unto him who is the Supream Law-giver,
and Rightful King, without poſſibility of change or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Unto this right and the lawful exerciſe and poſſeſſion of, it this
Nation did arive by the good providence and gift of God, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and aſſembling the Parliament, <hi>November</hi> 3d. 1640. and then
continuing their Seſſion by an expreſs Act, 17. <hi>Car.</hi> with power not
to be diſſolved but by their own conſent; which was not ſo much the
introducing of a new Law, as declaratory of what was Law before,
according to Man's natural Right, in which he was created, and
of which he was poſſeſſed by God, the ſoveraign giver of all
things.</p>
               <p>But the paſſing that ſaid Act of Parliament alone, was not that
which reſtored the Nation to their original Right, and juſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Liberty; but onely put them in the capacity and poſſibility of it.
That which wanted to make out to the Nation a clearneſs in having
and obtaining this their right, was the obligation they had put upon
themſelves and their poſterities to their preſent Soveraign and his
Authority, which in juſtice and by the Oathes of Allegiance they
were ſolemnly bound to, in the ſight of God as well as of Man.
And therefore, unleſs by the abuſe of that office of Truſt, (to that
degree, as on his part, to break the fundamental compact and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93090:56"/>
of Government) they could not be ſet free nor reſtored to
their original Right and firſt Liberty: eſpecially if together with
ſuch breach of Truſt, both parties appeal to God, and put it upon
the iſſue of Battel, and God give the deciſion; and in conſequence
thereof, that original Right be aſſerted, and poſſeſſion thereof had
and held for ſome years, and then not rightfully loſt, but trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly
betrayed and given up by thoſe in whom no power was
rightfully placed, to give up the ſubjection of the Nation again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any, whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Unto which is to be added, that how and when the diſſolution of
the ſaid Parliament, (according to Law) hath been made, is
yet unaſcertained, and not particularly declared: by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and by what hath been before ſhewed, the ſtate of the Caſe on
the Subjects part, is much altered, as to the matter of Right, and
the Uſurpation is now on the other hand, there being, (as is well
known) two ſorts of Uſurpers; either ſuch, as having no right
of conſent at all unto the Rule they exerciſe over the Subject; or
ſuch, who under pretence of a Right and Title, do claim not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but by conqueſt and power, or elſe hold themſelves not obliged
to the Fundamental compact and conſtitution of Government, but
gain unduely from the Subject, (by advantages taken through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and violence) that which is not their own by Law.</p>
               <p>For a rational Man to give up his Reaſon and Will unto the
Judgement and Will of another, (without which, no outward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive
Power can be) whoſe Judgement and Will is not perfectly
and unchangeably good and right, is unwiſe, and unſafe, and by the
Law of Nature, forbidden. And therefore all ſuch gift, made by
rational men, muſt be conditional, either implied, or explicite, to
be followers of their Rulers, ſo far as they are followers of that good
and right, which is contained in the Law of the Supream Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
and no further; reſerving to themſelves, (in caſe of ſuch
defection and declining of the Rulers actings from the Rule) their
primitive and original Freedom, to reſort unto, that ſo they may
in ſuch caſe, be as they were before they gave away their ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto the Will of another; and reſerving alſo the power to have
this judged by a meet and competent Judge, which is the Reaſon of
the King and Kingdom, declared by their Repreſentatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
that is to ſay, the Delegates of the People in the Houſe
of Commons aſſembled, and the Commiſſioners on the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
by his own Letters Patents, in the Houſe of Peers; which two
concurring do very far bind the King, if not wholly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:93090:56"/>
And when theſe cannot agree, but break one from another, the
Commons in Parliament aſſembled, are <hi>ex Officio,</hi> the Keepers
of the Liberties of the Nation, and righteous Poſſeſſors and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors
of it, againſt all Uſurpers and Uſurpations whatſoever, by

happens in this viſible World, but is either commanded or
permitted from the inviſible and unintelligible Court and Pallace

and permitted a ſubordinate external Government over Men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
by man, for the upholding of Juſtice in humane Societies,
and for the peace, welfare, and ſafety of men that are made in Gods

out of his own hands, but that in caſes of eminent injuſtice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
(committed in Provinces, States and Kingdomes, contrary

               <p>Such a ſeaſonable and ſignal appearance of God, for the Succor

(when they have no might, viſible Power, or armed Force, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the great company and multitude that comes againſt

theirs, as the Lord's: and the frame of their heart will be humble
before the Lord, believing in the Lord, and believing his Prophets,
for their good ſucceſs and eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>This Diſpenſation is very lively deſcribed under the Type, and
by the Name of <hi>The Valley of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> as to the Seaſon and Place

a far greater and more ſignal appearance of God for their Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

his Mighty Ones to come down from Heaven, to put in their ſickle

               <p>All theſe conſiderations of Church and State, put together, afford
great ground of enquiry, as to the Condition of the times in which
we live, how far the face which they bear, (and which God hath put
upon them, in the courſe of his Providences, for ſome years now
paſt) doth ſpeak or ſignifie the near approach of any ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and ſignal appearance or day of Gods Judgement, for the
Deciſion of his own or his Peoples quarrel and controverſie with
the prophane Heathen that are round about them, waiting for an
advantage, utterly and univerſally to remove and root them out
from off the face of the whole earth?</p>
               <p>That which hath been acted upon the Theater of theſe Nations,
amongſt us, in the true ſtate of our Controverſie, ſeems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to this following Querie;</p>
               <p>Whether the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in
Parliament aſſembled, and in their Supream Power and Truſt made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolvable,
unleſs by their own Conſent and free Vote, and this by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and expreſs Statute, have not had a juſt and righteous Cauſe? A
Quarrel more God's, than their own?</p>
               <p>1. It may appear they had; <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the Ground of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
the War; Was it not in their own and the Kingdoms juſt
and neceſſary defence, and for the maintaining of the publick
Rights and Liberties of both?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Was it not undertaken upon mutual Appeals of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93090:58"/>
both Parties to God, deſiring him to judge between them, to give
the Deciſion and Iſſue by the Law of War, (when no other Law
could be heard) as the definitive Sentence in this Controverſie,
from the Court of Heaven?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Purſuant to ſuch Deciſion, did they not recover and
repoſſeſs the Kingdoms original and primitive freedom? Did they
not endeavour to conſerve and ſecure it, as due to them by the Law
of God and of Nature? For man was made in God's Image, and
all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity are properly one Univerſal Kingdom on earth,
under the Rule and Government of the Son of God, both as Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>By virtue of this original and primitive Freedom ſo recovered,
they were at their own choice, whether to remain in, and retain
this their true freedom (unreſigned and unſubjected to the Will of
any Man) under the Rule of the Son of God and his Lawes, or elſe
to ſet up a King or any other Form of Government over them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of other Nations. In this latter caſe, it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that when a Common-wealth or People, do chooſe their
firſt King, upon condition to obey him and his Succeſſors, Ruling
juſtly; they ought to remain ſubject to him, according to the Law,
and tenor of the Fundamental Compact with him, on whom they
have transferred their Authority. No Juriſdiction remaineth in
them (after that free and voluntary Act of theirs) either to Judge
the Realm, or determine who is the true Succeſſor, otherwiſe than
is by them reſerved and ſtipulated, by their Fundamental Laws
and Conſtitutions of Government.</p>
               <p>And though the righteouſneſs of this Cauſe (contained in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
particulars) be ſuch, as carries in it its own evidence;
yet, as (as things have fallen out) it is come to be oppreſſed and
buried in the grave of Malefactors; in the room of which, a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Judgement and Way, is viſibly owned, upheld, and intended to
be proſecuted to the utmoſt, for its own faſt-rooting and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and this, by the common Conſent and Aſſociation of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.
What then remaines for the recovery and reſtitution of
that good old Cauſe and Way, but ſuch a ſeaſonable and ſignal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God, (as aforeſaid) in the Valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat?</hi> What
but the taking things immediately into his own hands, for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Judgement, and giving the laſt and final deciſion? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
ſince what was foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> is remarkably accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongſt us, to wit, that the viſible Power of Gods People ſhould
be broken and ſcattered, ſo as that they ſhould have no might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93090:58"/>
in and with them, to go againſt the Multitudes, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and reſolve their Ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is not any remedy left to them, wherein they may expect
ſucceſs, but from ſuch a ſignal day of the Lord's immediate appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in Judgement on their behalf.</hi> For their ſakes therefore, O
Lord, return thou on high, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. 7.) take thy Throne of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
over men, from which thou haſt ſeemed to have departed, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
that righteous Judgement, which thou haſt ſeemed for a ſeaſon to have
ſuſpended, upon wiſe and holy ends beſt known to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a dark and gloomy day, thoſe that truely fear the Lord,
are directed and required by him, not to fear or be diſmayed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he will be with them. They are encouraged in the way of
Faith onely, to expect this deliverance; even to <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no need to fight in this Battel, but onely <hi>to ſee the Salvation of
the Lord,</hi> through believing.</p>
               <p>ANtient Foundations, when once become deſtructive to thoſe
very ends for which they were firſt ordained, and prove hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances,
to the good and enjoyment of humane Societies, to the
true Worſhip of God, and the Safety of the People, are for their
ſakes, and upon the ſame Reaſons to be altered, for which they
were firſt laid. In the way of God's Juſtice they may be ſhaken
and removed, in order to accompliſh the Counſels of his Will, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch a State, Nation, or Kingdom, in order to his introducing a
righteous Government, of his own framing.</p>
               <p>This may have been the cauſe of our Wandrings as it were in a
Wilderneſs, and of God's bringing us back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> after
our near approach to the Land of Reſt; that we have no better
known, and had no more care to proſecute, what he principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in and by all our Changes and Removes, in the courſe of
his Providence. Yea we have added this alſo, to the reſt of our ſins,
that we have improved the Gifts and Deliverances that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon us, another way, and to another end than was by him
intended, as well as Providentially intimated, by that holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of his, in the Deciſion, declared at the Trial in his Martial
Court, with points of Swords.</p>
               <p>Here the great Controverſie that had been depending many Ages
between Rulers and the Ruled, (as to the Claimes of the one in
point of Prerogative; and of the other in their Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93090:59"/>
Freedoms) was after many heats &amp; colds, many skirmiſhings
and battels, at laſt decided by the Sword. This is a way of Tryal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the known common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and the Law in force
throughout all Nations. By this, the Verdict is given forth from a
Court of ſuch a Nature, as from whence there is no further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;
Eſpecially ſince after the Tryal paſt, quiet poſſeſion was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Conquerors, and continued ſome years. Upon this,
Reaſon and Gratitude to God, obliged us to ſuch a proſecution
as might anſwer the true end of Government; and in eſpecial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner, as might be moſt to God's well-pleaſing.</p>
               <p>The Powerful Being which by ſucceſs of Armes, as given to the
Peoples Repreſentative Body in Parliament, did communicate to
it eſſentiallity, according to the nature of that Being, for which it
was ordained. For that Being, with Power of continuing together
at their own pleaſure, were as the Soul and Body, unſeperated, and
they might have performed things neceſſary at preſent, for the
ſafety and preſervation of the Body they repreſented. They might
have been a good help to ſettle righteous Government, in a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
moſt acceptable to God, and beneficial to the Governed, on
the Foundation of God's Inſtitution, and the Peoples Ordination,
in conſent together, laid by the Power of God and the Peoples own
Swords, in the hands of their faithful Truſtees.</p>
               <p>It would imply a high contempt of God and his Diſpenſations,
ſo ſignal amongſt us, to communicate the benefit of them to his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers.
The right of chooſing and being choſen into places of Truſt
in the Government, was returned by the Law of the Sword (which
is paramount to all humane Laws) into its primitive exerciſe,
which is warranted by the Law of God and of Nature. By that Law
the moſt famous Monarchies of the World in all Ages were firſt
conſtituted and ſetled; and by it God decided our Cauſe, looking
for an event and fruit anſwerable to the benefit by him given; even
ſuch a Government, as God would have given us the Pattern of
(had we ſought it, as was our duty) whereby Juſtice and Mercy
ſhould have been daily adminiſtred according to his will, to the
bringing on the <hi>new Heavens and new Earth, wherein Righteouſneſs
might dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Veſſel of this Common-wealth now weather-heaten and
torn, ſeems to be more in danger, than that wherein <hi>Jonah</hi> would
have ſled to <hi>Tarſus:</hi> For though we have caſt forth a great part of
our goods to ſecure it, this has done us but ſmall good. That Ship
had but one Delinquint aboard, which occaſioned the Storm; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93090:59"/>
his being thrown into the Sea, brought immediate ſafety. They had
alſo many skilful Seamen to guide it, but all our Pilots are caſt
over-board, and none left in appearance, but guilty Paſſengers.
Nay, admit with <hi>Jonah,</hi> both the Common-wealth and Cauſe be
brought into moſt deſperate Exigents and Extreamities, from
whence there is no more appearing redemption for them, then ſuch
as they have, that go down quick into the grave and belly of the
Whale; yet they may be preſerved, even by that which naturally
of it ſelf is irrecoverably deſtructive to them, and be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in ſervice by him againſt whom they have been ſo ungratefully
rebellious after former great deliverances. So infinite are God's
Mercies, yea, ſo exceeding Merciful are the ſevereſt of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Diſpenſations towards his People.</p>
               <p>Thus may both People and Army be deprived of their Power,
and another party let in to plague and root out from amongſt us,
ſuch as are more wicked than themſelves, and ſo make room for a
more righteous Generation, which will begin all things anew.</p>
               <p>By the courſe of things acted amongſt us, God's ſentence on our
behalf is made void, and that ſeems given away for ever, which
was recovered by the Sword. Our troubles are onely prorogued.
No Faith or Contract is thought meet to be kept with Rebels
and Hereticks, when by acquired Power it may be broken. 'Twas
the great ſolly and ſelf-flattery of ſome, to think it would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
It is moſt certainly true, that no Time or Preſcription, is a
juſt Bar to God's and the Peoples Right.</p>
               <p>To murmure againſt God's Verdict, and reſiſt his Doom, ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
given and executed amongſt us, in the ſight and concurring
acknowledgement of the Nations round about, is to become adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
to God, and to betray our Countrey. If God then do think
fit to permit ſuch a diſpenſation to paſs upon us, it is for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our ſins, and for a plague to thoſe that are the Actors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
to bring more ſwift exemplary vengeance upon them. Such as
have diſcharged a good Conſcience in what may moſt offend the
higher Powers, are not to fear, though they be admitted to the
exerciſe of their Rule, with an unreſtrained Power, and revengeful
mind.</p>
               <p>Though from that Mountain, the Storm that comes, will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
terrible, yet ſome are ſafeſt in Storms, as experience ſhews. Yea
beſt therein by Gods Mercies, when their greateſt enemies think
moſt irrecoverably to undo them.</p>
               <p>Our late Condition held much reſemblance with that of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93090:60"/>
                  <hi>Jewes,</hi> and we deſerve as well to be rejected as they were. If
Chriſt were in the fleſh amongſt us, as he was with them, we are as
likely to prefer theeves and murtherers before him, and crucifie
him.</p>
               <p>The preſent neceſſity in a righteous Cauſe is to be ſubmitted to,
and we are not to be diſcouraged by the danger, which to ſome
ſeems threatned us, from former or preſent Laws. For no man that
acts for common ſafety, when the Sword hath abſolute power, and
ſhall alſo command it, can juſtly be queſtioned afterwards for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to ſome former Laws, which could be binding no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then whilſt the Civil Sword had Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>What People under Heaven have had more Experiments of God's
timely aſſiſtance in all their Extreamities, then <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> as well
with reſpect to times paſt, as within our remembrance? Are the
like Mercies recorded of any Nation? In their times of greateſt
Confuſion they were preſerved. They were a living active Body
without a Head: A Buſh burning in the Flames of a Civil War,
yet not conſumed: A People when without a Government, not
embrued in one anothers Blood. A wonder to all Neighbours round
about, and many ſignal Changes brought about without Blood,
which indubitably evidences that God is in the Buſh: and would
gather us together as Chickens under a Hen, to be brooded by him,
if we were not moſt ſtubbornly hardened.</p>
               <p>Our ſins have been the cauſe, that our Counſels, our Forces, our
Wit, our Conqueſts, and our Selves have been deſtructive to our
ſelves, to each other, and to a happy advancement towards our
long expected and deſired Settlement. Until theſe ſins of ours be
repented truly and throughly, all the Wiſdom and Power upon
Earth ſhall not avail us, but every day, every attempt, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
our Troubles, until there be a final extirpation of all that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
God's Work; When this once is, nothing ſhall harm us, God
being a ſure refuge againſt all evils, if we reconcile our ſelves to
him by Faith and Repentance. Then, even thoſe things that are
moſt miſchievous in their own natures, ſhall be made our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>The Peoples Cauſe whom God after trial hath declared free, is a
righteous one, though not ſo prudently and righteouſly managed
as it might and ought to have been. God's doom therefore is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
executed upon us, with what intent and jugglings ſoever it was
proſecuted by men.</p>
               <p>Man's corruption makes him more firmly to adhere to that which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93090:60"/>
is good: in which caſe, it is not many times, Virtue ſo much as
Neceſſity that keeps men Conſtant; having no other means of
ſafety and ſubſiſtance for the moſt part.</p>
               <p>The goodneſs of any Cauſe is not meerly to be judged by the
Events, whether viſibly proſperous or unproſperous, but by the
righteouſneſs of its Principles: nor is our Faith and Patience to
fail under the many fears, doubts, wants, troubles, and Power of
Adverſaries, in the paſſage to the recovery of our long loſt Freedom.
For it is the ſame Cauſe with that of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, of which
we ought not to be aſhamed or diſtruſtful.</p>
               <p>How hath it fared with the Cauſe of Chriſt generally, for more
now than 1600 years, being made the common object of ſcorn and
perſecution, not from the baſe and fooliſh onely, but from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
and wiſeſt perſons in the Worlds eſteem! Yet, though our
Sufferings and the time of our warfare ſeems long, it is very ſhort,
conſidering the perpetuity of the Kingdom which at laſt we ſhal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
&amp; wherein we ſhal individually reign with the chief Soveraign
thereof. For whereas all the Kingdoms of the World have not yet
laſted 6000 years, this is everlaſting and without end. They that
overcome by not loving their lives unto the death, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 11.)
ſhall be Pillars in the Houſe of this everlaſting Kingdom, never to
be removed. They ſhall be Kings and Prieſts to God, ſitting with
him upon his Throne, ſubjecting the Nations, and reigning with
him for ever and ever. This is a Kingdom that conſiſts with the
Divinity of Chriſt, and humanity of men. Such a reign of Chriſt
upon earth, as will not be without Laws agreeable to humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor without Magiſtrates appointed as Officers under him; in
which Election, God and the People ſhall have a joint concurrence.
God's Throne in mens Conſciences muſt then be reſigned, and his
People permitted to enjoy the Liberties, due to them by the Laws
of Grace and Nature. Into this, God's own immediate hand can
now onely lead us, by his own coming to Judgement in the Valley
of <hi>Jehoſhaphat.</hi>

               <head>Meditations concerning Man's Life, &amp;c. Penned by this Sufferer
in his Priſon State.</head>
               <p>IT is a principal part of Wiſdom to know how to eſteem Life; to
hold and preſerve, to looſe or give it up. There is ſcarce any
thing man more fails in than this. They that think nothing dearer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93090:61"/>
than Life, eſteem Life for it ſelf, live not but to live. Others think
the ſhorteſt Life beſt, either not to be born at all or elſe to die quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Theſe are two extreams. That comes nearer Truth, a Wiſe Man
ſaid, Life is ſuch a good, that if a man knew what he did in it, he
would not accept, at leaſt not deſire it. <hi>Vitam nemo cuperet, ſi daretur
tantum ſcientibus.</hi> Wiſe Men, in living, make a Virtue of Neceſſity,
live as long as they ſhould, not as long as they can.</p>
               <p>There is a time to Live and a time to die. A good Death is far
better and more elegible than an ill Life. A wiſe man Lives but ſo
long as his Life is more worth than his Death. The longer Life is
not alwayes the better. To what end ſerves a long Life? Simply
to live, breath, eat, drink, and ſee this World? What needs ſo
long a time for all this? Me thinks we ſhould ſoon be tired with the
daily repetition of theſe and the like Vanities? Would we live
long, to gain knowledge, experience, and Virtue? This ſeems an
honeſt Deſign, but is better to be had other wayes by good men,
when their Bodies are in the grave.</p>
               <p>None uſually imploy their time ſo ill in this World, as Men.
<hi>Non inopes ſumus vitae, ſed prodigi.</hi> Some begin to live when they
ſhould die. Some have ended before they begin. 'Tis incident to
folly to be alwayes but beginning to Live. Life is but a ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſtate, a perpetual iſſue of Errors. 'Tis a Web of unhappy
Adventures; A purſuit of divers Miſeries enchained together on all
ſides. <hi>Solum id certum, nil eſſe certi: Nec miſerius quicquam homine
nec ſuperbius.</hi> Vanity is the moſt eſſential and proper quality of
Man's firſt Nature. The World is not worth that Labour and Pains
Man exerciſes in and about it; which cauſed that ſaying; A wiſe
man ſhould do nothing but for himſelf. Tis not reaſon wiſe men
ſhould put themſelves in danger for Fooles, much leſs for
Knaves.</p>
               <p>The Will onely is truly Mans own, and the conſiderable part of
the reaſonable Soul. On it depend the iſſues of Good or Evil, Life
or Death. All the reſt of a Man, his Underſtanding, Memory, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
may be taken from him, altered, troubled by a thouſand
accidents. But the Will is ſo much in our own power, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be taken away, though its action may be hindred. 'Tis our own,
till we knowingly and freely give it away, which may be. And he
that hath once abſolutely given up his Will to another, is no more
his own man. He hath left himſelf nothing of his own. Tis by the
Will we are good or evil, happy or unhappy.</p>

               <p>He that gives up his Will to the Rule and Government of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becomes ſubject to that other. Men that are born equal, come
to be made ſubject two wayes; either, by the free giving up of
themſelves to others, or by others violent aſſuming and exerciſing
power over them, becauſe they are ſtrangers, as <hi>Nimrod</hi> the mighty
hunter of men, ſerved his fellow mortals.</p>
               <p>Government is either Royal, or Seignioral and Tyrannical, as the
<hi>Turks.</hi> 'Tis then properly Royal, be it adminiſtred by one, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or by all their Repreſentatives, when he or they that have Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power, obey the Laws of Nature, preſerve the natural Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and propriety of the Goods and Perſons of the Subjects, which
no reaſonable men, acted by ſound judgement, will ever abſolutely
give away, but ſecure their right in, and power over, by fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Contracts and Agreements with their Governors.</p>
               <p>Abſolute Soveraignty is a perpetual power over all, without any
reſtraint, limitations or conditions put upon the Soveraign. This
conſiſts in a power of giving Laws to all in general, and to every
one in particular, without the conſent or gift of any others, and
requiring univerſal and undiſpenſable obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
under juſt penalties. This Soveraignty is proper onely to
the higheſt Being, not at all to Creatures, though where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is Deſpotical and Seignioral, it is aſſumed and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
               <p>But Government Royal, is that which is conſonant to the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Laws of Nature and Dictates of right Reaſon, which require
a conſervation of the Subjects Liberty, and Propriety in their
goods and perſons, as well as the preſervation and upholding of
Empire and Authority in the Prince, and find out the Medium,
through the mutual Agreements of Soveraign and Subjects, for both
to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>In Quarrels between Subjects and Soveraigns, about the Subjects
Liberty and the Kings Prerogative, 'tis ſeldom ſeen, but the Error
lies on the Soveraign's part, who is apt to be flattered into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
exerciſe of ſuch an abſolute Soveraignty and Legiſlative
Dominion over them, as becomes no creature, and exceeds all the
bounds of that Contract he made with them, at his Inauguration.</p>
               <p>All juſt Power and Authority is from God, and by virtue of his
Ordinance and Inſtitution. <hi>He therefore that reſiſteth the Power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93090:62"/>
the Ordinance of God.</hi> But all contrarient actings againſt the
Prince, are not to be accounted a reſiſting of the Power; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when the whole State is concerned, and the buſineſs is managed
by publick Truſtees, called and authorized by Law, as Conſervers
of the State, and Defenders of the publick Liberties and Lawes
thereof. In ſuch a publick capacity, to ſtand in the gap, when a
Breach is made, and hinder any charge or attempt that would rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the State, is Duty. In ſuch caſe, they ought to withſtand and
hinder the violent proceedings of any, either by way of Juſtice in
a Legal tryal, or by force. For the Prince is not Maſter of the State,
but onely a Guardian and Defender thereof, from injuries and evil.
Yet theſe affaires, for redreſs of Grievances, in caſe of Princes
failers, belong not to all, but to the Tutors and Maintainers of the
State, or thoſe that are intereſted therein; as Electors in Elective
States, and in Hereditary States, the States General and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Body of the Kingdom, according to the tenor of their funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws. In this caſe it is generally acknowledged lawful, to
reſiſt a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Under the croſs Accidents, iſſuing from ſuch Conteſts, to which
man is ſubject through others arbitrary Domination, he may carry
himſelf well, two wayes.</p>
               <p>1. By a ſtrong and vigorous reſiſtance thereof, to the laſt, for
diverting or blunting the point of it, ſo as either to eſcape or
force it.</p>
               <p>2. The other way, and that perhaps the ſureſt, is to take and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
theſe Accidents at the worſt, let them prove what they will,
though to the loſs of Life and all that's dear to him in this World.
To reſolve within himſelf to bear them ſweetly and patiently, and
peaceably to attend whatever ſhall happen, without tormenting
himſelf about it, or looſing the calmneſs and ſerenity of his mind
in going about to hinder or prevent it. He that takes the firſt courſe,
labours to eſcape; he that takes the latter is content rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
This many times proves the better bargain. 'Tis poſſible to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
greater inconveniency and loſs in pleading and contending,
than in looſing, or in flying for ſafety, than in ſuffering.</p>

worthy revenge, to ſlight the worſt they can do, whereby we take

muſt in ſuffering Injuries, have reſpect to our ſelves and to him

               <p>It is a weakneſs of mind not to know how to contemn an offence.
An honeſt man is not ſubject to Injury. He is inviolable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.
Inviolable, not ſo much that he cannot be beaten; but,
that being beaten, he doth neither receive wound nor hurt. We can
receive no evil but of our ſelves. We may therefore always ſay

               <p>The day of Death is the Judge of all our other dayes; the very

               <p>The knowledge of Dying, is the knowledge of Liberty, the ſtate

               <p>Death is not to be feared and fled from, as it is by moſt, but

not die, I doubt I may ſpeak against my ſelf, to my loſs and hindrance,
who may find more good in death than yet I know. Thoſe things I know
to be evil, as unrighteouſneſs and ſin, I fly and avoid; thoſe that I know
not to be ſo, as Death, &amp;c. I cannot fear, and therefore I leave it to you
to determine for me, whether it is more expedient for me to Dye or to
Live.</p>
               <p>He can never live contentedly that fears to dye. That man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a free man who feareth not Death, Life it ſelf being but ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
if it were not made free by Death. It is uncertain in what
place Death attends us, therefore let us expect it in all places, and
be alwayes ready to receive it. Great virtue, and great or long Life
do ſeldom meet together. Life is meaſured by the end, if that be
good, all the reſt will have a proportion to it. The quantity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as to the making it more or leſs happy.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of a good man, when he ceaſes to live in the Body,
goes into a better ſtate of Life, than that which he exerciſes in this
World; and when once in that, were it poſſible to reſume this, he
would refuſe it. Yea were a man capable to know what this Life
here is, before he receives it, he would ſcarce ever have accepted
it at firſt. The ſelf ſame journey men have taken, from no being to
being, and from pre-exiſtent being, into mortal Life, without fear
or paſſion, they may take again from that Life by Death, into a Life
that hath immortality in it.</p>
               <p>Death is the inevitable Law, God and Nature have put upon us.
Things certain, ſhould not be feared, but expected. Things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
onely are to be feared. Death in ſtead of taking away any thing
from us, gives us all, even the perfection of our natures; ſets us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
both from our own bodily deſires, &amp; others domination; makes
the Servant free from his Maſter. It doth not bring us into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but takes darkneſs out of us, us out of darkneſs, and puts us
into marvellous light. Nothing periſhes or is diſſolved by Death,
but the Vail and Covering, which is wont to be done away from all
ripe fruit. It brings us out of a dark dungeon, through the crannies
whereof, our ſight of Light is but weak and ſmall, and brings us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an open Liberty, an eſtate of Light and Life, unvailed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93090:64"/>
It takes us out of that mortality which began in the womb
of our Mother, and now endeth, to bring us into that Life which
ſhall never end. This day which thou feareſt as thy laſt, is thy
Birth day into Eternity.</p>
               <p>Death holds a high place in the policy and great common-wealth
of the World. It is very profitable for the ſucceſſion and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the works of Nature.</p>
               <p>The fading corruption, and loſs of this life, is the paſſage into a
better. Death is no leſs eſſential to us, than to live or to be born.
In flying Death thou flyeſt thy ſelf, thy eſſence is equally parted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theſe two, Life and Death. It is the condition and Law of thy
Creation. Men are not ſent into the World by God, but with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to go forth again; which he that is not willing to do, ſhould
not come in.</p>
               <p>The firſt day of thy birth, bindeth thee and ſets thee in the way as
well to Death as to Life. To be unwilling therefore to die, is to be
unwilling to be a Man, ſince to be a Man is to be Mortal. It being
therefore ſo ſerviceable to Nature and the inſtitution of it, why
ſhould it be feared or ſhunned? Beſides, it is neceſſary and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
we muſt do our beſt endeavour in things that are not Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs,
but ought to grow reſolute in things paſt Remedy.</p>
               <p>It is moſt juſt, reaſonable, and deſirable, to arive at that place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which we are alwayes walking. Why feareſt thou to go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the World goes? It is the part of a valiant and generous
Mind, to prefer ſome things before Life, as things, for which a man
ſhould not doubt nor fear to die. In ſuch a caſe, however matters
go, a man muſt more account thereof than of his Life. He muſt
run his race with reſolution, that he may perform things profitable
and exemplary.</p>
               <p>The contempt of Death, is that which produceth the boldeſt and
moſt honourable exploits. He that fears not to die, fears nothing.
From hence have proceeded the commendable Reſolutions and
free Speeches of Vertue, uttered by men, of whom the world hath
not been worthy.</p>
               <p>A gallant <hi>Romane,</hi> commanded by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> not to come to the
Senate, anſwered, <hi>He was a Senator, therefore ſit to be at the Senate;
and being there, if required to give his advice, he would do it as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
commanded him.</hi> Hereupon being threatned by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
he replyed, <hi>Did I ever tell you, that I was immortal? Do you
what you will, and I will do what I ought. It is in your power to put me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
to death; and in mine to die conſtantly.</hi> What hard dealing cannot
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93090:64"/>
he ſuffer, that fears not to die? Other deſignments may be hindred
by our enemies, but they cannot hinder us from dying. The means
whereby to live free, is to contemn Death. It is no great thing to
live, ſlaves and beaſts can do that, but it is a great matter to live
freely, and die honeſtly, wiſely, conſtantly. <hi>Emori nolo</hi> (ſaith one)
<hi>ſed me eſſe mortuum, nihil eſtimo;</hi> I would not die, but to be dead, I
look upon as nothing. But no man can be ſaid reſolute to die, that
is afraid to confront it, and ſuffer with his eyes open, as <hi>Socrates</hi>
did, without paſſion or alteration.</p>
               <p>In a miſerable eſtate of a Life, which a man cannot remedy, Death
is lawfully deſirable, as our beſt retreat and onely haven from the
ſtorms of this Life; and as the Soveraign good of nature, the onely
ſtay and pillar of Liberty. It is a good time to die, when to live is
rather a burthen than a bleſſing, and there is more ill in Life than
good.</p>
               <p>There are many things in Life, far worſe than Death, in reſpect
whereof we ſhould rather die than live. The more voluntary our
Death is, the more honourable. Life may be taken away from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man by every man, but not Death.</p>
               <p>It is no ſmal reproach to a Chriſtian, whoſe faith is in immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and the bleſſedneſs of another Life, to fear Death much, which
is the neceſſary paſſage thereunto. He ought rather to deſire and
thirſt after death, as great gain; <hi>Vitam habere in patientiâ, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
in deſiderio;</hi> to endure Life, and deſire Death. But it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
conſtancy, well to uſe the chain wherewith we are bound, than
to break it. A man is not to abandon his charge in Life, without
the expreſs command of him that gave it him. <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
being pardoned by <hi>Nero,</hi> choſe Death, rather than to Live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe terms. <hi>Nerva</hi> a great Lawyer, <hi>Cato</hi> of <hi>Urica,</hi> and others,
died, as not able to bear the ſight of the Weal-publick in that bad
and declining ſtate, into which by Gods Providence it was brought,
in their times, but they ſhould have conſidered,</p>

               <p>A man ought to carry himſelf blamleſly and with a ſteddy cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in his place and calling, againſt his aſſailants, and conſider
that it is better to continue firme and conſtant to the end, then
fearfully to fly or dye. It is not a leſs evil to quit the place and
fly, than obſtinately to be taken and periſh. It is a great point of
wiſdom to know the right hour and fit ſeaſon to Die. Many men
have ſurvived their own Glory. That is the beſt Death which is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93090:65"/>
well recollected in it ſelf, quiet, ſolitary, and attendeth wholly to
what at that time is fitteſt.</p>
               <p>But let us more particularly, and upon truly and purely Chriſtian
Principles, weigh and conſider Death.</p>
               <p>They that live by Faith, die daily. The Life which Faith teaches,
works Death. It leads up the mind to things not ſeen, which are
eternal, and takes it off with its affections and deſires, from things
ſeen, which are temporary. It acquaints the ſoul experimentally
with that heavenly way of converſe and intercourſe, which is not
expreſſed by ſenſible ſignes, but by the demonſtration proper to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whether angels, ſouls ſeparate, or ſouls yet in the body, as they
live by faith, not by ſenſe. In which reſpect, the uſe of voice and
mouth is attributed to God, to Chriſt, to Angels, who have that
with them and in them, whereby they outwardly manifeſt what they
inwardly conceive, although they expreſs not the inward word of
their mental conception, by any outward voice, hand, eye, or other
external ſign, but by the way of its own ſelf evidencing brightneſs,
and eſſential demonſtration. Such a way of living and ſhining forth
in man's naked eſſential beams, he then arrives unto, when the
thick vail and wall of his fleſh is diſſolved, and his earthly taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
put off.</p>
               <p>The knowledge, ſight, and experience of ſuch a kind of ſubſiſting
and heavenly manner of Life, that man is capable of, is the beſt
preparative, and moſt powerful motive, to leave the body, and
ſurceaſe the uſe of our earthly organs. This in effect is all that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
death, rightly known and underſtood, doth impart; a lawful
ſurceaſing the uſe and exerciſe of our earthly organs, and our willing
and chearful reſorting to the uſe and exerciſe of that Life without
the Body, which man is capable to ſubſiſt in, when made perfect
in ſpirit, an equal and aſſociate with angels, under the power and
order of expreſſing what he inwardly conceives, as they do. This
made <hi>Paul</hi> look upon Life in the Body, and Life out of it, with no
indifferent eye, but as accounting the being at home in the body,
an abſence from the Lord; and ſuch a kind of abſence from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as death cauſes, to be that which makes us moſt preſent with the
Lord: which therefore we ſhould be moſt willing unto, and with
greateſt longing after, deſire. The ſtrait which the Apoſtle found
himſelf in, was not at all from the leaſt haeſitation in his mind,
which of the two, was in it ſelf beſt and to be preferred, but by
which Chriſt might moſt be magnified, and the Church benefitted,
according to the will of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:93090:65"/>
So then unleſs to live were Chriſt, and a real and clear magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt in his Body, he cared not for Life, but contemned
Death. He ſaw evidently how it was his own particular loſs and
hindrance, even, not to Die, ſince to be diſſolved, to depart and be
with Chriſt, and in the Society of the bleſſed Angels and Saints in
Heaven, was beſt of all, and far more gainful and to be valued by
him, than any longer continuance or abode in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The magnifying of Chriſt in his Body, whether by Life or by
Death, was the Conſideration with <hi>Paul,</hi> that held the ballance,
caſt the ſcale, and that onely. So it ought to be with every true
Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The end of man's coming into the Body, and his temporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and abode there, according to the Law of his Creation,
is the magnifying and glorifying Chriſt, either by his Life or by his
Death, or both, the one of which if he do not, it muſt needs be his
ſin, and he is left without excuſe. For none can violate or corrupt
the mind of man, by the Law of Nature, nor let in Death upon his
Spiritual Subſtance, but himſelf, though they diſſolve his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
abode in the fleſh, break his outward caſe and ſhel; and rather
than do the one, we ſhould chooſe the other, chooſe affliction rather
than ſin, the diſſolution of the Body, rather than the corrupting of
the Mind. In ſo doing and dying, Chriſt is magnifyed. Thus <hi>Peter</hi>
was foretold, <hi>by what Death he ſhould glorify God. And to ſuch it is
given by Chriſt, not onely to Believe, but Suffer and Die for his Names
ſake,</hi> as a tranſcendent priviledge and honour.</p>
               <p>If no reſtraint then be upon our mind from without, what hinders
that Chriſt is not magnified in our Body, but ſomething within us;
in our judgement, will, and affections, that are not right ſet and
fixed, nor as yet wrought to this ſelf ſame thing by God, who hath
<hi>given us the earneſt of his Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be demanded, What is it, in which this great duty of
man lies, as to the magnifying of Chriſt in his Body by his Life, or
living in the Body, which is a more difficult thing to do than to
Die? Chriſt himſelf tells us, when he ſaith, <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine
before men, that they may ſee,</hi> feel, and ſenſibly diſcern, <hi>your good
works; and ſo, glorify your father which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of ſigns we read of, in thoſe that believe,
which juſtifie their Faith, in conſortſhip (as it were) with which
their Faith works and is made perfect, ſo as <hi>the work of Faith is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in them with power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Signs Extraordinary, as <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 18. with which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93090:66"/>
Chriſtians were well acquainted, and ſo may all ſuch again,
as arrive to any competent maturity in that primitive Chriſtian
Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Signes Ordinary, as thoſe mentioned,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. <hi>called,</hi>
the fruits of the Spirit in us, <hi>that makes us</hi> mighty in word and in deed,
not onely to will but to perform that which is good; by being filled with
the Spirit in our very Bodies, made the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, rich in
Faith and <hi>Tuch</hi> good Works, <hi>as are the fruit of Faith,</hi> without which,
Faith it ſelf is dead <hi>and unprofitable; and by which,</hi> Abraham juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Faith, and was called, the Friend of God.</p>
               <p>It is in this ſenſe, the Prophet urges the ſanctification of our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
when he ſaith, <hi>Be ye clean that bear the Veſſels of the Lord.</hi> And
the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 19. What! know ye not that
your Body is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> unto which Redemption
by Chriſt extends, as well as to your Spirits? <hi>therefore glorify
God in your Body as well as in your Spirit, which is God's,</hi> and wherein
he hath and challengeth a ſpecial propriety.</p>
               <p>The Body in Scripture acceptation, ſignifies, not onely the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
ſubſtance, from which the Soul is actually ſeparated, when it is
laid in the Grave; but very uſually the Soul it ſelf, that is to ſay,
that part of the Soul, which vitally unites the Body to it ſelf, whoſe
faculty and operation is in and by the Body, and doth properly and
immediately exerciſe bodily Life, as that which is co-natural, and
co-eſſential to it.</p>
               <p>There is a higher part in man's Soul, called Spirit, in diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Soul and Body, expreſſed 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. as if the Spirit
were an entire thing in it ſelf, though it be that, in and with which,
Soul and Body doth conſiſt, as parts of the whole Man. <hi>I pray God,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that your whole Spirit, Soul, and Body, be preſerved
blameleſs to the coming of Chriſt, and that you may be ſanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
or in every part of you, <hi>in your Soul and in your Body,</hi> which are
to be eſteemed but as parts, comparatively with your whole Spirit.</p>
               <p>Man, conſidered as entire in his Spirit, may have and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
before he partakes of Fleſh and Blood, as it is written, <hi>Behold,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I and the children which thou haſt given me. Foraſmuch
then as the children are partakers of Fleſh and Blood, he alſo himſelf
took part of the ſame:</hi> even he, who, with the children, were a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
hid with the Father, before the World was, and had their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
and radical Being, in the Word of Life, the Father of Spirits.
In this Word, as in the Image and Mental conception of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
God, the Souls of all men, even of Chriſt himſelf, as man, were
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93090:66"/>
comprehended, as in their original pattern and rule, in order at
the time appointed, to come into fleſh, and there make their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
abode, allotted to them.</p>
               <p>By the Condition and Law of Man's Creation, he is made a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
eſſence, with two diſtinct faculties and operations, according
to which he may be ſaid to be both Immortal and Mortal, Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
and Material, Spirit and Body, as Body ſignifies man's animal
rational Soul, that is to live in fleſh, and hath its peculiar deſire,
faculty, and operation, proportioned thereunto. In all this Man
bears the Image and Similitude of God the Mediator, or of the
Godhead in Chriſt, as two Natures in him are Hypoſtatically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and make but one <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> or Perſon. This was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in that Counſel which the bleſſed Trinity took concerning
the making of Man in their Image, and after their Similitude. He
was made male and female in his very Spiritual ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> with a faculty, and operation of mind, ſuperiour, ſtronger
and more excellent, which is free and independent upon bodily or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
exerciſing Life, properly and purely Spiritual and Immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
above and without the uſe of ſenſible, ſignes, or ſhapes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> With that inferiour faculty and operation of mind,
whoſe ſubſiſtence, life, being, and motion, is in, with, and by the
body, and through the uſe of bodily organs, ſenſible ſignes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
mediums, on the loſs of which, this ſecond faculty and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of man's Soul, which is the weaker, inferiour, and leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable,
ceaſes; at leaſt, is for a time ſuſpended, which in Scripture
phraſe is called <hi>Death;</hi> even the Death of the Body. Yet the more
vigorous the exerciſe of this latter is, and the more that thereby we
are at home in the Body, the more in truth and reality we are dead;
at leaſt, aſleep in the earth, as to our more Noble and Spiritual part,
in and through which, we enjoy moſt of the preſence of God and of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Since therefore, mans conſtitution of Being, in ſuch, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live both theſe Lives together, untill the Reſurrection, but that
in the one of them, he muſt be incompleat, have his operation
much ſuſpended, and be, as it were dead or aſleep.</p>
               <p>To reſolve which of theſe to chooſe and prefer, ought not to be
ſo difficult, as commonly it is made.</p>
