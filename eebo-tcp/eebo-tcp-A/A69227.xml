         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My ſelfe, among many other of both the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities,

When the Prophet ſawe the Lorde ſitting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12228:5"/>
on an high Throne, and the Seraphins
ſtoode vppon it, and one cryed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſayde, Holie, holie, holie, is the
Lorde God of hoaſts, the whole worlde is
full of his glorie, and the lintils of the doore
cheekes mooued at the voyce of him that
cryed, and the houſe was filled with ſmoke,
hee ſayde: wo is mee for I am vndone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am a man of polluted lips, for mine
eyes haue ſeene the King and the Lorde of
hoaſts. Then flewe one of the Cherubins
to him with an hote cole in his hand, which
he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the aultar with the tongs,
and he touched his mouth, and ſayde: Lo,
this hath touched thy lips. If the Cherubin
had ſanctified my lippes,<note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 4.</note> as he did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

the fourth time it was a deepe riuer, and
and not to bee paſſed ouer, that hee was
faine to bee brought backe againe to the

the deeper he was plunged. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers

But as a learned man ſayth, <hi>Ceremonia

the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of him which ſweareth being
good, and the oath religious which hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
But whoſoeuer ſweareth, hee muſt
ſweare by the Lorde, and when the Lorde
ſweareth, he ſweareth by himſelfe. So the
Angel ſwore by him that liueth for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<note place="margin">Apo. 10. 6.</note> there ſhould be no more time. By my

becauſe thou haſt done this thing,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 16.</note> and

ſweare by the Lord, and the Lord by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is alledged by the Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 13.</note> An oath
for confirmation is the ende of all ſtrife: ſo
God, willing more abundantly to ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heires of promiſe, the ſtableneſſe of
his counſell, bound himſelfe by an oath, that
by two immutable things wherein it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that God ſhould lie, we might haue
ſtrong conſolation, which haue our refuge
to holde faſt the hope that is ſet before vs.
Now men ſweare by him that is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to ſweare by, he ſwore by himſelfe. But
I come to the laſt and eſſential point, where
he proteſteth, that he delighteth not in the
death of a ſinner.</p>
            <p>That he delighteth not in the death of a
ſinner, we need no further proof, then this,
that hee ſent his ſonne to die for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſinners.<note place="margin">Iohn 12.</note> God ſent not his ſonne to
condemne the worlde, but that through
him the worlde might bee ſaued. And
notwithſtanding the enmitie betweene

wee were reconciled vnto him through

ſo writeth <hi>Auguſtine:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tract. in Iohn. 100</note> 
               <hi>Incomprehenſibilis &amp;

then firſt begin, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were reconciled to
him by the death of his ſon, but his loue was
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, for he ordeined vs when
as yet we wer not ſons, to be heires with his
only ſon.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ita deus dilexit mundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> So God
loued the world, that he gaue his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12228:9"/>
ſon for vs, that whoſoeuer belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in him ſhould not periſh, but haue life
euerlaſting. In which wordes of our ſauiour
Chriſt, I note ſix things, which al do ſauour
of the infinit mercy of god ſhewed to ſinful
men. The firſt is, that god is the only author
and efficient cauſe of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> ſaluation of ſinners.
The 2. is, what moued God to ſaue ſinners:
his great loue towards them: the 3. how far
this loue of god is extended: euen to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
for he ſo loued the world: the 4. the
means how he wrought the ſaluation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
by which ſaluation he made his loue
knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by giuing his ſon, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> higheſt
degree of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, hee gaue the innocent
for the noce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the righteous for the vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
&amp; that not a ſtranger, but a kinſman,
not a kinſman but a ſon, &amp; not a ſon onely,
but an onely ſon. The 5. what ſinners take
hold of this his mercy, not ſimply al ſinners,
but all beleening ſinners: the 6. is, the end of
his compaſſion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinners, that they ſhould
not periſh in their ſins, but haue life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
Theſe things being ſo, that we haue ſo
many argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of his mercy ſhewed to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that he is the only author of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that it proceedeth from his loue,
and for the working of it, he ſpared not his
onelie ſonne, and that it extended not to
a fewe, but to all: for as much as hee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12228:10"/>
loued the world. And, which is a more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proofe of his mercie, ſeeing he woulde
haue none to periſh, but all to come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 9.</note> ſeeing he would haue all men to
be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of
the truth, for as much as there is one God,
and one Mediator betweene God and man,
the man Ieſus Chriſt, which gaue himſelfe a
raunſome for all men,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 4</note> to be a teſtimonie in
due time, ſeeing euery one which calleth on
the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaued.<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> And
our Sauiour Chriſt inuiteth them ſaying.
Come to mee all that bee laden,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> and I will
refreſh you,<note place="margin">Pſal, 145.</note> if Gods mercie be greater then
all his workes, if he bee more ready to ſaue
then to deſtroy, to abſolue, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
as it appeareth in that immediately
vpon the ſinne by <hi>Adam</hi> committed in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice,
he pronounced the ſentence of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
before the doome of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation,
promiſing the Meſſias the bleſſed ſeed,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he threatned him with miſery &amp; death,
that he might raiſe him vp to a liuely hope,
and not throw him downe into the pitte of
deſperation. And as ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayeth,
<hi>Quando peccauit homo miſerabiliter, condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
Deus miſericorditer,</hi> When man ſinned
moſt miſerably, God forgaue him moſt
mercifully, <hi>Et licet ô Deus in cunctis tuis ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12228:10"/>
mirabilis es, tamen mirabilior eſſe crederis
in operibus pietatis.</hi> Though he be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in all his workes, yet hee is more to bee
wondered at for his workes of pittie. In ſo
great a clowde of witneſſes of Gods mercie,
which is extended to all, and that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
not in the death of any ſinner,
how can it be that many are called,<note place="margin">Ma. 20. 16</note> and few
are choſen? that great is the way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to perdition, and many there bee that
finde it,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 13.</note> and narrowe is the gate which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to ſaluation,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 24</note> and fewe there bee that
enter therein? That when <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>
had done neither good nor euill, that the
purpoſe of God might remaine according
to election, not by workes, but by him that
calleth: before they were borne God loued
<hi>Iacob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> and hated <hi>Eſau?</hi> choſe one, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

whom he will haue mercie,<note place="margin">Exod. 33.</note> and ſhew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
on whom he wil ſhew compaſſion?<note place="margin">Eſa. 10. 21, 22.</note>
That it is not in him that willeth, nor in
him that runneth,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 27.</note> but in God that ſheweth
mercie? That he hath mercy on whom hee
will, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will he hardeneth? though
the children of Iſrael were in number as the
ſandes of the ſea, but a remnant ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?
I haue thought good to handle this
poynt at large: and for the better diſcuſſing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12228:11"/>
therof to collect and gather out theſe three
concluſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt,</hi> that it is not the will of God that all
men ſhould be ſaued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond,</hi> that the abſolute wil of God, &amp;
his ſecret decree from all eternitye, is the cauſe
why ſome are predeſtinated to ſaluation, others
to death and deſtruction, and not any foreſight of
faith or good workes in the one, or of infidelitie,
neglect, or contempt in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third,</hi> that Chriſt died not effectually
for all.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> diſputeth in this
maner,<note place="margin">Enchirid. ad Laur. cap. 95, &amp; 97.</note> That God will not haue all men to
be ſaued, it is manifeſt, foraſmuch as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
wrought many works in the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
cities,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 21</note> 
               <hi>Corazin, Bethſaida,</hi> &amp; <hi>Capernaum,</hi>
which he knew would not repent, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained
from ſhewing any ſuch examples in
<hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi>
which if he had done there, <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi>
had repented in ſackcloth &amp; aſhes, &amp; <hi>Sodom</hi>
had remained vntill this day. Moreouer,
ſaith he, I giue thee thanks, ô father, lord of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe
things (meaning the miſteries of ſaluation)
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wiſe &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; haſt opened

<hi>Deus multa poteſt quae non vult, ſed nihil

his will, and his will extendeth not it ſelfe ſo
far as his power: his will is not to do all that

as the prophet ſpeaketh.<note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 3.</note> Our god is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

often would I haue gathered thy children

the will of God. And it is a wonderfull my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
to ſee, that which is againſt his will, is
not otherwiſe then hee hath willed; for but
by his ſufferance it could not bee, neither
doth he ſuffer it againſt his will, but with his
will: neither would God which is good ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any thing to be done which is euill, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
his omnipotencie were ſuch that hee
could make good of that which is euill. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
to this obiection out of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi>
(hauing firſt diſputed <hi>antagoniſticò)</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

two maner of wayes. The firſt is this: <hi>Quod
Deus vult omnes ſaluari, &amp; tamen plurimi non
ſaluantur, ita intelligendus eſt ac ſi diceret,
nullum hominem ſaluum niſi quem ſaluum fieri
ipſe voluerit, non quod nullus ſit quem non ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uum
fieri valit, ſed quod nullus ſaluus fiat niſi
quam velit, &amp; ideo rogandus ſit vt valit, quia
neceſſe est fieri ſi voluerit, de orando quippe Deo
agebat apoſtolus vt hoc diceret.</hi> Where it is
written, that God willeth all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and yet the greateſt part of men are
not ſaued, it is ſo to be vnderſtood. God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all men to be ſaued, that is, no man is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
againſt his will, but whoſoeuer is ſaued,
it is by his will, not as though there were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12228:13"/>
none whom hee would not haue ſaued, but
that none are ſaued, vnleſſe hee will, and
they onely whom hee will, and therefore he
is to be prayed vnto that he would, becauſe
it cannot otherwiſe bee, but they ſhall bee
ſaued if hee will, for the Apoſtle alleageth
this as an argument, that wee ſhould pray
to him for the ſaluation of all men, becauſe
it is by his will that they are ſaued. And
becauſe the ſafeſt and moſt ſound interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Scriptures, is by other like
places of the Scriptures, wee reade the
like kinde of ſaying in the firſt of. <hi>Iohn,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt: <hi>Illuminat omnem homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
venientem in mundum, non quia nullus
hominum eſt qui non illuminatur, ſed quia niſi
ab ipſo nullus illuminatur.</hi> Hee lighteneth
all men which come into the worlde, and
yet manie ſit in palpable darkeneſſe, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.</note> Iewes, Turkes, Infidels, and in the
ſhadowe of death, therefore it is not ſo to
bee vnderſtoode, as if all men were
lightened by him, but ſo, that that no man
is lightened but by him. His ſeconde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
is this: That whereas hee willeth
all men to bee ſaued, this woorde All,
is bee vnderſtoode, as it is often tymes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Scholes, not <hi>De ſingulis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
ſed de generibus ſingulorum,</hi> Not as if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12228:13"/>
hee woulde haue euerie one in particular,
of all ſortes of people to bee ſaued, but of
all ſortes ſome to bee ſaued. For thus hee
ſayeth: <hi>Omnes homines vult ſaluos fieri, non
quòd nullus hominum eſſet quem ſaluum fieri
nollet, qui virtutes miraculorum facere noluit,
apud eos quoi dicit acturos poenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiam ſi feciſſet:

reges, priuatos, pauperes, mares, faeminas,
&amp;c.</hi> By all men we muſt vnderſtand all kind
of men. Whereas it is written, hee will
haue all men to be ſaued, it is not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode,
as though there were no man
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would not haue ſaued, for as much
as he would not work wonders among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which (as hee ſaith) had bin conuerted, if he
had wrought them amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them: but by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man, all ſortes of men, as kings, ſubiects,
rich, and poore, are to be vnderſtood. <hi>Nam
Apoſtolus ibi praecepit vt oremus pro ſingulis,
ſpecialiter addit, pro regibus qui poterant ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia
ſeculari ab humilitate Chriſtiana abhorre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>
For the Apoſtle in that place exhorteth,
that ſupplications be made for all men, but
eſpecially for princes, and ſuch as are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
becauſe ſuch men may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
by the proſperitie of this life, drawen
away from the humilitye of fayth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:12228:14"/>
               <hi>Hoc dicit eſſe bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vt pro talibus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

vt deſperationem tolleret, addit: Quia deus vult
omnes ſaluari.</hi> Therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle,
it is good &amp; acceptable in the ſight of God,
that ſuch men be prayed for, and that wee
may hope well of all, and deſpaire of none,
he addeth: For God willeth all men to bee
ſaued. Wherefore in a worde, God will not
haue all men in particular, but all men in a
generalitie, that is, all kindes of men to bee
ſaued, as in the wordes going before, he will
haue prayers to be made for all men, that is,
not for all men in particular, but all kinds of
men: for there bee ſome men in particular,
for whom we may not pray.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 16.</note> If any ſee his
brother ſinne a ſinne which is not to death,
let him aske, and life ſhall be giuen him: but
there is a ſinne to death, that is agaynſt the

for that thou ſhalt not pray. Likewiſe our
Sauiour ſaith:<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 24</note> Wo be to you Phariſies, for
you tithe mint and rewe, and all hearbs, but
paſſe ouer iudgement and the loue of God.
Yet they tithed not all hearbs, but all kinds
of hearbs, not <hi>omnia oleta, ſed omne genus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerum.</hi>
So God willeth all men to bee ſaued:
not all men, but all kinds of men. To theſe
two anſwers of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which are
both conſonant and agreeable, not only to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12228:14"/>
the analogie of fayth, but alſo of that
place of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> I will adde a thirde
anſwere, for the more fuller ſatisfying of
all ſuch as deſire to attaine vnto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, &amp; that is this: Foraſmuch
as God will haue all men to bee ſaued, wee
muſt diſtinguiſh of his will, which is two
folde, <hi>Voluntas reuelata, &amp; voluntas benepla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita,</hi>
his hidden or ſecret will, which is onlie
knowen vnto himſelfe, and his written or
reuealed will, which is imparted vnto man
in his holy Scriptures. According to his
written will,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> hee willeth all men to bee
ſaued.<note place="margin">Matt. 26. 27.</note> For he ſayth: Come vnto mee all:
Drinke of this all: his Goſpell hath beene
preached vnto all nations.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> The ſounde of
them, meaning the voyce of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Ma. 28 29</note>
hath been heard in all lands,<note place="margin">Mar. 16. 20.</note> Go, and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of
the father,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 5.</note> &amp;c. They went forth and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
euery where. There were at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
men that feared God, of euery nation
vnder the cope of heauen, and euerie one
heard the Apoſtles preach in his owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that by their meanes the fame of the
Goſpell might be ſpredde abroad in all the
corners of the earth, that no infidell might
hold himſelfe excuſed by pleading igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
at the day of iudgement. But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12228:15"/>
to his ſecret wil few are ſaued: and that
is it of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, ſaying:
The foundation of God remaineth ſure,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19.</note> and
hath this ſeale or priuie ſignet: <hi>Solus deus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
ſuos:</hi> only god knoweth who be his. And
leaſt any ſhould think, that this diſtinction
of the will of God into his ſecret will, and
reuealed will, is but an idle and friuolous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
ſauouring of curioſitie more then
of ſubſtance, I will proue it by ſuch euident
places of Scripture, that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denied.
In one and the ſelf ſame action of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he ſold his Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
appeare two ſundry wils of God, the
one hidden, the other reuealed, and one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the other. His ſecret will was that
<hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould betray him: his reuealed will
was, that he ſhould not betray him: and yet
both theſe willes, in reſpect of God, were
good and iuſt. His reuealed will was, that
<hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould not betray him. For it is not
onelie forbidden in a generalitie, where it
is written:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> Thou ſhalt not kill, or conſent
to murther: And among thoſe things which
the Lord hateth,<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 17.</note> one is: <hi>Manus effunden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
innoxium ſanguinem,</hi> Handes that ſhed
innocen blood: But alſo hee is forbidden
by a particular caueat, where our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſayde as hee ſate at meate, verily
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12228:15"/>
I ſay vnto you,<note place="margin">Matt. 26. 21.</note> that one of you ſhall betray
mee, euen hee which dippeth his hand with
me into the diſh, hee ſhall betray mee, but
wo be to that man by whom the ſonne of
man is betrayed, it had beene good for that
man if he had neuer beene borne. And at
the verie inſtant when he did betray him,
he rebuked him,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 48</note> ſaying: <hi>Iudas,</hi> doſt thou
betray the ſonne of man with a kiſſe?<note place="margin">Act. 2. 22</note> And
yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh plainlie, that God in his
ſecret will had appointed that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould
betray him: for, ſaith he: Ieſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
a man approoued among you with
great workes and wonders which God did
by him in the middeſt of you, as yee your
ſelues know, him I ſay, haue ye take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the
hands of the wicked, being deliuered by the
determinate counſell and prouidence of
God,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 25.</note> and haue crucified and ſlaine. And it
is the voice and conſent of all the apoſtles.<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 1. 2.</note>
Thou haſt ſaide by the mouth of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
<hi>Dauid:</hi> Why did the Gentiles rage,
and the people imagine a vaine thing? The
kings of the earth ſtood vp, and tooke cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

thou hadſt anointed, both <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pilat,</hi>

themſelues togither to do whatſoeuer thine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12228:16"/>
hand and thy counſell had determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be done. This concluſion being thus
determined, two doubts or ſcruples may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe.
The firſt: Theſe things bee graunted
that God hath two willes, the one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the other, whether it may bee ſayde
at any time, that God is contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
The ſecond is: If whatſoeuer the
wicked do, bee done according to the will
of God, why are they not blameleſſe for
dooing his will? To this firſt I anſwere:
<hi>Voluntas Dei in ſe eſt ſimplex, nobis tamen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paret
multiplex qui quo modo idem diuerſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
fieri, &amp; non fieri velit non comprehendimus.</hi>
God is not contrarie to himſelfe, albeit his
reuealed will, and his ſecrete will, are not
one: for the will of God in it ſelfe is one,
but it is ſaide to bee diuerſe, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vnto vs, whoſe dulneſſe is ſuch, that we
cannot conceiue how in diuerſe reſpects he
he will, and he will not. Or elſe wee may
ſafely anſwere with Caluin. <hi>Contrariae ſunt
Dei voluntates, ſed in diuerſis inſtitutis.</hi> His
willes be different, but to diuerſe purpoſes.
But in reſpect of vs his will is alwayes one,
and the ſame, becauſe for our parts hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth
alwayes the ſame dutie at our hands
to be performed, that thereby wee may be
voyd of excuſe, if we performe it not. He
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12228:16"/>
commaundeth vs alwayes to do the ſame, if
in his ſecret will he will put in our hearts to
to do otherwayes then he hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it is either for our puniſhment, or
the ſetting forth of his owne glorie, or the
executing of his ſecret purpoſe. <hi>In vnâ vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate
illius eluceſcit Dei iuſtitia, in altera pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur
crimen hominis.</hi> In one of his willes is
made manifeſt the iuſtice of God: in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the offence of man. To the ſecond: If
the wicked do but the will of God, are they
therfore to be excuſed? Nothing leſſe. For
firſt: <hi>Licet Deus Illud voluerit, tamen aliud ijs
praecepit.</hi> Howſoeuer God willed one thing,
he commaunded an other thing by them to
be done. We muſt not inquire after his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
will, but wee muſt follow his written
commandement. Secondly howſoeuer the
wicked do the wil of god, yet they do it not
to that ende, to obey his will, but to ſatisfie
their owne deſire.<note place="margin">Hugo de ſancto vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore dè ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra pars 4. cap. 15.</note> As <hi>Hugo</hi> writeth. <hi>Non

are not moued by their owne will to fulfill

wil, not knowing themſelues that God hath
appointed them to do ſo. And as <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

Petrus id fieri nolebat, Satanas ab eo qui occidi

man is contrary to the will of God, and yet
his will is good: ſometimes againe, the will
of man concurreth with the will of God,
and yet the will of God is good, the will of
man euill. As for example: A good ſonne
deſireth that his father may liue, when the
will of God is that hee ſhall die, there the
will of man is pleaſing to God, though the
one be contrarie to the other. Likewiſe, an
euil ſonne is willing that his father ſhal die,
God willeth the ſame, the will of God and
man are the ſame, yet one is iuſt, the other is
ſinne, &amp;c. I come to the ſecond concluſion.</p>
            <p>The abſolute will of God, and his ſecret
decree from all eternitie, is the cauſe
why ſome are ordayned to ſaluation,
others to death and deſtruction, and
not any foreſight of faith or good
works in the one, or of infidelity, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
or contempt, in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:12228:18"/>
This concluſion is the doctrine of no leſſe

            <q>
               <p>11 For before the children were borne, and
when they had done neither good nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
(that the purpoſe of God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

               <p>13 As it is written, I haue loued Iacob,

               <p>14 VVhat ſhall we ſay then? Is there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
with God? God forbid.</p>
               <p>15 For he ſaid to Moſes: I will haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

I will haue compaſsion.</p>
               <p>16 So then, it is not in him that willeth,
nor in him that runneth, but in God that

               <p>17 For the Scripture ſaith to Pharao: for

               <p>23 And that he might declare the riches of

            <p>Secondly, That notwithſtanding he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

            <p>The reaſon why God loued the one,
and hated the other, before they were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12228:19"/>
borne, and when they had done neither
good nor euill, is alleaged in the parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
that the purpoſe or ſecret decree of god
in chooſing one &amp; refuſing the other, might
remain according to electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not by works,
but by him that calleth, which is God alone.
There is plainly ſet downe the eternall
decree of God, in chooſing ſome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
others, proceeding meerely from
himſelfe, without any reſpect or regarde of
the perſons, which are elect or reprobate,
or any thing foreſeene in them, where hee
ſayth: Not by workes, but by him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
And here is preuented the aunſwere
of the Papiſtes, which confeſſe that <hi>Iacob</hi>
was loued before hee was borne, but <hi>ex
praeuiſis operibus,</hi> for the good workes which
God foreſawe in him, as alſo of <hi>Huberus,</hi>
and other Lutherans of our times, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of ſtraunge opinions, which holde
that ſome are predeſtinated to bee veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of honour, but <hi>expreuiſa fide,</hi> becauſe
of theyr fayth, which God did foreſee to
bee in them, others of diſhonour, but
<hi>ex mero contemptu, aut neglectu, non ex
Dei decreto,</hi> not by anie decree of God,
but becauſe hee had in them a foreſight
eyther of neglect, or contempt: as if
the cauſes of theyr predeſtination were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12228:20"/>
in themſelues and not in God, whereas in
deede theſe wordes: Not by workes, but by
him that calleth, do ende all controuerſie,
ſhewing that the whole cauſes of election
and reprobation, are in himſelfe and not in
vs, and therefore not long of any fayth, or
workes of ours. And as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
ſayth: <hi>Si futura opera quae Deus vti<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Enchir.</hi> c. 98.</note> 
               <hi>vellet intelligi, nequaquam diceret, non ex
operibus, ſed ex futuris operibus, eoque modo
iſtam ſolueret quaeſtionem, immo, nullam quam
ſolui opus eſſet faceret quaeſtionem.</hi> If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
did vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any good works fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene
in <hi>Iacob,</hi> to be the cauſe why God did
loue him, he would not ſay as he doth: Not
of workes: but he would rather ſay, God
loued him becauſe of his workes which hee
foreſaw in him, and ſo he would not onely
ende this controuerſie, but make it ſo plaine
that it ſhould be indeed without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie.
Againe, the Apoſtle doth explaine
his owne meaning, that he loued <hi>Iacob,</hi> and
hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> without reſpect of any thing in
them worthy of loue or hatred, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
following, where he ſayth: What
ſhall wee ſay then? Is there iniquitie with
God? God forbid. Becauſe it ſeemeth to
fleſh and blood not to ſtand with the iuſtice
of God, to condemne men before they are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12228:20"/>
borne, but to be crueltie in him to hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which neuer did euill: therefore the apoſtle
preuenteth that obiection, and purgeth
God of that ſuſpition which men might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
againſt him, which he ſhould not need
to do, if God did loue or hate vpon anie
foreſight of faith or good works in the one,
or neglect and contempt in the other; for
that were in the iudgement of men, a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cauſe of loue and hatred, without all
ſhewe of iniuſtice. Thirdly, he maketh it
yet more plaine, by the wordes which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 18. where he ſaith: Hee will haue
mercie on whom he will haue mercie, and
whom he will he hardeneth. He maketh
two cauſes of ſaluation, and damnation, and
both ſubordinate to an higher and more
principall cauſe, the ſubordinate cauſe
of ſaluation beeing mercye, becauſe
none is ſaued but by mercie: of damnation
hardening, or obdurating, for they which be
damned, are hardened in their ſinnes, that
they cannot repent, and both thoſe inferior
cauſes are ſubordinate to his will, as the
higheſt cauſe, and onely in himſelfe, and
theſe inferiour cauſes doe both proceed
from his will. And finally, when he ſayth:
It is not (meaning election) in him that
willeth (that is, in the indeuors of man) nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12228:21"/>
in him that runneth, (that is in the workes
of men) but in God onely that ſheweth
mercy: hee teacheth that the onely rule of
predeſtination, and reprobation, whereby
God is directed, and the only law which he
tieth himſelf to obſerue therin, is his will: ſo
that no part of our electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is aſcribed to our
ſelues, or any thing which may be in vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to anſwere this obiection. Is
there iniquitie with God? God forbid. He
cleareth that two maner of waies. Firſt, God
is not vniuſt by being partiall in ſauing, hee
dooth not erre in his choyſe by preferring
Iacob before Eſau, when the caſe of them
both was one, both vnborne, neither of
them had done good, why hee ſhould bee
choſen, or euill, why hee ſhould be refuſed.
For God will haue mercy on whom he will
haue mercy. <hi>Non poteſt peccare in dolectu, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius
voluntas eſt iuſticiae regula.</hi> Hee cannot
erre in his choyſe, when that is iuſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
is his will. When two theeues haue
committed murther, and both deſerued
death, may not the King without ſuſpition
of iniuſtice ſhewe mercie in pardoning
the one, and doe iudgement in executing
the other?</p>
            <p>Iacob and Eſau were both as we all are,
by nature the children of wrath, could not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12228:21"/>
God iuſtly haue compaſsion on Iacob,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> and
let Eſau die in his ſinnes? That anie are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it is his mercie, and hee may haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
on whom hee will. It is worthie of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
that the Apoſtle dooth ſay: when
they had done neither good nor euill. But
hee dooth not ſay: when they were neither
good nor euill. For true it is that they had
done neither good nor euill, becauſe they
were vnborne, and therefore coulde not
commit anie actuall ſinne: but they were
both of them euill, for both were infected
with originall ſinne, in their mothers
wombe, which they drewe by inheritance
from Iſaac theyr father, and Rebecca their
mother,<note place="margin">Enchir. cap. 98.</note> and therefore ſayeth Auguſtine:

They were both by nature the children of
wrath, not by reaſon of any offence which
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, but for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of <hi>Adam:</hi> they were in ſtate of damnation, as
all the reſt of <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie: wherefore
that God loued <hi>Iacob,</hi> it was free mercy and
vndeſerued grace: that hee hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> it
was no wrong, but iuſtice, a puniſhment
due vnto his ſinnes: which puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
due vnto them both, was in iuſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
vpon one, and in mercie but vpon
the one: that as one was an example of his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12228:22"/>
iuſtice: ſo the other might bee a veſſell of
mercie, that none may boaſt of his owne
merits, becauſe it is not in him that willeth,
nor in him that runneth, but in God that
ſheweth mercie. When the wicked ſhall be
tormented in hell fire, then ſhal Gods ſaints
clearly perceiue howe much his grace and
mercie did auaile them: then ſhall they find
it true by their owne experience, as a thing
verified in themſelues, which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in his hundred <hi>Pſalme.</hi> My ſong ſhall
be of mercie and iudgement. For that they
are ſaued, it is free mercie: that the other are
damned, it is iuſt iudgement. When of two
infants one is choſen through mercie, the
other refuſed in iuſtice: he which is choſen,
cannot but confeſſe, what in iuſtice was due
vnto himſelfe, had not mercy beene ſhewed
vnto him, So then, where mercye is not
ſhewed, there is not iniquity, but iuſt iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted. I remember, Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
ſpeaketh very fitly to this purpoſe, in
an other place, though vpon an other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
for in his 157. Epiſtle to <hi>Optatus,</hi>
he propoſeth this queſtion, why God hath
ordained ſo few to be ſaued? and foreſeeing
that ſo many millions of men are to bee
damned for their ſinnes, why he doth crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
them? Why ſo mercifull a God ſhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12228:23"/>
be glorified more by the damnation, then
ſaluation of his owne creatures? For if his
glorie did conſiſt in ſauing rather then in
deſtroying, it ſhould ſeeme without doubt,
that the greateſt number ſhoulde bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and that hee would not create thoſe
whom he doth foreknowe to be but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
            <p>Hee maketh this anſwere: <hi>Meritò in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtum
videretur, quòd fiunt vaſa ad perditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
niſi eſſet vniuerſa ex Adam maſſa dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata.</hi>
Indeede it might ſeeme verie iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that anie ſhoulde be ordayned to bee
veſſels of wrath, if it were not, that the
whole lumpe of which the veſſels of wrath
are framed, had beene damned before in
Adam, but nowe: <hi>Quod fiunt naſcendo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa
irae, pertinet ad debitam paenam: quod fiunt
renaſcendo vaſa miſericordiae, pertinet ad inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitam
gratiam:</hi> That manie are borne
veſſelles of wrath, it is but a iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to theyr originall ſinne: that a
fewe by their regeneration are made veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of mercie, it is vndeſerued fauour.
But if all which are borne of Adam,
ſhoulde bee regenerate, and borne anew,
and none ſhould bee damned, then: <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret
beneficium quod donatur indignis:</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:12228:23"/>
Then Gods mercie which is extended to
them that are ſaued (which indeede are all
vnworthy of their ſaluation) would not bee
ſo apparent as nowe it is when but a fewe
are ſaued. <hi>Plures Deus fecit damnandos
quam ſaluandos incomparabili multitudine,
vt reiectorum multitudine oſtenderetur, quàm
nulli momenti ſit apud Deum iuſtum quan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
talibet numeroſitas iuſtiſſimè damnatorum,
atque vt hinc quoque intelligant, qui ex ipſa
damnatione redimuntur, hoc fuiſſe maſſae
illi vniuerſae debitum quod tam magnae eius
parti redditum, cernerent.</hi> But therefore
GOD hath ordayned, without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
more to bee damned then to
bee ſaued, for theſe two cauſes. Firſt,
that it myght appeare by the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of them which are damned: howe
little GOD, which is moſt iuſt, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the outcryes of whole multitudes
of ſinners, which are iuſtlye puniſhed:
Secondlye, that they which are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from that damnation, may by their
owne redemption, confeſſe, when they ſee
the greater part damned, that that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was due to the whole lumpe, (and
therefore to their owne ſelues) which was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12228:24"/>
adiudged to the greater part. Secondly, he
is not vniuſt by any parciality in puniſhing,
becauſe, firſt hee may, becauſe it is his will
and pleaſure, iuſtly condemne ſome, as it
appeareth by <hi>Pharao:</hi> ſecondly, as in elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo in reprobation, between his decree,
and the execution of his decree, there bee
ſubordinate cauſes: for although his will be
the firſt &amp; principall cauſe, that he decreeth
who ſhall be ſaued, and who ſhall bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
yet between his decree to ſaue, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
it ſelfe, there is mercie, for none is
ſaued but by mercie: and betweene his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
to condemne, and the damnation, there
is hardening that men can not repent, but
continue in their ſinnes. So that albeit the
cauſe why he decreed that men ſhoulde bee
damned, is only in himſelf becauſe his owne
wil is the cauſe of that decree, there is found
cauſe of damnation inherent in themſelues,
which is infidelitie and hardneſſe of heart:
ſo that none are condemned, but firſt there
is found in them matter enough worthy of
condemnation, as the Prophet ſpeaketh:
<hi>Perditio tua ex te,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oſe. 14. 13.</note> 
               <hi>ſalus ex me Iſrael,</hi> Thy
ſaluation, ô Iſrael, commeth onely from me,
but thy damnation from thy ſelfe.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 12.</note> And as
the apoſtle ſpeaketh. Theſe which as bruit
beaſts lead with ſenſualities, ſpeake euill
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12228:24"/>
of the things they knowe not, ſhall periſh
through their owne corruption.</p>
            <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> where it is written: Thou wilt ſay
vnto me, why doth hee yet complaine? for
who hath reſiſted his will? Hee graunteth
two antecedents, that God hardeneth who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he will, And that no man hath power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
his will, And yet the argument is denied
as a weake conſequent, that therfore Gods
wrath is vniuſtly kindled againſt them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he thus hardeneth, and conſtraineth to do
his will, ſhewing that man may not thus
expoſtulate: which hee proueth by two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Firſt, an argument, called in Logicke,
<hi>à comparatis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> where he ſaith: <hi>Nunquid deo
non licebit quod figulo licet:</hi> The potter may
of his owne clay make veſſels for the bedde,
as well as for the boord, and may not God
much more, of the ſame lumpe make veſſels
of wrath. The ſecond is, <hi>Ab optimo fine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uini
concilij,</hi> drawn from the end which God
doth propoſe, where he ſaith: What if God
woulde, to ſhewe his wrath, and to make his
power knowen, ſuffer with long patience
the veſſels of wrath, prepared to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
And that he might declare the riches
of his glorie vppon the veſſels of mercie,<note place="margin">Verſ. 22. 23.</note>
whom he hath prepared to glorie, who can
accuſe him of vniuſtice? Then he ſheweth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12228:25"/>
that neither the ſaluation of the elect, nor
the damnation of the wicked, is the laſt
ende of his eternall decree and purpoſe, but
that he propoſeth a further and better end,
which is his owne glorie, that he may ſhewe
his wrath, and make his power knowne, as
alſo he may declare the riches of his glorie.
A poynt of ſo deepe diuinitie, woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
both a learned and large diſcourſe,
eſpecially before ſo honourable, frequent,
and iudicious an auditorie; but two houres
are too ſhort a ſcantling, &amp; I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained
to be briefer then I woulde. But that you
may bee fully ſatisfied concerning this
poynt, I will with as great breuitie as I can,
aunſwere three obiections, which doe
ſeeme to make agaynſt this doctrine of
predeſtination, which I haue deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</p>
            <p>The firſt is of <hi>Samuel Huberus</hi> a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran,
which affirmeth that this place
of Saint Paule, concerning Eſau and
Iacob, is not meant of any particular
men, but of whole nations, not of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things, but temporall bleſsings,
and therefore maketh nothing to proue
predeſtination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:12228:25"/>
The ſecond, of the Papiſts, which inferre
this abſurditie, that if God hardeneth
men to doo euill, then God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of ſinne.</p>
            <p>The thirde of the Atheiſtes and carnall
men, which denye the prouidence of GOD
and diſpute with themſelues in this
manner: If GOD haue predeſtinated
mee to Hell, then in vayne is it for
mee to leade a godlye lyfe? If hee haue
predestinated mee to ſaluation, what
neede I to confourme my ſelfe vnto
his VVoorde? For his will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
muſt needes take place, I can
not auoyde his ſecrete Decree, it is lyke
the law of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> it can not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>

                  </gap> bergenſi.</note> For as much
as it is written: I haue loued Iacob, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Eſau: <hi>Samuel Huberus</hi> a Lutheran firſt
diſtinguiſheth the ambiguitie of the
names, Eaſu and Iacob, as alſo of loue and
hatred, affirming that Eſau and Iacob are to
bee vnderſtood <hi>collectiue,</hi> not <hi>diſtributiue,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:12228:26"/>
not perſonally, but nationally, as by <hi>Iacob</hi>
is ment all the poſteritie of Iacob, and by
<hi>Eſau,</hi> all the families and ofsprings of <hi>Eſau:</hi>
as for example, oft times in the Scripture,
<hi>Iſrael, Edom, Iſmael, Amon, Moab, Iuda, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui,</hi>
are vnderſtoode, not of particular men,
but of whole nations: ſo likewiſe the loue
of God to the one, &amp; hatred to the other, is
not to be vnderſtood of ſpiritual graces, but
temporall bleſſings: not in the life to come,
but in this life: not to belong to their owne
perſons, but to appertaine to their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and thereupon he inferreth this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
that theſe wordes of the Apoſtle doo
make nothing at all, either to proue electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or reprobation. And becauſe this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> is quoted out of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malac. 1.</note> and that of <hi>Malachy</hi> out of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note> he
examineth theſe three places of ſcripture,
and by the coherence of the text, ſeemeth
to alleage many arguments to that purpoſe.
His arguments out of <hi>Paule</hi> are theſe. 14.
1. A great prerogatiue is graunted to the
Iewes aboue other people,<note place="margin">Ro. 9. 4. 15</note> but they are the
whole poſteritie of <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 7. vnto 13.</note> 2. That prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
is drawne from the couenant, which
the Lord did make with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which
couenant is belonging to many, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to Abraham alone. 3 He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riueth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12228:26"/>
this prerogatiue from Iſaac to Iacob,
and ſeparateth Eſau fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, as one which was
no partaker of that bleſſing: but what is this
prerogatiue which is giuen to Iacob aboue
Eſau? namely, that in his poſteritie ſhould
be continued the true worſhip of God, that

that in his poſteritie ſhould be eſtabliſhed a
temporall kingdome, neither was that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue,
and glorie alwayes to continue in
Iacobs poſteritie, but only for a time, for as
much as at the length, the Iewes which
were Iacobs poſteritie, were reiected, and
and the Gentiles choſen in their place.</p>
            <p>4 Whereas is written:<note place="margin">Verſ. 12, 13.</note> The elder ſhall
ſerue the yonger, it was neuer verified of
the perſon of Eſau, nor during the life of
Iacob, becauſe Eſau did neuer ſerue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iacob, but only his poſteritie did ſerue
his brothers poſteritie, when the Iſraelites
had brought the Edomites into ſubiection.</p>
            <p>5 He ſayth:<note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> Whom the Lord hath choſen,
not onely of the Iewes, but alſo of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
where hee mentioneth whole nations
and kinreds.<note place="margin">Oſe. 2.</note> 6 He vrgeth the authoritie
of Oſe, ſaying: I will call them my people
which are not my people.<note place="margin">Eſay 10.</note> 7 The authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Eſay: Though the number of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were as the ſandes of the ſea, but a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12228:27"/>
remnant ſhall be ſaued. 8 Hee oppoſeth
all the Gentiles to the whole nation of the
Iewes,<note place="margin">Verſ. 30.</note> ſaying: The Gentiles which followed
not righteouſnes, haue obtained vnto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
which is of faith: but Iſrael which
followed the law of righteouſneſſe, coulde
not attaine to the lawe of righteouſneſſe.
9 He ſheweth that Iacob hath not the true
knowledge of God:<note place="margin">Cap. 10. 2, 3 ver. 9 &amp; 12</note> which coulde not
without impietie bee vnderſtoode of the
perſon of Iacob. 10 Out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.
and <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. He commendeth the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Gentiles, and reprehendeth the
contumacy of the Iewes.<note place="margin">Cap. 11. verſ, 2, 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 9, 10, ab 11. ad 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30, 31</note> 11 he ſaith: Hath

ſheweth that of the poſterity of Iacob ſome
are ſaued, but the greateſt part are gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray.
13 He compareth together the zeale
of both nations, as well Iewes as Gentiles.
14 Hee concludeth of both Nations in
in this manner: As you in tymes paſt
haue not beleeued God, yet haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
mercie through their vnbeleefe: ſo now
haue they not beleeued God, by the mercy
ſhewed vnto you, that they alſo may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
mercie.</p>
            <p>As for the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> where he
ſayth:<note place="margin">Mal. 1.</note> I haue loued Iacob, and hated Eſau,
he expoundeth himſelf, and declareth with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12228:27"/>
what kinde of hatred he hated Eſau. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he made his mountaines waſte, and his
heritage a wilderneſſe for dragons: which
was neuer brought to paſſe while Eſau li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but long after his death. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
he bloued Iacob, yet he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his vnthankfulneſſe: which ingratitude
could not be obiected to his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to his
poſterity, as in that whole chap. he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
not of one in particular, but of a whole
nation.<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> To come to the examination of the
words contained in the 25. of <hi>Gen.</hi> The lord
ſaid to Rebecca: Two Nations are in thy
wombe, two maner of people ſhall bee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of thy bowels, and the one people
ſhalbe mightier then the other, &amp; the elder
ſhall ſerue the yonger. Where it is moſt
manifeſt by the coherence of the wordes,
that hee ſpeaketh not of perſons, but of
peoples: ſo that where hee ſayeth: The el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſhall ſerue the younger, he meaneth the
elder people ſhall ſerue the younger peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or the poſteritie of the elder ſonne, ſhal
ſerue the poſteritie of his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In another place, Iſaac ſaith to Iacob:
Let peoples bee thy ſeruants,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 29</note> and Nations
bowe to thee: bee Lord ouer thy brethren,
and let thy mothers Children honour

perſon of Iacob, becauſe his brethren did
not bow vnto him, neither were people his
ſeruants, neither did his mothers children
honour him, but he ſerued others: himſelfe
was a fugitiue in Meſapotomia, and did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyſance
to his brother Eſau: but onely the
poſteritie of Eſau ſerued the poſteritie of
Iacob,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 8.</note> when they were by Dauid ſubdued
and brought into ſubiection.</p>
            <p>As for the loue of the one, and hatred of
the other, it conſiſted onelie in temporall
things, which he proueth by theſe three
reaſons. 1 One could not be a ſeruant to
the other in the life to come,<note place="margin">Gene. 27.</note> becauſe there
is freedome and no ſeruice, euerie one is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua
creatura in Domino,</hi> a new creature in the
Lord. 2 When Iſaac bleſſed Iacob, hee
ſaid: Behold, the ſmell of my ſonne is as the
ſmell of a field which the Lorde hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
God giue thee therefore of the dew of
heauen, and fatneſſe of the earth, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of wheat and wine. But with the ſame
bleſſing he bleſſed Eſau, though not in ſo
great and ample maner,<note place="margin">Verſ. 39.</note> ſaying: Behold, the
fatneſſe of the earth ſhall bee thy dwelling
place, and thou ſhalt haue of the dewe of
heauen from aboue. But all theſe things are
temporall reſpects, 3 If theſe things had
been ſpirituall, and to be vnderſtood of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12228:29"/>
life to come, then Iacob and Eſau ſtanding
in oppoſition one againſt the other, in ſo
much that one ſhould be choſen, the other
damned, then both of them could not haue
beene bleſſed.</p>
            <p>That I may anſwer with as great breuitie
as I can. The Argument doth not follow,
that becauſe Saint <hi>Paule</hi> dooth diſcourſe of
whole nations, and not of particular perſons:
therefore theſe words do make againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.
For, if we do well conſider the
drift and ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place,
we ſhall find the contrarie moſt plainely to
appeare. For although the argument which
the Apoſtle handleth in that Chapter, and
the two other Chapters following, is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
diſcourſe of the generall apoſtacie and
reiection of the Iewes, and the vocation of
the Gentiles, yet by a kinde of occupation,
he entreth into a particular tract of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,
although it be <hi>obiter,</hi> and by the
way, as a queſtion moſt neceſſary to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
for the right vnderſtanding of a place
of Scripture, which ſeemeth at the firſt
ſight flatly to make agaynſt this doctrine,
which he hath deliuered concerning the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
reiection of the Iewes, and ſo hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intreateth
of predeſtination, for the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of an obiection. For, in the beginning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12228:30"/>
of the ſame chapter, hauing lamented the
reiecting of his kindred the Iewes, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this obiection with himſelfe: If it bee
ſo that God hath reiected the Iewes, and
called the Gentiles in their place, it ſhould
ſeem to be contrarie to the couenant which
he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> (for his promiſe
to <hi>Abraham</hi> was otherwiſe) and that his
worde ſhould be of none effect. To which
obiection he anſwereth, that albeit the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
reiecting of the Iewes, yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
which the Lorde made to <hi>Abrahaem</hi>
remaineth ſure and ſtedfaſt, for as much as
notwithſtanding their general apoſtacy and
infidelitie, the Lorde in his ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
chooſeth of them ſome in particular
whom hee liſteth, whom hee hath before
predeſtinated to ſaluation. For hee made
the promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeede,
not in a generalitie to all his ſeede, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fleſh, but in particular, to all
thoſe of his ſeede which ſhould be his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
according to the fayth, euen as hee
was the father of the faithfull. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſtate of this queſtion thus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
That this grace is offered to all the
poſteritie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> without exception,
that hee woulde bee their God, and they
ſhould be his people, but it is ſealed onely
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12228:30"/>
to the faythfull: the vertue and efficacie
thereof appertaineth onely vnto them of
the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Gods elect, which are predeſtinated,
which hee proueth by two examples, the
one of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the other of <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
Concerning <hi>Abraham:</hi> hee hadde two
ſonnes, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> though <hi>Iſmael</hi>
were the ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> yea, and circumciſed before <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
had receyued the circumciſion, yet by the
ordinance of God was Iſaac onely reputed
the ſonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the heire of the
promiſe, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> reiected: hee yeeldeth
this reaſon, becauſe they which are the
children according to the fleſh, are not as
children: but only the children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
are accounted for the ſeede. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo he had two ſonnes, <hi>Eſau</hi> and
<hi>Iacob,</hi> both they were twinnes, and nearer
one to the other then <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi>
becauſe they had both the ſame father and
mother, yet before either was borne, one
was choſen, the other refuſed, to ſhewe that
notwithſtanding the generall reiection of
the Iewes, yet God kept his promiſe with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> foraſmuch as it concerneth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
thoſe children of <hi>Abraham</hi> which are
according to faith, and not according to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12228:31"/>
fleſh alone, whom he predeſtinated before
they were borne, not for any foreſight of
any good thing in them, but of his owne
good will and pleaſure, becauſe it was his
will and pleaſure, which in deed are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
but a fewe, beeing compared with the
great multitude of them whom he hath ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
although they be of the ſtock of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
And as for that loue and hatred wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hee loued one, and hated the other,
although it be hiſtorically vnderſtoode, as
it is in Moſes, and Malachy, conſiſteth of
temporall and worldly bleſſings: yet in this
Epiſtle of Saint Paule, it cannot otherwiſe
be conſtered, then of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and of the life to come, as Paule him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the beſt interpreter of himſelfe, dooth
in the wordes which followe explaine his
meaning. For he ſheweth that the hatred of
Eſau was ſuch, as the hardening of Pharao
a reprobate, not onely in this life, but alſo in
the life to come. Moreouer, hee tearmeth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are ſo hated the veſſels of wrath,
prepared to deſtruction, and them which
were ſo loued, as Iacob was loued, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of mercie prepared to glorie, ſaying:
God to ſhewe his wrath, and to make his
power knowen, doth ſuffer with long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the veſſels of wrath prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12228:31"/>
and to declare the riches of his
glorie vpon the veſſels of mercie, which he
hath prepared vnto glorie. Furthermore,
leaſt wee ſhould bee like the Iewes,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> which
when the vaile was put vppon Moſes his
face, did not looke to the end of that which
ſhould be aboliſhed: and therefore theyr
mindes are hardened, and till this day doth
remaine the ſame couering vntaken away:
in the reading of the olde Teſtament wee
muſt not be ignorant that it receyueth two
interpretations, the one hyſtoricall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
myſticall:<note place="margin">Biblioth. ſanc. lib. 3. de vtilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te credendi ad Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum, c. 3</note> as <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> did well obſerue. As for example.
Chriſt ſpeaketh of Iudas in this maner: I
ſpeake not of you all, I know whom I haue
choſen, but it is that the ſcripture might be
fulfilled: he that eateth bread with me hath
lifted vp his heele againſt me.<note place="margin">Iohn 13.</note> But if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
theſe wordes with the wordes of the
prophet from whence they are taken,<note place="margin">Pſal. 41. 9.</note> they
do hyſtorically concerne the perſon of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
and his acquaintance, and cannot bee
vnderſtoode of Chriſt and Iudas, becauſe
Chriſt was without ſinne, but in the fourth
verſe of that Pſalme, he ſayth: Haue mercy
on me, and heale my ſoule, for I haue ſinned
againſt thee. Yet Chriſt in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
dooth myſtically expounde it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12228:32"/>
&amp; the treaſon of Iudas againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> interpreteth this ſaying
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Let his habitation be void, &amp; no
man dwell therein,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 54.</note> of <hi>Iudas,</hi> where in that
place the prophet ſpeaketh in the plural nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 25</note> not of one, but of many, ſaying, Let
their habition be voide, and none dwell in
their tents, ſpeaking of the whole nation of
the Iewes, that the iuſt puniſhment of God
ſhould be iuſtly inflicted vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
of Chriſt, that their city ſhould bee
ſacked, &amp; they diſperſed by the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.
And ſeeing the ſoundeſt interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the ſcriptures, is by other places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> theſe bleſſings &amp; curſings, loue &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,

their poſteritie, it is made manifeſt by the
apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 8.</note> ſaying: By faith <hi>Abraham</hi> abode in
the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange land, as
one that dwelt in tents with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>
heires with him of the ſame promiſe, for he
looked for a foundation, whoſe builder and
maker is god. But I come to the 2. obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17. 18. The Apoſtle writeth in this
maner: For the ſcripture ſaith vnto <hi>Pharao,</hi>
for this purpoſe I haue ſtirred thee vp, that
I might ſhew my power in thee, and that
my name might be declared throughout all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12228:32"/>
earth. Therfore he hath mercy on whom he
will, and whom he will he hardneth. What
then, if God hardned the heart of <hi>Pharao,</hi>
and cauſed him to ſin, is not God the author
of ſin? Nothing leſſe, forasmuch as God is
goodneſſe it ſelfe, his very eſſence is good,
and nothing can proceed from him, but that
which is exceeding good. True it is, as the
Prophet ſayth,<note place="margin">Amos. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Non eſt malum in vrbe quod
non fecit Dominus,</hi> There is no euill in the
citie but the Lord did it. The lord doth not
onely ſuffer the wicked to do euill, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is a doer, and principall agent therein. I
knowe there bee ſome of greater modeſtie
then iudgement in diuinity, which for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the perſon of God, do affirme, that
all the actions of ſathan, and the wicked, are
not done by the will, but onely by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
&amp; ſufferance of God: by which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of theirs they fall into two abſurdities:
the one is, they deny his prouidence which
doth ſo moderat &amp; diſpoſe of al things, that
nothing can come to paſſe otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
hath apointed and decreed before. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, they derogate much &amp; detract from
his omnipotencie, as if he ſhould ſuffer any

He will haue offences to be committed, not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12228:33"/>
as if hee did allowe and approue them, but
that by them hee might execute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo he doth make vſe of the euill
as his inſtruments, himſelfe being good. He
vſed the treaſon of Iudas, and the crueltie of
the Iewes, to their deſtruction, but to our
ſaluation: he hardened Pharao, to his owne
glorie, but for Pharaos puniſhment. But the
intent and purpoſe of Pharao, was not the
ſame which God intended: though the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which God and Pharao did were the
ſame, yet in God it was good, in Pharao it
was euill, becauſe the intent of them both
was not the ſame. Sometime God cauſeth
men to ſinne for their puniſhment, becauſe
oftentimes hee puniſheth one ſinne with an
other: when man hath ſinned grieuouſly,
God cauſeth him to commit a more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
ſinne, or a puniſhment of his former
ſinne, and ſo one ſinne is heaped vpon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that at the day of iudgement their

Chriſt to the Iewes to be crucified, that in it
ſelf it was good, &amp; proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god for the
redemption of mankind: the qualitie of that
fact as it was wilfull murther, ſo it was euill,
and did proceed from the corrupt nature of

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:12228:35"/>
action, doth propoſe a good ende and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
which is ſecret and knowen to himſelf,
but man which doth the action, propoſeth
an other ende and purpoſe, contrary to the
end and purpoſe which God doth propoſe,
and therefore in man it is an offence. In the
ſelf ſame action, both God and the diuel do
worke in the hearts of the wicked, &amp; yet ſo
that hee cannot bee excuſed, becauſe God
concurreth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor yet God accuſed
for doing that which the diuell and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their doings being the ſame, yet
they are different two maner of wayes, to
wit, in the end which they propoſe, &amp; in the
maner of their working. As for example:
When the cattell of Iob were ſtollen away,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note>
in the ſame action were three agents, God,
the diuell, and the Chaldeans: but they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the maner of doing, becauſe God
was the authour, the diuell was but a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
or executor of the will of God, and the
Chaldees were the inſtruments of the diuel
to bring it to paſſe, as alſo they differed in
the end wherunto they did this. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of God was, onely to trie the patience
of Iob, and his faith: the intent of the diuell
was cleane contrarie, to driue Iob to deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
the intent of the Chaldees was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe, but to inrich themſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:12228:35"/>
What then? ſhall wee ſay with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
If it be ſo that God hath predeſtinated
me to die the death, to what end ſhal I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
my ſelfe to do his will and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements?
His counſell and eternall decree
cannot be altered, if he haue ordained mee
to be ſaued, I cannot be damned: if he haue
ordained mee to bee damned, I cannot bee
ſaued, what courſe of life ſoeuer I take: for
my ſaluation dependeth not on my inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
but on his decree, which muſt needes
ſtand. This is like the diſputation of ſeruant
of <hi>Leno</hi> the Stoike Philoſopher, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee was led to the gallowes for his offence,
his maiſter comming thither, ſaid to him: <hi>O
perdite quis ad hoc te impulit?</hi> to whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
<hi>O ſtulte philoſophe, quis me hoc fatum
docuit?</hi> O foole what brought thee hither?
O fooliſh Philoſopher, thou haſt taught
mee, that whatſoeuer was my deſtinie it
could not be auoyded. But wee which are
Chriſtians, muſt not bee ignorant, that in
matters of our ſaluation, God worketh by
his meanes: as he ordaineth ſaluation, ſo he
appoynteth meanes to the attainment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and theſe means are not to be neglected.
God decreed that Abraham ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
therefore he gaue Abraham the gift of
faith, without which there is no ſaluation:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12228:36"/>
and as he could not but be ſaued: ſo he could
not but beleeue. For howſoeuer theſe
things in reſpect of our knowledge are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
yet in reſpect of Gods ordinance
they bee neceſſarie, and can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
bee, becauſe hee hath ſo appoynted.
Hee decreed that <hi>Pharao</hi> ſhould be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
therefore hee hardened his heart that
hee coulde not turne vnto the Lord: for if
hee had turned, hee had beene ſaued. He
decreed that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhoulde bee a caſtaway,
therefore hee gaue him not his grace to
repent, whereas true repentaunce is a
meane to ſaluation. And if hee had trulye
repented, without doubt hee had beene
ſaued.<note place="margin">2. Reg. 20.</note> If GOD haue decreed to adde
to the dayes of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> fifteene yeares
longer, he hath alſo appoynted that <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi>
during thoſe fifteene yeares, ſhoulde
take his refections and bodily ſuſtenaunce
whereby life is preſerued. VVherefore
let vs for our partes followe the meanes
which God hath appoynted to ſaluation,
as prayer, hearing, the woorde, receyuing
the Sacraments, fayth, amendement of
life, godly and Chriſtian conuerſation,
and then we may ſecure our ſelues, that
as God hath vouchſafed vs the meanes
ſo hee hath predeſtinated vs to ſaluation.

But I come to the third and laſt concluſion.</p>
            <p>Chriſt died not effectually for all,</p>
            <p>Though the death of Chriſt were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the redemption of all mankind,
yet hee dyed not effectually for all, for as
much as all men are not ſaued, therefore
to manie, that is, to them which are not

to thoſe for whom Chriſt doth not pray, to

               <hi>Huberus</hi> a brocher of new and ſtraunge
opinions, whereof this is one, that Chriſt
died effectually for all, alleageth ſo manie
common places, being altogither friuolous,
and nothing pertaining to the purpoſe, as
would be tedious for mee to repeate them,
and I wiſh it woulde not offend your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to heare them. Himſelf diuideth them
into three claſſes, as he dooth tearme them.
The firſt tende to this purpoſe: to prooue
that Chriſt died effectually for all, in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie
without exception. The ſecond,
to ſhew that he died as effectually for Cain
and Iudas, as for Peter and Paule, for the
godly, as for the godleſſe. The thirde, to
ſhew that he died for all, or elſe (as he ſayth)
which is <hi>dictu horrendum,</hi> not to be ſpoken.
<hi>Deum grauiſſimorum ſcelerum reum peragi,</hi>
That God is guiltie of heinous crimes. A
verie ſtrange and blaſphemous ſpeech.</p>
            <p>His places to proue that Chriſt died ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
for all in a generalitie,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> are theſe
that followe.<note place="margin">Iohn 16.</note> The ſeede of the woman

that the Serpents head ſhould bee broken,
that the prince of this world ſhould be caſt
out, that the diuell ſhould bee aboliſhed, if
yet the greateſt part of men are vnredee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Moreouer, the reſtoring againe of
man, is in as ample maner as was the fall of
man.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> But as by the diſobedience of one (that
is <hi>Adam)</hi> many were made ſinners: ſo by the
obedience of one (that is Chriſt) many are
made righteous. Where, by many, all are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood:
ſo then, as in <hi>Adam</hi> all are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſo in Chriſt all are redeemed. The
kingdome of Chriſt the conquerour,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> is lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then the kingdome of the diuell,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> which
is conquered.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> God willeth all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> He will haue none to periſh. He ſpared

God hath reconciled the worlde vnto
himſelfe, And many other places, if diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in wordes, yet parallell to theſe, and in
effect one and the ſame. Which places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
are verie ſufficient to prooue that
Chriſt died for all, but not that his death
appertained to all, or that he died effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for all, but onely for the beleeuers. And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12228:38"/>
therefore they are but a fallacie in Logicke,
called <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> they proue onely that
ſaluation is offered vnto all, which we doe
not denie, but they do not proue that ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſealed to any more then to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
which is the queſtion in controuerſie
betweene vs.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, ſome of theſe places are by
him miſtaken. For the brooſing of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
head, is not to be vnderſtoode of the
nullitie or paucitie of them which ſhall bee
ſubiect to the kingdome of Sathan, as
though the Serpents head beeing broken,
and the diuell vanquiſhed, all mankinde
were ſo deliuered, that all were ſaued, and
none damned: But it is to bee vnderſtood
of the triumph of Chriſt ouer the diuell, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſinne, and ouer death, that as by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
mankinde was ouerthrowne, ſo by man
the diuell ſhould be ſubdued againe: that as
before all men were bondſlaues to Sathan,
now Satan himſelfe ſhould be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſubiection, that nowe he ſhould haue no
more power but by Chriſts permiſſion, for
as much as he hath the key of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
pit,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> and the great chaine in his hande,
and he bindeth the great dragon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12228:38"/>
               <hi>Adam,</hi> and our riſing againe by the ſecond,
and ſheweth that a greater good is deriued
to man by the obedience of the ſecond, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was the puniſhment which was inflicted by
the diſobedience of the firſt. But how? Not
as then al which before in <hi>Adam</hi> were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nowe in Chriſt were ſaued. But as in
<hi>Adam</hi> all were damned, ſo in Chriſt ſome
are ſaued: for if all were ſaued in Chriſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
were no vſe of hell, of the diuell and his
angels, which are appointed for the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of wicked men. But in theſe three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
appeareth the largeneſſe of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
deriued vnto vs by the death of Chriſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the loſſe which we indured by <hi>Adams</hi>
fall. Firſt, our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption is a greater &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
worke then our creation: <hi>Facilius est
creare quam lapſos reſtituere, ex nihilo bonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
quàm ex malo bonum facere.</hi> It is more eaſie
to create vs then to reſtore vs, when we had
declined from our firſt integritie, of nothing
to make vs good, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being euill to make vs
good: and therfore by our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption a more
rich treaſure is heaped vpon vs, but ſo that it
is to be vnderſtood of the life to come, not
of this preſent life. Secondly, by the fall of
<hi>Adam</hi> was loſt a earthly kingdome, by the
death of chriſt was gained an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which is ſo much the greater benefit,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12228:39"/>
by howe much heauen is higher then the
earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, although before the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>
the righteouſnes of man was pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
now it is full of imperfections: it was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
inherent,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> it is now but onely by imputation
(for as <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, in mee,
that is my fleſh, dwelleth no good) yet that
righteouſneſſe which was in man before his
fall, had not onely annexed vnto it <hi>Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
peccandi,</hi> Poſſibilitie to ſinne, but alſo
<hi>Procliuitatem ad peccatum,</hi> It was verie
prone and apt to ſinne, and continued in
him but a verie ſhort time, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
which we ſhall bee indued withall
by the death of Chriſt, in the life to come
ſhall farre exceede, becauſe it ſhall alſo be
inherent in vs, and that not for a ſeaſon, but
for euer, and it ſhall haue all poſſibilitie of
falling taken away. So that in a word, where
the Apoſtle ſayth: By the diſobedience of
one man, many are made ſinners, by many
hee meaneth all: but where hee ſayeth,
by the obedience of one manie are made
righteous, by many hee meaneth not all,
but ſome: yet wee gaine more by Chriſts
death, then by <hi>Adams</hi> fal, I meane we which
are redeemed, but the greatneſſe of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
beſtowed vpon vs by his death, doth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12228:39"/>
not conſiſt in the multitude of them which
are to be ſaued, but in the great prerogatiue
giuen to the paucitie of them which are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> For, if we weigh the number, Straite is
the gate which leadeth to life, and few there
be that finde it, but broad is the way which
leadeth to deſtruction, and many there bee
that enter in.</p>
            <p>In his ſecond order of common places,
he commeth nearer to the purpoſe, to ſhew
that Chriſt died effectually for them which
are damned in as much as they were by him
redeemed, but afterward voluntarily, &amp; by
their owne free will they made an apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and renounced this benefite of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
whereof they were once made
partakers. His places are theſe, and others
like vnto them:<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 4.</note> For it is impoſſible, that
they which were once lightened, and haue
taſted of the heauenly gift, and were made
partakers of the holy Ghoſt, if they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
ſhould bee renued againe by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſeeing they crucifie againe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the ſonne of God, and make a mock
of him. Doe yee not knowe that yee
are the Temple of GOD,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> and that the
ſpirite of GOD dwelleth in you? If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man deſtroy the Temple of God, him
will God deſtroy, for the temple of God is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12228:40"/>
holy which you are.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 11.</note> Through they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſhall the weake brother periſh,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 1.</note> for
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt died. Falſe prophets ſhal bring
in damnable hereſies, denying the Lorde
that hath bought them, and bring vppon
themſelues ſwift damnation. He that hath
not theſe things is blinde,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 9.</note> and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
that hee was purged from his olde
ſinnes.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 4.</note> Ye are aboliſhed from Chriſt who
ſo euer are iuſtifyed by the lawe,<note place="margin">Iohn 15.</note> yee are
fallen from grace.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 12.</note> I am the true Vine,
and who ſo abydeth not in mee is caſt
foorth. Beholde the bountifulneſſe of
God towardes thee, if thou continue in
his bountifulneſſe, or elſe thou ſhalt bee
cut off.</p>
            <p>Vpon which commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> places he inferreth
this concluſion: They once beleeued, they
were lightned, they receiued y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knowledge
of the truth, they were made partakers of
the holy Ghoſt, taſted of the heauenly gift,
were waſhed, ſanctified, made the temples
of God, the members of Chriſt, the Lord
bought them. Therefore they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
and Chriſt dyed effectually for
them, and that they are not ſaued, it is
not any decree of God from euerlaſting,
but the free will which was in themſelues,
that being redeemed, they renounced the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12228:40"/>
benefite of their redemption, when it was
in their power to haue receiued it. To theſe
places I anſwere: That indeed in outward
appearance they were waſhed, ſanctified,
redeemed, made the members of Chriſt, and
Temples of the holy Ghoſt, but not in
truth and in veritie, for as much as they
which are indeed the children of God, can
neuer reuolt and ſtart backe from the faith,
and their ſtate of ſaluation. Our Sauiour
ſaith:<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> My ſheepe heare my voyce, and I
know them, and they follow me and I giue
them eternall life and they ſhall neuer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
neyther ſhall any plucke them out of
mine hande, my father which gaue mee
them is greater then all, and none is able to
take them out of my Fathers hande. And
the Apoſtle ſayeth of the falſe prophets:
they went from vs,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 12. 19</note> but they were not of
vs, for if they had beene of vs, they woulde
haue continued with vs, but this commeth
to paſſe, that it might appeare that they
were not all of vs. And concerning free will
which hee affirmeth to be the cauſe of their
apoſtacie, the time will not permit mee
to ſay much, onely this in a worde: The
will of man is neither as the Eagle which
alwayes with ſtedfaſt eyes beholdeth the
brightneſſe of the Sunne, neither as a ſtone
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12228:41"/>
which alwayes falleth downe from the top
to the bottome, for neyther doth it alwayes
ſoare vp aloft, nor decline to the centre, but
ſometime it is in diuine conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, ſome
times againe it meditateth vpon vanity. It is
not dead, &amp; yet it liueth not: it is not blind,
and yet it ſeeth not: as the ſeede ſowne in
the ground is not conſumed, and yet it
ſpringeth not vp without the warmth and
comfort of the Sunne: as the eye in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is not blinde, and yet it neither liueth
nor ſeeth, without the eſpeciall grace of
God.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of agents: the
one is <hi>ex Placito,</hi> and that is God: the other
is, <hi>ex neceſſitate,</hi> and that is nature, then
there muſt needes bee a third, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in a mediocritie betweene them both:
for, <hi>Poſitis extremis ponuntur &amp; Media.</hi> No
man is good agaynſt his will: ſo no man
hath power to will any thing that is good,
vnleſſe God giue him the will.<note place="margin">Ier. 10.</note> For as the
Prophet ſpeaketh. The way of man is not
in himſelfe, neither is it in man to walke and
direct his ſteppes. We are not of our ſelues
ſufficient to thinke a good thought, as of
our ſelues,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> but all our ſufficiencie is of God.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note>
No man commeth to Chriſt vnleſſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12228:41"/>
that do I not: the euill which I would not
do, that do I, (ſayth the Apoſtle.) But there
is a ſchoole diſtinction betweene compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and neceſſitie: For, <hi>Qui neceſſariò pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,
nihilominus voluntariò peccat.</hi> Though
man cannot chooſe but offend, yet hee is
willing to offend, but that is no libertie, or
freedome of his will.</p>
            <p>In the third he doth not ſo much diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as blaſpheme againſt the
maieſtie of God. As, if all mankind be not
redeemed by Chriſt, neither was by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
ordained to life, that he may be iuſtly
accuſed of notorious crueltie an iniuſtice,
his wordes are, <hi>Immenſae iniuſticiae, doli, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitatis,

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> Euill wordes corrupt good

when hee diſputed with the diuell about

thee. But to come to the reaſons which he
alledgeth, ſetting aſide his blaſphemous
wordes, hee argueth in this manner: To
holde with <hi>Caluin,</hi> that Chriſt dyed not to
ſaue all, but onelie thoſe which in his will
bee had predeſtinated, were plaine Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metiſme,
Paganiſme, Saraſaniſme. For
firſt, that were to take away all comfort,
which is deriued vnto vs by the paſſion of
Chriſt, to annihilate the vertue of his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12228:42"/>
death, to ouerthrowe the foundation of
fayth, for fayth cannot ſtand being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon particulars, the vniuerſalitie of
the redemption of mankind being denied,
becauſe then euerie man in particular may
doubt of himſelfe, whether Chriſt bee his
Redeemer or no, when it is helde that he
hath redeemed but a fewe. Secondly, it
were to aboliſh the miniſterie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
for as much as the duetie of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Gods worde is to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
and to pronounce remiſſion of
ſinnes through Chriſt vnto all, to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Sacraments to all, and not to a few.
To theſe abſurde concluſions, I may ſay
with <hi>Ierome:</hi>

confutation of theyr abſurdities.<note place="margin">Pelag. c. 4</note> For
what man but meanely inſtructed in the
rudiments of Chriſtian Religion, can bee
ignoraunt that fayth is grounded vppon
the trueth of Gods promiſe in his ſonne
Ieſus Chriſt, but the application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
muſt not be made to all in generall,
but to euerye one in particular by his owne
ſelfe? For, a true, liuelye, and iuſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fayth of a Chriſtian man, is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined:
To bee a ſure and certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the loue of God towards himſelfe,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12228:43"/>
which beeing grounded vpon the truth of
Gods promiſe in Chriſt is reuealed and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the holy Ghoſt. And that is it which
the Prophet ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Habak. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Iuſtus ſua fide viuet.</hi>
The iuſt man ſhall liue by his owne faith:
and the Apoſtles Creede beginneth <hi>Credo,</hi>
I beleeue, not <hi>Credimus,</hi> We beleeue. And
Iob ſaith of himſelfe in particular:<note place="margin">Iob. 19.</note> I knowe
that my redeemer liueth, that though
wormes deſtroy this bodie, yet I ſhall ſee
God in my fleſh.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> The ſpirit of God beareth
witneſſe with our ſpirit that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> Becauſe (ſayth <hi>Paule)</hi> yee are
ſonnes, God hath ſent the ſpirit of his ſonne
into your hearts, which crieth Abba, father.
So that euery true Chriſtian may by this
doctrine of predeſtination, that Chriſt died
onely for them whom hee hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before, comfort himſelfe that hee is one
of them which are predeſtinated, foraſmuch
as he beleeueth, &amp; the ſpirit of God which
is within him, euen that ſpirit of comfort,
doth witneſſe to his ſpirit that he is the ſon
of God, and therefore aſſure himſelfe of his
owne ſaluation, without entring into the
ſecrets of God, to iudge of other men whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhall bee ſaued or no. As for the
miniſterie of the Goſpell, it continueth the
ſame which it was euer from the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12228:43"/>
For though fewe are choſen, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are called, and only God knoweth who
are his. Therfore the Miniſter muſt preach
ſaluation to al, <hi>Paule</hi> muſt plant, <hi>Apollo</hi> muſt
water, and leaue it to God to giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
<hi>Peter</hi> muſt caſt his net into the ſea,
and leaue to God the ſucceſſe of his labors.
The Miniſters of Gods word muſt doe as
the ſeruants of the great king, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made
a marriage for his ſonne, which went out
into the high way, and inuited all without
exception, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerie one whom they could
finde, both good and badde, and bid them
to the wedding. As God ſuffereth the ſunne
to ſhine, and raine to raine vpon the badde,
as well as the good, with all indifferencie.
No man knoweth whom God hath called,
or at what houre hee will call men, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will call them or not, and therefore
we muſt not refuſe to do our indeuour, wee
muſt not deſpaire of any mans conuerſion
vnto the fayth, or perſeuerance after his
conuerſion in the fayth. And becauſe God
hath two willes, one ſecret, and knowne to
himſelfe alone, the other reuealed in the
ſcriptures, and imparted to vs: in his ſecrete
will hee will haue ſome to bee ſaued: in his
reuealed will hee commaundeth that the
Goſpel ſhould be preached to all, we muſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12228:44"/>
not inquire after his ſecrete will, which is
knowne onely to himſelfe, but his reuealed
will which is knowne to our ſelues: for that
ſeruant which knoweth his maſters will, and
dooth it not, ſhall bee beaten with many
ſtripes. Thus counſailing euerie one that
will enter into the conſideration of ſuch
deepe poynts of diuinitie, that they would
<hi>ſapere, non altum,</hi> but ad <hi>ſobrietatem,</hi> that they
would be wiſe, but with ſobrietie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
with ſaint <hi>Paule:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> O the deepeneſſe of
the riches, both of the wiſdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, howe vnſearchable are his
iudgements, and his waies paſt finding out?
For who hath knowne the mind of God?
or who was his counſayler? (Wee muſt
not demaunde reaſon in matters of fayth,
becauſe fayth goeth beyond reaſon) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
