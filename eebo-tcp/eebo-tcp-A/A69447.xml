            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40108:3"/>
Of all diſmall and periculous acted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions there is none more obnoxious to State or Common wealth, then thoſe of conſpiracy, whoſe malitious and braine-ſicke projects are continually, and hourely forging deſtruction upon the Anvill of Envie and hate, which is the Mother of all pernicious imaginations, (examples of conſpiracy are manifold,) but to omit thoſe fore-paſt relations, I will here fully and truely declare a late diveliſh and helliſh Plot, firſt intended, and long concealed by the ſilent tongue of ſecrecy, yet the Al-ſeeing Eye of Gods divine Iuſtice, hath found out their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and diſſipated their malitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>Not farre from the <hi>Neweries,</hi> there is a Caſtle commonly called by the name of <hi>Caſtle-patricke,</hi> inhabited by the Lord <hi>Dempſey,</hi> the antienteſt Rebell now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſaid Lord bought all the beſt Warlike and comelieſt horſes he could get at any rate, he alſo tooke up Oxen, Sheep, Butter Cheeſe, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb facs="tcp:40108:3"/>
neceſſary for humane ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be unpriſed and unbought, and alſo divers quantities of Powder and Ammunition, he alſo ſet 100. Smiths at worke ever ſince foure yeares before the Rebellion, knowing what their evill and damnable intentions were, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in this Caſtle for the ſpace of foure yeares and a halfe, ſtill waiting for his opportunity, and having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that the Proteſtant Army were fully reſolved to aſſault the ſaid Caſtle, (not knowing what Damnable Plots were in agitation againſt them.) He made it knowne to his ſervants; where he got every thing in Order ready to blow up the whole Army, but one of thoſe which were in the Caſtle, being troubled in mind, and fore ſeeing what would follow, thought it expedient to impart it to one of his Companions, who conſulting together got out of the Caſtle, and came to the Proteſtant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where they made it knowne to ſome
<pb facs="tcp:40108:4"/>
of the chiefe Commanders, who with all ſpeed haſtened towards the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; but ere they came thither the Lord <hi>Dempſey</hi> was got out, with all his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Armes, ſaving onely one old man who was left to giue fire to the powder, there he was to looſe his owne life voluntarily.</p>
            <p>The intention of this prodigious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is not yet openly manifeſted to the popular expectations of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the vulgar cenſure is variable and wee may well and iuſtly. imagine that as it proceedeth from the divell - ſoe the intention could, not but be diabolicall and nefarious.</p>
            <p>O the Ingendred mallice of man? O the inteſtine and irremeable Laborinth of wicked and pernicious intentions, when Superſtition and Roman Idolatry, worketh in ſecred miſchiefe and private evill, then doth it ſo infinitly ſwell with impious cogitations that it ſuddenly burſts into extreames and by Gods all
<pb facs="tcp:40108:4"/>

            <p>Conſpiracy may fitly be compared to to a <hi>Hidra</hi> having many Heads and one Body, ſeemeth prodigious and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the ſpectators.</p>
