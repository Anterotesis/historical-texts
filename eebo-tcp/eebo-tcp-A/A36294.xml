            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
GRAND IMPOSTOR
DEFEATED.</head>
            <p>BY the aid of Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi>'s Aſtrological Intelligence, I was brought to
a moſt famous piece of ſelf-commending Eloquence; entituled, <hi>The
Earl of</hi> Caſtlemain<hi>'s Manifeſto;</hi> a piece, I muſt confeſs, that I never
ſo much as heard of, until <hi>Gadbury</hi> mention'd it in the Preface of
his <hi>Almanack;</hi> neither do I much wonder that I did not, ſince there
are ſuch ways found out to encourage, or at the leaſt connive at, all ſorts of
Popiſh, and the moſt Villanous Books and Pamphlets, daily Printed and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
by the Papiſts, that ever Men or Devils invented; which cannot be done but
with the greateſt ſcandal and reflexion upon the Government imaginable; and yet
how are we to expect any better, ſince mercinary Ignorants have the peruſing of,
and liberty to hinder or let paſs what they can get moſt Money by; and having
once paſſed the Preſs, there are as many, who not altogether ſo much for Gain, as
out of Impudence and Ignorance, voluntarily become the Publiſhers thereof. And
(to ſpeak ſomewhat modeſtly of the man) ſuch a one is <hi>Sam. Carr,</hi> at the Sign of
the <hi>Kings-head</hi> at the Weſt-end of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who was the Publiſher of this
rare piece of <hi>Caſtlemainiſme;</hi> which hath not ſo much of weighty miſchef in it,
as it hath of Scandal, and the moſt groſs Abuſes and Abſurdities put upon the
Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> in Nature; tho' there it was that he eſcap'd the deſerv'd
Puniſhment of a Traytor. But Gentlemen, notwithſtanding all his good-luck,
I am ſtill the ſame; I am certain, that when I acted Treaſon, I was not aſleep,
I know what I ſaid and did; and I know what others ſaid and did to me; and
therefore in ſpight of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi>'s Teeth I do aver, That what I ſwore againſt
him, was in all reſpects undeniably true; Nor is he ever able to make it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to the Judgment of Impartial men: And I do farther tell ye Gentlemen,
That all his <hi>Manifeſto</hi> is a meer conjumblement either of Lies and Forgeries, or
at beſt, of pitiful ſhifts and evaſions: Now then, becauſe I am unwilling to tire
your Patience with a long Preamble, I ſhall take the matter juſt as it offereth
it ſelf, ſo far as it concerneth me; and ſhew you not only wherein he would
impoſe upon the Government, where the King himſelf is reflected upon, where
the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> is ſo groſly abus'd; and in a word, how he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to impoſe upon the whole World a moſt notorious Lye, which he calls his
<hi>beſt Defence;</hi> and indeed ſo it might have prov'd, had it been more ſtrong and
cunningly inſinuated; but as Liars ought to have good Memories, or as furious
Cholerick men are ſaid to be no Conjurers; ſo either his Lordſhips Memory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106899:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fail'd him, or elſe he left his beſt contrivance in the <hi>30th</hi> Page of his <hi>Compendium;</hi>
for ſurely had it not been ſo, he could not but have found out ſome better way
of Geometrizing his Arguments than that in which they here ſhew themſelves.
For do but read <hi>pag.</hi> 12, 13, 14. where he tells the World, <hi>That one Mrs.</hi> Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<hi>viſiting the Priſons in the beginning of the Troubles, and coming to me about
Charity for the Poor there; I told her, I would not only give her ſomething, but
would allow them Weekly alſo; and thus my Lords I ſtill do</hi> (ſpeaking then to
the Lords of the Privy Council) <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account, and the St.</hi> Omers <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
(which I had provided for my own Defence, in caſe of Tryal, and which I
Lodged at her Houſe) ſhe came frequently to me; and (among the News and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of the Priſons) told me one day, ſhe had taken out of</hi> Newgate <hi>for</hi> 3 l. <hi>10s.
a Young man vers'd a little in the Law, whom ſhe thought very fit to look after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
deſperate Debts (to the value of 3 or</hi> 4000l.) <hi>due to her Husband, who had
formerly been a conſiderable</hi> French <hi>Merchant; this Fellow was it ſeems</hi> Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<hi>now</hi> Dangerfield; <hi>and him ſhe ſent ſometimes to my Houſe on ordinary Errands;
but preſently he plaid me as Villanous a Trick as could be imagin'd, conſidering the
times we live in: the thing was this; The five Jeſuits being (on the Twentieth of</hi>
June <hi>laſt) Executed, he came within very few days after to me, either in my Lady</hi>
Powis<hi>'s Name, or pretending to go to her afterwards, and asked me if I thought it
convenient to have their Speeches Printed; I told him by all means, for why ſhould
ſuch Excellent and Loyal things fall to the Ground? He replyed, That it would
coſt Ten Pounds; Well ſaid I, if it does, tell my Lady I'l willingly give ſomething
towards it; and ſo he departed. Not long after, I went to the</hi> Tower <hi>to ſee my
Lord; and as ſoon as I met him, ſaid he, Why did you ſend a Stranger to me?
and beſides, what have I to do with the Jeſuits Speeches? Has any body (anſwer'd
I) been with you in my Name concerning that affair? Yes, (replyed he) one</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,
<hi>whom I ſent away as he came, as ſoon as he acquainted me with the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
This Accident ſurprizing and troubling me not a little, I took my leave of
his Lordſhip, aſſuring him that I never ſent the Fellow, and ſo went ſtraight to
Mrs.</hi> Cellier, <hi>and I acquainted her what the Spark had done; and alſo told her, He
was ſo great a Villain, that if ever he came any more to me, I would order my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to Kick him out of my Houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So my Lord! I dare ſay you think you have claw'd me off now? you'l never
leave nibling till you 'r caught i'th Trap again; What a piece of Chimerical
whim's here? were there not more of Malice and Miſchief forc'd along with
your inſinuation, than either Truth or Honeſty, I could not have ſo much Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
as to appear in Print againſt ſo great a piece of incoherent Nonſence.
But for publick Satisfaction, and in Vindication of the Naked Truth, my King
and Country, and in my own Juſtification, I ſhall prove by fact the material
parts of your aſſertions to be moſt egregiouſly falſe, and meer Fictions contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on purpoſe to impoſe upon the World the belief of a notorious Lie: And
in order to it, Gentlemen, I crave leave to trouble you with theſe few remarks,
wherein, as near as poſſibly I can, with my hand upon my Heart, and in all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
by the Grace of God, I ſhall here declare the Truth for my ſelf, and do
his Lordſhip all the fair play imaginable; which I leave to the Judgment of
every Impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That one Mrs.</hi> Cellier <hi>viſiting the Priſons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>about Charity for the Poor,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>I told her I would not only then give her ſomething, but would allow them Weekly
alſo;</hi> Here's fine Stuff! and here all the World may plainly ſee that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>
was employ'd by the Papiſts to ranſack and rummage the Priſons, under the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106899:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pretence of diſperſing Charity, to try who ſhe could find out, <hi>That was fit for
a bold and daring Enterpriſe;</hi> and the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> it ſeems, was willing to put
his Hand to the Plough, and make a Weekly Allowance of Money in that, as
he had done in other Affairs of the like nature before.</p>
            <p>He goes on: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which account, and that of the St.</hi> Omers <hi>Witneſſes, (which
I had provided for my own Defence in Caſe of Tryal, and which I Lodged at Mrs.</hi>
Celliers <hi>Houſe, ſhe came frequently to me.</hi> Here, I think is one of the faireſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
of Fact that can poſſibly be; for I only charg'd his Lordſhip <hi>with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
of the St.</hi> Omers <hi>Witneſſes what they ſhould teſtifie on the behalf of</hi> Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn
<hi>and the five Jeſuits.</hi> And he tells us <hi>he provided</hi> them for <hi>his own Defence,</hi>
and undoubtedly they were deſign'd to have Teſtiff'd at his Tryal, had they not
been ſo often baffled, which put his Lordſhip to find out a better Expedient,
by raiſing a ſcruple in the Judges Conſciences about the validity of my Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But will any man of reaſon believe, that the St. <hi>Omers Witneſſes</hi> which
his Lordſhip <hi>had provided for his own Defence,</hi> (as he ſays) were never conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, to know what they could, or rather were to Teſtifie on the behalf of
his Lordſhip, in caſe there had been any ſuch occaſion? If ſo, then what I
have alledged againſt him muſt be looked upon as falſe and Villanous: But if
they will but conſider how material, and how common a thing it is, for a
perſon that is capable of giving Evidence, to be conſulted withal, to know
what he can teſtifie, before there is occaſion to uſe him; they cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
much more care was taken by his Lordſhip of the St. <hi>Omers Witneſſes</hi> who
were to give a falſe and forg'd Teſtimony, (as its plain they did, and which
appear'd as clear as the Sun to the whole Court, upon the Tryals of the <hi>Five
Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Langhorn,</hi> to which Tryals I refer the Reader for his ſatisfaction)
I ſay then, I hope there is no body but will believe that the Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi>
could otherwiſe chuſe, (having provided them for his own Defence) but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe
Money to buy Cloaths, and equip thoſe his Novitiates in Perjury. That
he allow'd them ſo much ſpending money <hi>per</hi> Week; and that he paid Mrs. <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
ſeven Shillings <hi>per</hi> Week a piece for their Lodging and Diet, which could
not amount to leſs than ten or twelve pounds <hi>per</hi> week, for there were 15 or
16 of them in number; all this may rationally be ſuppos'd: But that which
follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Lordſhip did inſtruct them daily, what they ſhould teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for himſelf, (which he calls making Proviſion for his Defence) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
for <hi>Langhorn</hi> and the Five Jeſuits, in which ſenſe let his Confeſſion be
Recorded to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>He runs on: <hi>That ſhe</hi> (Mrs. Cellier) <hi>told him one day, ſhe had taken out of</hi>
Newgate <hi>for Three Pounds Ten Shillings, a Young man vers'd a little in the Law,
whom ſhe thought very fit to look after ſeveral deſperate Debts (to the value of</hi>
3 <hi>or</hi> 4000 l. <hi>due to her Husband,</hi> &amp;c.) How far this Fiction hath been Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I know not, but I am ſorry to ſee his Lordſhip has no better a ſhift, than
this old one of Mrs. <hi>Celliers,</hi> which was invented by her for my particular uſe;
a Story ſo incongruous and unlikely, that none but a Drowning Lord in a weak
Cauſe would have laid hold on; which is plainly ſeen thus. He ſays Mrs.
<hi>Cellier</hi> told him, ſhe had taken me out of <hi>Newgate</hi> for Three Pounds Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
and I ſay, That before I was diſcharged out of Priſon, and made fit for
their Plotting buſineſs, it coſt them near Three Hundred Pounds. He ſays ſhe
thought me very fit to look after deſperate Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for that reaſon was
at Three Pounds Ten Shillings Charge, to take me out of Priſon. In anſwer
to which I ſay and will prove it by more than one Witneſs, that ſhe enquir'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106899:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fore ever ſhe came to me, for a man of a bold and daring Spirit; and receiving
information according to her Enquiry, ſhe then came to me, and did Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
me to no other end or purpoſe, than what my firſt <hi>Narrative</hi> makes
mention of, which is far enough from what his Lordſhip would inſinuate.
And I do farther, in the Preſence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> affirm, That the end of my
being taken out of Priſon, to get in her Husbands deſperate Debts, is as
falſe and as prepoſterous a Lie as ever was told: In a word, it is a thing that
never was heard of until after I had been Committed by the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
for conveying of the Treaſonable Letters into Mr. <hi>Manſells</hi> Chamber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
at which time ſhe Forged that Excuſe, as you may find it in the 52 Page of my
firſt Narrative (apprehending that ſhe and I ſhould be Examin'd apart, and
therefore ſhe ſent me that Note, wrote by her own hand, to prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.)
And as for her Husbands having any ſuch Debts, as could
amount to the value of a Groat, much more to the value of Three or Four
Thouſand Pounds, I am ſure is altogether as falſe; and that I may be able to
prove that as well as the reſt to be a Device, I do here offer to produce ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Teſtimony, That at that time, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the Year 1678, her Husband
was taken by all the Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> that knew him, to be many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Pounds worſe than nothing. Nay, that I may once more clear up this
great point, upon which thoſe of the Popiſh party hinge all their accumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I do hereby challenge all the World to ſay impartially, That I ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of them or any of them, One Shilling more or leſs, either in the Name
or for the Uſe of Mrs. <hi>Cellier:</hi> Now, I having made this Challenge in Print two
or three times already, and no perſon hath yet come in to contradict it, one
would have thought that no Papiſt (how ſilly ſoever) eſpecially a Lord,
would have had the confidence to make any further uſe of that Lie; it ſeems
his Lordſhip was very hard put to it, that he was forc'd to borrow <hi>Mother
Damnables</hi> Thread-bare Shams. But becauſe I will yet ſet the thing more clear,
pray do but conſider, if I had been taken out of Priſon only to get in Mr.
<hi>Celliers</hi> deſperate Debts, Firſt, how the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> came to be concerned
in ſo large a Contribution, as Thirty odd Pounds towards my Enlargement,
which I can prove to be certainly true, by the Papers that were taken in Mrs.
<hi>Celliers</hi> Houſe. Secondly, Whether or no the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> all the reſt of
the <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> Mr. <hi>Webb,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Jeane</hi> at <hi>Peterly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nevil,</hi>
alias <hi>Payne, Gadbury, Munſon, Kemeſh</hi> and <hi>Knowles</hi> the Popiſh Prieſts, <hi>Donner
Rigaut</hi> the <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchant; nay, and the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> too, were Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi>
Debtors, and what Money I demanded of them in his Name? Thirdly, How
I came to be brought to the Lord <hi>Peterborough,</hi> from thence to the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> and from thence to His Majeſty; and whether theſe were Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi>
Debtors too or no? And laſt of all, how often I waited upon the King, what
I ſaid to His Majeſty? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then I hope it may eaſily be diſcerned, that I
was taken out of Priſon for ſome other end, than to get in a Bankrupts deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Debts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Fellow was it ſeems</hi> Willoughby, <hi>now</hi> Dangerfield, <hi>and him ſhe ſent ſometimes
to my Houſe on ordinary Errands,</hi> &amp;c. I know not what his Lordſhip calls ordinary
Errands, but you ſhall hear how I gain'd his Eſteem for my Diligence; for let
him ſpeak never ſo contemptibly of me in his Paſſion, yet he at that time
employ'd me to get <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> out of Priſon; he ordered me to employ
divers perſons to Write out Letters and Liſts of Names, concerning the <hi>Sham-Presbyterian
Plot,</hi> then ſet on foot by the Papiſts. He peruſed the Papers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106899:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with me, wherein was contained the Charge which <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> were to
make good againſt Mr. <hi>Otes:</hi> He was concerned in the drawing up of the falſe
<hi>Affidavits</hi> that <hi>Lane</hi> ſwore to, before Sir <hi>James Butler:</hi> And he was angry with
me, for that I had refuſed the Propoſal which the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> had
made me; which was to KILL THE KING, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
calls in terms, a being ſent to him <hi>upon ordinary Errands.</hi> All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſitive Truths, I am bound to maintain in the face of the Nation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
he eſcap'd the deſerv'd Puniſhment of theſe Crimes.</p>
            <p>But preſently he play'd me as Villanous a Trick as could be, <hi>(ſays his Lordſhip)</hi>
conſidering the times we live in, <hi>&amp;c. Why, what was that, pray?</hi> The five Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
being Executed, he came to me, and asked if I thought convenient to have their
Speeches Printed; I told him by all means, for why ſhould ſuch Excellent and
Loyal things fall to the Ground? He replyed, That it would Coſt Ten Pounds;
Well ſaid I, if it does, I'le willingly give ſomething towards it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was pretty well ſaid, but moſt miſchievouſly intended, as you may find
by his commending the Excellence and Loyalty of thoſe <hi>Trayterous Jeſuits
Speeches,</hi> which cannot but be taken for the moſt groſs, Equivocating Shams
that ever were endeavoured to be impos'd upon the World. And I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
let but any man of Impartial Judgment, who has but heard of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
compare the Tryal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his Dying, <hi>alias</hi> Lying Speech, with Mr.
<hi>Jenniſons</hi> Depoſitions, and then compare thoſe and the <hi>Five Jeſuits Tryals,</hi> and
their <hi>Speeches</hi> together, and then ſumm up the moſt probable circumſtances fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on both ſides, certainly he cannot but find them the moſt pernicious Lies that
ever were told, I mean the Speeches he mentions in his <hi>Manifeſto:</hi> And yet that
a Lord ſhould concern himſelf in the patching up of ſuch Stuff as this, is ſo
ſcandalous a thing that—but what Lord is it? Why a <hi>Popiſh,</hi> an
<hi>Iriſh Lord,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Caſtlemaine:</hi> ſay ye me ſo! I thought he and his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi>
had been too well known, to give out <hi>Manifeſto</hi>'s, &amp;c. But all this
while, where's the <hi>Villainous Trick</hi> he ſpoke of? Why, <hi>Not long after,</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>I went to the</hi> Tower <hi>to ſee my Lord; and as ſoon as I met him, ſaid he, Why did
you ſend a Stranger to me? What have I to do with the Jeſuits Speeches?</hi> Ay, what
indeed? How ſhall a man do to know what Lord he means? for ought I can tell
he might go to pay his reſpects to the <hi>Earl of Danby;</hi> and to his Lordſhip I was
a Stranger, and therefore he might well <hi>look with an apparent diſſatisfaction,</hi> and
demand, <hi>What he had to do with the Jeſuits Speeches?</hi> But this I am ſure of,
had he gone to any of the other Lords, they could never have ſaid, with any
Truth, that I was ſuch a Stranger to them as his Lordſhip pretends. And if I
miſtake not, they had as much reaſon to concern themſelves about the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
and <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits Speeches</hi> as any he could pretend to: Therefore
that any one of them ſhould ſay, <hi>What have I to do with the Jeſuits</hi> (their God-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties)
<hi>Speeches,</hi> is about as likely, as it is for Mr. <hi>Otes</hi> to have been at St.
<hi>Omers</hi> and in <hi>London</hi> at the ſame time: So that now 'tis clear, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was willing to make a ſmall wilful miſtake, and leave the Argument copious
enough, that ſo upon occaſion he might have recourſe to the extravagancy of
it for an Anſwer. But where's the <hi>Villanous Trick</hi> all this while? Oh, he
would be underſtood to be a great admirer of the <hi>Jeſuits Speeches,</hi> and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to have them Printed, but I it ſeems demanded Ten Pound for the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of e'm, ſo here's the <hi>Villanous Trick</hi> then I ſuppoſe! truly it's a very ſmall
one, and I think my Demands were very reaſonable; for what man living
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106899:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whoſe Trade Printing is <hi>(Nat. Thompſon</hi> excepted) would, in his right ſenſes,
concern himſelf in ſuch a parcel of Lies and Villanies for leſs than Ten Pounds?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I acquainted her</hi> (meaning Mrs. <hi>Cellier) what the Spark had done; and alſo
told her, he was ſo great a Villain, that if ever he came any more to me, I would order
my Servants to Kick him out of my Houſe.</hi> Right or wrong I am to be called
Villain now I find! but why ſo? Only becauſe I diſcover'd a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Villains and their Villanies; for I never heard one word of being Kicked
down Stairs, nor of any diſlike that I was under, until I had made my Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and then, as it hath done ever ſince, I found the Popiſh Blood boyl at me;
but before my Diſcovery no man was like to me; <hi>Gadbury</hi>
could tell me I was a man fit for <hi>a bold and daring Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,</hi>

Truth, and were it proper, I could carry it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but here I think are enough to prove how
much I was Eſteemed of while I did their Service; but
when I Diſcover'd, then 'twas <hi>Rogue, Villain, Raſcall, Scoundrel,</hi> &amp;c. and all
the Tricks and Devices that could be imagin'd, were uſed to invalidate my
Teſtimony, which meeting with ſome Mercenary helps, ſoon anſwer'd their
End.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus (as I told his Lordſhip, when we were face to face before the
King and Councel) I am beholding to him for confirming ſo great a part of
my Evidence; for however it was carried upon his Tryal, yet I am ſtill the ſame,
and by the Grace of God, will ever maintain what I from the firſt Charged him
with,</hi> viz. His being privy to the Propoſal that was made by the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Now, to let you know what Reply his Lordſhip made to this Charge, pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
this that follows, which is taken out of the 16, 17, and 18 pages of his</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto,
<hi>where ſays he,</hi> Willoughby affirms this, and I the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of any Propoſal made him by the Lords; <hi>Then being told by my
Lord Chancellor, that they (the Popiſh Lords in the</hi> Tower) <hi>had propoſed the
Killing of the King to me.</hi> I know nothing of it (reply'd his Lordſhip) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I asked him when it was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As he was muſing a while, and looking up in a
conſidering Poſture; I ſaid, You had need conſider well, for the Queſtion about Time
is the thing that will ever confound you, and ſuch as you are; at laſt he told me, it was
a fortnight or three Weeks after Sir <hi>George Wakemans</hi> Tryal. Now <hi>(replies his
Lordſhip)</hi> I have all I deſire, having eaught him in a moſt Evident Lie and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
for did he not confeſs that he never came to me after his Knavery at the
<hi>Tower;</hi> which was at the leaſt five Weeks before Sir <hi>George Wakemans</hi> Tryal; and yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106899:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now he affirms that my being angry with him was even a fortnight or three
Weeks after the ſaid Tryal; This ſo much ſtartled him, that he had nothing
to ſay, but that he would ſhew me Circumſtances to prove the Truth of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation;
which were, That I was then Writing the <hi>Compendium,</hi> a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph
of which he read as it lay before me on the Table: That one <hi>Lawſon</hi>
was then in the Houſe, and one <hi>Turner</hi> a Book-ſeller. Theſe <hi>(ſaid his
Lordſhip)</hi> are vain things, and ſo far from reconciling your former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
that they create new ones: For how was it poſſible for you to
read a Paragraph in a Paper, when I my ſelf was by, and in an angry humor,
and at the very firſt ſight of you? [And here (ſays his Lordſhip) I muſt
with my Readers leave, farther acquaint him, That <hi>Dangerfield</hi> neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have done this by ſurpriſe, nor would it have availed him had he
ſaid ſo; for my Chair and Table in my Study ſo face the Door, that it is
impoſſible for any body to come in, and not be preſently ſeen by me, when
there.] Now <hi>(continued his Lordſhip)</hi> for the perſons you Name, they
are eaſily gueſs'd at, <hi>Lawſon</hi> being my Sollicitor, and conſequently moſt
mornings with me; and the other my Book-ſeller, who having Orders to
bring me ſtill whatſoever was new, could not but be often at my Houſe, the
Preſs being at that preſent ſo prolifick. He to amuſe me and the Board,
<hi>(for 'twas all this while before the King and Councel)</hi> began again with
the Compendium, and that he read only a part of a Paragraph; but the
Chancellor telling him, that that was not the preſent Queſtion, he was
ſent out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as to that part which he ſeems to affirm ſo ſtrongly, <hi>viz. That he
never heard of any Propoſal made to me by the Lords in the Tower,</hi> &amp;c. I am
of his Opinion, and it is now more than the ſame Equivocation that I
expected he would make, <hi>viz.</hi> that he never heard of it at <hi>Candia;</hi> but
that he had heard of it here in <hi>England,</hi> nay here in <hi>London,</hi> and that
he was angry with me becauſe I refuſed it; it is true, and muſt paſs for
Truth, until he can more cloſely contradict it. But perhaps thoſe that
have a mind to be Partial in their diſtinguiſhing of theſe niceties, may
object and ſay 'tis but one mans Oath, (and he a perſon that hath lived
very extravagantly too) againſt a Perſon of Qualitie's Word or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
In anſwer to this I ſay, let thoſe Judges but be ſatisfied whom, and
what ſort of People they are that I had to deal withal, <hi>viz,</hi> the Lords
<hi>Powis,</hi> and <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> who were the Perſons that firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the <hi>Killing of the King</hi> to me, in a cloſe Room in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where
none but themſelves and I were preſent; and likewiſe that the Lord
<hi>Caſtlemaine,</hi> when he had a mind to make me underſtand his Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for my refuſing of that Propoſal, had ſent his Servants out of his
Study, before he would enter into any Diſcourſe with me about the
thing; why then I ſay, no reaſonable man can do other than believe
what I have ſworn to be Truth; and what they have or may affirm, to
be falſe: For can it be expected that two Bigotted Papiſts and a Jeſuit,
whoſe beſt Principles are Blood and Murder, and that had ſo often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of, and engag'd ſo many perſons for the <hi>Killing of the King,</hi> viz.
<hi>Pickering,</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman, the four Ruſſians, my Self,</hi> and one <hi>Lewis,</hi>
all which have confeſſed it themſelves, or been Diſcover'd by others;
and ſome Executed for that very Fact, ſhould at laſt play the Fool and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106899:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
accuſe themſelves. Perhaps had there been another Inſtrument as I was,
preſent at the ſame time when the Propoſal was made me, for ought I
know (after the Providence of Heaven had ſmote him with the Horror
of the thing, as I bleſs God I was) he might have been as ready to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it: But then it may be they will ſay, there was <hi>Gadbury,</hi> the
Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cellier, Father Sharp</hi> at <hi>Wild Houſe,</hi> and others whom
I had charg'd with being Privy, more or leſs, to this Conſpiracy; and
yet they all flatly deny it; what then! and what does that ſignify? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Traytor (that knows our Common Proverb, <hi>Confeſs and be
Hang'd)</hi> denies his Crimes, therefore he is Innocent; an Excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
indeed! Yet let me tell ye Gentlemen, <hi>Gadbury</hi> once (when he was
in the <hi>Gate-houſe)</hi> was willing, and as I have been inform'd, did make
ſome conſiderable Diſcovery; but no ſooner had he obtained his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
moſt Gracious Pardon, but as ſoon his mouth grew Black and
<hi>Mealy,</hi> and ſo became ſilent; and ever after, all that he could tell of,
Good-man, was but <hi>Tranſiently:</hi> As for Mother Midwifes part, ſhe did
ſay when the Parliament was ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1680, that ſhe had ſome Diſcovery to make, and accordingly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be ſent for to the Bar of that Houſe of Commons; but this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of hers being by ſome means or other made known, ſhe was ſoon
Preſented either with Money, or a Bill for a Hundred Pounds, and
great Promiſes of being plentifully ſupported from that time forwards,
as ſhe hath been without doubt ever ſince; ſo that when an Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Member of that Houſe went to <hi>Newgate</hi> to know what ſhe had to
ſay, the beſt he could get from her, was but baſe and abuſive Language;
ſo that what likelyhood there is for any of theſe Conſpirators to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and Confirm my Diſcovery, ſeeing they are thus tamper'd with,
is but vain, and as yet not to be expected. Therefore, I hope, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
you will be ſo juſt, as not to think them ever the more Innocent
for their aſſerting and affirming of it; nor me ever the leſs to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for their recriminating and laying to my Charge things that I call
God to Witneſs, I never was in the leaſt Guilty of: I am ſure, and I am
able to prove it, that what they (I mean the Papiſts) had engag'd me
in, was of Nature ſo much beyond all that I had ever acted or done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that when ſome things were diſcours'd of amongſt our ſelves, which
went down with others as glib and eaſie, they have made me Tremble:
I hope this being ſeriouſly conſider'd, amongſt the many Temptations
which I have lain under, together with my reclaim'd and modeſt Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards all ſorts of Perſons for this two Years paſt, will ſo much
out ballance any thing that Popery can object againſt me, that I may
find ſome Room in the Opinions of Good and Sober People. But Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
if you'l but do me the favour to take along with your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the probabilities which attend my Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> That I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of Priſon by the Papiſts, to their Charge near Three Hundred
Pounds, before I was capable of doing them any conſiderable Service;
then the plentiful way of my Living after that, even to the time of my
Diſcovery; then my being brought acquainted with the Popiſh Lords
and Ladies in the <hi>Tower</hi> and elſewhere, and moſt of the conſiderable
Prieſts and Papiſts then about the Town; then my being brought to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106899:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and from thence to His Majeſty; I ſay do me but the
favour to compare theſe Probabilities impartially to what I have ſworn,
and theſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That I never ſaw the Popiſh Lords, until I
was by their means releaſed out of Priſon, and was ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi>
&amp;c. That I never had the Honour to wait upon the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Duke,</hi>
until the Papiſts had procur'd it: That I had no other End or Deſign by
my waiting upon His Majeſty, but to endeavour to poſſeſs him with the
Belief of that Damnable Popiſh Contrivance, <hi>A Plot amongſt the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
to alter the Government,</hi> &amp;c And laſt of all, that the Propoſal which
was made me to <hi>Kill the King</hi> (whom God for ever Preſerve) was done
by thoſe that hold theſe pernicious Tenets, <hi>viz. Depoſing of Kings, Burning
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Deſtroying of Hereticks, Changing of Governments,</hi> &amp;c. That is to
ſay, the Papiſts, the worſt ſort of Papiſts, the Bigotted, be-Jeſuited Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
whoſe Doctrine and their own practices have ſufficiently rendred
them notorious to the World; now if theſe people were, as they pretend
to be, ſuch a ſort of harmleſs, innocent Doves, without Gall, Bitterneſs,
and the worſt of Malice, then indeed there were ſome reaſon for the
World to ſuſpect the Accuſation which my ſelf and others have charg'd
them with; but on the contrary, as they are not, and ſince their Crimes
are attended with ſo many vigorous and lively Circumſtances, I hope
no man will be ſo void of reaſon to think, tho' I am but <hi>Singularis Teſtis,</hi>
that I have not as great a value for my Soul and its Eternal Happineſs, as
e're a Papiſt of them all can pretend to; or that I ſhould ſo often in this,
and in other Papers of mine now in Print, call God to witneſs a Lye,
and yet remain, or have any Being amongſt my Fellow Creatures here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth. So that now the ſum of all is this, Either you muſt believe
that what I have ſworn againſt them is Truth, for which you have the
pledge of a thing more valuable to me than the whole Earth, my Soul.
Or elſe you muſt believe what the Conſpirators affirm in the denyal of
it, and conſequently me to be <hi>Perjur'd;</hi> a thing I muſt confeſs, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet laid to my Charge: for the determination of which, ſince the
Opinions and Tempers of men are ſo various and different, I appeal to
the Supream God and Judge of all Mankind, before whoſe great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
I Challenge the Conſpirators for the Truth of my whole Charge, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every individual Papiſt, or perſon by me nam'd; more eſpecially
that all-contradicting Gentleman, the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> whom that you
may know to be a Prieſt, and of the Order and Society of Jeſuits, look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the 19 <hi>page</hi> of his <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> where he ſays Mr. <hi>Otes</hi> accuſed him of
being a Prieſt, and that he had ſaid Maſs: But that's not all neither, for
<hi>Turbervile</hi> ſwore the ſame; a Man and his Wife ſwore it alſo, who were
both Papiſts, and that they had heard him read Maſs at <hi>Doway</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi>
I would not take up any thing of this kind from bare words and
common Report; neither do I, nor would I be thought to mention any
more here than what I am able to prove; becauſe I know I have to do
with a ſubtle, ſupplanting ſort of Devils in the ſhape of men, who care
not who they aſperſe and ſcandalize by their Paltry Aſſertions, ſo they
can but gain a belief, upon the too credulous and good natur'd, or rather
impoſe upon the World any thing, though never ſo falſe, to ſerve their
own Villanous Ends.</p>

But now to return to the point, <hi>viz.</hi> the Propoſal to <hi>Kill the King,
I kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w nothing of it</hi> (replyed his Lordſhip) <hi>and thereupon I asked him
when it was,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as he was muſing a while and looking up in a conſidering
poſture, I ſaid, you had need conſider well; for the Queſtion about Time is
the thing that well ever confound you,</hi> &amp;c. Now for the Truth of this, I
Humbly make my Appeal to His Majeſty and the whole Council; and
alſo to all that ever heard me deliver my Evidence in any Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature,
or any other place, Whether or no, at all times and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I have not Expreſs'd my ſelf as freely, and as clear from any Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Muſing, as any one whatſoever of my capacity can be ſuppos'd
to do in a matter of that great Moment: And likewiſe, If I have not as
readily anſwer'd Queſtions concerning matter of Fact or Circumſtances,
as any the moſt exquiſite of the Papiſts have been to put them to me.
But to allow his inſinuation that very way that he puts it, that is to ſay,
that the whole matter which I charg'd him with was falſe; yet is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(ſuppoſing me to be ſo baſe and villanous) that I ſhould Study my
Charge no better than ſo, as not to be able to give an Anſwer about <hi>Time</hi>

Charge being <hi>ipſo facto</hi> true, that I ſhould not be able to anſwer a ſingle
Queſtion; and this all perſons that know meare able to contradict. What
he means by his ſaying that <hi>the Queſtion about Time and Place is the thing
that will ever confound you,</hi> &amp;c. is a Trick I can't well underſtand; unleſs
by ſome Magick Spell he made me to be at <hi>York,</hi> when I Swore I was at
his Houſe; which if either he, or any Papiſt of them all can make out,
upon any part of my Charge given againſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> That I accuſe <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-Noaks</hi>
to have been here or there when he was not; or that I had
Diſcourſe with him about this or that, and was never in his Company;
and this I ſay, to be proved by Lawful, Credible and Proteſtant Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
not St. <hi>Omerians,</hi> of his, or their own tutoring, or other Prieſts
or Papiſts, that have the Knack of Swearing a man to be at <hi>London</hi> and
<hi>Valledolid</hi> at one and the ſame time; why then I ſay, my Lord, I'le be
bound to give you the Victory, but not till then: And that I may with
more Modeſty than you have done with Diſcretion, ſhew you your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
and how inconſiderately you have accumulated things laid to my
Charge as falſe as God is true; and that all the World may be able to
know the Monſter by the bigneſs of his Foot, take notice of my reply to
that part of your Diſcourſe; wherein ſay you, <hi>At laſt he told me it was a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
or three Weeks after Sir</hi> George Wakemans <hi>Tryal. Now</hi> (ſaid his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
<hi>I have all I deſire, having caught him in a moſt evident Lie and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction;
for did he not confeſs that he never came to me after his Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
in the</hi> Tower, <hi>which was at leaſt five Weeks before Sir</hi> George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>Tryal; and yet now he affirms, That my being angry with him was even
a fortnight or three Weeks after the ſaid Tryal.</hi> What a fine way his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
has found out to catch a man? here's a Trick with a Witneſs! One
would think this were a fine way to <hi>Dugdalize</hi> an Evidence. But pray
my Lord, how does it ſo happen, that this contradiction which you ſay
paſs'd in <hi>November</hi> 1679. was not inſiſted upon and prov'd in <hi>June</hi>
1680. when you were Arraign'd and Tryed? This would have been
far more conſiderable than the Six of the Sixteen Records which you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106899:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and YOUR Chief Juſtice made ſuch a noiſe with; this might have prov'd
me <hi>Perjur'd,</hi> and then I had been for ever diſabled for an Evidence; truly it
had been a thing well worth your while, but I know you are ready with
an Excuſe for that too; either you could not procure the Council-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
time enough, or elſe you could not prevail upon the Clerks to bear
Teſtimony upon e'm, and that's much. But pray my Lord let me ask you
one Queſtion, and don't be Hot or Chollerick; where was it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom did you <hi>catch</hi> me in this great <hi>Lie and Contradiction?</hi> Your
<hi>Manifesto</hi> I know tells us it was before the King and Councel: Was it
ſo? Why then truly you have made a fine reflection upon His Majeſty
and the whole Board, which lies thus; either none of them were ſo
quick of Apprehenſion as your ſelf to take notice of this <hi>Contradiction,</hi>
and that's ſtrange, for they took notice of all yours; or elſe they did
take notice, and were willing to connive at it; So that in plain
terms he charges me with a <hi>Perjury</hi> committed before the King
and Councel, and does as good as ſay they were all Privy to
it, in regard no body took me up for it but himſelf; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as clear as the Sun, here is a direct Charge upon the King, and the
whole <hi>Council,</hi> which is as like his Lordſhips way of Scandalizing, as
<hi>Roger Palmer,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> is like the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemaine.</hi> But ſuppoſing my
Lord, that I ſhould be able to counter-prove this notable affirmation
of yours, that is to ſay, to prove it a <hi>Lye</hi> of your own making; what
do you think the World will ſay then? Why 'tis but like an exquiſite
Papiſt, and there's an end on't. Come on then for once, I'le try what
I can do with it: Your <hi>Manifeſto</hi> tells us, <hi>viz. At laſt he told me it was a
fortnight or three weeks before Sir</hi> George Wakemans <hi>Tryal; Now I have
all I deſire, having caught him in a moſt evident Lie and Contradiction;
for did he not confeſs that he never came to me after his Knavery at the</hi>
Tower, <hi>which was at the leaſt five weeks before Sir</hi> George Wakemans
<hi>Tryal; and yet now he affirms that my being angry with him was even a
fortnight or three weeks after the ſaid Tryal,</hi> &amp;c. and you ſay this happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the King and Council; but who was there beſides your own
words to prove this moſt egregious <hi>contradiction,</hi> which you with ſuch
ſcrutiny obſerv'd upon the <hi>at leaſt five Weeks before Sir</hi> George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>Tryal?</hi> &amp;c. Truly juſt no body: But perhaps you'l ſay 'twas prov'd
at your Tryal in <hi>June</hi> 1680. Was it ſo? how can that be? how does it
appear? why ſee his own words for it in the Printed Tryal <hi>page</hi> 60. viz.
<hi>If you pleaſe my Lords,</hi> (he then ſpeaking to the Judges) <hi>I would only
tell you this, my Lords, you ſee that theſe two Witneſſes teſtifie</hi> (viz. <hi>Mrs.</hi>
Cellier <hi>and</hi> Bennet Dowdall) <hi>that I was angry with</hi> Dangerfield <hi>in</hi> June;
<hi>my Lords I only ſay this to you my Lords, that when I was Examin'd at
the Council Board before the King, of this particular, my Lords, my Lord
Chancellor asked him the particulars of it, and he did confeſs this thing
which I now prove,</hi> &amp;c. O moſt admirable ſenſe this; Pſha, ſenſe with
a wanyon; What Madman at this time of day would write ſenſe I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
any one but a raſh, hot-headed Popiſh Lord, or a Conjurer; and
they write Non-ſenſe out of a meer deſign to amuſe the people: Ay, but
what was the thing his Lordſhip prov'd? Why 'twas, That I had made
a complaint to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> of his Lordſhips being angry with me; and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106899:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſhe ſpoke to <hi>Bennet Dowdal</hi> (another Papiſt) to ſpeak to me not
to be troubled at his Lordſhips anger: But that which is moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is, That I ſhould make this Complaint a conſiderable time before the
time that I mention'd in my Evidence, which was in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679, but
ſtill how does he prove this? Oh, by the two fore-mentioned Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>Cellier</hi> and <hi>Dowdal;</hi> ſay you me ſo! two ſpecial Witneſſes indeed, the
one an equal Conſpiratreſs with his Lordſhip, and the other a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Papiſt; but however I'm willing to try how far their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will agree with his Lordſhips Aſſertion, and my counter-Evidence:
When the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> had asked <hi>Dowdal</hi> a Queſtion; wherein he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
to him what Anſwer he was to make to it, (as you may find in
Tryal <hi>page</hi> 58. where ſays his Lordſhip, <hi>Mr.</hi> Dowdal, <hi>the Caſe is this: Mr.</hi>
Dangerfield <hi>tells me I was angry with him at ſuch a time for a buſineſs at my
Houſe; was I not angry with him at</hi> Powis <hi>Houſe for going to the Lords in
the</hi> Tower? They ſays <hi>Dowdal, Mrs.</hi> Cellier <hi>ſpoke to me to ſpeak to Mr.</hi>
Dangerfield, <hi>not to be troubled at your anger.</hi> Then <hi>Dowdal</hi> being ask'd by the
Court when this was? reply'd it was after the Jeſuits died. In Tryal
page 66. <hi>Dowdal</hi> ſays, viz. Dangerfield <hi>told me his Lordſhip was angry about
his going to the</hi> Tower <hi>in my Lords Name unknown to him;</hi> then being
ask'd by the Court, <hi>Did he acknowledge to you my Lords Anger in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of</hi> July? To which <hi>Dowdal</hi> reply'd, <hi>it was within a Week after the
Jeſuits died:</hi> And a little after that, he ſtands up and tells the Court <hi>it
was about the 21 of</hi> June. Now let's hear what the Lady of the <hi>Wicket</hi>
Teſtify'd about this buſineſs of his Lordſhips anger: Oh me, ſhe ſays po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
that <hi>This day twelve month</hi> (viz. the 23 of <hi>June</hi> 1679.) <hi>He and I
had been employ'd in Writing Copies of ſome
Letters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The writing of which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is a part of my Charge againſt his Lordſhip and againſt her ſelf, as you may find in my firſt Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</note> 
               <hi>and I ſent him to my Lord to know if
he would go ſomething towards the Printing
them; and he went from him to the Lords in
the</hi> Tower. <hi>In an hour and half after, my
Lord came to me very angry; Mrs.</hi> Cellier,
<hi>ſaid he, I thought you would not forfeit your
Diſcretion, to ſend ſuch a Raſcal to me; if you
ſend him to me again, I will bid my Servants Kick him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time I would have ſent him, and ſaid he, pray Madam dont ſend me
thither, I would rather go an hundred Miles,</hi> &amp;c. So now, Gentlemen, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
is fairly to ſet before you the ſum of theſe two Teſtimonies, which
for Argument ſake I am willing to allow as ſuch; <hi>Dowdal</hi> ſaid, <hi>That I
told him of the Lord</hi> Caſtlemains <hi>being angry with me about the 21 of June,</hi>
adding that it was a Week after the Execution of the Five Jeſuits; now
pray do but obſerve this contradiction, 'tis worth your while to ſee
what a ſort of infatuation theſe ſilly Bigots are under, when they come
to ſtretch their Zeal for the Cauſe. The Five Jeſuits were Tryed on
Friday and Saturday, being the 13 and 14 of <hi>June</hi> 1679; after that <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi>
was Tryed and found Guilty; after which they were all Six brought
to the Bar together, and receiv'd Judgment to be <hi>Drawn, Hang'd and
Quartered;</hi> which accordingly was done upon the Five <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> on <hi>Friday the 20 of</hi> June, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here is now viſible to all mankind
ſix days miſtake, ſo that had he been upon his Oath, as he was not; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106899:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>about</hi> had been left out, for ought I ſee the tranſport of this mans
<hi>Zeal</hi> might have brought him into the Bryers of <hi>Perjury. Cellier</hi> ſeems
to teſtifie that ſhe heard not of his Lordſhips Anger till the 23 of <hi>June,</hi>
but ſays not one Word of the Week after the Jeſuits were Executed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> however there's two days difference between them: I wonder,
(not to reflect either upon the Lord Chief Juſtice, or the Jury, by whom
this <hi>good Lord</hi> was Tryed) what the World can think of ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Caſes as theſe are, this not being the firſt of that kind neither:
And with what Impudence men can, as they do in their Lying Pamphlets,
daily aſſert the Innocency of ſuch a ſort of people as theſe, who in their
Teſtimonies even for one another, confeſs the very Crimes with which
they themſelves had been charg'd, and thus has Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> done, when ſhe
ſaid <hi>He and I</hi> (meaning me) <hi>had been employed in writing Copies of ſome
Letters,</hi> &amp;c. which Copies of Letters are thoſe very ones that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be conveyed into the Houſes of moſt of the conſiderable <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> in order to be ſeiz'd for the carrying on of that <hi>Sham-Plot;</hi>
I could give many inſtances of this kind, but my Deſign in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only to confute his Lordſhip by ſuch matter of Fact as particularly
relates to himſelf; I am willing to be confin'd to that narrow compaſs, and
ſhall ſhew you what I brought in Bar to his Lordſhips Objections, and
thoſe incoherent, falſe, oral Teſtimonies (whoſe Guilt, if poſſible, was
greater than the impudence they appeared with.) Firſt, the time that I
ſwore his Lordſhips anger was about the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1679. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
one <hi>Turner</hi> (then a Papiſt, but ſome what honeſter than the reſt) ſwore
that he ſaw me at the Lord <hi>Caſtlemains</hi> Houſe, and being asked by the
Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> what Month he could charge himſelf to ſay
he ſaw <hi>Dangerfield</hi> in the Lord <hi>Caſtlemains</hi> Company? <hi>Turner</hi> made this
Anſwer, <hi>I cannot well tell, I think it might be about</hi> July; ſo that here, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
you have this doubtful point, this great <hi>Lye,</hi> this moſt egregious
contradiction that his Lordſhip has ſo bang'd me about with, diſſolved
in a word or two. <hi>Cellier</hi> and <hi>Dowdal</hi> teſtifying for the 23 and 21 of
the Month of <hi>June,</hi> and my ſelf and <hi>Turner</hi> ſwearing to the middle of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> and the month of <hi>July</hi> poſitively; both of theſe being long enough
after their times, to have (I think) convinc'd a man about the Truth of
the Charge, though <hi>Cellier</hi> and <hi>Dowdall</hi> had agreed never ſo well about
the time: Therefore 'tis as clear as the Sun at Noon-day, that I was
with his Lordſhip after the time that he endeavours to prove his being
angry with me; and if you'l but do me the favour to take my Word
for it after my Oath, I do in the Preſence of an All-ſeeing God, moſt
ſolemnly declare, and upon my Salvation, That I never knew of, that
I never heard of, nor never gave his Lordſhip any ſuch cauſe of Anger
as he pretends, unleſs until the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which was the time that
he ſo roughly treated me, for refuſing of the Propoſal that had been
made me by the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> Now this great Link of their whole
aſperſion being broken by Truth and apparent matter of Fact, I hope
no man from hence forwards will either inconſiderately or out of Zeal
to hide the Villany of Popiſh Conſpiracies, take upon him to raiſe an
Argument from the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemains Manifeſto:</hi> Or if he does, I doubt
not but that I may be able to convince him in time of his obſtinate and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106899:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
peeviſh Errour. And now I ſhall return to the next point, and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
own words, viz. <hi>That he would ſhew me Circumſtances to prove the
Truth of his Allegation; which were, that I was then writing the</hi> Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
<hi>a Paragraph of which he then read as it lay before me on the Table;
That one</hi> Lawſon <hi>was then in the Houſe, and one</hi> Turner <hi>a Book-ſeller,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>For how was it poſſible for you to read a Paragraph in a Paper, when I my
ſelf was by, and in an angry humor, and at the very firſt ſight of you?</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>That</hi> Dangerfield <hi>neither pretended to have done this by ſurpriſe, nor would
it have availed him, had he ſaid ſo; for my Chair and Table in my Study ſo
face the Door, that it is impoſſible for any body to come in, and not be
preſently ſeen by me,</hi> &amp;c. LOOK YE GENTLEMEN, here is a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ariſes thus, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> ſwears his Lordſhip was writing the <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
at that time when his Lordſhip was angry with him for refuſing
the Propoſal made him by the Lords in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and to prove that he
was at his Lordſhips Houſe at ſuch a time, he names you two perſons that
ſaw him there, <hi>Lawſon</hi> and <hi>Turner;</hi> the laſt hath Teſtifi'd that he ſaw
his Lordſhip and <hi>Dangerfield</hi> together, and the firſt never yet did the
contrary, and conſequently cannot refuſe the ſame, if he be, as I hope
he is, a Lover of Truth. In anſwer to this, you have theſe ſurmiſes ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to render the Queſtion improbable, <hi>viz. How was it poſſible</hi> (ſays his
Lordſhip) <hi>for you to read a Paragraph in a paper, when I my ſelf was by,
and in an angry humor?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For my Chair and Study ſo face the Door, that
it is impoſſible for any body to come in, and not be ſeen by me,</hi> &amp;c. Goodly,
goodly, why <hi>impoſſible</hi> my Lord? Don't you know your Papers lay
looſe upon a large Table, and that I ſtood on the ſame ſide of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at which you were writing; and that within a Yard or leſs of the
Paper wherein I read the part of a Paragraph, which had been ſo lately
wrote that ſeveral of the lower Lines were wet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pray what <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
is there in all this? Can any man alive do other than believe by the
lame and helpleſs ſhifts you uſe for the denyal, but that you did write
the <hi>Compendium,</hi> or at leaſt ſome part of it; and conſequently, that what
I have Charg'd you with is True, ſince you only endeavour to prove that
to be falſe by trivial and forged Circumſtances, which otherwiſe is not
to be deny'd? Had you made a Declaration upon your Honour (if you
have any ſuch thing) that I was not at your Houſe at that time when I
ſwore I was; had you brought your <hi>Sollicitor</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> or any others
to have prov'd as much, this had been ſomething like; or had you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
it to be wrote by any other perſon, and have brought ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to own it, or at leaſt ſome perſons of Credit to have prov'd it; Then
I ſay the World might have had ſome reaſon to doubt my Evidence;
But ſince neither your Lordſhip nor Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> upon neither of your
Tryals have been able to prove any one of theſe kind of contradictions
upon me, nor indeed any thing elſe, more than by way of recriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(which was very lucky to your whole party that I was ſo lyable) I
hope there is no doubt to be made by any Impartial Opinion, but that
you were both Guilty of every individual Crime, by me Charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you.</p>
            <p>Now to <hi>page</hi> 21. where ſays his Lordſhip, <hi>Many other things I had to
urge to the Council; as their great diſeſteem and ſlight of</hi> Dangerfields <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106899:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt</hi> Col. Manſell; <hi>his not laying to my Charge any Treaſons; for he
accus'd me not poſitively of knowing what the Lords in the</hi> Tower <hi>had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to him,</hi> &amp;c. what a ſly, but weak inſinuation is there compremis'd
under theſe words, <hi>viz. Their great diſeſteem and ſlight of</hi> Dangerfields <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
againſt</hi> Col. Manſell? Pray my Lord how could it be otherwiſe
than a <hi>diſeſteem</hi> and <hi>ſlight,</hi> when it was prov'd as clear as the Sun, not
only by my own words, but by divers Witneſſes; beſides many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as ſtrong as could be imagin'd, That I was the perſon that had
conveyed the Papers into Mr. <hi>Manſells</hi> Chamber? but as for my not
charging you with Treaſon before the King and Council, I can't well
tell what to ſay to that, becauſe I don't know whether you think Murder
Treaſon, or to compaſs, imagine or contrive the Death of the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to be a Crime; this my Lord I am ſure of, if you are a right Jeſuit, as
I have great reaſon to believe you are, you are ſo far from thinking it
a Crime, that you hold it as the higheſt piece of Merit, and the greateſt
piece of Service that can be done to Mother-Church, all which is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be underſtood in your own words, which you gave in anſwer to
my Lord Chancellor, when he ask'd you a Queſtion about your being
a Prieſt, <hi>viz. As for my being a Prieſt, I ſhould (were I one) be ſo far
from poſitively denying it, that I would glory in the Title.</hi> But that I did not
from the very firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> before the King and Council, Charge you with
that which our Laws term Treaſon, (the Propoſal which was made me
by the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which was to <hi>Kill the King)</hi> is utterly falſe,
and as meer a Fiction as all the reſt of your <hi>Manifeſto;</hi> for the proof of
which I refer my ſelf to the Council-minutes, which I had thought to
have inſerted here, but in this I miſs'd of my aim; becauſe I could not
procure ſo many powerful Guineys as your Lordſhip did, to preſent
thoſe withal, that gratified your Deſires, which if it were done, was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
and I'm ſure, contrary to the Knowledge either of his Majeſty or
the Council, to help you to them; a thing certainly which may be ſaid
to be one of the greateſt abuſes imaginable, done to the Honour of that
Board, that the Copies of their Records ſhould be bought and ſold, when
I (who thought I had as great reaſon to have had Copies, as any you
could pretend to) had ſo often made application, and ſtill went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
'em; Nay, when I had moſt immergent occaſion for them too, when
they were to be employ'd in the Service of the King and Kingdom, and
yet I could not prevail: Now Gentlemen, pray what think you of his
Lordſhips little piece of <hi>Caſtlemainiſm?</hi> Was ever any thing more full of
contradictions, and falſhoods? ſurely nothing unleſs it were his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
little <hi>Hiſtory of the late Wars between the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and the</hi> Dutch, or
<hi>the Hiſtory of his Travels and Adventures to</hi> Candia, and thoſe indeed were
claw'd off to purpoſe with Stories and Relations as falſe and inconſiſtent
as ever were mention'd in Hiſtory; and let any man but read over thoſe
two little Books that ever knew, or that ever hath read or head of any
true Relation either of thoſe unhappy <hi>Dutch-Wars,</hi> or of the Siege of
<hi>Candia,</hi> and I'le undertake to ſay he ſhall ſoon be convinc'd, That neither
his Lordſhips <hi>Compendium,</hi> his <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> &amp;c. are the firſt Shams that he
hath endeavoured to impoſe upon the World, and appear in Print with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
a thing he much delights in. Was ever man <hi>(Godbury</hi> excepted) ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106899:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mad as this Lord, to go about to vindicate himſelf againſt a charge of
ſo high a nature, by nothing but Fictions and abuſes: Reflections upon
the Council, as you may find in the 21 page of his <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> where ſays
he, <hi>I ask the Noble mans Pardon for ſaying any thing that offended him or
the Board;</hi> This Pardon was ask'd you muſt know, after he had receiv'd
a ſmart reprimand for his Chollerick and abrupt behaviour before the
King and Council; and a'my word 'twas well he had the manners to
apologize. The next is the many abuſes which he puts upon his very
Keeper the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> as you may find in <hi>Manifeſto</hi> page
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. But that which is moſt remarkable is, his abuſing
the man who of all took moſt pains to deliver him, <hi>viz. The Lord Chief
Juſtice Scroggs,</hi> and the very Lawyers that were of his Councel; what
Monſtrous ingratitude is this? In a word, there is not a perſon from the
higheſt to the loweſt, whom he hath not in ſome meaſure or other abus'd
and reflected upon; but I think 'tis pretty well known of what Credit
his Lordſhips Choller is, and therefore I leave him to the Cenſure of all
unbiaſs'd Readers: I had thought to have gone through his whole <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto,</hi>
and to have made ſome remarks upon every Page; but I find it
ſo ſtuff'd with Incoherencies, Tautologies, Repetitions, and what not,
that I was unwilling to trouble the Reader and my ſelf with writing an
Anſwer to that which in divers parts anſwers it ſelf; but more ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a thing which is ſuppoſed for an intended Vindication, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any name of Atteſtation to it: 'tis a Sign his Lordſhip was ſomewhat
doubtful of what he there mention'd, or elſe he could never have ſent
ſuch a piece of Stuff into the World without giving ſome aſſurance that
it was of his own Writing.</p>
            <p>By the way, Gentlemen, I cannot but take notice of a paſſage in his
defence, <hi>p.</hi> 83. where he calls me a <hi>forger of Treaſonable letters to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
the innocent, and urges my commitment by the Board, upon Mr.</hi>
Manſell's <hi>accompt,</hi> as an argument to invallidate my <hi>Teſtimony:</hi> By which
the World may ſee a very great weakneſs and failing in his Lordſhip,
to make that a Crime which he ſo cordially manag'd and promoted. I
profeſs he has hit the Nail o'th' head. For ſays he, <hi>Dangerfield</hi> was
in the ſame Plot with my ſelf; but <hi>Dangerfield</hi> fell off and diſcover'd
the deſign; therefore <hi>Dangerfield</hi> is not to believ'd. But Midwife
<hi>Cellier,</hi> being in the ſame Plot, and manager of the very letters, being a
Teſtimony for his Lordſhip, and continuing true to the cauſe, was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
without exception. 'Tis a ſign that men read with little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
when ſuch ſhifts and evaſions as theſe ſhall be ſo eaſily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip goes on with a confeſſion of his faith; a new invention
they have now a days gotten, to uſher in a fallacious piece of Cajolrie
upon the World: That it is againſt the Doctrine of the Romiſh Church
to depoſe and murther Princes; than which there never was a more
notorious and demonſtrable piece of Hypocriſie broach'd upon the
Earth. For it has not only been the common practice of the Popes
themſelves, but a Doctrine openly defended by a numerous and moſt
authentick part of the Fathers and maintainers of the Popiſh Principles.
So that if the Proteſtants were not ſtrangely enclin'd to favour their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106899:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Enemies, how is it poſſible they ſhould ever give credit to a man that
belys his own Religon? If his Lordſhip were not ſo much for <hi>depoſing
the King,</hi> why was he ſo angry with me for <hi>refuſing to Kill him?</hi> For
with his Lordſhips leave, I muſt keep cloſe to my Text, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his <hi>Junes</hi> and his <hi>July's.</hi> Perhaps it may be his Lordſhips particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
opinion that Kings are not to be depos'd; but then they muſt be
Kings of his own making, ſuch as he accounts real Kings: For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
be thinks it unlawful to depoſe that King to whom he will not
ſwear the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, is contradictory to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reaſon. He tells ye, he cannot take the Oath of Allegiance, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the King will be pleas'd to alter ſome words in it. And as for the
Oath of Supremacy, whatever ſome of his Religion may have done, that's
no preſident for him.</hi> So that what credit there is to be given to a
Loyaltie that refuſes the common Tyes and Bond of Subjects fidelity
to their Prince, I leave to all Impartial Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for Diſpenſations to Lye, Kill, Forſwear,</hi> and ſo forth, thoſe he
<hi>not only abhors, but proteſts,</hi> he <hi>never heard from any Papiſt,</hi> that <hi>they
are or were grantable.</hi> What a plunge has his Lordſhip here put himſelf
to? For hereby he has made himſelf the moſt ſilly, illiterate, ignorant
perſon in the World, or elſe the divulger of a moſt notorious untruth,
there being nothing more obvious to reading, than the juſtify'd allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of theſe crimes by the moſt noted Caſuiſts of his Religion. Now
what good ſuch ſtories as theſe will do his <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> is the Queſtion.
For my part I believe the Bookſeller was out in his Title; for had he
call'd it, the <hi>Legend</hi> of the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> he had done well. This is
ill done to impoſe upon us a meer <hi>Romance,</hi> or a ſecond part of <hi>Mandevil's
Travels,</hi> under the Title of a <hi>Manifeſto.</hi> Only there is this excuſe to be
made for his Lordſhip, that he has told theſe ſtories ſo oft, that he now
believes them for <hi>Truths,</hi> and thinks all the World as ridiculouſly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
as himſelf. In ſhort, I would deſire his Lordſhip to conſider what
Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> his great Crony and fellow-Conſpirator, got by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſcandalous <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> tho' ſhe came off by the ſame fair means
as he did. What Mr. <hi>John Gadbury</hi> got by that abuſive lying Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack
of his for this preſent Year 1682. And what his Lordſhip will
gain by his <hi>Manifeſto.</hi> And it may not be an improper Queſtion, If
the ſame courſe were taken with both the laſt, as was with hers, whether
they might not have as little reaſon to boaſt of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>
Impoſitions upon the World, they being equally ſcandalous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
to the publick Juſtice of the Nation? And that all ſuch may
receive their ſo highly merited reward, is the hearty wiſh of</p>
