         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The one, to teach vs, that the principall obiect of our faith is God himſelfe, conſidered in vnitie of Eſſence, and Trinitie of perſons, and therefore to each of the perſons, there is either a (<hi>Beleeue</hi>) prefixed, or the Particle (<hi>in</hi>) ſet before, to ſhew
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:25223:7"/>
that on them we are to build the certaintie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of our hope; but as for theſe Articles of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body,</hi> and the like, they being creatures, are but the ſecondarie obiects of our Faith, not to be truſted vpon immediately in themſelues, but onely vnder God and through God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue not a <hi>Credo</hi> a (<hi>Beleeue</hi>) a part to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but prefixt to one of the perſons (<hi>I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>The other, to ſet out and diuide by this meanes vnto euery of the perſons an appropriate and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall worke. For as God the father hath <hi>Creation</hi> in the Articles attributed vnto him, and the Sonne <hi>Redemptionem merito,</hi> Redemption by the merit of his Death and Paſſion, vnto him; ſo the holy Ghoſt by the (<hi>Beleeue</hi>) which is prefixt to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and is in part of ſenſe to be conuei'd vnto the following; hath the application of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Virtute &amp; efficacia,</hi> by his vertue and efficacie appropriated vnto him alſo; to wit, <hi>The ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Catholicke Church, the vniting of the members in a communion with their head, the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of iuſtifying faith, which apprehends the remiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, the quickning of the dead in the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the conferring of life,</hi> both <hi>vitam gratiae,</hi> the life of Grace, and <hi>vitam gloriae,</hi> the life of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the world to come.</p>

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:25223:9"/>Firſt by the Grammaticall conſtruction of this <hi>Credo,</hi> I beleeue, which when it imports to yeeld credit or aſſent to a thing, is not ioyned with an <hi>Accuſatiue caſe,</hi> as here in the Creede, but with a <hi>Datiue,</hi> whereas wee ſay not, <hi>Credo Eccleſiae,</hi> but <hi>Credo Eccleſiam,</hi> to ſhew that the Creede in this place implies <hi>veritatem in eſſendo,</hi> a beliefe of the Churches being; and not <hi>veritatem in ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> a beliefe of the Churches ſaying: <note n="h" place="margin">Staplet. lib. 8 princip. doct. cap. 21.</note>

the ſenſe which <hi>the Church</hi> beleeues in this place, it is abſurd to conceiue that theſe words <hi>Credo Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam,</hi> I beleeue that there is a Church, ſhould bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiualent to theſe, <hi>Credo Eccleſiae,</hi> I yeeld faith and beliefe to the Church.</p>

                        <p>2.

                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others.

                     <p>To reſolue therefore the difficultie; We graunt,<note place="margin">Reſolut.</note> that where the Propounder is the principall, finall, and onely cauſe, for whoſe ſake we beleeue a thing, there, if the Propounder bee liable to error and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, a firme and vndoubted beliefe of ſuch a thing cannot be had.

In like manner,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25223:25"/>
if two perſons onely bee preſent at the death of a friend, and depoſe, that in this or that manner he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed legacies: in this caſe, if they be of doubtfull repute, it will be hard to determine poſitiuely, what is the truth, becauſe that here they are the principall and onely witneſſes, and there are no other authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike proofes whereby their depoſitions may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. But where the Propounder is onely the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, <hi>by whoſe meanes,</hi> wee are brought to ſee proofes of an higher nature, and by whoſe miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, arguments of greater importance doe diſplay themſelues; (as if the Trauailer ſhall bring letters of Credence, vnder the Hand &amp; Seale of the Prince confirming his Relation, or if the perſons preſent at the death of their friend, ſhall, beſides their owne teſtimonie, produce a formall will, ſubſcribed by the hands of lawfull witneſſes, and ſtrengthened by an authentike ſeale) here the poſſibilitie of erring in the Propounder, takes not away the certaintie of the things propounded by him, becauſe, in this caſe, the ſame may be ſupplyed by other more ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient demonſtrations, vpon which, as the principall cauſes of our beliefe, wee may finally reſt.

But I will conclude where: I began, with our Countriman <hi>Stapleton,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he layes downe the very fundamentall reaſon vpon which this Doctrine is grounded. <note n="n" place="margin">Staplet. lib. 8 princip. c. 20. Fides eadem eſt in reliqua tota Eccleſia, quae eſt in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetis, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolis, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>There is the ſame faith</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in the reſt of the whole Church, which is in the Prophets, Apoſtles, and all thoſe who are immediately taught of God. They haue one and the ſame formall reaſon of their act of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. But the faith of the Apoſtles and Prophets which was by immediate reuelation, was lastly reſolued into God alone the Reuealer, and did end and rest vpon him onely, as the ſupreme and laſt cauſe of beleeuing, therefore the faith of the reſt of the whole Church, hath the ſame formall obiect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe foundations being laid, it ſhall not be hard to ſhape diſtinct anſweres to the ſeuerall queſtions aboue propounded. To the firſt, if the teſtimonie of the Church bee not infallible, how ſhall wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly knowe the Scriptures to bee the Word of God?</p>
                     <p>I anſwere, that wee may know them to bee ſo, partly, by the light of the Word, that is, the diuine notes and characters therein imprinted, and partly by the enlightning and perſwading grace of Gods Spirit, enabling vs to ſee, and mouing vs to beleeue what wee ſee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:25223:27"/>Now on the contrarie, I demand of them; <hi>(If one cannot bee aſſured of the certaintie of the Scriptures propounded by the Church, vnleſſe the propoſition of the Church bee infallible) how the lay Papiſts in this Land doe know any article of faith to be infallibly true, conſidering that few or none of them euer heard the voyce of that Church, which they ſuppoſe to bee infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; (that Church being according to their ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either the Pope in his chaire, or a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell) but are engaged altogether to the reports of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prieſts and Ieſuites, whom none will exempt from being ſubiect to error and deceit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. To the ſecond queſtion, if the expoſition of the Church be not infallible, how doe we know the ſenſe and meaning of the Scriptures?</p>
                     <p>I anſwere, that although all places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not alike perſpicuous, as all are not alike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation, yet for the opening of the ſenſe thereof, ſo farre as is behoofefull for his Church, God is the beſt Interpreter of his owne meaning, expounding outwardly one place of the Word by another, &amp; inwardly both opening ones eyes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and enclining ones heart to aſſent vnto the truth. As for thoſe which cannot ſee but with the Popes ſpectacles, and pretend the Scriptures to bee euery where throughout ſo ouerſhadowed with a miſt, that nothing preſents it ſelfe cleerly to their view, I wonder the leſſe at them, becauſe their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſuch, that they cannot ſee to ſerue God, without burning Tapers and lighted Candles at noone day.</p>
                     <p>Now, on the other ſide I demand of them, if one
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25223:28"/>
cannot know the certaine meaning and ſenſe of the Scriptures, vnleſſe the expoſition of the Church be infallible.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Wherefore hath not the Church of Rome all this while publiſht a ſet interpretation vpon any one book of the Bible, conſidering, that they ſay, it is ſo neceſſarie, and that the Popes Commentaries vpon it, haue for ſo many Marts beene expected?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>How a man which cannot diſcerne the ſenſe of the Scriptures in plaine places, ſhall be able to ſhun the proceſſe</hi> in infinitum, <hi>and not runne his wits out of breath, conſidering that according to the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the voyce of the Church vttered in former Decrees, requires the expoſition of the preſent Church, meaning the Pope, and that the Churches Canons are inuol'd with no leſſe, if not more perplexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than the Scriptures?</hi> I could inſtance in ancient Councells, as the <hi>Nicen,</hi> and aske whether the ſixth Canon, wherein theſe wordes be, <hi>Quoniam talis eſt Epiſcopo Romano conſuetudo,</hi> are to bee vnderſtood, according to the opinion of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> or <hi>Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or <hi>Caranza,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which foure are recounted by <hi>Bellarmine lib, 2. de Rom.

                     <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in reſpect of the meanes wherewith
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25223:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the holy Ghoſt cooperates, which are hearing of the Word of God preached, meditation, ſtudie, skill of tongues and the like, which are diuers in all. For we relye not (as I ſaid before) vpon ſpeciall and immediate reuelations, as the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did, but on the grace of God concurring with our meditations, and the vſe of the publike meanes.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in reſpect of the matters contayned in the Scriptures, whereof all diſplay not themſelues alike, being not all equally and alike neceſſarie to ſaluation, ſome impoſing an abſolute neceſſitie of beliefe, others onely a conditionall, that is, a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of minde to giue fuller credence, when it ſhall pleaſe God farther to enlighten one; as in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the authoritie of the Scriptures, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Inſtrument or Pen-man, whether it bee Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> or Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is not ſimply ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, as to know the principall Authour which is God, nor to determine punctually of the wordes ſo oblieging, as to beleeue the ſenſe; nor againe of the ſenſe of ſome places and texts as of other; all are to ſtriue vnto perfection, but as the difference is in the gifts of arte, grace, and nature, ſo ſhall the difference be in the meaſure of the knowledge of all or ſome.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> trick and ſleight of theirs, which they put vpon the people in this kinde, is, that bidding them to vrge vs to proue the Scriptures to bee the Word of God, or that they are cleare and eaſie in points neceſſarie to ſaluation, and knowing that the chiefe proofes vpon which we reſt, are embowelled in the very body of the Text itſelfe; <hi>firſt,</hi> they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the lay people to reade the Scriptures, vnleſſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25223:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they obtayne ſpeciall licence from the Biſhop or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor to doe it; as appeares by the <hi>fourth</hi> rule of prohibited bookes, which is at the end of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine Councell. And the granting of theſe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is now againe taken away by <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth as may bee ſeene in his <hi>Index</hi> of prohibited bookes, printed at Paris by <hi>Laurentius Sonius,</hi> and cited alſo by <hi>Iuſtinianus</hi> a Prieſt of the Congregation of the Oratorie, <hi>lib. 1. de Scriptura, cap. 9. Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know that ſome people will bee itching (notwithſtanding this prohibition) to looke into the Scriptures, and to ſee whether matters bee ſo as wee affirme them to bee, therefore they crie downe our Bibles, and preſent a Bible of their owne tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, which (to argue the obſcuritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) they patch vp with ſuch gallimaufrie and inke-horne termes, that an ordinarie man may bee confounded with the ſtrangeneſſe of the wordes. As in the old Teſtament publiſht by the Colledge of Doway; in ſtead of Fore-skin, they put <hi>Prepuce; Gen.</hi> 17. for Paſſeouer, <hi>Phaſe;</hi> for vnleauened bread, <hi>Azims,</hi> Exod. 12. for high places, <hi>Excelſes, 2.

thereby any whit of their courage, as being for want of artes and languages, vnable to ſee the point of the weapon which is darted at them, I meane the truth of thoſe things which are alleaged.</p>
                     <p>Their <hi>ſixt</hi> deuice is, that if any of their laytie, notwithſtanding thoſe prohibitions and this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will preſume ſo farre vpon the indulgencie of their ghoſtly Fathers, as to hazard a diſpute out of the Bible, yet to doe it with aduantage enough on <hi>their</hi> ſide, they counſell him to make no thruſts, but to lie onely vpon the ward, and therein to enioyne vs, to ſhew the articles of Faith eſtabliſhed in our Church, in iuſt ſo many wordes and ſyllables in the Scriptures and (as if grace deſtroyed nature) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vs the benefit of Reaſon or Conſequences.</p>
                     <p>1.

Which argument concludes our Aduerſaries as much (if not more) then it doth vs. For the mayneſt principle of their to wit, <hi>That thoſe which profeſſe the faith vnder the Biſhop of Rome, are the Church of Chriſt,</hi> cannot be deduced by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> logick, but ſearch made in the Court Rolls of Nature, and by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing an Euidence from thence to ſupply the place of one of the premiſſes. But to ſpeake more punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, we ſay, that thoſe principles of Nature which we imploy in this kinde, are alſo vertually included in the Scriptures, though not expreſly. As hee that faith, <hi>Socrates is a man,</hi> faith alſo by conſequence that <hi>Socrates is a ſubſtance,</hi> that he is a liuing creature and that hee is reaſonable, becauſe <hi>Man</hi> contaynes all theſe things in his nature. So the Scripture ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt hath a body, ſaith by conſequence, that according to his humane condition, he is finite, and being finite hath a limited and bounded exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtencie, and therefore cannot bee in many places at the ſame inſtant. For arte in this, is grounded vpon nature, and in nature the <hi>immediate cauſe</hi> implyes <hi>the effect,</hi> the <hi>ſpecies</hi> the <hi>genus,</hi> the <hi>ſubject</hi> the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> the <hi>parts, &amp; one contrarie remooues</hi>

                        <hi>the other,</hi> ſo that theſe Maximes of Philoſophie are but dilated verities, being before contractedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the Letter, and adde not any thing to the Scriptures fulneſſe, but onely are diſplayed by the vnderſtanding facultie, as the ſpecies and formes of an obiect are by a perſpectiue glaſſe multiplyed and made more viſible.</p>
                     <p>3. If we preſſe them with the force and neceſſitie of our conſequence, they bid them, demand of vs, whether we cannot erre in the deducing of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? if we ſay we cannot, then to tell vs that we oppugne a doctrine of our owne, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth that the Church may erre; and if wee ſay wee may, then they will them to aske vs, how wee can build an article of faith vpon a Conſequence which by our owne confeſſion is fallible. To which wee ſay, <hi>firſt,</hi> that <hi>a poſſe ad eſſe non valet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> from a poſſibilitie of erring, to an actuall erring, an argument will not follow. Againe, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of a Conſequence depends not vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him which deduceth it, but vpon the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall vnion and reall affinitie betweene the termes of the Antecedent and Conſequent. But <hi>laſtly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they preſſe vs, to ſhew, how we can aſſure our ſelues that in this or that particular Conſequence we doe not erre, conſidering that there is no ſubiect wherein we do not acknowledge, that we may erre. Let me aske them againe, how any of them can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues that they know the meaning of the Church in any one article of faith, conſidering that there is none of them in particular (the Pope in his chaire excepted) which may not (by their owne
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:25223:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Tenets) miſtake a word, or miſſe-conceiue the Churches meaning. Sure if this reaſon were of force, wee ſhould for the ſame Cauſe take away all certaintie of knowledge which comes by the ſenſe, which was the error of the <hi>Academikes</hi> and <hi>Pirrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> For what ſenſe is there which at ſometimes by reaſon of the <hi>Medium, Organ,</hi> or <hi>Object,</hi> is not lyable to erre and be deceiued? But as Nature, which (Philoſophers ſay) is not defectiue in things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, hath for the remedying of theſe inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces endowed man with reaſon, common notions and principles, whereby hee is able to iudge of the due ſite, habitude, and diſpoſition of things, ſo the God of Nature, which is alſo the God of Grace, and knowes the neceſſitie of his children, giues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them (beſides that portion of reaſon, common notions and principles aboue-mentioned) the ſpirit alſo of diſcretion, for <hi>the ſpirituall man iudgeth all things, 1.

Ioh.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
                     <p>4. If the Conſequence bee ſo euident, that they cannot for ſhame denie it, then they counſell them to aske vs, where the Scripture ſaith in expreſſe termes, that whatſoeuer followeth by euident and neceſſarie conſequence from her Pages, is an article of faith. Where they hope to choake vs with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall acception of the word article. For an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith is ſometimes taken <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> for one of thoſe verities which ſo neerly touch the foundation of faith, that a man cannot be ſaued vnleſſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:25223:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
know and beleeue it, ſometimes <hi>largely</hi> for any Catholike truth whatſoeuer. If they take it in the former ſenſe, they fight with their owne ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, for which of our men euer ſaid, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer followeth from the Scriptures by euident and neceſſarie conſequence, is in ſuch manner and ſenſe an article of faith. But if they take it in the latter ſenſe, wee need not runne farre for Texts to proue that ſuch conſequences are articles of faith, and require (according to the nature of the ſubiect and euidence of the deduction) a beliefe, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, or implicit of them, becauſe that concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as I ſhewed before, lye hid in their principles, as a kernell in the ſhell, and that conſequences are materially in their premiſes, and being in them, are to be eſteemed part of them, and therefore he which is bound to an abſolute beliefe of the one, is bound alſo, at leaſt conditionally, that is, vpon the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the euidence of the conſequence, to beleeue the other.</p>
                     <p>5. If wee diſpute ſyllogiſtically, they bid them tell vs, that not the Scriptures, but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes rules for ſyllogiſmes, and that <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> rules cannot binde the faith. As though ſyllogiſticke formes were principall cauſes of the truth of things, and not onely inſtruments, whereby the Truth which was before, and might otherwiſe by naturall Logick and the ſtrength of the common apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be perceiued, is made ſomewhat the more eaſie and apparant. For many Concluſions follow neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in regard of the <hi>matter,</hi> which are vicious in regard of the <hi>forme. Galen</hi> inuented a fourth figure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25223:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which others reiect. And therefore wee build no more vpon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in matters of faith, then an houſe is built vpon the Carpenters Hammer, Square or Rule, which are neither whole nor part of the building, though otherwiſe they conduce thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>6. If wee ſtop their mouthes, either with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Texts of Scripture or pregnant conſequences, then they bid them demand of vs <hi>Who ſhalbe iudge?</hi> Which is a peece of Sophiſtrie beyond the Deuils,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 6.</note> who being taken tardie by our Sauiour in miſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoting places of Scripture, forgot to aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: <hi>Who ſhalbe iudge?</hi> This cauill is ſquint-eyed, and lookes three wayes at once. If we ſay the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> then they vpbraid vs with flying to priuate ſpirits, and making our ſelues Iudges in our owne cauſe. If we ſay the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they reply, that the Scriptures are not ſufficient to execute the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mute and wanting a voyce to declare, which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many ſenſes) is their owne; and if we ſay the <hi>Church,</hi> then they conceiue the victorie to runne on their ſide, and think we haue granted them their Concluſion. But what if we make neither the one nor the other ſitting alone, to be this Iudge, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Concurrency (though not equall) in all of them, and that Concurrency (though not to the enacting of the ſentence) as it is conſidered <hi>in ſe,</hi> in it ſelfe, yet to the publication of it, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> as it hath reference to vs? What then ſhall become of theſe ſequells? And ſo it is indeed. For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we make one ſupreme Iudge in this high Court of Veritie, yet wee doe not imagine him to ſpeake
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25223:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but by writing, nor that writing to bee ordinarily read and declared without an Herald. <hi>The principall Iudge,</hi> wee ſay, is God himſelfe, from whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes the knowledge of all ſupernaturall truths whatſoeuer. The inſtruments, whereby hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates them vnto vs, are threefold; <hi>firſt,</hi> his Spirit, whereby he ſpeakes inwardly vnto vs, both enlightning vs to behold, and perſwading vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the ſenſe and meaning of his myſteries. Yet is not this a priuate ſpirit, becauſe it reueales not ought vnto vs beſides the publicke writing, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily without the miniſterie of the Church.

                     <p>So that in ſumme the <hi>totall and plenary indicature</hi> of matters of Faith, belongs to the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25223:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereby the Iudge of theſe things properly taken, is he alone; the gift of his ſpirit, the Scriptures and the Church, are but <hi>partiall inſtruments</hi> of promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſeruing onely as ſeuerall trunkes and pipes, whereby his decree arriues at the eares of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; yet if any ſhall compare the outward inſtruments together, <hi>the Church</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and demand, by which of the two it is that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſpeakes properly; as hee is iudge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, and on which wee are finally to reſt for his infallible ſentence; I anſwer, not the Church, but the Scriptures. Firſt in reſpect of their dignity, becauſe the Scriptures are the immediate worke of God, dictated by his Spirit; Whereas the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church proceed not immediately from God, but mediating the voice of the Scriptures. Secondly in reſpect of their <hi>certainty,</hi> for the church is ſubiect to error, the Scriptures are not. Againe the truth in regard of the Scriptures is <hi>fixt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſie to be there found, ſhee being alwayes lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the ſame bookes, but in regard of the Church it is <hi>Ambulatorie,</hi> and therefore needes more ſearch to diſcouer it there, as not being entayled either to chaire, place or perſon. Thirdly in reſpect of the <hi>order and manner of knowing them,</hi> for howſoeuer by a <hi>confuſed knowledge,</hi> the Church may bee <hi>notior Scripturis,</hi> knowen better then the Scriptures, and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before them, yet <hi>according to a diſtinct knowledge,</hi> are the Scriptures <hi>notiores Eccleſia,</hi> knowne better and ſooner then the Church; for the true Scriptures, are knowne by their owne light, but the true Church, is not knowne but by the light of the Scriptures.</p>

Church Catholikes being, but <hi>modus cognoſcendi,</hi> the manner of knowing it, is more queſtionable; for on it depends that great queſtion of our dayes, wherein the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> ſo triumph, concerning the perpetuitie and viſibilitie of our Church in all Ages.

                           <item>1.

Thus from that principle in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, that heauie things tend downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the center, I know that a plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of lead, would fall to the center of the earth, if no thicke or groſſe body interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſelfe, although I neuer ſaw any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or practice of the fame.

                           <item>2. The other <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> that is, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the effects to the cauſe, or by grounding ones knowledge and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie vpon the ſenſe of an experiment, as when one beleeues that the fire is hot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee feeles it burne, or that the Sea is ſalt becauſe he taſtes it briniſh.</item>

due circumſpection applyed, but they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and in all ſubiects alike demonſtratiue, and therefore the queſtion will bee, <hi>which of them the Creed requires for the procuring of a firme beliefe and aſſent to this article of the Catholike Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſſe, that arguments <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> that is, from teſtimonies of men, pointing out by name the Profeſſors and vpholders of any Religion in all Ages, is a great motiue and inducement to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that ſuch a Religion is Catholike, that is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall in reſpect of place, perſons, and time; and that the Church profeſſing ſuch a Religion is of the like amplitude and antiquitie. But yet this is not that <hi>modus cognoſcendi,</hi> that manner of knowing the true Church, to be Catholike, which is proper to the Creed, or by which Faith cleaues vnto it, and beleeues it, as an article of ſaluation: that manner of knowing it to be ſo, is onely <hi>a priori,</hi> by diuine principles, that is, by Gods promiſes made vnto it in the Scriptures, where wee reade, <hi>that of Chriſts Kingdome there ſhall be no end,</hi> Pſal. 2. <hi>that the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it,</hi> Matth. 16. and <hi>that our Sauiour will continue with vs vnto the end, Math.</hi> 28. theſe are the pedigrees of Chriſts Church, by theſe it proues it ſelfe to be of an ancient ſtemme, that it had noble Progenitors: he which playes the Herald and points out the ſeuerall deſcents of her ſonnes, with their lots and portions in all Ages, he may ſomewhat illuſtrate the Church Catholike, he cannot ſtrengthen or confirme it; hee may bee a <hi>Thomas Didimus,</hi> which will not beleeue vnleſſe hee ſees, hee cannot bee any of thoſe <hi>bleſſed of</hi>

                        <hi>our Sauiour, which ſee not, and yet beleeue,</hi> Ioh. 20.</p>
                     <p>Now that the Catholiciſme of the Church, that is, the vniuerſalitie, duration and perpetuitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (ſo farre as it enters the Creed) is to bee knowne onely <hi>a priori,</hi> by the promiſes made in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnto it, and not <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> that is, by inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhewing the viſible Profeſſors of the ſame in all Ages, I ſhall not neede to trauaile farther then the Creed it ſelfe to make it good.</p>
                     <p>My firſt reaſon ſhall be drawne from <hi>the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church Catholike as it is an article of our Creed,</hi> and as we ſay, <hi>I beleeue the Catholike Church.</hi> From whence I thus argue. Whatſoeuer wee are to beleeue as an article of the Creed, the ſame muſt bee endowed with theſe foure conditions, The <hi>firſt, that the proofe of it be perfect,</hi> for otherwiſe, if it prooue but in part, it cannot ſuffice for an article of faith. The <hi>ſecond, that the ground vpon which it depends be ſome diuine and infallible principle,</hi> for otherwiſe it may create an opinion in one, but it cannot beget a faith. <hi>Thirdly, that all thoſe who are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it be capable of the manner of prouing it,</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">Gregor. de Valent. in Tho. tom. 3. diſp. 1. q. 1. punct. 7. §. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi> requires in theſe caſes.

                     <p>Now to bring this home to my argument; the Church Catholick, of theſe foure wayes that it may be conſidered, is not viſible at all three wayes, and the fourth, it is not alwayes ſo clearely viſible, as that the viſibilitie ſhould ſerue for a note whereby to come to the knowledge of the vniuerſalitie and perpetuitie of the Church.

note to know the Church, it is neceſſarie, that the note bee fit for all ſorts and conditions of men, and that all men bee qualified and capable to diſcerne the Church by it; But the Church euen in this ſenſe, by his owne confeſſion in the 16. §. is ſometimes ſo toſt with the flouds of error, ſchiſmes and perſecutions, that to the vnskilfull, and ſuch as cannot prudently weigh the reaſons of times and circumſtances, it is hard to bee knowne; ſo that by conſequence the Viſibilitie of it is not alwaies ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant vnto all ſorts of men, as to ſerue for a note or proofe of the Church as Catholicke.

or what Profeſſors of your doctrine were there, or what aſſemblies of men profeſſing the ſame faith that you doe, euer ſince the time of our Sauiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this preſent?

vs take along with vs theſe few conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>firſt,</hi> that <hi>we are to distinguiſh betweene our affirmatiues, that is, ſuch things as are purely affirmed by vs, and our negatiues, ſuch as in whole or in part we denie,</hi> betweene which there is a great difference to be made in all ſciences. For, affirmatiue propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onely are the proper parts and ingredients of a diſcipline, Negatiues are admitted (ſay Logicians) not ſo much by way of Precept as of Cautell and of Commentaries to vindicate the other from miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> that <hi>ſuch affirmatiues of ours as are eſtabliſhed by our Church of England, at leaſt ſuch as concerne the foundation of faith, haue beene in all ages profeſſed by the Church of Rome it ſelfe;</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof, we are to obſerue, that the Popes Arithmetick which he vſeth in calculating the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith, is not ſubſtraction but addition: what wee purely affirme, the Popiſh writers for the moſt part doe affirme the ſame; the difference is, that they affirme ſomewhat more then wee doe. They denie not ſo much that our affirmations are truth, as that they ſay we affirme not all the truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they vſually ſtile vs in their writings <hi>Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſts.</hi> For example ſake: Wee agree on both ſides, the Scriptures to be the Rule of Faith, the Bookes of the old Teſtament written in Hebrew to bee Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, that we are iuſtified by Faith, that God hath made two receptacles for mens ſoules after death, Heauen and Hell, that God may bee worſhipped in ſpirit without an Image, that wee are to pray vnto God by Chriſt, that there be two Sacraments, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25223:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt is really receaued in the Lords Supper, that Chriſt made one oblation of himſelfe vpon the Croſſe for the redemption, propitiation, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the ſinnes of the whole world. In a word, where they take the Negatiue part, as in with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cup from the Laytie, forbidding the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments in the vulgar tongue and reſtrayning the marriage of Prieſts, yet euen in theſe they condeſcend vnto vs for the lawfulneſſe of the things in themſelues, and in reſpect of the Law of God, and oppoſe them onely in regard of their neceſſitie and conueniencie, and for that the Church of Rome hath otherwiſe ordayned.</p>
                     <p>But ſee, our affirmations content them not. To the Scriptures they adde and equalize vnwritten Traditions; To the Hebrew Canon, the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha; To Faith in the act of Iuſtification, Workes; To Heauen and Hell, Purgatorie, <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> and <hi>Limbus Puerorum;</hi> To the worſhip of God in ſpirit, Images; To prayer to God by Chriſt, inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and interceſſion of Saints; To Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, fiue other Sacraments; To the realitie of Chriſt in the Sacrament, his corporall preſence; To the ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, the ſacrifice in the Maſſe; with other like; and theſe we denie.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>third,</hi> that <hi>our affirmations (by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Rome) haue beene in all ages deemed ſufficient to ſaluation, ſo that our Negatiues take not away any doctrine, the explicit beliefe whereof is abſolutely neceſſarie.</hi>

                        <hi>of faith) other things then the articles of the Apoſtles Creed, the ten Commandements, and ſome few of the Sacraments, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe are ſimply neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and profitable for all men, the reſt beſides, ſuch as that a man may be ſaued without them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>for practice,</hi> they grant, that one may attayne ſaluation without the performance of ſuch duties as wee refuſe to vnder-goe; For if one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues no more then what is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hee beleeues (as <note n="n" place="margin">Bellarm. ib.</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth) as much as is neceſſarie and profitable vnto all men. If one worſhips God without an Image, they denie not, but that this worſhip is acceptable; If one pray immediatly vnto Chriſt &amp; repeates the Lords prayer, they will not ſay that his deuotion is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; If one performe the beſt works he can (which wee alſo require) and ſtand not vpon the point of merit, but onely vpon the mercy of God, as we doe, <note n="o" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 5. de Iuſtif. c. 7.

Now, what would a man require more of a Chriſtian, then to beleeue well, pray well, liue well and die well?</p>
                     <p>The fourth conſideration is, <hi>that thoſe points of theirs whereof we hold the Negatiue, were not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as articles of faith, nor the contrarie iudged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall by the Church of Rome for many hundred yeeres after Chriſt.</hi> For that Church could not iudge vs to be enemies of her faith, or oppugners of that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereon ſhee was built: which firſt, by our Aduerſaries owne confeſſions, held <note n="p" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 11. §.

(both Romaniſts) that they held three Orders to bee in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Deacons, Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nay, the <hi>Huſsites</hi> which deſcended from them, did ſo highly eſteeme of theſe Orders, that as <note n="n" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. ca. 26.

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Gregorie de Valentia</hi> doe acknowledge, they receiued none into the Office of Paſtors, but ſuch as were orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of the Church <hi>mixt and conioyn'd</hi> with the Church of Rome it ſelfe, conſiſted of thoſe, who making no viſible ſeparation from the Roman profeſſion, as not perceiuing the myſterie of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which wrought in it, did yet miſlike the groſſer errors, which at this day ſhee maintayneth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a reformation.</p>
                     <p>For there may bee a Church, which in reſpect of her chiefe Prelates, and a predominant faction therein, may bee falſe and Antichriſtian, yet may contayne ſome members of the true Church within her Pale, who though they refuſe not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with her; nay more, are infected with ſome ſmaller errors of the time, yet ſwallow not downe all vntruths without difference, but keepe ſtill the foundation of faith intire and vnſhaken. Thus it was with the Church of the Iewes at the comming
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:25223:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our Sauiour. They which fate in <hi>Moſes chaire,</hi> were the Scribes and the Phariſies, who peruerted the doctrine of the Law, and were the profeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Sauiour, yet many there were, who though they communicated with them in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sacraments and diſcipline of the Church, yet were the flock of another fold, and like a few Oliues at the end of a twig, after the ſhaking of the tree, claue to the right ſtocke, and wayted for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Chriſt. And thus doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was with ſome, which being outwardly of the Church of Rome, wee may iuſtly notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding challenge to our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>1. For <hi>firſt,</hi> there was baptiſme, which admitted them to the rights and priuiledges of our Church, for they were baptiſed vnto Chriſts Truth, and not the Popes errors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                        <note n="o" place="margin">
                           <hi>In the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Popiſh Biſhops, it is ſaid.</hi> Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus te, ſl omne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prudentiam tuam quantum tua capax eſt natura diuinae Scripturae ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibus acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare volueris?

Accipe Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelia, vade &amp; praedica po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo tibi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſo.</note> There was true &amp; lawfull ordination, wherein their Paſtors receiued commiſſion, and did promiſe to teach the people, not the Popes legends, but out of the holy Scriptures, and to intend wholly to the ſenſe thereof. So that both Paſtor and flock, were ours by admiſſion, promiſe and ingagement, theirs by abuſe and practiſe; for howſoeuer the Prieſt at the baptiſing, or the Biſhop at the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had another meaning, yet the wordes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they baptiſed and ordayned being the wordes of Chriſt, are to be taken in Chriſts meaning, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hee which receiueth a thing from another, is to receiue it according to the intention of the principall Giuer, and not the inſtrumentall giuer. Hee which conferres Baptiſme and Orders as the

                        <hi>principall</hi> Donor is Chriſt, the Biſhop or Paſtor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres them onely as his <hi>inſtruments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There were ſufficient meanes of Calling beſides, to ſupply the Paſtors negligence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, as <hi>first,</hi> profitable parcells of Gods Word read in the Church, and the whole bodie of the Scriptures at hand, which though it were in Latine, yet many might vnderſtand it, and this our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our pointed at, when hee brings in <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Parable, thus ſpeaking to the rich man touching his brethren, <hi>habent Moſen &amp; Prophetas,</hi> they haue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Writings and Commentaries of the Fathers, to whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations their <note n="p" place="margin">Concil.

Seſſ. 2.</note> Councells binde them to adhere, and out of whom diuers of the Papiſts both ancient and moderne, doe confeſſe (as you haue heard) that many of the chiefe articles of Poperie were not for a long time brought into the Church, nor beleeued. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Schoolemen and others of their owne ſide, which taught publikely in their Vniuerſities, our very doctrine (not, I confeſſe ſo entirely as they ſhould) but ſome in one point, others in another, whereby there was both pregnant meanes to know the truth, and ſtrong reaſons to thinke at leaſt the doctrines ſo controuerted, and diuerſly reſolued, to be in the Popiſh ſenſe at moſt no article of faith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> there were no Councells generally recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all, and not excepted at by ſome, which ſo expreſly deliuered the grounds and Tenets of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie as now they are, vntill the Councell of Trent.</p>
                     <p>So then who can denie, that they were ours by Calling, ours by Ordination, by inſtitution and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:25223:53"/>
admiſſion ours, and why ſhould any doubt, but that ſome were by practice and obedience ours; ſurely, God which called <hi>Iob</hi> amongſt the Heathen, and the Queene of the South by the bare report of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> would not ſuffer this Calling to be ſtil in vaine; the Ordination to be wholly vnprofitable; or that Admiſſion in baptiſme to be alwayes fruſtrate; that is, to be the ſauour of death vnto death, and in none the ſauour of life vnto life. For if ſheepe in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, where venemous herbes are mixt with whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, can by the inſtinct of nature make choiſe of that which is proper for them, and abſtaine from the contrarie; what maruaile is it, if the flocke of Chriſt, who know the voyce of the true Shepheard from the voyce of ſtrangers, ſhould by the guidance of Gods aſſiſting Spirit doe the ſame. Who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that God hath his Temple where Antichriſt hath his Throne, ſeeing, <note n="*" place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2. Reuel. 18. 4.</note> Antichriſt (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells vs) is to ſit in it? or that ſome of Gods people may bee in Babylon, ſeeing ſuch are warned by the Spirit to come out of her: and it were in vaine to command a man to depart a place if he were not there.</p>
                     <p>Now, if any ſhall thinke theſe motiues and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of ours, eſpecially touching the laſt ſixe hundred yeeres, not to be altogether ſo exact as the Papiſts require, who challenge vs to produce the names of ſuch viſible Proteſtants in all ages, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the ſame entire doctrine in all reſpects, that we doe; I anſwere, <hi>first,</hi> that it is not our hold that the Church neuer erreth or diſcordeth from it ſelfe <hi>in minoribus,</hi> in matters of leſſe moment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:25223:54"/>
it is ſufficient for vs to ſhew who profeſſed our faith entirely, <hi>in majoribus,</hi> that is, ſuch points as of themſelues are fundamentall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ſay, that whereas wee finde a twofold ſtate of the Church in the <note n="r" place="margin">Reuel. 20. 2.</note> Apocalypſe: the one <hi>before the looſing of Satan,</hi> whileſt the old Dragon was ſhut vp in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit for a thouſand yeeres: the other <hi>after his looſing,</hi> when the Deuill was to be let free to goe and deceiue the Nations, not in one pettie Hamlet, but in the foure quarters of the earth, that is, (as Saint <note n="ſ" place="margin">Aug. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. Dei, lib. 20. cap. 8. &amp; 9. Vid. Bellar. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Auſten</hi> expounds it) vnder the reigne and tyrannie of Antichriſt; We are not bound to giue ſo ſtrict a reckoning and account of our Profeſſors, vnder the ſecond ſtate of the Church, as vnder the firſt. The reaſon is, becauſe the Church in her firſt eſtate was glorious to behold, appearing like a <note n="t" place="margin">Reuel. 12. 1.</note> Woman clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Sunne. But in the latter ſhee was to be vnder the thraldome of Antichriſt, and our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries themſelues tell vs, that then wee are not to enquire for viſible Profeſſors of the true faith, or for the publike exerciſe of Religion, ſo <note n="u" place="margin">Suarez lib. 5. cont. ſect. Angl. cap. 21. Bellar. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Suarez, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> and others. In a word, then was the time that the Church was to flee into the wilderneſſe, as was foretold, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. Now, to expect multitudes<note place="margin">x <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. 14.</note> of people, frequent cities, pompous ſplendor, afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of foode and prouiſion in a wilderneſſe, were extreame madneſſe; this were to ſuppoſe a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be no wilderneſſe. In Deſerts there may be aſſemblies of men, but they are rare; there may be foode, but we know it is but little, and ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as is but abſolutely neceſſarie for the life of man; and there may be buildings &amp; edifices, but through
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:25223:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the thickets of trees, and ſhades of leaues hardly to bee diſcerned. And ſo did it fare with the Church vnder the tyrannie of Antichriſt. There were ſome alwayes of it, but few; there were aſſemblies, but not ſo euident to the eye of the world; and there was the foode of the Word and Sacraments, but not ſo plentifull, nor euery where ſo pure as before times.</p>
                     <p>But who would thinke that the Ieſuites were all this while but in ieſt, and that they are conſcious to themſelues, that the taske which they require to bee performed on our part, is not feſable on their owne. For let mee but queſtion them from their owne grounds; whether the entire articles of faith, which the Church of Rome now holds, are found mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Writers in all ages? The Cardinall and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Ieſuites ingeniouſly confeſſe they were not, and namely Indulgences, the Churches treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the Popes canonizing of Saints, &amp;c. onely they anſwer, that it followes not, that they were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued becauſe they are not mentioned: Bee it ſo; but if their articles of faith be not mentioned, how will they make it appeare by the teſtimonies of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in all ages (as they vndertake to doe) that ſuch Tenets were from the time of the bleſſed Apoſtles held without interruption. <note n="z" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 9. §. Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta regula.</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore anſweres, that the concurrent teſtimonies of ſome Writers of greateſt note, affirming ſuch a Doctrine to haue beene profeſſed &amp; beleeued by the Church in all ages, none gaine-ſaying it, will ſerue the turne. But here, beſides that they ſtand not to their firſt bargaine, which was to produce the teſtimonies of Writers in all ages; I demand of what ages they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:25223:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meane that their writers ſhall bee, to whoſe concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent iudgement they will adhere; if of the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, we accept the offer, but this will little aduantage them: for neither are many points of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene vs and them mentioned by thoſe writers, as aboue was ſpecified, much leſſe affirmed to bee Apoſtolicall Traditions: neither are thoſe which are mentioned, allowed of in that ſenſe which they deliuer. If the writers of the after Church, and namely the Schoolemen, let them heare <note n="a" place="margin">Valent. in Thom. tom. 3. diſp. 1. q. 1. p. 7. §. 46.

                        <hi>Gregorie de Valentia's</hi> owne cenſure concerning them. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer all the Fathers</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>doe vniformely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that is to bee held for the opinion of the Doctors of all times, becauſe the Schoolemen doe follow the holy Fathers as their guides; But not on the contrarie, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Schoolemen doe deliuer vniformely, is to bee thought to haue beene beleeued by the Doctors in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; becauſe the Schoolemen haue added many things more explicatly to the doctrine of the Fathers.</hi> Seeing therefore, neither ancient writers will ſerue their turne, no latter may be admitted, I demand by what other authoritie they hope now to make good their bragge? By what (doe the <note n="b" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 9. 5. Quinta regula. Valent. in Thom. tom. 3. diſp. 1. q. 1. p. 7. §. 44.</note> Ieſuites anſwere) but by the teſtimonie of the Church, and chiefly the preſent, affirming ſuch a doctrine to haue beene vniuerſally beleeued in all ages. And this indeed is their laſt refuge, whereby it may plainely appeare, that after they haue ſo lowdly dared vs to ſhew the perpetuitie of our Church in all ages, <hi>a posteriori,</hi> by producing the names of our ſeuerall Profeſſors,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:25223:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they can bee contented quietly to relinquiſh that title themſelues, and to flie to the teſtimonie of the Church, which being with them the foundation and principle of their faith, is not properly to argue <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> but <hi>a priori,</hi> the difference betweene our arguing in that kinde and theirs, being but this, that we proceed deſcending downwards from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, they aſcending vpwards from the preſent Church. But I aske now, will the Churches teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in this caſe ſerue their turnes, to proue, that whatſoeuer is held at this preſent as an article of faith in the Roman Conſiſtorie, was alwayes ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in the Church. No, doe <note n="c" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de verbo Dei, cap 10. Valent. in Thom. tom. 3. diſp. 1. q. 1. p. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Bellarmine, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and other Ieſuites informe vs: for ſome points (ſay they) were not heretofore defined by the Church (in which to erre was then no hereſie) which now are; and <hi>Thomas</hi> tells vs that the Pope may make a new Creed: But wee aske then, how their articles of faith were held in all ages? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that theſe new additions of theirs, though they were not as then made articles of faith, nor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Fathers <hi>explicitly,</hi> yet were they <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly</hi> beleeued. But this plungeth them then into another gulfe, for if <hi>implicitly</hi> onely, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion thereof was not viſible; for an implicit beliefe is like ſeed buried in the ground, and cannot ſerue for any of thoſe proofes, whereby the viſibilitie of the Church which is in queſtion, may be tried. But haply (will ſome ſay) thoſe points which in former times were not mentioned or not expreſly beleeued, or not defined, are but matters of leſſe moment, and ſuch as the preſent Church of Rome makes not to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:25223:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be fundamentall. No, doe the Ieſuites anſwer; for they are euen ſuch as are by the Tridentine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Generall Councells, commanded vnder paine of an A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus, whatſoeuer they pretend, they finde no harbour, but in their preſent Church, and that like the <hi>Sirtes</hi> too, troubleſome and tempeſtious.

                  <p>The ſecond ſort of <hi>Lenetiues,</hi> conſiſted in relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or releaſements from Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures. For whereas, during the heat of perſecutions, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity of Church Diſcipline was ſuch, that for ſome offences, ten yeeres, for ſome the whole life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was adiudged to the doing of penance; the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction notwithſtanding, which ſome gaue the Church by outward ſignes of penitency, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts<note place="margin">Albaſpin. 1. 1. cap. 20.</note> of Martyrs in Priſon for them, cauſed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to releaſe them either of all or of part of thoſe yeares wherein they ſtood bound to vndergoe their penance, and theſe were the Indulgences of thoſe dayes. But the times growing more looſe and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and withall the eſteeme held of Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures diminiſhing, the Cleargie was ſaine to remit much of their rigour; and to change publike penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into priuate, or other good workes, and ſo to bring in that which wee call commutations. Now theſe alſo in the end beeing ſlighted, the Biſhops who had let goe and quitted the true reines, tooke hold by the falſe, and taught, that whatſoeuer a man
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25223:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
omits to performe of his commutations in this life, the ſame he ſhall pay full dearly in Purgatory, in the the World to come; which brought an eager and freſh deſire in men to procure with all coſt and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Pardons for the neglect thereof; and becauſe ſome caſes were reſerued to the Popes owne power of diſpenſing (euery man beeing deſirous to haue a plenary or full pardon) they began to neglect other Biſhops, and eſtabliſhed the Pope (by that meanes) in the ſole right of granting Indulgences, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the firſt, but abſolutions in the Conſiſtory of the Church, and that for the liuing onely, became a thouſand yeares and more after Chriſt, to be abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Chancery of Heauen, and that alſo for the dead.</p>
                  <p>By theſe few examples it may appeare, how from the miſconſtruction and wreſted Interpretations of Primitiue Diſcipline, the bodie of Popery is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and withall the degrees whereby it ſprang vp to this ſtature which now it hath, to the end that the Deuils policie being ript vp, our ignorance of the firſt Founders of Romiſh Cockle, may ſeeme as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, as was this of the Seruants in my Text of the Sower of Tares: and withall that our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may not think vs ſo ſtupid as to know nothing, though wee bee not ſo skilfull as they require, to know euery thing.
