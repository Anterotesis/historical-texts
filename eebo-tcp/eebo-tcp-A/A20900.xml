         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What will you ſay if I adde more, that there is put into it the true eſſence of golde, which is ſo commended in olde time, by the writings of learned Philoſophers and Phyſicians? I beleeue you would laugh at this eſſence, which is vnknowen vnto you, yet familiar vnto many phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. But I affirme that golde to be a moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and effectuall remedie to helpe the ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, againſt melancholike affections, weake ſtomackes, paſſions of the heart, and ſuch as be extreamly ſadde.</p>
                  <p>Truelie you may worthe lie beleue, that there is much more force in his eſſence, then in your leafe golde. And this you will graunt (my friend <hi>Aubertus)</hi> that there is greater force of ſecrete qualities in that moſt fine golde, then in your brothes ſodden with golde. Neither yet doe I thinke you doe beleeue (for that were too abſurde) that golde which cannot be waſted or burned with the heate of the fire, can be ſo digeſted or ouercome by naturall heare, but that it may by ſome meane ſtreng hen the hart the ſubſtance remaining whole, when as the opinion of the Philoſophers is this, that all earth is dead, and that it is only the ſpirites of things that can worke in bodies. But <hi>Laudanum</hi> it ſelfe, although it be opiat, yet is it not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:10504:5"/>
to be reprehended. For if it were not ſo corrected afore, it were very dangerous, &amp; for his extreame coldnes dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as the <hi>Paracelſians</hi> which are the folowers of the true and auncient phiſicke, doe well vnderſtand. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth any of them doubt, but that <hi>Opinm,</hi> to take away his venemous force, is corrected of many, only with ſafferon, caſtoreum and mirre, which correction doeth nothing hinder, but that it may be done with a better pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paration: for <hi>Aloes</hi> alſo is waſhed, that it frette not the veines with his ſharpnes: and blacke <hi>Elebore</hi> is made ſo commodious for vſe, with the ſpirite of wine, and oile of Anieſeedes, (that you may learne alſo of the Chymicke Phiſicians) that it may be ſafelie geuen to children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dropſey, and all melancholie affections.

Therefore are ſalt meates commended, becauſe ſalt doth extenuat and driue away the excrementes, dryeth them vp, gathereth ſtrength and comforteth.</p>
                  <p>By this I thinke you and all other do ſufficiently perceiue how greatly you are deceaued in contemning our remedy taken out of the true doctrine of the learned.

I thinke there is no Doctor wil ſay this to be ſo abſurd &amp; hurtfull for the quartane. You ſhould therefore if you reproue <hi>Paracelſus</hi> medicines, haue choſen ſome other more ſpeciall thinges, wherein you might haue exerciſed the greatnes of your witte and proued your cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For theſe thinges (although you enuiouſly call them <hi>Theophraſticall)</hi> are both agreeable to reaſon, and to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of euery learned Phiſition. But peraduenture you will ſay theſe thinges haue not beene knowen to the diuine Hippocrates, nor vnto <hi>Galen,</hi> and therefore you will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that they are to be reiected: but that is onely by your owne iudgement, and not by any reaſon, wee do not deſpiſe their excellent knowledge and diuine learning, neither violate their lawdable memory, when as we ſay they were the firſt that floriſhed in Phiſicke: yet therewithall we affirme that they had not tried all kinde of medecines, or knew the properties of them all.

of diuers roſins, gummes, and other kindes of vegetables are drawen many faire and very profitable preparations: as alſo of diuers partes of ſundrie beaſtes, of which rightly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared are made many verie holſome medicines, as by the true preparations of Mumia onely knowen vnto the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſians is made a moſt laudable medecine in all peſtilent infections.

Other call all things that are digged out of the bowels of the earth by the proper name of mettalles. So <hi>Oneſicritus</hi> writeth that in Carma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia there is a mettall of a red chalke. <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirmeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in Lybia about <hi>Atlantus,</hi> is a mettall of ſalt, and this doth <hi>Plinie</hi> teſtify in his 33. booke of his naturall hiſtorie. Others ſay that is proper mettall, which being molten is brought againe to his former forme, and that may be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out with hammer, is hard and apt to take impreſſion &amp; for that cauſe they deuide it into ſix, that is, golde, ſiluer, copper tinne, leade, and Iron: whereunto ſome haue added mercurie, not that it is a mettall indeede, but it may be. The Chimiſtes vſe to call them by the names of the planets, not to referre their ſubſtance to the planets, as <hi>Aubertus</hi> foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly thinketh: but partly moued with a certaine likenes of the greateſt and principall ſtarres (for which cauſe they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the two moſt perfect mettalles, the Sunne and Moone) and Iron for his hardnes, <hi>Mars,</hi> whom the Poets faine to be the God of armes and battell, and quickſiluer for the great and vncertaine motion they called <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and partly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pythagoreans, that they might hide their ſecrets vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darke ſpeeches. But I ſee no reaſon why Antimony ſhould be properly receiued among mettalles (wherefore by <hi>Agricola</hi> his leaue, whoſe aucthoritie <hi>Aubertus</hi> leaneth
<pb facs="tcp:10504:10"/>
vnto) it is to be excepted out of their kinde, for that it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their definition: for all mettalles mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doe returne to their, proper forme, and ſuch as are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be driuen, be hard, and apt to receiue impreſſion: by which reaſon they differ from many liquable ſtones, in which the humiditie is not ſtrongly mixed with the dry earthines, as alſo from infinite kindes of marcaſites and halfe metalles. But Antymony molten doth vtterly looſe his firſt forme, as practiſioners doe daily trie, neither is it eaſye to be driuen, and practiſe ſheweth it will take no print, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it cannot be called mettall. But it pleaſed <hi>Aubertus</hi> which is ſo learned in mettalles to affirme this, that yet he dreameth that tynne glaſſe (which is that Biſemutum, and that ſinder or aſhie kinde of leade whereof <hi>Agricola</hi> ſpeaketh much in the 8. booke <hi>de natura foſſil.)</hi> to be Stibium molten, and the Chimiſts, baſiliſke, which is moſt abſurd. For that tinne-glaſſe which is commonly called biſemutum, is not ſtibium any way prepared, neither the Chimiſtes baſiliſke, extract with tartar &amp; niter, may be called biſemutum, which I leaue to the iudgement of al that be of vpright mindes: but this is ſmall to the purpoſe, when many thinges are called by the name of mettall, and yet not properly. But let vs pardon <hi>Aubertus</hi> in this which neuer ſaw any mines that he might iudge rightly of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither vnderſtandeth the minde of <hi>Agricola.</hi> In the meane time hee complaineth that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtes deuide the metalles into perfect and vnperfect, and that he thinketh ridiculous for many cauſes. Firſt becauſe of a certaine diffinition giuen by <hi>Geber,</hi> which agreeth no leſſe to one mettall then an other: whereas the perfecte might be diſcried from the imperfect, one diffinition were to be giuen to the one an other to the other. As though the diffinition of a man were not agreeable to a child, although he be not yet come to a mans age: or in other accidentes ſeeme to differ from him, as mettals do differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So the diffinitions of white and red coralles ſhould be ſundrie and diuers, that by reaſon of abſolute and perfect concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the white haue not attained the vttermoſt degree, whoſe definition notwithſtanding is all one. But <hi>Aubertus</hi> to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10504:10"/>
proue his opinion the better, writeth that all thinges, which haue eſſentiall forme (as it is certaine mettalles haue) muſt of neceſſitie be perfect. And that nature the godly parent of all thinges in doing of her office doth not ceaſe or reſt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be letted) vntill ſhe hath attained her purpoſed end and ſcope. He addeth that the matter whereof any naturall thing is made, and whereabout nature is occupied, doth moue ſo long vntill it hath attained the eſſentiall forme. He concludeth that mettall cannot rightly be deuided into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and vnperfect, neither that gold ought by any meanes to be called more excellent and perfect, although it be more bewtifull and temperat then other mettalles, all which wee muſt confute, as ſriuolous and vaine. And to proſecute all thinges in due order, we muſt ſhew that golde it ſelfe of the true Philoſophers is worthily called more perfect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and pure then other mettals: that hereuppon wee may conclude, mettalles not without reaſon to be deuided of the Chimiſtes into perfect and vnperfect. Therefore that I may alſo ſtay vpon the aucthoritie of <hi>Agricola</hi> (out of whom <hi>Aubertus</hi> hath ſpecially taken thoſe his wordes) he writeth in <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de ortu &amp; cauſis ſubterraneorum,</hi> that mettalles do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer among themſelues, not onely in ſhining, but alſo in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſauour, ſent, weight and power. And ſpecially ſpeaking of ſhining (which you <hi>Aubertus</hi> confeſſe to be in golde and ſiluer) he ſaith. But by how much the humor is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, thicke and pure, by ſo much the mettall is more cleere and ſhining: for which cauſe in this behalfe gold excelleth the other. The excellencie of which gold <hi>Agricola</hi> himſelfe ſeeketh in the difference of ſent, ſauour, and waight. For the vnperfect mettalles, when they come in any liquor are perceiued to be ſower of taſte, as copper and Iron: for the aduſt earth is cauſe of their ſowernes, whereof thoſe met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles do participat, as <hi>Agricola</hi> himſelfe witneſſeth. But the other becauſe of their pure earth, and more abundant wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do not giue the liquors ſo ſenſible a ſauor, bur rather a ſweetiſh taſt, as gold and ſiluer. Alſo for as much as in gold the earth is moſt pure and verie wel tempered with his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it giueth verie litle or ſcarſe ſenſible ſmoke when it is
<pb facs="tcp:10504:11"/>
burned, and rather ſweete then ſtinking. And <hi>Agricola</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more that gold when it is purged in the fier hath in a maner no excremente<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe of his puritie, in others there is more, but ſo much more in one, then an other, as it is more vnpure. Alſo the excellency of golde is to bee ſought for in his force and ſtrength, becauſe that beſides it and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all other mettalles do vaniſh away in ſmoke, and periſh with the violence of fier vppon the teſt or cople: which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth vnto them, as the earth in them is found to be leſſe pure and their temperature not ſo good. As it hapneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iron through the impure earth, whereof there is great ſtore in it. But when as gold alone cannot bee conſumed <note place="margin">3. <hi>Meteor. cap.</hi> 6.</note>with anie fierie heate, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, and looſeth nothing of his waight though it bee burned or tried, of neceſſity it muſt haue a moſt pure earth, and well compact with his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that his earth doth hold and let his humor, that it vapour not away, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the humour defendeth the earth, that it butne not (as ſaith <hi>Agricola)</hi> which commeth to paſſe, as others do affirme, becauſe of a moſt ſubtill, moiſt, and drye, that hath not any impuritie mixed. By this reaſon gold according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thinge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is purer then other mettalles, and ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them in price, becauſe it is the moſt ſimple and pureſt mettall, and furtheſt from imperfection of elementes by reaſon of his forme. So <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, vnto one thing, which <note place="margin">Lib. natu. hiſt. <hi>33.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>is golde, nothing decayeth by fier (as the Poet alſo ſaith) and as appeareth by that aforeſaid. By this we may gather, that amongeſt all mettalles, gold is not onely the brighteſt, but moſt temperat and perfect, in reſpect of which all other mettalles may worthely be called vnperfect. For nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tendeth to perfection, that is, to the making of golde, which alone amongeſt mettals is called perfect: for no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent naturall (as the Philoſophers ſay) ceaſeth from worke in his owne matter, neither is ſeperat, but with putting on ſome forme in that matter. Therefore ſo long as the agent is ioyned to the matter, or worketh vpon the matter, that is ſaid to be vnperfect: for the perfection of any thing is not but by putting on of forme. For ſo much then as in all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10504:11"/>
mettalles there is a certaine viſcous water, which the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtes Philoſophers call quickeſiluer, becauſe of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which is put in place of the matter, and that which they call ſulphur by like ſimilitude of the agent or inducer of form in that matter: no mettall can bee called perfect, but that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the ſulphur is ſeparated, But becauſe other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles haue their ſulphur mixed in the matter, whereby they are killed, made blacke, calcined and burned (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth vnto them onely by that dry exhalation, that is, the ſulphur becauſe it is a matter apt to be ſet on fire) for that cauſe they be altogether called vnperfect. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part becauſe onely golde is altogether without this ſulphur, which the affinitie of gold and quickſiluer by it ſelfe doth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declare. (For as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, all things ſwimme vppon it but gold, which alone it draweth vnto it) <note place="margin">Lib nat. hiſt. <hi>33.</hi> cap. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note>By this meanes it is free from corruption both in the fier &amp; out of the fier, Of right therefore, it alone is called per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and formed according to the firſt and true intention of nature, and complete, becauſe it is come to the vttermoſt end wherein it is complete, and pure becauſe the agent is not mingled with the matter, but is ſeperat from it. To this purpoſe writeth <hi>Ariſtotle Met.</hi> 3. <hi>cap. vltimo</hi> ſpeaking of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles: wherefore ſaith he they conteine earth in them, and are all burned becauſe they haue a drye exhalation, But gold alone of all the reſt vſeth not to be burned. But <hi>Auber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> not content with theſe reaſons will anſweare: what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath attained an eſſentiall forme, of neceſſity muſt bee perfect. But all mettalles haue their ſubſtantial forme. No man will deny (ſaith he) except it be ſome blockhead aſhes blower: and by that meanes hereupon concludeth, that all are perfect. But it is eaſy enough for vs to anſwere this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. For thoſe thinges which perſeuer in their nature are called perfect in their kinde through their ſubſtantiall forme: but ſome continue by nature in their kinde, which notwithſtanding are made perfect by ſome meanes through their ſubſtantiall forme, to the which their is a certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and end: but becauſe they are carried to another la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſſentiall forme, which altogether finiſheth the matter

<pb facs="tcp:10504:12"/>
it ſelfe, and maketh it complet: therfore they are called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long as they remaine vnder that firſt forme, in reſpect of the later, to the attaining whereof they do ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor themſelues. But if no accompt be made of that later forme, but they be conſidered onely in themſelues: they are truely perfect in that their kinde (through their eſſentiall forme) as that kinde doth require. This all men ſee in the generation of egges, in which there is a certaine determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned motion in the getting of his ſubſtantiall forme, which doth ſo remaine. But becauſe thoſe egges are by nature or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined to this end, not to remaine vnder that forme, but to bring forth a byrde, and ſo is made the begetting of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubſtantiall forme: Therefore egges are called vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnder the forme of an egge: but it is a perfect thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bringing forth of a birde, for that is the laſt ende of egges. This is likewiſe to be iudged of mettalles, which albeit they haue in their kinde gotten an eſſentiall forme, yet can they not be called perfect, in reſpect of gold, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is ſaid to bee perfect, vntill they come to that laſt &amp; perfect end, that is, to the perfection of golde, and become golde. And like as in the generation of the <hi>Embrio,</hi> there is compariſon of the vegetable ſoule to the ſenſible and of the ſenſible to the rationall, and not as formes ſo other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mettalles are in reſpect of gold. Therefore the Chimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Philoſophers haue worthily deuided the mettalles into perfect and vnperfect. For although the difference of mettalles be in the forme it ſelfe, yet ſhall it not be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difference of the kindes, as the difference of man and horſe, but ſhall be taken more properly of the matter, &amp; his partes that is according as it is digeſted or vndigeſted, complete or incomplete, ſeeing thoſe are altogether of one proper matter. But indigeſt and incomplete is ſpoken in reſpect of gold. But whereas <hi>Aubertus</hi> judgeth Iron more noble then golde, becauſe it ſerueth more to the vſe man, I thinke he ſhall neuer perſwade any Phiſitions (be they neuer ſo vnlearned) which rather deſire to catch gold then Iton. But I ſuppoſe there is ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ciently ſpoken touching the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and perfection of gold: and becauſe we ſaid that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10504:12"/>
mettalles are of one proper matter, although not in all alike digeſted, herein conſiſteth the point of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore we muſt now come to ſeeke out that matter of mettalles. The Philoſophers make two cauſes of mettals, as alſo of all other mixed bodies. The one generall and far of, which is taken of the elements, as of the firſt cauſes of all things, of which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt, as of moſt ſimple, &amp; are reſolued againe as into moſt ſimple. The Peripatecians contende againſt the Stoickes, that onely the qualities and vertues of the elementes doe paſſe one into another, and altogether mingled. The Stoickes contrarily doe affirme that whole ſubſtances are mingled with the whole: but leauing theſe waues of ſlipperie opinions we will goe to the ſafe and quiet port. And in this point we do allow the opinion of <hi>Aubertus,</hi> who thinketh the elementes not to be mixed bodies eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, or in deede, but in power, which <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth in the firſt book, <hi>de methodo medendi,</hi> where he writeth that the elements are to be mingled wholly with the whole, onely by their qualities. Of the ſecond or proper matter of mettalles, the opinion of many Philoſophers is not agreeable, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diuers. For ſome ſaid the neereſt matter of mettals is a moiſt breath, as <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> &amp; ſome hold it to be a water drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from other elementes, which <hi>Agricola</hi> alloweth, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion our <hi>Aubertus</hi> agreeth vnto. Other deeme it aſhes moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened with water. But the Chimiſt whoſe opinion <hi>Aubertus</hi> goeth about to ouerthrow, ſaith quickſiluer is the matter of them: ſome haue ioyned ſulphur: all which opinions are breefly and diligently to be examined by vs, that the matter may bee more euident, and that all men may vnderſtand how vnworthely <hi>Aubertus</hi> &amp; others haue inue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by the verie ſence, that ſo groſſe vapors do often breake out in places vnder the ground that the diggers can not take breath, and ſometimes through the groſenes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth, are choked. If they be ſo groſſe, who will iudge that mettalles and breathes, are of contrary qualities, but that they may grow into a ſound matter of mettalles, without any other meane, as the ponderous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por doth into a ſtorme? Furthermore (as multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can teſtify) if it hath rained copper and Iron, and that ſtones and ſuch other bodies do grow and are made in the vppermoſt aire, how ſhould theſe be engendred of water, &amp; earth, for whom there is no place to tarrie in the aire, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of vapour and breath, which both can pearce &amp; ſtay there for their thinnes and heate.

their matter can not bee quickſiluer, for ſo much as it can not congeale to hardnes. But this argument is no more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall then the former: For he ſetteth downe as graunted that which he hath not by any means prou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rie ſubſtance, but that it cannot therfore congeale, wee deny, when contrary to his minde we haue ſhewed his vapors do congeale. And truly <hi>Aubertus</hi> doth not deny but by art it doth harden, but hee thinketh that neither by art or nature it may congeale into mettalle in hardnes or forme, as thoughe to thinke, were to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a thing. Therefore he denyeth quickſiluer to be the matter of mettalles: the cauſe which he alledgeth, that it is of an airy ſubſtance, is of no force. For wee haue ſhowed out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that it is a vapour of an airy ſubſtance in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of water, and neuertheleſſe the next matter of mettals. Therefore airy thinges are to bee diſtinguiſhed: for ſuch as are altogether and ſimply airy becauſe of the predominant matter cannot be coagulated neither by heat or by cold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their airie moiſture cannot bee dryed vp, the earth w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt boddies of all mettalles will ſwimme vpon golde onely except for the great affinitie of them both, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that it is of an other ſubſtance, then ſimply aire like oile. Therefore to the ſimilitude of this quickſiluer, the next matter of mettalles: the Chimicall Philoſophers haue ſaid, that this quickſiluer is ingendred of a ſtrong commixtion of the firſt matter of all mettals, that is of a moiſt viſcous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combuſtible humour, incorporat with a ſubtill earth, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly mixed by ſmall partes in the minerall caues of the earth. Vnto this wiſe nature (becauſe the matter bringeth not it ſelfe to effect) ioyneth his proper agent, that
<pb facs="tcp:10504:15"/>
is ſulphur, which is nothing elſe then a certaine fatneſſe of the earth engendred in the proper mines, and by tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat decoction thickned, that it may turne the quickſiluer by digeſtion, and concoction into forme of mettall. Therefore this ſulphur is to the quickſiluer as the man to the woman, and as the proper agent to the proper matter. Not that this quickſiluer and ſulpur (as ſome fooliſhly thinke) are found by themſelues in their nature in the mines, but that theſe are alreadie mingled by nature, and by longe concoction brought into the nature of earth. And this truly is the ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt matter of mettalles, as in the generation of man meate is neerer matter then the elements, the blood neerer then meate, and the ſperme neerer then blood it ſelfe: and at laſt by apt digeſtion the matter receiueth the ſhape of a man. So when as it is ſaid, that mettals are firſt made of the foure elements, as of their generall and firſt matter: the ſame order kept, it is neceſſarie that of thoſe elements come va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, of vapours a ſlimie water (which is yet a neerer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vapors, leſt by defending <hi>Ariſtotle, Aubertus</hi> may thinke mee to gainſay my ſelfe) and heauy, mingled with a ſubtile ſulphureous earth which is called quickſiluer: of which as of a neerer matter by meane of the mixture and working of the outward ſulphur is made gold or other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall according to the great or leſſer digeſtion of nature. For as the Philoſopher writeth Metaph. 6. when any thing is ſaid to be made of another, either an extreme &amp; perfect, is made of a meane and vnperfect, as of a childe, a man, or elſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of extreme, as aire of water: but let vs returne to our <hi>Aubertus.</hi> He writeth that ſulphur alſo can not bee the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mettalles. But let vs heare by what reaſons he doth proue it. Sulphur, ſaith he, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of a hot, drie, and vnctuous breath, but mettals are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of an other breath hot and moiſt, and a litle vnctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Truly a goodly, but ſophiſticall argument, by which he goeth about to proue his purpoſe, by the opinions which he hath already impugned, Let him therefore remember that he before hath affirmed againſt <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that breath was not the matter of mettalles: and now he doth confeſſe that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10504:15"/>
mettalles are ingendred of breaths. Therefore he ſpeaketh againſt himſelfe, that he ſhall not neede my refutation: hee addeth to proue his opinion, that ſulphur waxeth ſoft with moiſture like ſalt, and that mettalles are molten only with ſtrong fire: but of a falſe antecedent can not follow a good conſequent. For by no meanes is ſulphur diſſolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water, but by heat is molten like leade: and this ſhould our ſearcher of thinges vnder ground firſt haue tryed, then to affirme ſo boldl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I haue afore ſhewed the contrary, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not to looke for any other anſweare of me, becauſe he hath neither reproued my argument, neither made any demonſtration of his opinion by firme reaſons. But this one thing ſufficeth, that all wiſe Chimiſtes do affirme, that this which they call ſulphur, is not the common ſulphur which burneth with combuſtion of blacknes and aduſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whereas their proper ſulphur doth whiten, rubify, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulat, and finally make perfect that Chimicall quickeſiluer which is commonly vnknowen into the ſubſtance of golde, according to nature, or of the philoſophers ſtone, and gold according to art.

But it is to be obſerued that by the mixture of drie and moiſt the bodies are firſt called congealed, then harde or ſoft: of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed bodies there is a triple difference? for it is either a watrie humor that is congealed, or ſome dry earthly thing, or a mixture of them both.

But thoſe thinges which are drye and fierie, as hony and muſt, will neuer be congealed, and they which are moiſt &amp; airie predominant as all oily thinges. Wherefore theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are not elements, neither the matter of theſe ſufferinges.

drie, that is, fiery heate: and thoſe which fier melteth, or whoſe congelacion in any part it doth diſſolue (as horne) are congealed by colde, for of contrarie effectes the cauſes be contrarie: and becauſe that mettalles do melt by heat, it is of neceſſitie that firſt they were congealed by cold, as the efficient cauſe, whereof none of the Chimiſt philoſophers doth doubt, although, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſome time ſaith, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſheweth vs the contrary: for ſalt is congealed by heate, and may bee diſſolued and molten by fier as I haue often tried, and it is called fuſible ſalt.

And firſt ſaith hee, it is euident thoſe foure mettalles to bee perfect: but we haue before ſhewed they are altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect for many cauſes, neither can it be denied but that by art and right preparation they are made much more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and excellent in their kinde.

                     </gap> that one is ſounde after another. But <hi>Aubertus</hi> wil ſay to this. If vnperfect met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals by longer decoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be reduced into gold by nature, why do not the diggers expect that time, ſpeciallie ſeeing, if that ſhould come to paſſe, they ſhould haue much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaine by the thing: we anſwere there are certaine things which make the generation of mettalles diuers not onely in kinde but in properties and accidents, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and places where they grow, as alſo beaſtes are made diuers, as writeth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> 6. <hi>de animalibus.</hi> For in Egipt Scorpions are not venemouſe, in other places contrary: and wheat in time &amp; in ſome places doth degenerate into rye, &amp; rye into wheat: So is to be ſaid of mettalles which although they be appointed of nature vnto their end, that is that they ſhould be gold, notwithſtanding by the diuerſity of Regions and mines and their corruption ſome are brought to their degree of perfection that they become golde, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the path of imperfection according to the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of digeſtion or purifying: For by weaker heate nature doth congeale ſome vndigeſted thinges as lead and tinne, &amp; ſome with a ſuperfluous and burning heate, as copper and Iron, and ſome contrariwiſe for want of heate and lacke of an agent doth not congeale as quickſiluer. But nature it ſelfe bringeth forth ſiluer with a reaſonable temporat heate, but gold with a moſt temperate which needeth no workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be made perfect, as that hath attained the vttermoſt end and accompliſhment. For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in his 2. booke <hi>de Coelo &amp; mundo:</hi> that onely is good accompliſhment that needeth no labour to make it good, and all perfection of thinges conſiſteth in this point, that they receiue their laſt accompliſhment, For ſo much then as the vnperfect met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals haue not attained to that laſt ende of perfection for the cauſes aforeſaid: therefore they lacke the worke of art, by whoſe help following nature it ſelfe, they are at length made perfect, and attaine that laſt end whereunto they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined of nature, that is they become golde. For as the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10504:18"/>
Philoſopher writeth 2. <hi>Ethicor.</hi> truely ſometime art maketh perfect ſome things which nature cannot worke, other ſome it doth follow. So nature being holpen by art, trees bring forth their flowers and fruites euen in the winter ſeaſon, and in cold countries, which nature of it ſelfe could not do, as is to be ſeene in the county palatines orchard at Hedelberge, and in many other places: but that which <hi>Aubertus</hi> ſaith, that in the whole work of Alchemy nature doth vtterly reſt, and onely art doth moue the ſubiect, it is moſt falſly ſpoken: for by reaſon of nature being agent <hi>Chymia</hi> is a naturall worke, for the matter in the ſelfe ſame ſtone which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction it deſireth, retaineth, digeſteth, expelleth, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, engendreth, and formeth in his time by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of almightie God, wherewith nature doth forme mettalles by the mixture of it: but by reaſon of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie I confeſſe Chimia to be an artificiall worke, not that art doth corrupt engender and forme, but thus farre onely that it miniſtreth all this vnto natures working, which otherwiſe of it ſelfe it could not alone performe: for nature worketh two manner of waies to engender golde: one by it ſelfe: and firſt of all when it doth engender gold in his proper mines, and of his proper beginninges, in which it is vnpoſſible for art to imitate nature. Secondly it worketh by it ſelfe but not firſt, becauſe firſt it engendreth ſome vnperfect mettall of the ſame beginninges in his mine: and laſtly conuerteth it into gold, in which point art followeth nature it ſelfe, in that of vnperfect mettalles it maketh gold as nature it ſelfe doth. Hereby it is euident ſomething to be made of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: two manner of waies mediatly and immediatly. For according to <hi>Ariſt. lib</hi> 9. <hi>Meta.</hi> There may be many matters of one thing, as mediat and immediat: albeit at the laſt the mediat matter muſt bee reduced into the immediat, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of diuerſe matters diuers thinges would riſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe art taketh both the mediat &amp; immediat matter which nature doth, &amp; reduceth the mediat at the laſt to the immediat as nature alſo doth, &amp; hath one and the ſelfe ſame agent which ſhall ſpoile the quickſiluer, and at laſt tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it, and the end of art and nature is all one, that is by the
<pb facs="tcp:10504:19"/>
vniting of this forme with his matter, at laſt to ingender gold: there is no doubt, but that art imitating nature it ſelfe in all pointes can make an vnperfect mettall a perfect, as nature it ſelfe doth make, as we haue aforeſaid. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cauſes being all one, of neceſſitie they alſo muſt be one, and bring forth the like effectes. Neither do I thinke them to be excuſed which ſeeke the ſubiect of the Chymick Philoſophers in the vegitalles. Their lahour is in vaine, for there can be no generation but by the neereſt, conuenient and immediates, Others haue beſtowed their labors vpon animall thinges, ſpecially in an egge, becauſe the Chimick Philoſophers moued with a certaine ſimilitude of egges cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their worke the egge, and ſaid that the egge euen as the Elixir doth conteine 4 elements, whoſe ſhell they called the earth, the thinne ſkinne the aire, the white water, and the yelke fier.

For kinde ought to be ioyned with kinde, and like with like, and euery bloſſom to anſwere to his ſeede, as we ſaid afore. And there be ſome which ſeek the matter of their Elixir not in vegitals or animalls, but in thinges vnder the earth and neerer.

For they depart from the philoſophers writinges which confeſſe all with one mouth, that the agent is ioyned and proportionat by nature in the mines with his owne matter, and they ſay, that it is but one thing wherein are the foure elementes well proportioned, that there is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is ſome minerall ſalt founde, as in Polonia, other ſome is made, as in France, yet hauing the ſame properties and paſſions as the minerall, by which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it may be called verie naturall, and his forme alſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and verie perfect. The like is to be thought of mettals, for as the want of proper matter is the cauſe chiefly, why that of euery thing an other the like is not ingendred: ſo if fit matter be found out, it is the chiefe cauſe why that of one another the like is ingendred. Therefore for ſo much as it is poſſible for the art of tranſmutation to finde out the

If this Philoſophers ſtone could iuduce the ſhape of ſiluer and golde, it would make it like vnto it ſelfe, and by that meanes frame another Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſtone. I anſwere, this conuerſion of mettalles is the reducing of them vnto a certaine meane, that is, to a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and that excellent equallitie (which is onely found in gold) in ſubſtance colour digeſtion, fuſion, ſound and other properties.

Which laſt ſimples were lately found out, and the roote of the former is all together like in force vnto the vitis ingrae.

The cauſe of the purging quallitie of all theſe ſimples is this: that a certaine thinne portion of it ſtirred vp by naturall heate, creepeth in by the open conditts or paſſages, into the leſſer vaines, and from thence floweth into the greater, from the which by the liuer it is turned into the inteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, and into the reynes it ſelfe, and then followeth eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of humores, by the belly, which ſometimes are diſcerned by the vrine, in which, as well the coloure as the ſauor of the medicine receaued is manifeſtly ſeene, which any man may trie in <hi>Rhabarbe &amp; ſenuae.</hi>
