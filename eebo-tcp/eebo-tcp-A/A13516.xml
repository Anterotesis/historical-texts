            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in these later times this Kingdome hath produced many brave and able mem, that (to the admiration of the world) have plowed and furrowed the dangerous

            <p>On the 17. day of <hi>Iune</hi> last, a Ship of the Port of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> of 200. in burthen, (the name of her being the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the owner of her is our Master Abraham <hi>Iennings,</hi> the Ship having binne in a Voyage to New-<hi>England,</hi> and thence to <hi>Virginia,</hi> after some 12. Months time returned Laden from thence, and making their best speed for their arrivall at home, they were (on the day aforesaid) about two of the clocke in the morning, within two Leagues neere to the <hi>Liz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> which is a small Iland, a good Sea marke on the West part of the mount in <hi>Cornewall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Scilly</hi> &amp; the main, Assaulted furiously by 3 Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Pirats (or men of war) where there was a most Bloody and cruell bickering. The accursed <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> having gotten the winde of the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was a great advantage for them, their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall being in burthen 230. Tunnes, with 22. Pieces of ordnance in her. The Vice Admirall was of a greater burthen, about 300. Tunnes, with 26. Pieces of ordnance: The Reare Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:3403:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was in burthen 200. Tunnes, and had but 8. Pieces in her. So the <hi>Turkes</hi> had in their three Ships 56: Pieces of Artillerie, the number of their men is unknowne.</p>
            <p>On the other side the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had but 30. men, and three of that small number were Passengers, or (as they tearme them planters) and they had but ten Pieces of ordnance aboord, and of those, they could make use of, or plye but five Gunnes, the Ship was so pestered with packes, and other carriage betweene the Decks. The Master of the Ships name was Master <hi>Doves,</hi> (who dwelt in <hi>Plimmouth</hi>) a Man of an excellent and invincible Spirit, as the sequell of the fight, and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy life, and unfortunate death will shew.</p>
            <p>The fight continued about the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene seven and eight houres, and though the <hi>English</hi> Ship had but 3. Pieces of ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (that could be used) yet by Gods Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the Master Gunner (being a skilfull valiant and experienc'd man, he so ply'd and play'd upon the miscreants, that he kill'd many of them.</p>
            <p>The Gunners of the Ships name is John <hi>Whidon.</hi> And all the while that the Master of the Shippe (Master <hi>Doves</hi>) most manfully and couragiously, did labour and bestire himselfe, and by his Valorous example gave encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all the rest of his Companie that were in the Ship, amongst whom the three Passengers which were with us, did
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3403:6"/>
most worthy deserving service. The Master still chear'd them up, and told them, that (by Gods Grace) he would not give away his ship and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to those accursed mis-believers, but that he was resolved with Christian courage to fight it out so long as his life lasted.</p>
            <p>And indeed hee was as good as his word, for being so long a time furiously assaulted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ordnance, and about 500 Enemies, and also being three times boorded, and entred by the Turkes (who were also thrice beaten out againe) their ship being fired, and their round house burnt, their maine-sayle was likewise consumed in the flames, and their rigging and Cordage cut downe and spoyl'd. At last the Master was slaine, ending his dayes Nobly, likewise the Masters-mate, and the Pilot, and quarter-Master were kild outright, they having done as much as men could do against so strong an enemy, kept Master <hi>Doves</hi> company, both in life and death, and in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly happinesse.</p>
            <p>In this terrible turmoyle, there were two of the Turkes had got themselves up into the Top, and one of the three passengers (with a Musket) shot at them, and kil'd them both: one of those slaine Pirats, was a man of an extraordinary great stature, and for his Corpulency, not to be equal'd amongst them all; he being kil'd, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> did cleave his head, and then they divided it from his carkasse, they shewed the head and corps to the Turkes, and with renewed courages and
<pb facs="tcp:3403:6"/>
unwearied Valour they haled to the enemy, and in braving manner said, come aboord you Dogges if you dare, and fetch your countrey-man; But the <hi>Turkes</hi> finding the businesse so hot, and the men so resolute, that their damnable courages were quel'd, that they had no more mind to assault the <hi>English</hi> Ship any more. So they in deriding and showting to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> cast the dead body over-boord, on the one side of the Ship, and the Cloven head into the Sea, on the other.</p>
            <p>There were also three <hi>Turkes</hi> more slaine that came aboord. But how many the number of them that were kil'd is uncertaine, therefore let them reckon them. But surely their losse must needs be great, for the Master Gunner was so diligent, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and expert, that it was not perceived that there was a shot lost or spent in vaine, and indeed for his skill and courage, he is esteemed not to have many fellowes in the <hi>West</hi> parts of <hi>England,</hi> for his knowledge in that Art.</p>
            <p>The losse on the Christian side, were those foure men, which were killed outright (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) there were also eight more of them danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wounded, whereof one of them is dead, since their arrivall at <hi>Plimmouth</hi>; And (praise be given to God) the other seaven are all on the mending hand and indifferent well, so that there is no doubt of their recovery, to health and limbs unmaimed, onely their scars will remaine, as markes of their Valour, and badges of famous reputation.</p>
            <p>The Master Gunner, being the Chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb facs="tcp:3403:7"/>
left alive in the Ship, did haile to the <hi>Turks</hi> againe, and dared them to come on againe and try the other bowt. But they had had such proofe of his courage and knowledge before in the fight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so shattered, torne, and gauled; That they could neither boast of Victory, nor durst then venture any more to gaine it, for they perceived the Gunners resolution was never to yeeld, and so they fell to their sayles, and tacklin, and very much discontented slunk away, making their moanes to <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were certaine <hi>Hogges,</hi> and <hi>Powltrey,</hi> in the <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; And in the heat of the fight, (the Ship being much rent and torne with the Shot of the enemy) the poore Swine and Pullen were killed, partly with the Bullets, but most with the shatters and splinters of shivered Planks, and timber of the Ship. Wherefore (in derision and scorne of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> who doe abhorre and hold all manner of Swines flesh in abhomination) The <hi>English</hi> marriners lifted up the Hogges, and shewed them to the <hi>Turke,</hi> as it were in a merry or jeeringway, to invite them to come aboord of their Ship to eate some Porke. Thus (by the mercifull assistance of God) this one poore Ship, so weakely man'd, and so meanely furnished with Artillery or Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, against so many, and so great a multitude, (as were 3. Ships, 500. Men, and 56. Peeces, maintaine a fight almost 8. houres, and (with the losse of 3. Men) not onely kill and spoyle a great number of their enemies, but also to escape them,
<pb facs="tcp:3403:7"/>
and come off with reputation, (as it were with Conquest, Tryumph, and Victory. It is almost to be thought miraculous and beyond beliefe, but that the truth of the matter is so plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested that all oposing unbelief is vaine and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>For after the <hi>Turkes</hi> had quite left them, they began every man to worke hard, some to lay the dead corps as decently and coole as time and place would give them leave, some others (who had es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped hurts, or had not received great harmes in the fight) did their best to helpe, dresse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort their wounded men: And some of them (with all speed and diligence) fell to mending their Ropes, Cordage, Rigging, and Sayles, which were cut, broken, spoyl'd, and burnt in the fight; So that no one was Idle, every man imployed in doing something necessary, that (by Gods gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance) the Ship and goods arrived safe in the harbour, or port of <hi>Plimmouth.</hi> The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which was Thursday, the eighteenth day of <hi>Iune</hi> last 1640.</p>
            <p>The bodies of the foure men that were slaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were brought on shore, and in seemely manner buried. And at their funeralls they had two Learned, Accute, and Gratulatorie Sermons, the one of them was preached at the Master of the Ships funerall, by the Arch-deacon of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who is Vicar of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was preached (at the Masters-mates funerall) by Master Thomas <hi>Bedfourd,</hi> Batchelour in divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:3403:8"/>
and Lecturer of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> and this may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sufficient testimonie of the certainty of this former Relation.</p>
            <p>But if there be any that be yet doubtful or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this case, let them (for their further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) read this following examination, of John <hi>Whiddon,</hi> the valiant and well deserving Gunner, whom my Pen cannot praise enough, nor these ingratefull times gratifie him; Read but his examination as followeth, and be confirmed in the Truth, for this is a true Copie of it, which was sent up from <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to the right Honourable the Lords of his Majesties most Honourable privie Counsell.</p>

               <p>THe said Examinant saith, that on Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day last about two of clocke in the more<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, being the 17 of this instant Iune, hee being Gunner of a Ship called the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of Plimmouth, of two hundred Tuns burthen, or thereabouts, having ten pieces of Ordnance aboard her, and comming from <hi>Virginia,</hi> bound for Plimmouth, two leagues off of the Lizard, they met three Turkish men of Warre, who wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred and kept the said <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from the shoar, and gave her chase, and saith, that the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:3403:9"/>
was a ship of 250 Tuns burthen or ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts: and had 22 pieces of Ordnance aboard her, and the Vice-Admirall was a shippe of 300 Tuns, and had 26 pieces of Ordnance; and the Rere-Admirall was a ship of 200 tuns, and had eight pieces of Ordnance aboard her, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that heretofore shee was a prize, and at first they all shewed both Dutch and English colours, and had at least 500 men aboard them, who betweene three and foure of the clocke in the morning, came up with them and boarded them, and continued fight with them, untill eleven or twelve of the clock that day; during which time, the company of each of the said Turkish men of warre, boarded them three times, and fired their round House, killed their Master, Masters Mate, the Pylate, and Quarter-Master, and hurt eight other of their Company, fired their maine sayle, cut downe all their riggin, and with their great Shot did them and their Shippe a great deale of hurt and dammage, and afterwards did leave them; presently after within two Leagues, or thereabouts off of the shoare, this Examinant, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the said <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> discovered eleven small Vessels floating on the streame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sayles, or any men in them at all, which this Examinant, the Gunner of the Shippe, doth very certainely believe were taken by the said Turkish men of Warre, and their

Company carried away by them, and doth say, that upon the eighteenth of this instant moneth of Iune, about foure of the clocke in the morning, they came into the harbour of <hi>Plimmouth.</hi>

               <head>A Friendly, true, deserv'd Commendation and encouragement of all Mariners, and the noble Art of Navigation with the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and necessary use of Shipping.</head>
               <p>THe use of Shippes and shipping, is of most worthy and memorable Antiquitie. For the blessed Patriarke <hi>Noah,</hi> built an <hi>Arke,</hi> (by the Commandement of God) of which <hi>Arke, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was <hi>Admirall, Master,</hi> and <hi>Pilot.</hi> That <hi>Arke</hi> was then the Militant Church, the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation being but 8 persons, and yet though they were but few, they were not all sound in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Piety, there was a <hi>Cham</hi> amongst them: All the people of the world, that had not grace to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e aboord of the <hi>Arke</hi> were drowned, wherein was prefigured that as many as will not come, and be of Gods Church, are like to be cast away.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Arke</hi> was tost and weather-beaten upon the troublesome waves of the All-Sea World (or Universall deluge) till such time as she happily grounded on the mountain of <hi>Ararat</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3403:10"/>
in <hi>Armenia, Gen.</hi> 8.4. And so shall the Church be continually turmoyl'd with tempests of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Seas of sorrow, stormes of strife, she being like a good peaceable Ship most inestimably rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laden, is daily assaulted by 3. wicked Pirats, (the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devill</hi>) who with their Associates and Vassals, (the Ocean or Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Schismaticall Gulfe of Separatisme, and the rough Lake of Nonconformisme,) she hath not any Ankering, rest, or Moareing at all, but upon the mountaine of Holynesse, the Rocke of righteousnesse, the True Corner-stone, <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour himselfe, did not onely passe the Sea or Lake of <hi>Genezareth,</hi> but he also did there (in the Ship) most miraculously command, and stil'd the raging windes and Seas, and he did grace one Ship so much, that he preached out of the said Ship, or another, to the people that stood on the banke of the Sea. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.22. And the Apostles (for the enlarging and divulging their Ministry, which was the meanes of the knowledge of Salvation) did make use of Ships, as it appeareth in divers places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>A Ship well govern'd at Sea, is an Epitomy of a wel guided Church, &amp; common-wealth on the Land, and it is a thing to be wished, that the earth were as free from some sinnes, as the salt water is. For in a Ship at Sea, it is a rare matter, to see a man play the brutish parts of a Glutton, or
<pb facs="tcp:3403:11"/>
Drunkard. There are no wrangling Lawyers, nor wicked Projectors, a Vsurer or a Catchpole are as rare to be found there, as it is to find Chastity in the Stewes. In a Ship is abstinency from swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and incontinency, and twice a day there is (or ought to be) prayer &amp; thanksgiving offered up to God.</p>
               <p>Ships, are the impregnable Wooden walls of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the winged flying and floating Castles, forts, &amp; fortifications for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against forraigne invasion &amp; domesticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: they were of that serviceable use in the raigne of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> that it is said that he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sayle round about this Iland with 1000 ships.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Solomon</hi> had his Cedar brought (for the building of the Temple, by Sea to <hi>Ioppa.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.16. And he had also brought him in Ships from <hi>Ophir,</hi> 450. Talants of Gold. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.18.

               <p>It is recorded that the warlike Virago Queene <hi>Semiramis,</hi> had 2000.

Then and there (aforesaid) was a bloody Battel fought where (to the great joy and safety of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) the Christians in five houres won a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and memorable Victory, and very few of the miscreant Turkes, went home to carry newes to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Reade <hi>Knoles</hi> Turkes History, or else Reade <hi>Stowe,</hi> page 670.</p>
               <p>And it ought thankfully ever to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, the great and wonderfull Victory that God vouchsafed to give us, from the Spanish invasion 1588. in the 31. yeare of the raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Spanish <hi>Armado</hi> being 128. Vessels for warre (besides victuallers) the <hi>English</hi> navie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (one with another) 104. sayle, and there was a supply of 340. ships more which the Prince of <hi>Parma (Alexander Fernesius)</hi> was to bring for the
<pb facs="tcp:3403:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spanish Ayd, and Englands ruine. But wind, weather, and the Hollanders kept Parma and his fleet in the havens of <hi>Graveling, Dunkirke, Newport,</hi> and some other Ports of Flanders, so that by Gods assistance, the Valour and Valiant service of the English marriners was so prevailing, that the Spaniards, were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, battered, slaine, taken, sunke, and so shattered, tattered, and scattered, there were not many of them left to make report in Spaine, of their entertainment in England.</p>
               <p>Thus having shewed partly the Antiquity of shipping, with the services which they doe for, and in matters of warre, so it is fit to be considered what commodious uses are made of shipping, and marriners in time of peace.</p>
               <p>It is manifest that as God hath beene mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, liberally, bountifull, to all Nations and people of the world, giving to each Climate and Countrey meanes for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of life, yet he hath not given all kinds of commodities to any one place, Kingdome or dominion. But for the society of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind he hath ordained negotiation commerce and Traffique. The gold and silver jewels of <hi>India,</hi> the honie, waxe, hempe, and furres of <hi>Russia</hi>; the winds, oyles, spices, drugs, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, silkes, stuffes, Copper, cotton, mashes, yards, pitch, rosen, tarre, turpentine, fruits, fish, coales, and millions of commodities more (I had almost forgotten Tobacco) from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3403:12"/>
and some rattels, babyes, and Hobby-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from Holland) all these, were it not for shipping, marriners, Marchandize, and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, we (in England) were like to want, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides millions of commodities more, which are endlesse and impossible by me to be named; and other Nations would be destitute of our Leade, Tinne, Leather, Cloath, Tallow, Beere, and I know not how many other pretty things which we doe vent, venture, and spare, to all the Realmes and regions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of the whole World. By which meanes customes are encreased and payd, peace and unity maintained betweene Nation and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Merchants enriched, marriners and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bred and maintained, and many thousands of Arts, Sciences, Trades, Crafts, Mysteries, and occupations, doe live well, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble numbers of poore labouring people are set on worke.</p>
               <p>True Valour is both invinceable and impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and (not savouring of dull mortality) in spight of death is immortall. It knows that the onely life is to live well. It shews that happinesse consists in wealth, for thieves may steale that, wife, parents, children, kindred, friends, &amp; our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may dye, &amp; all earthly goods may be spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; consumed by fire, water, time, or some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Accidentall way or other; but true valour is onely Long-liv'd, for it guids a Christian coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously all his life from whence it conducts to an honourable Death, and Death cannot hold it,
<pb facs="tcp:3403:13"/>
but delivers it to Fame, Fame, layes it up in the Register of Time, and Time leaves it to everlasting Eternity. To which in all my best wishes I doe give both the dead and the living that were in this former related Sea-fight; or have dyed or will dare to dye for their Christian Faiths, Prince, and Country: I meane not rashnesse, anger, fury, or desperate madnesse, for Lyons, Beares, Bulls, Boares, Dogges, Tygers, Cockes, and such unreasonable creatures, will fight, snarle, scratch, byte, teare, rend, and destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if it be ask'd wherefore they doe it, they doe neither know or can tell. But true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour indeed doth know that God hath put an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall soule into a mortall body (or transitory tenement; to inhabite therein till such time as the (Lord of life) great Landlord of all things, doth (at his pleasure) command the tennant forth of a poore house of clay, to an everlasting Mansion and perpetuall habitation of Happinesse.</p>
               <p>And as God delivered the <hi>Israelits</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> most miraculously, as his Almighty power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected <hi>David,</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; <hi>Absolon, Daniel</hi> from the hungry fierce Lyons, <hi>Noah</hi> from the almost all devouring flood, <hi>Ionah</hi> from the Whale, the three Children from the fiery Furnace, <hi>Iob</hi> from the Dunghill, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> from Beasts and exile; <hi>Ioseph</hi> from his brethrens malice, and <hi>Potiphars</hi> furie, <hi>Manasses</hi> from the Dungeon, <hi>Ieremie</hi> from captivity, <hi>England</hi> from Spaines invasion, and Romes powder

plot, so did hee most wonderfully preserve this poore Shippe (the <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Plimmouth</hi>) and the Valiant men therein from Apparent danger and destruction. For the which, and all other, his infinite undeserved mercies, to him alone be given all honour, and glorie, <hi>Amen.</hi>
