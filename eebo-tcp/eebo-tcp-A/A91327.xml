         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F in this brief Argument (which here treats of your Charters,
and maintains your priviledges) there be any thing beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Advocate of yours: I deſire the intire advantage
thereof may redound ſolely to your ſelves. For indeed the
Merit of your Cauſe is ſuch, as would require an able Orator:
and when I firſt applyed my ſelf to ſerve you herein, I perceived your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
was the ſame as the Common intereſt of all Merchants, and that could
have no termination, but in the common intereſt of our Nation: But if
there appear any Error, or Fayler in theſe papers: if the workmanſhip be
found too unworthy of the ſtuffe: I ſhall then deſire of all my Readers, that
the blame may be onely mine: and that none but my ſelf may ſuffer the leaſt
diſadvantage by my defects, and diſabilities. I am certain all wiſe, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Judges will diſtinguiſh betwixt that which is mine in this weak peece,
and that which is yours: and if they caſt ſome diſdain upon me for not
<pb facs="tcp:115386:3"/>
pleading your cauſe, as I might: they will not proceed to a condemnation
of your cauſe, for being no better pleaded here then it is.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes a Tract to this very purpoſe was Printed by
Mr. <hi>Wheeler</hi> (a learned Gent: that preceded me in this place) were that
Tract now re-printed, perhaps our Times would be better ſatisfied in this
Caſe. It came not to my fight, till after I had formed the lump of this, and
given it all thoſe rude lineaments almoſt, which it now bears: and I was
induced then to perſiſt in my reſolution of finiſhing this, and not of retroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
the rather; becauſe I ſaw my ſtile and method varied much from his:
becauſe, the face of the times (which has great influence upon the State
and fate of Merchandize) was not the ſame when He wrote, as it is now:,
becauſe, his Tract was in bulk more then twice, as great as mine; becauſe,
He might give ſome light to me in ſome things, and I adde ſome to Him in
other things; and ſo both might be more effectuall for the ends propoſed by
both, then either: becauſe, if He was more ſatisfactory in matters of this
particular Company, I had ſome thoughts in my ſelf, that I was more proper
for the affairs of Merchants in generall. Theſe reaſons kept from abortion
this Eſſay of mine at that time: but for how long a ſpace it was repreived, I
cannot prognoſticate: nor do I much regard how ſoon its fatall houre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
ſo the buſineſſe which it aymed at may ſurvive, and proſper. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
my reputation in this caſe muſt run ſome hazard, and ſtand or fall,

            <head>A DISCOURSE CONCERNING
FREEDOM OF TRADE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN is taught by the rules of Wiſdom to begin at the
End of his Actions, and to give the firſt place in his
intention, to that which is to have the laſt in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now the end of this diſcourſe is improvement
of Trade; and it being a thing of late much controverted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
whether Freedome in Trading be a proper means, or no,
to improve Trade: Theſe two Termes <hi>(Freedome</hi> and <hi>Trade)</hi> muſt
be the ſubject matter of this Diſcourſe. As for <hi>Trade</hi> the word is
plain, and needs no explanation: and the thing is as obvious to
every mans underſtanding, and ſo needs no definition. I will
therefore premiſe ſomething very briefly concerning the value,
and importance of <hi>Trade,</hi> that my <hi>end</hi> here aymed at, to which
my intention muſt needs give the precedence, may not ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
to any: and then curſorily from my firſt Terme, I
ſhall addreſſe my ſelf to my ſecond.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his Commentary upon our Great Charter
(where the Merchants contentment is ſo prudently provided
for) tels us, that Traffick is the Merchants livelihood, and that
the livelihood of the Merchant is the life of the Common-weal,
ſuch as the King himſelf, and every Subject of the Land has an
intereſt in. He obſerves alſo that the Merchant is the good Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe
of the Realme, aſwell to export Native, as to import forrain
Commodities for the benefit and neceſſary defence of the ſame.
This Politick <hi>Argonante</hi> in Law amongſt matters of Law, thinks
it no extravagance to deliver his judgement of matters in <hi>Trade;</hi>
and if we rightly analyſe his judgement herein, we ſhall finde,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115386:4"/>
that not a word of it falls to the earth without its due weight.
The Merchant indeed has a great dependance upon him both
of Land and Water men, and is often commander of great
ſummes of ready mony (greater then other men commonly
though better landed, and eſtated can raiſe upon ſuddaine, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
exigences) and ſo even in his gowne at home he is a proffit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
member of the Commonwealth: but look upon him in his
imployment ſerving the State by his traffick, and ſo he is more
then profitable, He is neceſſary to the well beeing, nay to the
beeing of the State. Thoſe things which he exports conduce
perhaps more to profi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and things imported to ſecurance: yet
tis well intimated here that both exportation, and importation
do conduce to both. Native Commodities more immediatly
afford us Treaſure: yet Treaſure is as well <hi>firmamentum belli,</hi> as
<hi>ornamentum pacis:</hi> and forrain commodities more uſually are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls
for Shipping, Armes, ſupplyes in times of dearth, and
diſtreſſe, &amp;c. yet ſomtimes we retayle the ſame to ſtrangers for
gaine, and thereby convert them into ornaments of peace, as
well as inſtruments of defence. How prodigiouſly did <hi>Antwerpe</hi>
formerly in a very few yeares aggrandize it ſelfe? and what an
exceſſe of ſplendor has <hi>Amſterdam</hi> attaynd to ſince? yet (for
ought I know) Nature has beſtowde no more previledge upon
thoſe two Townes whereby to advance themſelves with ſuch
facility: then it has upon <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> &amp; <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> amongſt us. Sure
then, the <hi>Hollander</hi> and <hi>Fleming</hi> may infuſe this ſecret into us
from that wonderous degree of opulence, and pompe, which
both by <hi>Trade</hi> have aſcended unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that importation of exotick
commodities, if ſubtilly managed, may become as great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
as exportation is to other<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> It is viſible in the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
that the mines of <hi>Perne</hi> are as ſerviceable to Him, as to the

                  </gap>rs</hi> of <hi>Ruſſiia</hi> are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually

they do the <hi>Engliſhman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that <hi>Spayne</hi> was his Orchard, that <hi>Norway</hi> was his Forreſt. That
City (tis true) which abounds with commodities of its own,
has an eaſier, &amp; ſhorter way to proſperity then that City which

is de<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>itate of the like helps, and opportunities, and yet experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
diſcovers daily to us, that ſome Cities which have little of
their own, being induſtrious, ſlowe with more abundance, and
ſwim in greater ſupefluity; then ſome other ſloathfull Cities,
that naturally want nothing. Hence is the difference betwixt
the Merchant and the Husbandman, the Husbandmans thrift
is in <hi>vendendo,</hi> not <hi>emendo</hi> as old <hi>Cato</hi> tells him: But the Merchant
has found out a way, how he may be <hi>emax,</hi> and <hi>vendax</hi> in the
ſame thing, and often times the retaylor findes the ſecond ſale
more beneficiall to Him, then the firſt was to the Proprietor.
Nay even the more unuſefull Crawmarys of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rinburgh</hi> though
they argue no thrift in them, that buy them at laſt hand, yet
they alſo are no contemptible mines of Gold and ſilver to thoſe
which make, or buy them for a ſecond utterance. Furthermore,
if from Merchandize it ſelfe, and theſe good Bayliffes of the
Realme, which ſo actively purvey in all parts of the world habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and uninhabitable for Treaſure, armes, and all other
things, that partain to pleaſure, health, and neceſſity: if from
them, we turn to the inſtruments, of their negotiations our Ships,
the wooden walls, and fortification of our State, of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ought theſe to be? Even theſe (under God) in times of
Peace prevent War: in times of War procure Peace: in times of
plenty they releive our Friends abroad, in times of dearth they
releive us at home. For examples, tis loſſe of time to offer any
in this argument, every man can tell how ſtupendiouſly <hi>Tyre,
Sydon,</hi> &amp;c. of old, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice, Belgia</hi> and other latter Signioryes
have flouriſht ſince by the gaines of Merchandize, whilſt their
puiſſance, and magnificence has been more raiſed, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Merchant, then either by the Husbandman, ſouldier,
or Scholler. Tis admirable to ſee what vaſt revenues are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt
by ſome Nations (eſpecially where Democracy takes place)
out of meere commerce; and how far other Nations in the
mean time (eſpecially ſuch as are ſwayde by Monarchs) though
more commodiouſly ſituated, and advantagiouſly qualified o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
do neglect the ſame. The reaſon hereof may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in popular States the Merchant uſually has more ſhare
in adminiſtration of publick affaires: whereas in Monarchies,
thoſe that have the charge of the rudder, have commonly little
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115386:5"/>
inſight into Trade, and as little regard of Traders. Howſoever
either ſome ſingular happineſſe has hitherto attended <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
<hi>Portugal,</hi> or elſe doubtleſſe the feats of Merchandice have been
in more then ordinary eſteeme with their Kings: for both theſe
have not onely inriched their own homes by Sea adventures, but
alſo acquired thereby greater Dominions then their own. For
indeed beſides thoſe purchaſes which have been made in the Eaſt
Indies, we ſee in <hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> there is a new Hemiſphere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
now to that old half world, which the <hi>Aſſyrians, Perſians,
Grecians, Romans</hi> with ſo much ſweat, and blood laboured to
ſubjugate heretofore. And if the Sun find no degree in all his
circuit, where He can obſcure himſelf from the Crown of <hi>Spaines</hi>
Subjects; the thanks thereof is due to the Art of an old Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
and probably had <hi>Hen: 7.</hi> given as much credit to <hi>Columbus</hi>
as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did, either the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family had not ſpread its
wings ſo wide, or the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had not been ſo cloſely
intrenched within the foure Britiſh Seas, as now they are. But I
purpoſely wave the oſtentation of many, and great inſtances,
and therefore the whole weight of this Argument ſhall onely be
hung upon the ſingle epitome (as it were) of this pety juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here, wherein we now reſide.</p>
            <p>All the Land-intradoes, which tillage or paſturage yeelds to
this Town of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> are not much more conſiderable then
ſome Gentlemen and Eſquires inherit in <hi>England;</hi> yet the wilde
Ocean, as theſe reſtleſſe Copemen plow it with their Fleetes, and
harrow it with their nets; (though they creep into that too
through a River, not wholly at their command) is forced to pay
them as great a Tribute, and ample a rent as three the richeſt
and goodlieſt Counties of <hi>England</hi> are annually worth. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
<hi>England</hi> more abounding with all habiliments, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
accommodations of Trade, and ſeeming to be as much
courted by the circumambient Sea, as any part of the Univerſe,
for want of incouragement to her Merchants at home, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
abroad owes little of her grandour, and power to that
Element. Forrein Nations eaſily become greater gainers by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into <hi>England,</hi> then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can by trading abroad: 'tis
too probable, that forrein Merchants reſerve an intire gain to
themſelves out of all their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Commodities brought in hither:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115386:5"/>
yet ſhare a half profit with us, in all our Commodities exported
hence by them. And thus whileſt we leave many benefits to our
emulous hoſtile neighbours, which by the ſame induſtry (as they
commendably uſe) might by us be anticipated to our own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof;
our own ſupine ſluggiſhneſſe is the cauſe that we remain
ſo much the weaker, and our Enemies become ſo much the
ſtronger. Thus much of the advantages of traffick; thus much of
the neceſſity of that noble profeſſion, which teaches us to be the
curious, &amp; laborious marriners of all the worlds Oceans, Straits,
and Creeks; if we have any deſire to be more formidable to our
Enemies, or more aidfull to our Friends, or more gainfull to our
ſelves, this may be held ſufficient.</p>
            <p>From the benefit, I come now to the Freedom of <hi>Trade:</hi> I mean,
that particular degree of freedom, which is at this day pleaded
for, and patroniz'd by ſome, that profeſſe themſelves no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends
to Trade. Herein this method ſhall conduct me: In the
firſt place, I ſhall inquire, whether that Freedom, which is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by theſe times can ſtand with due order, and diſcipline, or not:
ſecondly, whether Trade probably can flouriſh, or not, without
due order and diſcipline: and in the laſt place, I ſhall anſwer
ſuch Arguments, as are framed for liberty, and do militate
againſt our Order and Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty</hi> in a right acception, and underſtanding, is that which
delivers, and exempts us from ſome evill noxious, and offenſive
to us; ſuch as is oppreſſion, too much reſtraint, &amp;c. but it includes
not any wilde condition, ſuch as leaves us looſly in all things to
our own diſcretion. That famous <hi>Roman,</hi> that had the happines
to ſet <hi>Greece</hi> (in that age the Eye of the world) at liberty, and
did break in ſunder the yoke of <hi>Macedon,</hi> when He ſaw in the
people too much wantonneſſe, and immoderation, He adviſed
them to more continencie, and to retire into narrower bounds;
<hi>Vt ſaltem meram libertatem non haurirent.</hi> Herein he ſeemed wiſely
to diſtinguiſh betwixt that ſheere, unmixt freedom, which uſes
to intoxicate us, and to bring detriment, and danger with it;
and that allayed, or mixt freedom, which God, and Nature have
made ſo ſweet to all Generous mindes: whoſe property it is ever,
to ſet reſtraints to it ſelf in ſome things, as well as to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115386:6"/>
off from us in other. In politicks, there are Free Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
and there are Free Subjects: and the freedom of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
is not incompatible with the freedom of Subjects: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it neceſſary to the freedom of a Prince, that He ſhould be
unlimitable in all things, and beyond controll as well when He
deſtroys, as when He ſaves: nor to the freedome of a Subject to
live abſolved from all Laws, and obedience. Without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
He is the freeſt Prince that has the moſt power to do good,
and the leaſt to do harm: and He is the freeſt Subject, who is to
pay his obedience to the mildeſt Laws, and indulgenteſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.
So in Ethicks: He injoyes the pureſt and moſt refined free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in his own breaſt, which has the leaſt furious paſſion to
ſerve, and the leaſt impetuous appetite to maſter; not He that is
becalmed, as it were, and finds no mobility at all in his ſpirit.
The variovs Luminaries in Heaven have their diſtinct magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
motions, and ſtations: and the bleſſed Intelligences in the
Heaven of heavens (nay even thoſe ſpirits that are falne from
bleſſedneſſe) retain ſeverall diſtances of power, place, and office.
All theſe things prove to us, that reſtraint, and liberty, are rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
things, and not to be accounted ſimply good, or ſimply bad
in themſelves. When reſtraint deprives us of that good which
is in temperate liberty it degenerates into oppreſſion: when it
onely ſaves to us that good, which is in harmonious order, it is
fully anſwerable to Liberty. So liberty when it onely diſcharges
us from that evill, which is in oppreſſion, it approaches to the
perfection of Order: but when it diſſolves all Order, it precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
us headlong into confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty</hi> is either intenſive, or extenſive, and both wayes it muſt
be reduced to a juſt ſtandart: for if it be in degree too void of
temperature, and qualification the ruder ſediment of the people
cannot bear it, it ſtrangely inebriates them: and if the degree of
it be moderate, yet the dilatation of it to too many makes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious.
There are two vitious extreames in government;
the one is rigorous, and makes nothing lawfull, or ſafe to any:
the other is remiſſe, and leaves all things free and ſafe to all: now
by the conſent of all; that extreame, which ſtraitens too much,
is not ſo deſperately ill, as that which inlarges too much. The
reaſon is, becauſe thoſe which govern are fewer in number then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115386:6"/>
the governed: and therefore claſhing, and confuſion (which
muſt needs inevitably follow, where all limits, and reſtraints are
taken away) is leſſe dammageable amongſt a few, then it would
be amongſt many.</p>
            <p>Liberty therefore may well be compared to freſh waters, it is
potable, and ſweet whilſt it endures a juſt confinement in the
vaines and channells of the earth. But when it once refundes it
ſelfe into the boſome of the briny <hi>Ocean,</hi> it retaynes no longer
its former relli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h. And even ſo we muſt cenſure of Liberty by
the laſt, whileſt it produces good effects it remains Liberty, the
name and thing agree well: but when it ſupplyes to us no good
at all, or bereaves us of ſome good greater then it ſupplyes, it
remaines no more then the ſhadow, or meere miſnomer of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>Exempli gratiâ:</hi> If all Land-incloſures were every where
layde open, and all evidences cancelled, upon which mens pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſts, and proprieties depend, many poore men would
expect to have their conditions meliorated; yet undoubtedly
their expectations at laſt would faile them; and together with
community in all things a generall confuſion of all perſons, and
things would breake in to the fatall deſtruction both of poore
and rich.</p>
            <p>Our common Proverbe puts us rightly in mind, that he which
dwells every where, dwells no where: that every mans intereſt
is no mans intreſt, &amp; that every mans buſineſſe is no mans buſines:
now this being true in matters of Husbandry, and in all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
and negotiations, why ſhould it not be as true in matters
of commerce, for if agriculture generally be more neceſſary then
trade: and if confuſion in agriculture be more miſcheivous then
confuſion in Trade, yet by the ſame conſequence confuſion in
trade? is as miſchievous to Traders, as confuſion in tillage
would be amongſt thoſe that till the earth.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the word <hi>Freedome</hi> generally taken, I muſt now
ſpeake more particularly of that Freedome, whoſe expedience,
or inexpedience is ſo much queſtion'd in the buſines of Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Freedome</hi> and <hi>reſtraint</hi> are things oppoſite (we ſee) yet both
admitting of ſeverall degrees, and limitations, they are not ſo
oppoſite but that ſome kinde of reſtraint may be reconciled to
ſome kinde of freedome, for in as much as it is ſometimes conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115386:7"/>
to be reſtrained, though not alwaies, and from all things;
and ſometimes it is inconvenient to be looſed, or inlarged
though not alwaies, and from all things: in regard that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
at ſometimes onely upholds Order, and liberty at other
times introduces confuſion: Our mayne Quaere, is onely this;
Whether that reſtraint in Trade which hitherto has been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh't
amongſt ſuch and ſuch Companies of Merchants, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to Order, or no: And whether that Freedome of Trade
which irregular Interlopers diſpute for be the uſher of confuſion,
or no.</p>
            <p>For the juſt diſcuſſion of this, the benefit of Order, regulation,
and approved diſcipline amongſt Merchants, is to be conſidered
and brought into the ſcole of this hand, whilſt the advantage of
opennes, looſeneſſe, and unconfinedneſſe in trading is to be
brought into the other.</p>
            <p>For out of all queſtion, liberty is not to be poized by the meer
ſound of its name, but by the ſolid priviledges which it brings
with it, &amp; in like manner reſtraint is not to be rejected except one
ly for the certaine, ſubſtantiall diſadvantages which are found
to accompany it. Let us then draw up an exact ballance.</p>
            <p>The 1. Benefit which we now injoy by our government, and
incorporation is in things appertaining to Gods worſhip, &amp; the
true Religion: though we live amongſt <hi>Lutherans, Papiſts, Jews,
Mahometans, Pagans:</hi> Yet we have a free exerciſe of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in ſome places the Ordinances are as duly, profitably,
and comfortably adminiſterd amongſt us, as if we were in the
beſome of our own Church.</p>
            <p>How much this priviledge tends to the honor of God, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the true faith, how much to the proſperity of trade
(Godlineſſe having not onely the promiſes of the world to
come, but alſo of this life) &amp; how much to be bewail'd the want
of the Word, and Sacraments is amongſt our Merchants in
<hi>Spaine, Italy, Portugal;</hi> let all men judge. Yet how this divine
bleſſing can be continued amongſt us, after that we are bound
together by no links of Aſſociation, but that we may trade at
large arbitrarily where we liſt, how we liſt, and when we liſt, is
worthy to be conſidered; and I beleive all men who have a true
ſence, and tincture of Religion in their hearts will conſider it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115386:7"/>
ſeriouſly. The next benefit is in matters of Juſtice: Though
we are far diſtant from our own Judges &amp; Courts, and cannot
have timely recourſe to the remedie of our owne Laws, nay
though we ſhould otherwiſe be expoſed to the ſnares, and rigors
of forrein Laws, and Magiſtrates, we are now (in matters where
appeale is not requiſite) tryed by men of our own Religion, of
our own Nation, and education, and ſuch alſo as are preſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place.</p>
            <p>All Partners that enter into a joynt Trade for the moſt part
Covenant here mutually, and voluntarily in all caſes of diſpute,
and doubt to ſtand to the judgment of this Court, I never ſaw
any Indentures hitherto without that expreſſe clauſe in them.
Nay even ſtrangers here have often declined their owne Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
and ſubmitted their caſes to our deciſions, and I never
yet heard of any of them that departed not from our Court ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied both with our Juſtice, and expedition: it cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be expected, that our own Merchants which know ſo well
what a priviledge it is to be judged by Merchants, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſent upon the place, and ſuch as guide their judgments
by the ſame Merchants Law, as is in force in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould not
ſet a great price upon this eſpeciall priviledge. <hi>Hen:</hi> the 4th. and
<hi>Hen:</hi> the 7th. were as wiſe Kings as ever raign'd in <hi>England,</hi> and
when the one of them granted our Charter, &amp; the other inlarged
the ſame, the main conſideration, which both of them had in
their eyes, was the prevention of many miſcheifs empeachments,
&amp; obſtructions which at that time ſenſibly oppreſſed Merchants,
and confounded Trade, <hi>ob defectum boni, &amp; ſani Regiminis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third Benefit which we are now capable of by being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
into Companies is, that hereby we are inabled to do
many egregious works of charity, which by our disfranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would all be utterly loſt, and extinguiſht.</p>
            <p>The Merchant Adventurers are but one branch of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Merchants here reſiding are but one
branch of the Merchants Adventurers, yet how many hundreds
has this branch ſuſtained, and releived in caſes of neceſſity? and
how many widowes, and poore families doth it conſtantly feed
and refreſh? About 16 yeers ſince, when the expedition of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſe
<hi>Halmilton</hi> had miſcarried here in <hi>Germany</hi> many, ſick, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
ſouldiers that were the wofull ſplinters of his broken ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>army
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115386:8"/>
came hither, and were not onely ſaved from periſhing, but
alſo ſhipt for <hi>England</hi> at this Companies charge. M: <hi>Ant: Beding-field</hi>
was then our Deacon, and had the charge of the poores box,
he is now a Parliament man, and can averre upon his knowledge
that this ſociety iſſued no leſſe at that time within 6 months
ſpace then 400 pound, for ſuch devout purpoſes.</p>
            <p>A Fourth Benefit afforded by our preſent Governments, is, that
hereby we are render'd far more conſiderable inſtruments to ſerve
and honour our own Country, then elſe we ſhould be, and that
not onely in Trade, but alſo in diverſe other eminent, publick
Offices.</p>
            <p>As we are now imbodied, and compacted, we can by our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſeales raiſe great ſummes of mony: We are in a qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to entertaine Princes, to oblige Cities, to procure right, and
timely intelligence, and ſometimes to prevent publick miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings:
and ſo to merit much oftentimes of the Nation, from
whence we are.</p>
            <p>That formidable <hi>Armado</hi> which in 1588 was deſigned to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us up, had inprobability been far more fatall then it was
if it had been appointed ſooner, and arrived when Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
was not ſo well appointed as it found her afterwards.
And yet this is well known, that <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſham</hi> and other Merchants
by taking up the monys at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and our Company by doing
the like at <hi>Keeler Mart</hi> in <hi>Holſteine:</hi> did ſo prevent <hi>Philip</hi> that his
Invaſion was retarded thereby for a whole year, and that retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being ſo much to the diſadvantage of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of <hi>England,</hi> was under God a powerfull meanes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
us. <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. by calculation found that in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe
20000</hi> Soules, and in all the Low Countries at leaſt 60000
had a lively-hood, and ſubſiſtance from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he was very reſolute to bring the inquiſition into <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe,</hi>
and remained unmoovable againſt all other arguments,
and ſupplications of that Town: yet this motive, that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh</hi>
Company would be diſlodged by introducing of that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
diverted him from his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Alſo when the ſame <hi>Charles</hi> had transferred all his ſigniories,
&amp; Dominions to his ſon <hi>Philip,</hi> that branch of the Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
appeared in gallant ſtate to grace thoſe Solemnities,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115386:8"/>
conſuming above 2000 Crowns in ſumptuous furniture, ſhewes
and triumphall arches. In the yeer 1581. likewiſe the Duke of
<hi>Alanſon</hi> in the ſame City was entertained by 80 <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchants of the ſame Company, all bravely mounted on horſe
back, apparelled in black velvet, &amp; moſt of them with brooches &amp;
chains of gold about their necks: for which they received
thanks from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Lords of her Councell.
The King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and ſome of our Kings <hi>Nephews</hi> (beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Embaſſadors) have found ſome ſeemly receptions alſo
from us here at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and from our brethren at <hi>Roterdam,</hi>
upon ſeverall occaſions, but I forbeare prolixity in this point.
An other excellent ſingular Benefit of our government is, that
thereby we are put into a capacity of injoying all that is good
and profitable in union, and all that is good, and profitable in
diviſion withall. Take away that Order, and Harmony that is
now ſetled amongſt us, and has been ſetled by all our Kings, and
countenanced by all our Parliaments from <hi>Hen:</hi> the 4th. till this
very day, and as fully confirmed by this Parliament as by any:
and our Trade will become inſtantly both ſtragling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed:
and as a ſtragling Trade will deprive us of whatſoever is
good in union, ſo a confuſed Trade will abridge us of all that is
good in a due method, and diſtribution.</p>
            <p>This may be demonſtrated moſt plainly in a military bodie:
20000 men well armed, and imbattaild, are of greater force, then
40000 drawn together in an unformed, undigeſted heap; and
when that ſhall be accounted an Army of ſo many Souldiers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
this ſhall be deſpiſed as a rout of ſo many men rudely
conglomerated, and thronged together. For 'tis not ſufficient
that there be together in one Feild a due proportion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
and Souldiers, of Horſe and Foot, of Arms offenſive, and
defenſive: all theſe muſt be ſeverally ranged, and diſtantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed:
the Commander muſt move here, the Souldier there, the
Horſe muſt charge here, the Foot there; ſuch a Regiment muſt
be aſſigned its poſt here, ſuch a Brigade muſt advance there: wiſe
men know experimentally, that there is an art in diviſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
ſuch as in many caſes gives life to Union: and it is as true
on the contrary: that the queinteſt diviſion makes miſerable Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
when it is not ſubſervient to Union. For let a Battail be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115386:9"/>
marſhall'd in all its members, and parts according to the moſt
exact rules of ſouldery either ancient, or moderne: yet if the
Trumpets ſound contrary points of warre, if the ſuperior Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
give contrary Orders, if all theſe curiouſly faſhion'd
digeſtions, and diviſions be not inſpirited with one, joynt deſigne,
which like the ſoul is to over-rule all the Organs, what can be
expected from this great, moliminous frame? Now if we make
any doubt whether or no the uſe of Tacticks be as great in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorian,
as in military affairs let us come to neerer application,
and bend our ſelves to conſider, as well what the want of union,
as what the want of diſtribution uſually occaſions amongſt
Traders.</p>
            <p>Union amongſt Merchants cannot be denyed to be of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great importance, for in all places where we ſix our reſidence,
we ſee, it makes as more valuable, and acceptable: Whileſt we
are lookt upon as an orderly, united Society, we are known to
be able to make, or divert a Trade in or from any one Town, or
Province. How ſoon was <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> deſpoyl'd of its fame,
and opulence after our Company withdrew from it? and how
ſoon did <hi>Antwerpe</hi> tranſcend <hi>Bruges</hi> in fame, and opulence after
our Commodities were ſtapled in <hi>Brabant?</hi> When 'twas too late,
<hi>Bruges,</hi> beſides inlargement of former priviledges, could offer us
moneys, and deſcend to ſtrange intreaties for the wooing and
winning of our return: but <hi>Antwerpe</hi> had firſt prevailed with us,
and having prevailed, it ſent forth its Magiſtrates to meet, and
welcome us with proceſſions. And well it was for <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo taken with their civilities, for in the ſpace of
60 or 70 yeers, whereas it had, before it was our Mart, not above
foure able Merchants, and ſix Ships, it became the glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of all Europe. The like inſtance might be given in <hi>Stodt,</hi>
and <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> the ſame cauſe that now makes <hi>Hamburgh</hi> rich,
did once do the like at <hi>Stodt:</hi> and the ſame cauſe that made <hi>Stodt</hi>
poore, may hereafter perhaps work the ſame effect in <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
Who ſees not therefore that from the benefit which ſtrangers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from us, whileſt we are thus aſſociated, and made capable
of marrying our Company to them, ariſe thoſe reciprocall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and ſpeciall dowries, as it were, which they by their
concordates confirm unto us? Where we are unprofitable, we muſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115386:9"/>
expect to be held deſpicable: and what extraordinary profit can
other Nations expect from our Merchants, when they appear
onely as ſo many individuall perſons, or ſtragling Traders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had at the <hi>Narre</hi> in <hi>Leiſland</hi> a good Trade, and
good ſales for our Native Commodities for a while, but about
1565. divers ſtragling Merchants reſorted thither out of <hi>England</hi>
and ſo brought themſelves, and their wares into great contempt.
Divers of them went about the Town with Cloth in their arms,
and Meaſures in their hands, and ſo when they had ſhamefully
imbaſed our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Draperies, to the diſreputation of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and decay of themſelves, the Lords of the Councell at the
next Parliament were inforced, for prevention of the like ſordid,
Pedlar-like traffick thereafter, to compriſe the <hi>Narre</hi> within the
<hi>Muſcovie</hi> Companies Charter.</p>
            <p>Thus is Union, or a politick Aſſociation amongſt Merchants,
beneficiall to the places where we trade, and by reſultance bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
to our ſelves, and in the laſt reſort beneficiall to our whole
Nation: for all theſe intereſts are ſo interweaved, that the benefit
of the Stranger is requited with the benefit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant;
and the benefit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant is to be regarded
as the benefit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. For in ſome things that
which immediately advantages the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
mediately the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: even as in other things that
which immediately brings proſperity to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
brings proſperity to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant. This is to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
the Commodities which flowe from our Union, now the
Commodities which flowe from a due diſtribution, and diviſion
in Trade are no leſſe viſible. The whole world almoſt is now apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cantoniz'd amongſt ſeveral Societies of our Merchants, whileſt
ſome trade Eaſt, ſome Weſt, ſome neerer, ſome further off; and
were it not for this apt partition, it would unavoidably fall out,
that ſome Mart Towns would prove over-peſter'd, or like a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of Paſture over-layd, whileſt others in the mean time would
be left utterly unfrequented. And ſure if the world were not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
enough for a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our Traders, ſome pretence might be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
why all men ought to be licenced in all places: but ſince the
contrary is moſt true, and no man is ſo ſtraited for want of
roome, but that He may trade in ſome places to his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
though he be bounded that he may not trade in all places
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115386:10"/>
to other mens diſadvantage: nothing but an emulous deſire to
interfere with others, and to incumber trade could provoke men
to be oppoſite to our regular diſtributions. I need not amplifie
hereupon, tis enough that I further refer to the example of our
thriving Neighbours in <hi>Holland;</hi> whoſoever will behold Order in
its beauty, and perfection amongſt Merchants there, He may
obſerve them ſo politickly aſſociated, and their Aſſociations ſo
equally diſtributed, that no one impedes the other abroad, nor
no one Town ingroſſes all Trading to it ſelf at home.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have inſtanced in the manifold expediences of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Government, eſpecially in matters of piety, equity, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and policy as well in relation to the Common weal of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
as to the Common-weal of <hi>England:</hi> now whether there
be any thing in freedom of Trading that can preponderate, and
excell all theſe, I leave to all ſober men to diſcern; if there be, I
wiſh it may prevail, and obtain a juſt preference before all theſe:
if there be not, more need not be inferred out of theſe premiſſes:
ſober men cannot be affected with the name, or empty ſound of a
relative, that is rather to be judged by its circumſtances, effects,
and additions then by it ſelf: ſober men cannot but diſtinguiſh
betwixt that true freedome which alwayes diſ-inthrals us of
ſome evill, and that ſhadowy ghoſt of freedome, which often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudes
us of our greateſt priviledges. I hope I have now diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
what was to be expected from me in my firſt point, and
made it apparent that the freedom in Trade which is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſured,
and ballanced with all theſe expediences here enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
had not need to be of large extenſion.</p>
            <p>It remains now that I come to my next head, and therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether trade be likely to flouriſh or no, being ſtripped,
and robbed of all thoſe powers and preeminences which our
Charters convey to us.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto lookt upon Merchants as Travaylers ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, I muſt now come neerer, and looke upon them as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Merchants, buying, ſelling, bartering, bargaining, &amp;c. with
other Nations; &amp; from generall Order, and harmony amongſt
Merchants, I muſt come to inſtance in ſuch, and ſuch ſpecies of
that Order, and harmony, which has hitherto been ſo fortunate
to them. And firſt let us looke into that proviſion of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which limits the education, and admiſſion of Apprentices,
&amp; though I have not leiſure to cite all our rules concerning the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115386:10"/>
ſame which are very many, &amp; each of them very uſefull, yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>ſumum genus</hi> it ſelf, ſee if the breeding of Apprentices
be not abſolutely neceſſary. Grant to all without exception an
open licenſe to trade at large, &amp; who will indure the ſtrict duty
and bondage of Apprenticehood? and yet without that ſtrict
duty, and bondage, who can be ſufficiently inſtructed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to gaine all thoſe Arts, and ſubtilties, which we know are
abſolutely neceſſary to all Traders. In all ſciences, and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
breeding is neceſſary, but amongſt Merchants it is more
then ordinarily neceſſary: For if Divines may pretend ſomthing
to divine, ſecret illapſes from above; and ſouldiers by their
generall tacticks learned in one Countrey, may be qualified for
command in all Countries; and if agriculture be a skill that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
much upon naturall ſagacity: yet with Merchants 'tis
far otherwiſe. For unto a Merchant not onely a breeding, but a
particular breeding in ſuch or ſuch a place, in ſuch or ſuch a
Trade is requiſite. He that is experienced to trade in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> is not
thereby inabled to trade in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and he that can deale warily
enough with <hi>Indians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is not alwaies prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
enough to cope with the <hi>Jews,</hi> Hans Townes, and <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
Queſtionleſſe to licenſe all men to trade without breeding, nay
without the particular advertiſements, and preparations of
ſuch a breeding is to ſend men naked into battell, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them up as a prey to vulpine, circumventing neighbours. I
might here take occaſion to commend the training up of our
Youths on this ſide the ſeas, as it is publickly advantagious, there
being infuſed into them thereby ſomthing of the Souldier, and
ſomthing of the Scholler, and indeed (if I am not deceived) there
is commonly inſtilled ſomthing into them, that better qualifies
them to ſerve the State, then what we ſee in meere Schollers or
Souldiers. I wiſh our young gallants which learn in <hi>France</hi> to
weare ribbons, and in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to be perfidious, and do
worſe things, did alwayes return home as much improved, and
as well accompliſht as our Merchants uſe to do. But this is not
within my liſts, and that thought ſhall ſuperſede me.</p>
            <p>For our next evidence, we may appeal unto our many Orders
made to prevent, and reform, the ill and faulty making or Cloth,
and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> woollen Commodities, without which Orders
all our Manufactures would be falſified, and corrupted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115386:11"/>
our Nation diſparaged, all buyers of Cloth at home,
and abroad abuſed, and Trade it ſelf much deſolated. At the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation
of our Merchants, wholſome Statutes have been Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to ſecond them ſtrict Proclamations have been publiſht:
and to back them the Merchants have appointed Officers, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
ſtipends, and applyed divers other preventions, that our
Draperies might be kept to their juſt meaſures, weights, and
numbers; yet we find all is too little. The Clothiers begin to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate
of late more then ever, and all our power will be inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to withſtand them; except the State reach forth their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hands yet further; and do more exactly poize both our ends
and pretenſions. The clamors of the Clothiers againſt the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
priviledges ariſe chiefly from this offence, though they
are commonly palliated with other pretexts, and tis a wondrous
thing, that when they are ſenſibly gainers by tranſgreſſing Laws,
and we are as ſenſibly at a charge to maintain them, they ſhould
be ſo well, and we ſo ill interpreted.</p>
            <p>In my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> opinion nine parts of ten of all our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Staple Commodities, are ſuch as we ſheere from the Sheeps back,
we had need therefore be carefull how abuſes break in upon us
in theſe Commodities, and how we countenance thoſe that are
the abuſers, and yet thereby diſcountenance the zealous reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the ſame. M: <hi>Anth: Wither</hi> is now a Juſtice of Peace about
<hi>London,</hi> He was once imployed by the Merchant Adventurers
beſides others about reforming of theſe abuſes, let it be inquired
what a liberall yeerly ſtipend He obtained for the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the third place we may produce our many prudent Orders
againſt miſ-ſhipping, whereby, firſt, the Shipping of the Kingdom
is the better maintained, in as much as by our government it is
not permitted to any particular men for cheapneſſe ſake either
to ſhip in forrein bottoms, or in veſſels of our own that are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible.
Secondly, by our regularity in ſhipping many fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
attempts of ſuch as uſe to ſteal cuſtomes, bribe ſearchers,
colour ſtrangers goods, &amp;c. are diſappointed. Thirdly, by the
due obſervation of our rules, whileſt we ſhip our goods hand in
hand together we go ſtronger through the Seas, are in leſſe fear
of Rovers, and other dangers. We alſo are leſſe injurious to our
common Trade, yea and to particular perſons amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves:
in as much as now we foreſtall not one another, nor bring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115386:11"/>
down our common prices by the precipitate haſte of ſome few;
by this means alſo forrein buyers are accommodated by their
certainty, knowing in due ſeaſon when to repair to our Marts;
and we are not diſaccommodated by our uncertainty, becauſe
we know when to ſell, and when to forbear ſelling, and thereby
we keep our Commodities from being blown upon, either by
having our. Ware-houſes too full at ſometimes, or too empty at
others.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, the many Cautions, Orders made by us
for the reglement of our ſales may juſtly be here cited: by ſome
of theſe, we are limited to ſuch certain ſhew-dayes partly for our
own eaſe, and partly for the buyers advantage. The Cities of
<hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Bremen</hi> have lately been urgent with us to ſet more
ſhew-dayes here at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> then two in a week: but we ſeeing
our Trade no ampler, then it is at preſent, found the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of altring our Shew dayes, and ſo denied them ſatisfaction
in that point. By others of our Orders we are reſtrained from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gratifications to Merchants or Brokers, from all pety ſales,
and retails, which (if allowed) would reduce us ſoon to ignoble,
vulgar Pedlars: by others we are bound from giving credit
without liquid Bils, and ſpecialties, alſo from pawning Bils, or
rebating under ſuch a certain rate, and hereby we prevent ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
Suits with ſtrangers, and many ſtrifes amongſt our ſelves. By
others we are inhibited from allowing Tare out of the Mart
Town, or out of due time, or without due inſpection: and we
are all convinced, that were it not for regulation in this matter
of Tare, there were no abiding in <hi>Germany.</hi> How our Trade lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes
in <hi>Holland</hi> at this time by reaſon of Oppreſſion in matter
of Tare is known too well, our Councell Table in King <hi>James</hi> his
dayes took notice of it, and ſought the redreſſe of it: and ſure our
Merchants hitherto have onely continued trading there, out of
ſome hope of better times, and conditions hereafter, as Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
uſe to manure the earth in times of dearth, as well as
in times of plenty. Commiſſioners from <hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Bremen</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by the Senate of this Town have aſſailed us lately, and
eagerly preſſed us to allow the ſame Tare, as is in <hi>Holland,</hi> but
our anſwer was reſolute, that rather then to ſubmit to ſuch a
thraldome we ſhould be forced to abandon all Trade in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more inſtances then theſe (if it were not for prolixity)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115386:12"/>
might be made: but as thoſe which have any knowledge in
Merchandice will acknowledge theſe are matters of grand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and importance: ſo to other men that are ignorant, or
careleſſe of our affairs, more would be to little purpoſe. I will
onely adde this, that as we injoy many conveniencies by being
an united, imbodied Fraternity, ſo by vertue of the ſame we are
guarded and protected from many inconveniences. As we have
a juriſdiction amongſt us, we are inabled upon all new emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to contravene new deviſed arts of fraud, and circumvention
in bargaining, ſelling, &amp;c. by making new Orders againſt them.</p>
            <p>Alſo as we are a Corporation, we are armed thereby with a
competence of power to inforce, &amp; execute our Orders ſo made,
and if any violence of forrein States, and Potentates contrary to
our Intercourſes, and Treaties of amitie enterpoſes to our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
or if any new Tolls, impoſts, or exactions oppreſſe us, we
are in this poſture better qualified to relieve, or vindicate our
ſelves, then elſe we ſhould be. A thouſand private men intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own particular intereſts as ſo many particular men,
having no common purſe, nor publick Officers to ſolicite the
buſines of them all, cannot expect that authority with forrein
States, nor hope to make ſo vigorous a reſiſtance againſt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and innovaſions, as one hundred Merchants may, that are
cloſely linked, and cemented together under one, and the ſame
policie. For want of ſuch policie, all other Nations were long
ſince eaten out of their Trade by the <hi>Antwerpians,</hi> and <hi>Eſterlings,</hi>
and had the Merchant Adventurers been deſtitute of thoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
and immunities which <hi>Hen:</hi> the 4th. <hi>Hen:</hi> the 7th. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
famous Kings of <hi>England</hi> eſtabliſht amongſt them, they alſo
had been long ſince driven out of Trade in like manner.</p>
            <p>One man is woolviſh to another, as the old Proverbe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes,
nay when Bears will not prey upon Bears, nor woolfes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
woolfes, man will ſcarce prey upon any other then man.
And yet this notwithſtanding private man to private man is not
ſo unnaturall; as Nation is to Nation: for amongſt particular

and neereſt conjoyned in other relations, and as
for doing to other Nations, as we would have done unto us; that
ſems a ridiculous principle amongſt Statſ-men, inaſmuch as to
do juſtice to a ſtranger when he is plaintiffe againſt a Native,
is no leſſe reputed then to do injuſtice to a Native: and to let
ſlip any advantage whatſoever that is offered us of ſpoyling
forreiners, is the ſame accounted as to ſpoile domeſticks.</p>
            <p>Republicks have no breaſts, or ſeats where any ſuch thing as
conſcience or true honour can reſide; were it not for fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital,
and return of injuries from thoſe that are injured, all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would be at the ſame paſſe, as <hi>Argiers</hi> is now at.</p>
            <p>That bold <hi>Roman</hi> that expoſtulated with <hi>Alexander,</hi> why it
might not be as lawfull for him to ſeize boats, as it was for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to invade whole Empires, ſeemed to conceive that the Laws
of Nature extended to communities of men, as well as to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidualls:
but alas that would neither juſtifie his private roving
at ſea; nor condemne <hi>Alexanders</hi> royall roving by land.</p>
            <p>In matters of warre Monarchies eſpecially, and in matters of
Trade Republicks, lay hold of all advantages, as if their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
rights were never bounded by any thing but invincible
difficulties, and neceſſities, nor honour had any rules to meaſure
things by but thoſe of profit, and diſprofit.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon why the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Lumbards are odious for
their exceſſive gains exacted, and extorted out of all ſuch as they
contract with, and therefore are purſued as petty Pirats: but
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Hans</hi> Townes for the ſame exploits done more
publickly are extolled as great Merchants, nay are crowned as
glorious Conquerors. We that live here in <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and our
Brethren in <hi>Holland</hi> are too ſenſible of this: our often removals
from one Mart Town to another, to eaſe our ſelves of inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
preſſures moſt fedifragouſly brought in upon us, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that life in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade that is yet remaining in it:
yet the vaſt expences of our removings have left us in a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>This concludes my two firſt points: I am now in order to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſuch arguments as are brought for a <hi>free Trade,</hi> and ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
as are urged againſt our priviledged way of Trading.</p>
            <p>The firſt Argument is founded upon this maxime: <hi>Bonum quo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115386:13"/>
communius, eo melius:</hi> If Merchandize (ſay our Adverſaries) be
good for the Common-weal, then the more common it is made,
the more open it is layd, the more good it will convey to us. But
all grant Merchandize to be good <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgo. Anſ.</hi> To detect the
fallacies of this Argument: we muſt confeſſe that this maxime is
true of all ſuch good things as are abſolutely, or infinitely good:
yet we may deny that Merchandize is either abſolutely, or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
good. For firſt, Merchandize <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> that is, if it
be rightly managed, and regulated may be profitable to ſuch a
man, or ſuch a State: but (we all ſee) that Merchandize at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
for want of good government, and order, undoes many
private men, and in their undoing proves injurious to the State.
Secondly, Merchandize may be reckoned amongſt good things,
but not amongſt things infinitely good, therefore though the
diffuſion, or inlargement of it may bring profit to the State unto
ſuch bounds, and degrees; yet this is no proof, but that there are
bounds, and degrees beyond which it may not be diffuſed, nor
can be inlarged without diſprofit. Thoſe good things which are
ample enough to ſatisfie all, may be extended to all, and the
further they are extended, the more good they do: but Trade is
not of that amplitude as to ſatisfie all men in all places, and at
all times, and therefore not within the ſame Maxime. If there
were in the fruits, and increaſe of the earth an over-flowing
abundance to ſuſtain all, and anſwer all mens deſires without
our labour and ſweat, then hedges and ditches would be to no
purpoſe: but ſince the earth is not ſo profuſe of its favours, nor
ſo immenſe in its revenues, we muſt maintain mounds, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers;
priority of poſſeſſion, expence of toyl, purchaſe, &amp;c. muſt
be regarded, or elſe we ſhall all be ſoon at a loſſe.</p>
            <p>Before the Land of Canaan was fully ſtockt, <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi>

places where they travelled; but in proceſſe of time, when their
flocks became more numerous, and when conſequently the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face

The water is a more unmeaſured element then the
earth, and therefore formerly it was ever held a common patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to all: yet ſince Navigation is improved to this degree,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115386:13"/>
even this alſo is now diſterminated, and made ſubject to imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
lives for avoiding of incroachments, and ſtrife about fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
&amp;c. And not onely navigable Rivers, but Seas, and Oceans
begin to ſubmit to particular Proprieties, and to own the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
prerogatives of ſuch, and ſuch ſigniors. Lawyers ſay, <hi>Cujus
eſt Solum, ejus eſt etiamuſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ad Coelum:</hi> wherefore if neither Aire,
Water, nor Land reſiſt the Laws of propriety, we cannot think
the Trade of Merchants is a thing more emptie, and uncapable
of limits and rules, then any of the Elements: if our grounds may
be peſter'd with cattell; if Ponds may be over-ſtockt with Fiſh;
if the ſeveral Climates of the lower Region be ſeverally peopled,
and frequented with fowl that ſeem to underſtand their ſeverall
ſeaſons: we can hardly imagine that ſuch a Countrey, or ſuch a
Mart Town in ſuch a Countrey ſhould not be over-charged with
too great a confluence of Merchants.</p>
            <p>Second Argument. That which ſeizes too great matters into
the hands of too few, and ſo is in the nature of a Monopoly, has
been alwayes condemned as a preventing Trade, and held inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the major part of mankind: but ſuch is the Trade which
priviledged, and incorporated Merchants drive, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The force of this Objection is, that if Trade may not be
ſet at liberty to all, yet it may be ſet at liberty to more then it is,
except we will incur the name and blame of Monopoliſts. In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Merchant Adventurers who have, I think, the fulleſt
Charters, &amp; have ever met with the greateſt oppoſitions, though
I am not ſo well acquainted with other Companies, I may with
much confidence give theſe Anſwers hereunto. Firſt, though
Wools endraped be the main matter of our Trade, yet we deal
not onely in thoſe Draperies, but alſo in all kinds of Wares, and,
other Merchandizes. Secondly, neither doth our Company alone
tranſport theſe Draperies: all other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, nay the
Hans Towns, and all other Strangers in amity with the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> at their pleaſure may buy, and vend again all ſorts
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wares that are fully manufactured, as uncontrollably
as they bring in their own Commodities. Wherefore it cannot
be ſaid that this chief Trade of the Kingdom is ingroſſed, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoliz'd
by us in either of theſe two reſpects, for as much as our
priviledges neither confine that Trade to us alone, nor us to that
Trade alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:115386:14"/>
Thirdly, The name of Monopoliſts cannot be fixed on them in
reſpect of the bounds allotted them for their Trade: for by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
we finde there are above 6000 perſons free of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and from the <hi>Some</hi> in <hi>France</hi> to the <hi>Scaw</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> (the
<hi>nihil ultraes</hi> of our commerce) is no extraordinary proportion,
for ſuch a proportion of men, let the number of the Merchant
Adventurers be compared with the number of all other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and then compare this ſpace of earth in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
with all the globe beſides; and it will ſoon appeare, that
the confines of our Trade are rather too narrow, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Some hundreds, nay thouſands of our Company that are
capable of our freedome by ſervice, or by Patrimony are faine
to leave their callings, &amp; to betake themſelves to other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and neceſſity hath now taught us to confine our ſelves
to a certaine ſtint of Apprentices, in regard that our Trade is
too narrow for our Traders, &amp; therefore whileſt we are inforced
to break out, what can invite other men thus to break in, and to
invade our precincts?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The price that is ſet upon our priviledges cannot
condemne us of monopolie: for if a ſufficient number could
not be admitted by ſervice, or patrimony: yet the State hath
left a door open for any that are qualified for trading to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon a meane, inconſiderable rate.</p>
            <p>Any Out Port Merchant might have had his freedome for 25.

                  </gap>ing,</hi> and any of <hi>London</hi> for 50. l. and thoſe which neglected
that opportunity, are yet capable for the double ſumme.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The ſtint which we ſet upon our ſelves in buying cloth
cannot be objected to us, as ſavouring of monopolie: For firſt
the whole Company by common advice, and conſent ſets this
ſtint for its own good; and as the whole Company beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
its own intereſt, ſo neither has it, or can it have any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
but ſuch as is conſiſtent with the intereſt of the State. 2ly, the
Company had never reſolved upon any ſuch ſtint, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the narrowneſſe of Trade: and ſo far is this ſtint
from making trade more ſcarce, that it ſelf was ordained meerly
as ſome eaſe and remedie againſt the ſcarcity of Trade.</p>
            <p>We know well that tis poſſible for ſome one Merchant to exceed
fourty others in purſe, or credit; yet ſure it cannot be expedient
for the Common-wealth, that one Merchant ſhould graſpe too
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115386:14"/>
much, and ſwell up to an exceſſive bulk, whileſt fourty other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
being over ſhadowed by him, can attain to no growth at
all. Thirdly, As the ſtint of Clothes is now ſet, it remains larger
then is made uſe of by diverſe, the fourth part of our Merchants
ſcarce ever buyes to the fourth part of Clothes that is allowable
by the ſtint, wherefore it is a moſt indirect and prepoſterous
thing to call that a monopolie, or ſtraitning of Trade; which is
the onely remedie againſt monopolie, &amp; the meer effect of ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe
in Trade.</p>
            <p>They which know the difference betwixt Common certain,
and Common ſans number; and ſee how the Husbandman in
dreſſing his vine, makes it more fruitfull by paring away the
luxuriant products of its fertility, wil eaſily judge by theſe ſtints,
that the Merchants were grown too numerous for their Trade,
and not that their Trade was grown too copious for their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging.
Sixtly, As our Trade cannot be called an ingroſſing
Trade, or a monopolie in reſpect of any other of its priviledges
or powers, ſo neither can it be accuſed thereof in regard of our
covinous, falſe dealing in Marchandize. Tis true, our Company
in <hi>Qu: Elizabeths</hi> daies found much oppoſition from the <hi>Hans</hi>
Townes, and in that bando which was procured againſt us, to
remoove us from <hi>Stadt,</hi> the main pretence was monopolie uſed
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, but for a further Account of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we are to be informed: that the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns had antiently
by their great skill in Merchandize, made themſelves very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and procured to themſelves priviledges in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
Amongſt other Nations alſo that did priviledge them, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> was not the laſt, or leaſt.</p>
            <p>In <hi>London</hi> therefore they had the <hi>Steelyard</hi> aſſigned them with
power to exerciſe Merchant Law there, for their own better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation:
and amongſt many other old immunities, they were
to pay for wares brought in, and carried out one and a quarter
<hi>per centum</hi> cuſtome, and no more.</p>
            <p>This Cuſtome whileſt the cheife Trade of the land was in
Wooll undraped, was no great loſſe to us: but after that the
full Art of clothing was made ours in <hi>Ed:</hi> the 3ds. daies, and
the Wooll Trade was almoſt quite decaied, our State found that
it loſt exceedingly by paſſing out cloth at the old Cuſtome, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115386:15"/>
that the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns priviledges were diverſe otherwaies abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to our publick detriment. Hereupon after ſome conteſts,
<hi>(Ed:</hi> the 6th. raigning <hi>Anno 1550.)</hi> the ſaid priviledges were
lookt into, and found both defective in themſelves, and alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
by diverſe breaches of conditions: the formalities of
their incorporation were ſo voide, that none could ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with them, and therefore being detected of diverſe injuries
in colouring of forrein goods, not within the verge of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
and other falſhoods: it appeared, that they were
ſuch an uncertain, miſconſtituted body, that they were not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to any account, nor anſwerable for any treſpaſſe.</p>
            <p>This procured a judgment to annull, and abrogate the <hi>Hans</hi>
Towns priviledges, and in <hi>Anno 1557.</hi> under <hi>Phil:</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi>
our Cuſtomes were improoved from 14. d. to 6. s. 8. d. <hi>per Cloth</hi>
payable by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and 13. s. 4. d. by ſtrangers, and this
improovement did but equall the old Cuſtome of wooll undra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
Till the death of <hi>Q: Mary,</hi> whileſt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were
united, the <hi>Hans</hi> Townes ſeeing their profit ſo far impared, and
Trade in <hi>England</hi> in ſo good a meaſure advanced, gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w ſullenly
envious, but durſt attempt nothing.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe <hi>Anno 1564</hi> when <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was at enmity
with the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> with more reſumed courage the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns
laboured to ſuppreſſe the growth of our Merchandize: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> their abettor againſt us in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and the Netherlanders, they made themſelves parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us in <hi>Spaine,</hi> by furniſhing armes, amunition, &amp;c. Thus
ſome acts of hoſtility were done on both ſides, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
in a defenſive way ſeized ſome of their Ships ſent to ſupply the
<hi>Spanyard,</hi> and the <hi>Spanyard</hi> at their ſolicitation baniſht us out of
the Low Countries, and cauſed us to be interdicted <hi>Germany</hi>
alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno 1567.</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants being expelled out of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> contracted for entertainment at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> for 10
yeers: theſe 10 yeers being expired, no longer reſidence could
be had there, inaſmuch as all the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns could not injoy
us wholly to themſelves, &amp; for any one to injoy us, they thought
it unequall, and prejudiciall to the reſt.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hamburgh</hi> we remooved to <hi>Embden,</hi> and there the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115386:15"/>
parties proſecuting and renewing their clamors of a monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
Trade in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a new Edict from the Emperor <hi>Anno
1582.</hi> was thundered out againſt us. The Grave of <hi>Embden</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubled at this Edict, ſent his Chancellor Doctor <hi>Moller,</hi>
ſince <hi>Syndicus</hi> of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to the Spiers, who there defended
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade againſt the ſlanderous imputation of monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and for a while gave ſuch ſatisfaction, that the Emperours
Edict was not put in execution againſt us.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> alſo in 1595. wrote thus to the Emperour,
<hi>Monopolium de quo Hanſeatici ſubditos noſtros criminantur calumniae
potius quam verae accuſationis rationem per ſe ferre videtur.</hi> To wipe
off this calumny, we can alſo inſtance in ſeverall letters of atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
under the Common Seals of <hi>Antwerpe, Midlebourgh, Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Stadt</hi> juſtifying our faire, and juſt manner of trading: and if
ſuch legible proofs be not ſo available, wee could appeal
to all the places where ever we reſided, as ſo many viſible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
prooving fully for us, that our way of traffick hath not
been onely blameleſſe, and juſt, but alſo ſtrangely fortunate and
propitious.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Embden</hi> (for the <hi>Spanyard</hi> prevailing in <hi>Freiſland</hi> had
now made thoſe parts dangerous to us) we betook our ſelves to
<hi>Stadt,</hi> and there we continued till 1597. ſo deſirous was each of
the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns ſingly to have harboured us, if all jointly had
not envied that ſingle advantage: and being there then diſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated,
10. or 11. of the cheife Towns under the <hi>States</hi>
ſent to invite us, and made offers of large accommodations
amongſt them.</p>
            <p>We may further take notice, that <hi>Ed:</hi> the 6th. reſerved for
the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns after forfeiture of their priviledges, as ample a
freedome of commerce, as for any ſtrangers whatſoever: That
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reſtored the ſaid Towns upon ingagement that their
inordinate Trade ſhould be forborne, and this ingagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violated, She yeelded to a new Treaty about a ſit modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Intercourſes. Yet the <hi>Hans</hi> Towns did not onely
neglect to ſend Commiſſioners within the time perfixed, but at
the ſame time publiſht an Edict at <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eck,</hi> prohibiting all Trade
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for her husbands ſake was much
a freind to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> familie, and for the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> ſake to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115386:16"/>
theſe Eaſterlings, and therefore ſhe offered again another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in 1557. but this offer was rejected likewiſe with an oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
pretence, that in <hi>England</hi> they could expect no competent
Judges of their cauſe. If they durſt not truſt their cauſe to <hi>England</hi>
in Q: <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, becauſe it was a Monarchy, then they judged
diſhonorably of all Monarchies: if they made no difference of
Monarchies, but diffided in it, becauſe it was a forrein State,
where they ſhould not be their own Judges, this reflects alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all forrein States: but the truth is, they had an ill cauſe, and
ſo were diffident of all Judges, but themſelves. Howſoever Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> in 1560. offered yet a new Moderation, and this not
accepted of from the beginning of her Reign, ſhe commanded
they ſhould be uſed here as her own Subjects, and better then
any other Forreiners. This is alſo moſt certain, till She ſaw her
Subjects driven from <hi>Hamburgh</hi> in 1578. and an exaction of 7 ¼.
<hi>per centum</hi> ſet upon all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods at <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> in 1579. and
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> generally ill Treated at <hi>Dantzig, Deventer,</hi> &amp;c.
and not onely her Enemies of <hi>Spaine</hi> aſſiſted by them, but other
Princes alſo exaſperated againſt Her, She made little difference
betwixt them and her own Subjects. I hope this will be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
juſtification of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade: and now ſince it appears,
that this oppoſition was procured to us by ſtrangers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that ſought not to reduce us to a fair Trade, but to eject us
out of all Trade: me thinks it ſhould be very unworthy of any
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> to make uſe of the ſame Objections.</p>
            <p>3. Arg: That Trade which is not onely complained of by
Strangers, but Natives alſo, and in all ages has encountred with
ſo many Complainants, is likely to be a Monopolie, or ſome
private, anticipating, indirect way of commerce: but ſuch is that
of all Merchants incorporated by particular Charters, &amp;c. All
priviledged Merchants, eſpecially the Adventurers of <hi>England</hi>
(whoſe priviledges are lookt upon as ſo ample) have had
Adverſaries alwaies to wreſtle, and conteſt with both abroad, and
at home: yet this may be truly ſaid of them (as of <hi>Cato)</hi> they
have been as often abſolved, as accuſed: and their Patrons have
ever been far more honorable, then their Adverſaries. Clothiers,
Interlopers, ſome Officers of the Outports, and Court projectors
have moleſted them on the one ſide: but on the other ſide Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115386:16"/>
Kings, Privy-Councellors, and the wiſeſt of Stateſmen
have protected them, and their Cauſe; and upon a full, and due
hearing it continually appeared, that their friends had honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but their oppoſers diſhonourable ends. As for the Clothier,
He ſtomacks much that He muſt be ſo ſtrictly held to the Statute,
and may not digreſſe from the juſt weight, and meaſure, that is
there ſet for his Clothes. The Interloper takes offence, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contributing for Himſelf, He may not injoy the benefits of
that policy, which is maintained at other mens charge: that the
ſame hedges which keep other men from treſpaſſing him, ſhould
keep him from treſpaſſing other men. The Outport Officer is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
of ſome bribes, for ſtolne cuſtomes, falſe-colour'd goods,
&amp;c. by the regular ſhipping of our Merchants, and by our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
which keeps too ſevere a check upon him, and therefore his
indignation is raiſed. In the mean time the begging Courtier, He
finds it profitable for the Common-wealth, that accuſations
ſhould be favoured, and that all Complainants ſhould be heard:
for whether the Complaints be true or falſe, juſt, or unjuſt, profit
comes in to Him both wayes, and the Innocent muſt gratifie him
for his <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> as well as the nocent for his impunity. King
<hi>James anno 1613.</hi> found that his Progenitors had been deceived
in their Grants to us, and therefore ſuſpended and ſequeſtred
our Priviledges: but in <hi>anno 1616<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and 1617. after that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
had been drained of 20, or 30000 l. and <hi>Cockayns</hi> new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
(ſo obſtructive to Trade) was falne to the ground of it ſelf,
the ſame ancient Charters, and Liberties were revived with more
honourable teſtimonials then ever; the Courtiers were again
ſenſible that King <hi>James</hi> and his Progenitors had been well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
in their Grants.</p>
            <p>The Merchants Adventurers long before the Art of Endra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Cloth was introduced into <hi>England,</hi> had Priviledges abroad
from the Dukes of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and other Potentates. <hi>Edw:</hi> the 3d.
having tranſplanted the Manufacture out of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for
the better watering, and cheriſhing of it, confirmed to the ſaid
Adventurers whatſoever had been granted in the yeer 1248. by
<hi>John</hi> D: of <hi>Brabant. Hen:</hi> the 4th. ſeeing the good effects of his
grandfathers indulgence, added a more beneficiall and large
Charter of priviledges in <hi>Feb: 1406. H. 5. H. 6. Edw: 4.</hi> and <hi>R. 3.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115386:17"/>
were followers of that good example by ſeverall ratifications,
But <hi>H. 7.</hi> ſeeming to tranſcend all his Predeceſſors in policie, and
deſiring to teſtifie the ſame by his care of Merchants, proceeded
further to dilate their priviledges, and preeminences. <hi>Polydor

of <hi>Hen: 4.</hi> and <hi>Hen: 7.</hi> ſome Complaints were preferred by
Clothiers, &amp;c. againſt the Merchant Adventurers: but after
due examination, and hearing, the Company had a favourable
iſſue, and not onely obtained a fuller eſtabliſhment of former
Charters, but alſo new expreſſe clauſes againſt ſtragling Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and all other intermedlers, that might empeach, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe

thereof, the two chief of the Informers were committed to the

            <p>The like or more grievous Complaints were revived by the
Clothiers, &amp;c. in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, but what event did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

ſweetned with a Preſent for obtaining an inlargement of our
ſtint; but that Preſent now is become a Rent, and is ſucceſſively
granted by Patent; and though the Patentee be a ſingle perſon,
and cannot be ſaid properly to gratifie the Common-wealth, yet
He receives ſuch a yeerly revenue in conſideration that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
ſhall not be diſſerved: and this revenue it ſelf being
an Incumbrance upon our Draperies, and raiſed out of Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growers,
Clothiers, Merchants Retailors, and ſo charging Trade
in generall, is no leſſe then a diſſervice it ſelf to the Common-wealth.
Thus we ſee our Charters have been often times, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
wayes attempted againſt: and yet if they had not been ſo
much ſhaken, their power of reſiſtance had not been ſo experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
known; for the more the Anchor is ſtraitned, the faſter
hold it ever gains.</p>
            <p>4th. Arg: Since every man is preſumed to be moſt knowing in
that Craft wherein He has been bred up; we may preſume the
Clothiers in matters of cloth to be more knowing then the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, in the making of Cloth we deny not but there may
be more skill in the Clothier then in the Merchant: but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
here is about the uttering and vending, not about working
or preparing of cloth: and therfore, it follows not that the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Clothier does ſo much inable him to ſell cloth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in great quantities, and that to forrein Nations, as the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants:
but rather the contrary, even by the truth of the ſame
granted rule. Foraſmuch as there is not onely an Art and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in the ſale of cloth as aforeſaid, but alſo an Art more abſtraſe,
eminent, and exquiſite then that is which conſiſts in the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
way of making and dreſſing the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the State is not to conſider what is moſt beneficiall
to the Merchant, what to the Clothier <hi>ſeparatim,</hi> or whether the
benefit of the one alone, or of the other be more to be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but how they may be both favoured <hi>conjunctim,</hi> and how the
State may be moſt benefited by twiſting their intereſts both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Now then generall intereſt of the State requires that all
our <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nificia,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> commodities be raiſed in price unto other
Nations as high as may be without injuſtice, or inconvenience,
and that as many perſons and profeſſions in <hi>England</hi> as may be,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115386:20"/>
may come to be ſharers in the generall intereſt. If the queſtion
then be, whether the Merchants intereſt, or the Clothiers do
more conduce to this publick reaſon of State; ſenſe it ſelf will
preſently diſtinguiſh, that the Merchants advantage is more
compliant with the publick then the Clothiers. For the Clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ayme is to drown that gain, which the Merchants induſtry
and imployment now ſerves for, and which by his ſervice is kept
within the bounds of our own Iſland, to the maintaining of ſo
many families at home, and buſying ſo many men, and Ships
abroad, and thereby to abridge the ſame the more to Natives,
the more it is publicated unto ſtrangers. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are ſo
ſubtill as to clog our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen manufactures with great
Impoſitions, and to free their own of the ſame, that the prices
of their meaner Draperies may be raiſed up to our better ones,
or the prices of our better Draperies may be beaten down to
their meaner ones: but our ſubtiltie muſt be for the pleaſure of
our Clothiers to intercept from the Merchants all that liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
which they now earn, and by vilifying of our own Wares
to proſtitute the ſame unto Strangers: nay and by the ſame
means to expoſe themſelves to the danger of having worſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from forreiners, then now they have from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if more regard be had of the Clothier, then of the
Merchant, or State, yet conſtant experience teaches us, that this
favour and preference which the Clothier challenges herein
above the Merchant, is no reall favour, nor preference at all. For
it has been alwayes ſeen, that the ſetting at liberty of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Trade has proved more obſtructive to the Clothier then
to the Merchant, in as much as the Merchant has a more large
imployment, and can better ſubſiſt without the Clothier, then
the Clothier can without the Merchant. Moreover as it doth not
alwayes fall out, that the breaking up of the Merchants Trade
brings any preſent quickneſſe to Trade: ſo if it doth, that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
never <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s; 'tis but <hi>bonum preſens;</hi> 'tis but like cold water to
a feaveriſh man, it procures ſome ſhort refreſhment, but repays
that ſhort refreſhment within a ſhort ſpace after with a prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of ſharper extremities. So it proved it in Qu: <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
times; ſo it proved in King <hi>James</hi> his times; and ſo it is likely to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115386:21"/>
prove hereafter: wherefore if men of Mechanicall education will
onely contemplate preſent things, and neither look forward nor
backward, Stateſmen may, and muſt diſaccommodate them for
the preſent, that they may be accommodated the better for the
future.</p>
            <p>5th. Arg: That power in private men which onerates the
chief Commodities of the Realm with arbitrary impoſitions to
maintain it ſelf, is dangerous: but ſuch is the Merchants power,
&amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Companies ordinary charge is ſcarce conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in reſpect of the great ſummes we deal for; and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
charge is alwayes drawn on by ſome extraordinarie,
unavoidable inconvenience: for example, the removals of our
Reſidence from one Mart Town to another is commonly a great
burthen to us, but that burthen is undertaken to avoid ſome
greater detriment, and without it either we ſhould looſe old pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
or be made to ſubmit to ſome new exactions: or be ſome
other way aggrieved in a worſe degree. Now this is for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, and we may rather expect favour from the Kingdom,
then disfavour for ſuch ſervices.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we have a Bill now in the Houſes, prepared for His
Majeſties Aſſent, and in that Bill the future Impoſitions of our
Company are reduced to a certaintie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is an abſolute neceſſity of theſe Impoſitions, for
neither can our Trade proſper without government, nor govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be maintained without ſome charge: neither is our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
neceſſary onely for our ſelves, but alſo for the Clothier,
for as much as we are a good skreen, or bank betwixt the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
ſtranger, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clothier, and were not the prices
of our clothes kept up by us, and that partly by the charge of
our government, the Clothier would be more inſlaved to the
Stranger, then now He is.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, our Accounts are kept moſt exactly, and audited pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
and the hands through which all things paſſe are ſo
many that there can be no error, nor fraud. The Hans Towns in
<hi>Germany,</hi> anciently 72. in number, found it expedient to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate,
and maintain a common correſpondence: for which end
<hi>Lubeck</hi> of the <hi>Wendiſh, Brunſwick</hi> of the <hi>Saxon, Dantzig</hi> of the
<hi>Pruſſe,</hi> and <hi>Cullen</hi> of the <hi>Westphaliſh</hi> Towns was appointed to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115386:21"/>
chief; and the chief of all was <hi>Lubeck.</hi> Theſe Towns ſo united
for adjuſting all common, and particular intereſts obtained ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
places of Reſidence in <hi>England</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>Norway</hi> at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> at <hi>Novograde:</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> at <hi>Antwerpe:</hi> and in
each of theſe reſidencies they had their Alderman, Aſſiſtants, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries,
Treaſurers, Stewards, and other Officers, by whom
their publick affairs were adminiſtred, and Merchant Law was
exerciſed. Wherefore if the expence of their government was
more then countervailed by the benefit of their unity; and if
they were gainers by that expence, why ſhould that be impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in us which was prudent in them? or why ſhould that be
dammage to us, which was profit to them?</p>
            <p>The ordinary pleas for <hi>Freedom</hi> are thus anſwered, and the
Objections againſt Reglement in Trade removed; we will now
onely re-inforce all that has been ſaid in a word, or two.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſolid glory, and magnificence that ever dazel'd hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
eyes upon earth: was that of <hi>Solomons</hi> royall Court, at
that time, when his unparralleld wiſdome had made Silver as
ſtones in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and Cedars as vulgar as Sycamores uſed to
be in other places.</p>
            <p>Tis written of his raigne (by an inſpired Author) that it made
Silver of no account, that in one yeer there flowed into his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
666 Talents of pure Gold; that beſides all his Maſſes
of <hi>Ophir</hi> gold, he abounded with other various Treaſures, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtones, &amp;c. ſuch as the Merchants of Spices, the Governours
of the Countrie, and the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> did import. <hi>Solomon</hi> was
no warriour, nor born Lord of many Nations, nor did his <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Signiory extend it ſelfe over any large Tract in the univerſe: tis
onely written of him, that he had at Sea a Navie of <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> with
<hi>Hirams,</hi> &amp; the ſame Navie once in 3 years returned home fraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with gold, ſilver, ivory &amp;c. <hi>Hiram</hi> being hitherto ſtraitned in
the mediterranean Seas, could not gaine the <hi>Stronds</hi> of <hi>Arabia,
Perſia, India, China,</hi> &amp;c. without incompaſſing the Capes or <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and croſſing the Suns torrid line: but upon terms of partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<hi>Solomon</hi> is now able to let him in to that <hi>Southern</hi> Ocean by a
way far more compendious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> on the further ſide of the red ſea is <hi>Solomons</hi> neer Allye:
and the <hi>Edomites</hi> on this ſide are his tributary ſervants: hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115386:22"/>
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſo compoſed betwixt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Tyrians,</hi> that
it is as beneficiall for the <hi>Tyr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ans</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Jews</hi> with their skill
in Aſtronomy, and Hidrography, as for the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
with their harbours, and ſhips. Therefore the Queen of
<hi>Sheba</hi> (till her eyes were aſcertained with ſubſtances) might well
withhold her beleife from entertaining, that ſtupendious report
which was blowne about the world concerning <hi>Solomon;</hi> and
well might her ſpirit after ſinke within her, when her eyes had
once encountered with the radiant Majeſty of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whereby
the blaſts of Fames Trumpet were ſo far drowned, and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Of all <hi>Solomons</hi> ſucceſſors we read of none but <hi>Jeh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſaphat,</hi>
that ever thought of rigging new navies in <hi>Ezion-geber;</hi> and He
nevertheleſſe though he had the <hi>Edomites</hi> his homagers, and was
alſo much renowned for his wiſdome, and grandour, found this
deſigne unfeaſible, and the way to <hi>Ophir</hi> altogether unpaſſable.
This is a cleer chriſis to indicate how profound the judgment,
and how broad the comprehenſion of <hi>Solomon</hi> was, before whom
(till apoſtacie had alien'd his God from him) no difficulties
were able to ſtand: yet 'twas not ſo admirable in <hi>Solomon,</hi> that
he amaſſed ſuch incredible treaſures, as that he amaſſed them by
Peacefull arts, and not by the dint of his ſword.</p>
            <p>The tragicall exploits of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>magna, &amp; ſplendida Latrocinia,</hi> if they be compared to the feats
of Merchandize exerciſed by <hi>Solomon</hi> and the other Kings of
<hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Arabia;</hi> and yet we may doubt too, whether the ſpoile
of the Eaſt to <hi>Alexander,</hi> or of the Weſt to <hi>Caeſar</hi> were equall in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
to all <hi>Solomons</hi> Cargazoons.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the cruell<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d predations of war impoveriſh, diſpeople
and by horrid devaſtations root up, and ſo ſhrinke (as it were)
great Empires into ſmall Provinces: Merchandiſe on the other
ſide beautifies, inriches, impowers little States, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
their naturall dimenſions, that they ſeem to ſwell, as it were,
into ſpacious Empires. This martiall <hi>Hero</hi> has inſcribed upon
his Statue: that he has fought ſo many picht battells, that he
has <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>th his rapid lightnings ſpread a ſuddain conflagration
over ſo many Kingdomes; that with the loſſe of 100000 fellow
Souldiers he has purchaſed the ſlaughter of 1000000 Enemies,
at leaſt ſuch as he would needs make, and ſtile his Enemies. But
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115386:22"/>
in the mean time that gentle unbloody Prince which by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
diſperſed Carricks viſits each climate of the world onely
to plunder the Earths caverns of her Mettalls, or the Rocks of
their Diamonds, or the Deepe it ſelf of its pearles; merits to be
celebrated for the common benefactor of mankind, aſwell for the
neceſſaries which he convaies unto other Nations, as for the more
pretious wares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he recovers out of the darke abiſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and relades for the uſe of his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>Howſoever this one inſtance of <hi>Solomon</hi> (to lay aſide all other
inſtances of Princes, that have engaged themſelves in ſuch like
mercatorian negotiations) makes it plain, that the moſt Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
of all Kings that ever raigned, was the moſt ample ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer
that ever traffickt, and that he had not been ſo great a
Prince, if he had not been ſo ample a Merchant: for it is more
then probable that al the Tributes of <hi>Judea</hi> were inconſiderable
in compariſon of the returns which <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> did afford.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs follow therefore from the ſame very inſtance,
that the devouring, piraticall Trade of war is not ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or ſo fit to magnifie Princes, and make happie Nations, as
that ingenious juſt Art of commerce, which may be exerciſed
without rigor, or effuſion of blood.</p>
            <p>I ſhall then cloſe up all with this application to our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
if Merchandiſe be truly noble: if the raies which ſtreamed
ſo plentifull from <hi>Solomons</hi> diadem were more ſupplyde by traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
then by tribute; let not <hi>England</hi> totally neglect Merchants.
Let us look into the cauſes that make Trade ſo dead amongſt us
at preſent, and the fitteſt remedies that poſſibly may recover it.
In the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> we know who they are, that by cruelty have
oppreſt us; In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> we may take notice who they are, that by
ſubtilty have ſupplanted us. Here in <hi>Germany</hi> our Priviledges
are ill kept; in <hi>Holland</hi> they are worſe.</p>
            <p>In many Countries the manufactures in Silkes, and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonwools
increaſe. In High, and <hi>Low Germany</hi> the ſtore of ſheep
is increaſed, and of late the kinde of them eſpecially in <hi>Sileſia</hi> is
much improoved, hereby, and by the help of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> woolls,
nay of <hi>Engliſh</hi> woolls too, &amp; Fullers Earth daily exported againſt
Law, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Draperies are extreamely brought low.</p>
            <p>The late obſtructions and calamities of civill war in our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115386:23"/>
concurring with other annoyances done us by the Kings
Agents abroad, and millitary Commiſſions upon the Sea, have
added more to our ruine. Moreover, in other things the Times
ſeeme to looke towards a Reformation, but in matters of Trade
Order and regulation it ſelf is oppoſed, and confuſion under the
Name of Liberty is now more then ever publickly pleaded for.
The King by his Proclamation had formerly a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etted his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
grant to us, and the Parliament lately has corroborated
the Kings Proclamations, yet nothing can ſecure as againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
<hi>Interlopers.</hi> By this meanes Merchandize is brought to
a low ebbe, 20 Ships yearly in former times did attend us here in
<hi>Hamburgh,</hi> now 6. are ſufficient to ſupply us, and though our
Company be in this Conſumption; ſome other Companies waſte
away worſe then ours. All theſe miſcheifs perhaps are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable,
yet let us uſe the beſt remedies we can, and ſuch as
are moſt ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Platoes</hi> Opinion thoſe Common-wealths were moſt likely
to proſper where learned men ruled, or Rulers were learned.
Within the circle of <hi>Platoes</hi> learning let us comprehend the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of commerce. In <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes that kinde of learning
did wonderfull things towards the advancing of States; and of
late as <hi>Venice</hi> a City of Merchants has been the Bulwark of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>

Trade more then Arms, have gotten the ſword of Arbitration
