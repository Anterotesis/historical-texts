         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

may. And first are we to begin
with the Manner of the Defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
of this the wicked mans
Plot; which, we see here, is of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45217:7"/>
all the most scornful and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious.
<hi>The Lord shall laugh
him to scorn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Fable, amongst the
Poets, of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that, having
married <hi>Metis,</hi> and devouring
her, being with childe by him,
himself is at last delivered of
an armed <hi>Pallas</hi> out of his
head. And such Fables may
you observe more then a good
many men in the world to
frame, &amp; fashion, to themselvs.
They will needs dream them
into <hi>a love like</hi> omnipotency,
and then must they marry <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi>
wed themselves, to a sad,
and serious consultation, for
the succesful accomplishment
of their, what-ever, intended
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45217:7"/>
designs. Which, having gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
devoured, &amp; thorowly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
their Brains must now
be brought a bed of an armed
<hi>Pallas;</hi> of such a well-hatched
plot, as can in no wise mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> (may <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakeh</hi>
be heard to be his Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor)
shall now say, <hi>I have
counsel and strength for warre,</hi>
Esa. 36. 5. And then no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
if men now big-swolne
with pride, shall, with <hi>Edom,</hi>
in that other Prophet, <hi>Obad. 4.
Exalt themselves as eagles, and
build their nests amongst the
starres;</hi> and then say in their
hearts, as it is in the preceding
Verse, <hi>who shall bring us down
to the ground?</hi> And as those in

10. <hi>No evill shall overtake, or
prevent us.</hi> And this, for that,
as those in that other prophet,
Esa. 28. 15. <hi>We have made a
Covenant with death, and with
hell are we at an agreement;
when the overflowing scourge
shall pass through, it shall not
come nigh us; for we have made
Lyes our refuge, and under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have we hid our selves.</hi>
And, for the making of all
cock sure indeed, resolve for
for who-ever they shall finde
standing in their way, as those
Husbandmen for the Heyr,
<hi>Luke 20. 14. To kill all, that
all their inheritances may bee
theirs.</hi> Whereas yet all this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45217:8"/>

                  <p>The prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> speaking
of impenitent sinners, saith of

And the Rulers, <hi>i. e. Pilate,</hi> and

(as him of the same stampe

here in the Text) <hi>the Lord shall
have them in derision. Then
shall hee speake unto them in his
wrath, and vexe them in his sore
displeasure.</hi> Gods laughter at
the wicked hath more of an
<hi>imbittered gall,</hi> then <hi>a tickling

of displeasure hee conceiveth
against sinners, then any delight
he thereby findeth in himselfe:
Nay, it is not onely our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
word of him in this case;
but his own of himself, to those
that (for instance) wilfully
shut up their eares against his
counsel, <hi>Prov. 1. I will laugh at
your calamity, when your feare

Nay, in this <hi>Scene</hi> God shall

And therefore, as the <hi>Schoole</hi>

Thou hast Forborn him.</hi> Gods
Forbearance of a Sinner in his

                        </gap>fragable</hi> Argument of his
highly incensed Displeasure.
<hi>What, if God, willing to show his
wrath</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>and

the vessels of wrath, fitted to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?</hi>

Long-sufferance, which should

                     </gap>â€”as
upon vessels of wrath, that all

themselves to Destruction. <hi>If
a Man will not turn</hi> (saith our
prophet) <hi>then will he Bend his
Bow, and make ready his Arrows
against the Persecutours,</hi> Psal. 7.
For though a Sinner do Evil an
hundred times, and his Days be
prolonged; yet at last (the
Preacher is peremptory) it
shall not go well with him, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
8. And therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45217:26"/>
you may observe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to dance Attendance
upon wicked Miscreants a long
time, in a continued expectance
of their Conversion; and, no
lesse <hi>Passionately</hi> then <hi>Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately,</hi>
to debate the reason
of their Remissnesse in Turning
unto him; <hi>Turne yee, turne yee
from your evil ways; for why will
you Die, O yee House of Israel?</hi>
Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>Thou gavest
them place of Repentance</hi> (saith
the Wiseman of the People)
not being ignorant that they
were a Naughty Generation,
that their Malice was bred in
them; and that their Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would never bee changed.
<hi>Wisd.</hi> 12. 10. Yet, if now at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45217:26"/>
last, after his long exercised,
and so abused, patience, he can
discover no semblance of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
then doth he no longer
forbear to let flye the Arrows
of his vengeance. For whose
drawing up to the head though
hee may take some time (as
St. <hi>Hierome</hi>) to give them
fair warning that they stand
within the reach of his Arm:
yet, when he letteth loose from
the string, he striketh home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and pierceth to the very
heart. <hi>Sera tamen tacitis Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
venit pedibus;</hi> God, when
he cometh with <hi>Leaden Heels</hi>
to strike, striketh yet with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
Hands,</hi> when he commeth.
The further back a Blow is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45217:27"/>
fetched, the Deeper it wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And, when Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are furthest adjourned,
for point of Execution, they
still leave, when they come to
be executed, the most deadly
Scar behind them. He, that <hi>is of
Purer eys then to behold Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
will not suffer such Iniquity
for ever to escape, as not undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
so neither unpunished.
But, as we say of a skilful Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
that his Hand and Eye still
go together; upon the sight of
the ungodlies courses, contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiously
continued, <hi>he taketh
the matter into his own Hands,</hi>
as it is v. 16. of this Psalm. And
then <hi>woundeth</hi> to the purpose
<hi>the Hairy Scalp of such an one,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45217:27"/>
as goeth on still in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
as it is Psal. 68. 21. And
that Dreadful Day of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
the Hand of his Justice
will at last be sure to bring on,
which the Eye of his omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath foreseen, and that
perhaps for some long time, a
comming. <hi>The Lord shall laugh
him to scorn; for he hath seen
that his Day his comming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, as we say of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
that in the Sacrament, he
is, every Day, Making his

of Sweetness, and Grace; but

of Justice, and Rigour, nothing.
Nothing of him will sink with
us, but that <hi>his Mercy is great,
and that he will be pacified for
the multitude of his sins,</hi> as it

He hath the eyes of an Eagle,

us <hi>to run</hi> (as the same Apostle
adviseth <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1.) <hi>with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
and yet with cheerfulnes

him, that is <hi>the Light of the

come upon us; for that
it is but a very little while, that
wee are to expect this Light
with us. Yea for that (as it is
Jer. 6. 4.) wee cannot but
clearly discover, how far the
Day, even the Day of Grace,
is spent; and how the <hi>shadows
of the Evening,</hi> of the Evening
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45217:43"/>
of Ignorance, yea and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
too, are still every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
stretching them out more

there are but two Dayes (as

or rather a Day and a
Night, that <hi>dichotomize</hi> the
whole life of Man; the Day
of Grace; and the Day, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Night, of Vengeance. And
now, shall wee so farre turne
Gods Grace into wantonnes, as
to spend the Day assigned unto
this Grace, in worldly Lusts,
in sensual Pleasures, in the
<hi>Pressures</hi> of our poor Brethren;
whose cries, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
open our Eares, yet will
they be sure, sooner or later,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45217:44"/>
to enter into the Eares of the
Lord of Sabbath; great reason,
that, in Anguish of Spirit, we
still conceive, we hear a voice
speaking unto us, not unlike
that in the Prophet, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 7.
<hi>The morning is come upon thee,
the Day of trouble is near;</hi> at
least as that, in that other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Esay 21. The Morning
commeth, and also the Night.</hi>
Let it then be our care to walk
in a true, sincere, and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of some of our <hi>Time,</hi> and
<hi>Paines,</hi> for a Summary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
                  <p>First then Eagles (we know)
are the Kings of Birds. <hi>You
have seene</hi> (is the Lords own
word to his People) <hi>how I

19. 4. The Pitch, the Eagle

cause I finde, that the <hi>Romans,</hi>
the greatest Potentates, the

the Eagle in their Standard.
And such Eagls are the <hi>Saints.
The Prince of the Kings of the

they on the Throne; is well
worthy our best Observation:

senting unto temptations; but
know the way how to master,
and subdue them; Brideling
the Intemperance of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites;
Cooling the Heat of
their Lusts; Beating down the
Height of their Pride; Curing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45217:93"/>
the Itch of their Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Startling them from the Lees
of their Surquedry; and pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off the Disguise of their
Hypocrisie: and so, in him that
hath made them such being (as
the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37.) in all
these more then Conquerours.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Eagles have a
property of Renewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and Restoring their
youth. <hi>Making thee young, and
lusty, as an Eagle,</hi> saith the
Kingly Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 5.
Now, the way of this the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
Renovation, is, by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
variously related. St.
<hi>Augustine</hi> would have this to
be the manner: that when, by
reason of their Age, the upper
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45217:93"/>
part of their Beaks so far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow
the Nether, that they are
now no longer able to open
their Mouths; and so, for want
of Food, begin to langu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>sh;
they get them to a craggy
Rock; against which striking
off the excresc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>cy of the upper
part of their Beaks, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
their Feeding, they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
enable themselves to Feed
afresh; and so recover their
Youth, and strength. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
giveth us an Account, as of
another Malady, they labour
of; so of another Remedy, they
use for their recovery. <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantibus
occulis;</hi> when their
Eyes grow Dim (saith hee)
they drench themselves in a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45217:94"/>
cold Fountain; then expose
themselves to the heat of the
Sun beames; whereby the
Scales falling from their Eyes,
they recover their sight, and
youth. Both these wayes of
Renovation we shall do well to
to take together, and to apply
to the Saints of God. When
the Excrescency of our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Desires, and Carnal Lusts,
shall so entirely have deaded
our spiritual Appetites (that
as <hi>David</hi> in another case, <hi>Psal.</hi>
102. 4.) we forget to eat our
Bread; when the Eyes of our
understanding wee may finde
too sensibly growne so Dim,
that we, neither can, nor will,
any longer, discern those things
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45217:94"/>
that belong to our peace; lest,
seeing with our Eyes, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with our Ears; we should
be converted, and Healed, as it
is <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 10. our parts it shall
be to betake us unto the Rock,
Christ (for so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. I
finde him expresly stiled) to
put off all manner Dulness,
and Deadness, of the <hi>Old Man,</hi>
which is corrupt according to
the Deceitful Lusts: as it is
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22. to bathe our
selves thorowly in the Laver of
unfeigned Repentance; and
then fixe the Eys of them stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
upon the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that Ariseth with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in his Wings, as it is <hi>Mal.</hi>
4. 2. <hi>Looking unto</hi> Jesus
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45217:95"/>
(saith the above praised Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
<hi>the Author, and Finisher,

so become Renewed in the Spirit
of our Minds,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23.</p>
                  <p>Lastly (not to stretch the
strings of the Analogy so far,
as to endanger the cracking
them) Eagles (as in part you
have already had intimated)
Flye a great heighth from the
earth; a pitch above all other
Birds. Yea, as <hi>Araun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>

to give as a King unto the
King, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 23. these
Kings of Birds get them up

and unmoved, contemplation
of whose Rayes they try the

Legitimation of their young.
And this is that, which Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters

not onely Christ the Sun

the woman, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 1.) they
are clothed with him; tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Moone</hi> in the meane
time, all earthly things, as the

whether wee bee the Genuine
Sons of God, or no. So that
