            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WELL met, Neighbour, What in <hi>Querpo?</hi> I
cannot but admire how well those <hi>Caps</hi> and
that pretty <hi>Apes-cloak</hi> becomes you, upon
my Reputation, I cannot but look on you,
you'r so spruce to day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cappo-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why? what ail you to stare so? did
you never see one in such a Dress before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>No truly, not very often: For that Dress was
out of fashion (I thank God) before I was capable of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cappo-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>I should thank God that it was as much
in fashion as ever it was. For I cannot but honour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
remains of those glorious times, when the Saints enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Priviledges to the height; (<hi>i. e.) When they bound
their Kings in chains, and their Nobles in Fetters of Iron,</hi>
even according to the very Letter: when we kept <hi>Sabbaths</hi>
to the Lord, but no <hi>Holy-Days:</hi> and when our holy <hi>Fasts
and Prayers</hi> were always answered with the next days <hi>Feast
upon the good things of the Wicked,</hi> which the Lord was pleased
to send us, by those precious wayes and methods of his own
chusing, (as one of our Brethren did then well call them)
<hi>viz.</hi> those which the Prophane call <hi>Sequestration, Confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Plundering,</hi> and <hi>Decimation.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I cannot but think that a Gown and
Cassock, and a Canonical-Girdle, is a much more grave, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn,
decent, and honourable Habit for a Clergy-man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cappo-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot help your thoughts, but to tell
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48598:3"/>
you the truth (which is not our common method) I have
not heartily loved <hi>Gowns, &amp;c.</hi> since Dr. <hi>I. O.</hi> then Vice-chancellor
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> did so zealously and learnedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame
against them, as <hi>rags of Popery.</hi> Oh, that precious
man, whose very name is enough to sanctifie the Prophane
Title of <hi>Dean!</hi> Had you but seen with what earnestness he
<hi>paid off the Whore of Babylon,</hi> how he laid himself forth with
all his might upon her, and stript her from all her rags, you
could not but have been willing, not only to have put off
your <hi>Gown,</hi> but, <hi>your Breeches too,</hi> rather than have complied
with those <hi>Sons of that Whore, the Papists,</hi> in any Garment
that they wear. Oh, I can never forget that most precious
Speech as long as I have a day to live!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, Neighbour, hold. Don't be too much
transported with the remembrance of that glorious Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
How can any man but be abundantly satisfied
with such an eloquent Oration, <hi>that the Gown, &amp;c. is the
mark of the Beast?</hi> But you seem not only to have a
dislike to the <hi>Gown</hi> in general, but to the <hi>Crape-Gown</hi>
in particular. Now several of those Gentlemen you have
a fling at in your Book (I believe) never wore a Crape-Gown
in all their Lives; and I never read that <hi>Crape-Gowns</hi>
were the particular fashion amongst Papists; and
therefore you would do very well, either to get the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctor to make another Speech, (which if you can get
him to be <hi>Dean of Christ-Church</hi> again, I doubt not but he
will readily do) particularly against <hi>Crape-Gowns;</hi> or else
to give us in short your particular Reasons against them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why—now I think on't—It hath always
been the privilege of our Party, to do things for which we
can give no reason. Ask me for Reason? Don't you know
that we have nothing to do with Reason, nor ever had, nor
ever will have? therefore reason me no more reason, for if
you do, I'll be gone.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48598:3"/>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Not so hasty, Neighbour, stay a little, I pray
you. I beg your Pardon, that I was not so well acquainted
with the priviledges of you <hi>Army-Saints, and your Chaplains;</hi>
and do assure you, that it was not in any derogation to your
dear Priviledges, but for my own satisfaction, that I gave
you this trouble.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, if it be for your own Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
do you see, I shall give you some satisfaction in this
weighty matter.</p>
               <p>Why—first, your <hi>Crape-Gown</hi> is too light, and that (you
know) though it may do well enough for a Sister, yet is
not to be endured in a substantial-grave-brother. For (mark
ye me) Lightness and Gravity do no more agree than Light
and Darkness.</p>
               <p>Then, Secondly, your <hi>Crape-Gown</hi> may be seen thorough;
and of all things in the world, we Saints hate the Wicked
should see thorough us: for as it is well hinted, <hi>Crape-Gown.
part. 2. p.</hi> 26. since neither the Piety of <hi>David,</hi> nor the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> could keep them from falling so fouly as
they did with Women, how do we know but it may be
any of our Cases, and that we may not come off so sound
as they did? Now then, what a great Folly, yea, I say,
what a Madness is it for us to wear such a Garment through
which our Imperfections may be utterly laid open to the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Saints, and so our Persons be rejected as well as our
precious Doctrines? yea, I say, our precious Persons be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected!
would not this be a very great madness—yea—and
no small folly?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The main cause why <hi>our Sober party</hi> do not love
<hi>Crape-Gowns,</hi> may be this, that to wear them would be an
intrenchment upon our Christian Liberty; for you know
the Fashion came up in obedience to the late Act for the
Improvement of Woollen-Manufactures, there being no other
Woollen-stuff so cool and fit for Summer as Crape. But
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48598:4"/>
you know we are better taught by our elder Brethren, <hi>Knox</hi>
and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> as well as by our Fathers, the Pope, the
Cardinals, and all the Jesuits, than to obey Civil Magistrates
in Ecclesiastical Causes. No, No, we understand the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Liberty better than so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well said, now I thank you that you deal so
plainly with me; for, I well perceive, there the Shooe pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
with you: you have plainly discovered your self (<hi>p. 4.
Crape-grown, part</hi> 2.) where in excuse for the Loyal preaching
of the <hi>Levites,</hi> (as you please, out of your abundant Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Kindness, to call the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
you make <hi>Priest-Love</hi> say, <hi>The Scripture commands
Obedience to the Government, they are commanded to preach
the Scripture, therefore they are commanded to preach Obedience
to the Government;</hi> to which you answer, <hi>That is to say, in
Civil Affairs they are to preach general Obedience to the Laws
and Government.</hi> Now what (I pray you) doth this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
but that in Ecclesiastical Affairs they ought not to
preach Obedience to the Laws and Government? But, in
the name of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Ghost, why not as well in Ecclesiastical
Affairs as in Civil? Who but the Jesuits taught you this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
or those that learn'd it from them? Is there any
such distinction in the Writings of the Apostles? Is there not
such a Chain of all Affairs, as that there can scarcely be any
matter but may in some sort or another be Ecclesiastical as
well as Civil? So that either Obedience must be preached
to Civil Magistrates in all matters, <hi>salva Conscientia,</hi> or else in
none at all. Are not all Laws that are enacted by the Civil
Power rightly call'd Civil Laws? Why then are not those
Acts of Parliament which command all men to come to their
own Parish-Church to worship God, and to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
there in such decent and orderly manner as our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
prescribes, which is established by Act of Parliament, as
well Civil Laws, and consequently, as much to be obeyed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48598:4"/>
as any other? Why are not Laws for the security of our
Religion as readily to be obeyed as those which are made
for the security of our Property, and as fully to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
There cannot certainly be any reason of difference to
any man who does not set a much higher value upon his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
than upon his Religion. Nay, have we not seen that
your dear Brethren of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the notion
of Ecclesiastical Causes, brought in all manner of Affairs of
State, and by the Decrees of their National Synods, controll'd
all the Laws of their Natural Sovereign; and proceeded so
far, till at length, raising Horse and Arms, to fight against
his Majesty, was the great Kirk-matter which they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to compleat?</p>

               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Had I not a very great command of my
self, thorough mercy, I should not have the Patience to hear
one word more from you, or to stay one Minute longer in
your Company.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why Neighbour? What's the matter? How
have I hurt you? Have you some old Sore about you which
I touched a little too hard? I assure you, Neighbour, it was
unawares if I did, and therefore I pray you be a little paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Unawares? (say you) Why you'r always
rubbing our old Sores. How do you think they can ever
heal if you will be always picking and scratching of them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Corrosives are sometimes necessary, especially
where the Sores are closed up with dead or proud Flesh.
When I see you sensible of your old Faults, and endeavour
to amend them, I can be very willing to give my self the
quiet as not to disturb my Neighbours: but, when in your
Scriblings you will be insinuating the same Principles that
have been the Authors of so much War and Blood-shed
amongst us, I cannot help it if you hear of the old Practises
that followed from them.</p>

would not be accounted a Rebel, but would confirm it to his
Prince, with his Heart, his Hand, and his Purse:</hi> and what
he means by it, you have in the former words, <hi>viz. An obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Commands, enjoyn'd by the politick Constitution and
Frame of Government;</hi> and this he proves most learnedly,
from the derivation of the word <hi>Loyalty</hi> from <hi>Lex.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>But all this, I doubt, is but one, and the fairest
side of the Party, which he would have all men to see.—Thus
far I believe him, That <hi>there is no Dissenter in</hi> England <hi>that
would be accounted a Rebel;</hi> for, they love a Successful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
which they can soon call by the Name of the <hi>Good
Old-Cause; the Cause of God, which he hath so manifestly, even
against all Opposition, declared himself to own, by casting down
the strong holds of all the Powers on Earth;</hi> as they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
without so much as ever wiping their Mouths after it,
<hi>canted</hi> oftentimes in their Sermons before the two Houses,
and the Army. And let me deal freely with you, neighbour
<hi>Cap-cloak,</hi> How can we believe those Mens bare Words
whom no Oaths can hold? A <hi>Shaft.-Association</hi> possibly might
hold them; but, if that will not, I know nothing but an
<hi>Halter</hi> that can: Now, that this is the truth of the Business,
look a little farther, and you will plainly see; for after, in
the Name of all the Dissenters, he hath promised to <hi>confirm
an Obedience to Commands enjoyn'd by the politick Constitution
and Frame of Government, with Heart, Hand, and Purse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Penalty of being accounted Rebels;</hi> yet immediately
he destroys his own very Principle of Loyalty by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to subvert all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: for, saith
he, (<hi>lin. 13. ibid.</hi>) this <hi>being the chief Satisfaction to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate, it seems hard that Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48598:5"/>
should make such an heavy clutter for her far less inconsiderable
mite of a Coercive Power.</hi> Now Neighbour put on one Cap more,
(I beseech you) that is, your Considering-Cap, and tell me
where, according to your own Notion of Loyalty, we shall
find any such thing in your Party, who in your Obedience
to the Civil Magistrate take no notice of Ecclesiastical Laws?
For, is not the settled Religion of the Nation, the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
cause, one main part of the <hi>politick Constitutions of our
Nation?</hi> Are not the <hi>Canons</hi> of our Church, and our <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> ratified, <hi>commanded, and enjoyn'd by the
politick constitution and frame of the Government of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
(i. e.) even by Parliaments themselves, <hi>as well as any
other Laws whatsoever?</hi> Confirm then your Loyalty to your
Prince, by your hearty obedience to his Ecclesiastical Laws,
or else by your own Concession I must conclude, that you'r
of that number of Dissenters <hi>who would be accounted Rebels;</hi>
and I must needs say, that you'r the first of them that ever I
met withal: for, though most of them (I have too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe) would, if their Brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> last Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
had prosper'd, <hi>have been Rebels,</hi> yet they have now
generally more Wit, than to desire to be accounted so.</p>

               <p>Nay, Nay, good Neighbour, not so bitter
and cholerick (I beseech you) against the <hi>Sober People of
God</hi> in our Land: your Passion hath so far transported you
that you have not Patience to read on; for if you had, you
would find that they do <hi>acknowledge the Tithes of Vnity,
Love, and Charity to the Church of</hi> England.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Aye, say you so? a blind man would be glad to
see it. Where do we see in their Actions any such Tythe
paid? No, No, they cannot so much as spare their <hi>Mint,
Cummin, Annis,</hi> to their lawful Ministers, because they reserve
all to be paid to those of their own way, not of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> But however, methinks that a <hi>great Tythe of
Obedience,</hi> as well as the <hi>small Tythes of Love and Charity,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48598:6"/>
should be due from them to our Church, which was mainly
founded by the first and best Martyrs for the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>This is acknowledged too in the same
Page; only he tells you, they cannot come to Church to pay
it, <hi>because your Pulpits are like so many Beacons, where ye
raise such a Flame that they are afraid of the Country's coming
in upon them.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why? What's the matter with them? They
are not afraid of hanging, are they? They know well
enough they need not fear that, for their old Crimes are
pardoned, which they cannot but know, did too well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it; for greater than they were cannot easily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
and yet I am very confident, they might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
if they would do it quietly and orderly, with most of
the Churches in or near <hi>London,</hi> and never so much as be
put in mind of any of them, if their own guilty Consciences
did not accuse them. But a bad Excuse (you know Neighbour)
is better than none at all; for one would think, if they
were truly penitent for their Faults, they could not be so
enraged by their being told of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But further, you'r told</hi> (pag. 7. ibid.) <hi>that
they will conform, and that one Mr.</hi> Read hath led the way;
<hi>and that he tells you himself,</hi> That he had advised with his
Brethren of the Ministry, who did acknowledge the lawfulness
of using the Liturgy; <hi>and that his Principles are these,</hi> That
Obedience to the Magistrate, in things lawful, is a Duty, that
a Form of Prayer is lawful, and that Communion in such Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
is lawful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I should be glad to see these Principles put in
practise by him and his Brethren the Ministers. When I see
they come to their Parish-Churches, as the Law requires, and
do joyn in the Liturgy of our Church, and in all the Acts
of Communion with her, then I shall have some Reason to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48598:6"/>
think they have such Principles: but, whilst they go on to
make Divisions amongst us, to set up Conventicles against
our Churches, and Altar against Altar amongst us, I cannot
help it, if (notwithstanding all the pretences of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)
I still believe them to be the most senseless, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and perverse Schismaticks that ever the World knew:
for, I must needs tell you, these mere promises of theirs will
never obtain any Credit amongst us, that know how frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have fall'n off from much higher Obligations; and
how much further than barely saying and acknowledging
the lawfulness of Communion with our Church, some of
them have proceeded, and yet have continued in their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
As for instance, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Cure of Church-Divisions,</hi>
hath (by such Arguments as neither he, nor any
Dissenter, can ever fully answer) proved, not only that it is
lawful, but a Duty to unite with our Church; and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of practising accordingly, he hath ever since kept up a
Schismatical Conventicle, nay, hath made it his business to
undermine, not only the Reputation of our most eminent
Church-men, but the very Foundation of our Church it self;
witness <hi>his Pamphlet against Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet<hi>'s Sermon,</hi> and
his whole bundle of Lies in his <hi>History of Episcopacy.</hi> I might
also here add your Lay-Brethren, who (for the sake of an
Office by which they may serve their Cause and Party) stick
not at the highest Acts of Conformity, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the receiving
the Sacrament according to the established Rites of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and yet as soon as ever they have done,
run away from our Communion with as much seeming-Zeal
as though we were mere Pagans, and worshipped the Devil
in our Churches: but this is so well known to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practise, that I need not further mention it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>If their Words and Promises will not do,
if you read on to <hi>pag.</hi> 10. you may find full and satisfactory
Arguments that may convince you that they are real Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
to the Laws of both Church and State.</p>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Aye marry Sir, that would be Logick indeed!
the Philosopher that endeavoured (in spight of his own eyes)
to prove that <hi>Snow was black;</hi> or he that would prove <hi>there
could be no such thing as motion,</hi> when his Tongue wagg'd all
the while, (I think) had an easie Task in comparison of this.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, the Wit of man is much; and
though your Prejudices may be great, possibly if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Arguments, they may remove them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Oh! by all means let us hear them. Consider
them, say you; I will put on twice as many Caps as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Night-cap-Brother <hi>T. Goodwin</hi> ever wore, but I will
duely consider them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>First then, as to the Civil Law. His two
first Arguments (<hi>pag,</hi> 7.) clearly prove that the Law-makers
did never intend those Penalties against us that are Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but against Seditious Persons: for the Penalty is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon <hi>the Supposition that an Insurrection may be hatch'd
at such Meetings; but no such thing was done.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>The Intention of our Law-makers in that very
Act was grounded upon the sense of what had been done in
the late times, when our Conventicles had preach'd the best
of Kings out of his Throne and Life, and they well knew
that what hath been done may be done again: to prevent
which, they thought it necessary to hinder all such men, that
under the cloak of Religion hide their Faction, from all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of doing the same thing over again: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though it was possible to be true that none of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
themselves have any factious Designs, Yet because the
Papists, even the worst of them, the Jesuits, have disguised
themselves under the shew of peaceable Dissenters (as Dr. <hi>Oats</hi>
tells us, that twelve of them were particularly sent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to preach, in the shape of Presbyterians, all manner of
Sedition) they that give such Seditious Preachers all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
by their separate Meetings to raise Insurrections
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48598:7"/>
amongst us, do transgress the very intention of the Law, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
innocent they may be in their own designs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man,</speaker>
               <p>What, then you make no difference betwixt
our Dissenters and the Papists themselves?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>The Law (I think) makes none: For by our
Laws, all that do not come to their Parish-Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
conform to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> are called <hi>RECVSANTS;</hi> whether they are
Papists, Brownists, Presbyterians, Anabaptists, or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
(though perhaps some one particular Law may make
a difference) the Law in general makes no distinction amongst
them. For the Liturgy of our Church being establish'd by
the Laws of our Land (as is plain by the Act of Uniformity)
whosoever doth not conform to it, is therefore guilty of the
breach of the Law, let his opinion in Religion be what it
will; and of the design of the Law too: which is not only
to prevent Seditions, but to establish for ever an Uniformity
in our Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>But you do not take notice what is too
truly said <hi>(p. 7. line 28.) that this Law was obtain'd by some
part of the Clergy for their own advantage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Take you Dissenters without an excuse for
your selves, and reflections upon others, and hang you. But
it is no matter whether there is any sense or reason in them
or no, it is all one, if they be but fairly insinuated, <hi>the mobile,</hi>
or at least some of them, will believe them, and that is all
that you care for. For was there ever so senseless a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon all our Laws as this is? Are not Bills generally first
pass'd in the House of Commons? I pray you how many of
the Clergy are in that House? What, is the <hi>Speaker's Chaplain</hi>
alone able to over-rule <hi>the wisdom of our whole Nation,</hi> as
sometimes you please to call the Members of that House? As
for the House of Lords, there are but 26 of the Clergy in it,
and is it not very strange they should out-vote all the rest?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48598:8"/>
or that by their Interest they should over-power them? It
seems the case is altered since they were called <hi>the dead weight</hi>
of that most Honourable House, and thought to signifie little
or nothing in it. I remember a worthy Clerk told me once,
that a Speaker amongst the <hi>Quakers</hi> (whom he vilely suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be a <hi>Papist</hi>) made it his main Argument against his
payment of Tythes, that <hi>the Laws which enjoyned them, were
made by the Papists and the Clergy.</hi> And indeed the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lies equally against all our ancient Laws; so that if this
be a satisfactory excuse, no man can have any right to any
thing he possesses by vertue of any ancient Law in <hi>England;</hi>
For the same objection may be made against them all. Is it
for this reason that some of you Dissenters, will not take the
Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> nor take any notice of the
Acts for the observation of the <hi>Thirtieth</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> or <hi>29th.</hi>
of <hi>May?</hi> Are not they most admirable Subjects, and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
obedient to our Civil Power, and great Lovers of the
King, who refuse to acknowledge his Power, and to swear fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to him, or so much as to bewail the murder of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or to praise God for his happy return? If these are not
excellent Subjects, I know not where you'l find any such,
unless amongst the <hi>Banditi,</hi> or the <hi>Wild Arabians.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Not so fast (I beseech you) Let me put in
a word or two to vindicate my dear Brethren, who are (for
all your aspersions) precious in the sight of God and Man.
As for those who refuse to take the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance, I utterly disown them: But as for the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>thirtieth</hi> of <hi>Ianuary, Why should they bewail that
fact in which they had no hand?</hi> This would be tacitly to
confess themselves guilty of it. And as to the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>May,
Is it not enough for them who think they have received benefit
by it, to express their joy and thankfulness for it? We lost our
Lands and Livings by it, and what reason have we to keep a
thanksgiving for it?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48598:8"/>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>If you disown the first sort, why do you own
such Principles as may justifie them? for were not the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
as much active in making those Laws that enjoyn those
Oaths as any other? As for the question, <hi>Why should they</hi>
[the Dissenters] <hi>bewail that fact in which they had no hand?</hi>
I shall return you these few Queries. Had you Dissenters
attain'd to an absolute perfection? had you no sins that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest of the sins of the Nation might combine to
pull down God's wrath upon us, and to render us odious
to all Nations by the most barbarous murder of the best of
Princes? Was it the Cavalier, or the Army-Saint, that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
that Villany? Was it the Church-man that fought for
the King, or the Phanatick that fought against him, that were
guilty of it? Was it the Jew or Christian that killed our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
Was <hi>Peter</hi> that fought for him, or <hi>Iudas</hi> that betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him guilty of his bloud? I suppose for the same reason
you joyn with the <hi>Iews,</hi> in not observing any day in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of our Saviour's Crucifixion, because you believe that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they nor you were any ways guilty of it. For I am sure
you may as well believe this, as that you were no ways guilty
of the murder of our Royal Martyr. As for the Query in
your Vindication, for not observing the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> though
I believe you will be ashamed to own it, yet I assure you
(upon the reputation of a Gentleman) that I have heard that
reason given by a well-wisher of your brethren, and that I
do really believe never a Dissenter of you all can give a truer
or better reason for that ingrateful neglect. Did you not
then by the Kings great clemency receive your Lives, which
were justly forfeited to the Laws? and do not too many of
you enjoy great Estates which were other Mens Rights? and
is not all this worth I thank you to God and the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those infinite publick Mercies the whole Nation recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereby?</p>

               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>You never know when to have done rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
it is so natural to you. Come, come, if you would lay
aside passion, you would find the Men you speak off to be
good Men, and therefore (as the second Argument tells you,
<hi>pag. 7. ibid.</hi>) since <hi>it was never yet known in the world that
ever any Civil Magistrate made a Law with an intent to punish
any good man, therefore this Law was never intended by the
Supreme Power against the Dissenters. For that they are good
men is fully proved out of the Psalmist,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 8.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Here is a demonstration for you indeed! such
an one that will hold eternally, like a rope of Sand. For
first, Did you never hear of certain Heathen Emperours that
made Laws to punish, even with the severest Penalties and
greatest tortures, all the Professors of Christianity? Or <hi>2dly,</hi>
Can you believe that all those Primitive <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
were not as good Men as our Dissenters? And lastly,
Do you not know that Men may be very good in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of some Duties, that yet neglect the great duties of
peace and subjection, and may be very wicked as to many
other; nay, that Men may be very strict in Sobriety and
seeming obedience to the Laws of God, out of design to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on some gain or profit to themselves? Have you not heard
of the Pharisees, <hi>who made long prayers to devour Widows
houses;</hi> or of a sort of People whose <hi>gain</hi> is their <hi>godliness?</hi>
Was you never acquainted with a sort of <hi>good, godly and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
people,</hi> who preached up <hi>murder, sacriledge</hi> and <hi>rebellion,
and justified in their Pulpits that most execrable crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against the life of our late martyred Sovereign?</hi> These
might be in other matters (as to all appearance) very good
Men, and yet (had there not been an Act of Indemnity)
they do well deserve the Gallows? Do you not know that
all that will endeavour the destruction of a Church or State
by drawing in the People to their party, are necessitated to
appear as the best of Men, to carry on even the worst of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48598:9"/>
Hath not the <hi>Devil</hi> himself <hi>been transform'd into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of Light;</hi> and do not his Agents always imitate him? And
therefore such as these, who under the Shew of Goodness
carry on ill Designs (not only because their false Pretences
make even Religion it self become contemptible, and real
Goodness to be thought nothing but Hypocrisie; but also,
because where their pretences of Goodness are not seen

most dangerous to the Government) ought to be most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely

for your Cry of Persecution, this is another Help at a dead
Lift, but to deal plainly with you, there is nothing I more
hate than the Thoughts of Blood; and therefore I so much

(ibid. infra) The Law enjoyns the Exercise of Religion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which contains
no more than only Truth; but the Dissenters do speak Truth;

according to the Liturgy, <hi>vid. &amp; p. 9. ibid.</hi>

               <p>See now, what a parcel of Fools our <hi>Logicians</hi>

or <hi>Herebrood</hi>'s <hi>Comments,</hi> I will give him leave to prove
me an Horse, and will be bound to believe it when he hath
done. I will give you the same Argument in another case,
and do you judge whether it holds true or no. The Law
commands a Witness in any Cause, <hi>To speak the Truth, the
whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth.</hi> Now supposing the
Case be concerning Brother <hi>Bull</hi>'s being taken napping with
a small Girl in a Bawdy-house, and the Witness upon his
Oath, shall answer, by telling a Story of the Victories of
the Late Usurper, though perhaps the Story may be nothing
but the Truth; yet do you think that he hath spoke what
his Oath bound him to, and that he swears that the said
the Person was so taken, because this also is nothing but the
Truth?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Pish, I hate these <hi>Similies,</hi> they never run

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>The Argument is (indeed) so ridiculous,
that I cannot find in my Heart to be serious in confuting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48598:10"/>
it; but however for your satisfaction, I will endeavor it in
as few words as possibly I can. As to the first Proposition,
<hi>viz. The Law enjoyns the Exercise of Religion, according to the
Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which contains no more than
what is Truth.</hi> I readily acknowledge it, and am glad to
hear that our Dissenters do so too: For then I can see no
reason why they should dissent from that which <hi>contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Truth.</hi> But the Assumption, <hi>viz. That the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
do speak Truth,</hi> &amp;c. is a meer Falsity, or else a meer
Fallacy: For if they mean that they preach nothing else
but the same Truth contain'd in our Liturgy, and that they
practise according to all those Rules which you acknowledge
to be Truth prescribed in it; then you know it is utterly
false. But if they mean, that the Doctrines they preach are
true, if we should allow it (which is impossible where there
are so many Doctrines preach'd, as amongst our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Sects of Dissenters) this makes a new Term in the
latter, from that which was in the former Proposition; and
so concludes nothing at all, but that he that argues at that
rate, either knows not how to make an Argument, or else
that he hath a mind to deceive, as well knowing his Cause
cannot be defended any other ways: But this is so dull
stuff that I am weary of it, and am afraid I shall be thought
a meer Fool for my pains, for endeavoring a serious Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of so frivolous an Argument. I pray you therefore
give me leave (for Recreation-sake) to tell you a Story
which is not absolutely impertinent to this matter.</p>

               <p>The Commonwealth of Birds, to redress some
Grievances, call'd a Parliament, where, after they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their Places that were Representatives, and Elected
<hi>nemine contradicente</hi> the Parrot for their Speaker, because
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48598:11"/>
of its excellent Qualifications of calling Names, and Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
others Voices: All the Members were called over, and
made their personal Appearance before Mr. <hi>Speaker.</hi> Amongst
the rest appears a round fac'd Animal, that look'd as big
us a Burgess, commonly call'd an Owl. All the rest of the
Birds were amazed very much, as not being acquainted
with any such Corporation that could be represented by it.
Resolving therefore themselves into a Committee of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
consisting of the whole House, they began to debate
the Matter before the Chair-Bird, who was a Creature of
the same kind with Mr. <hi>Speaker.</hi> The Swallow, and the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
chatter'd to this purpose, that they had flown far and
near, but never saw any such Creature amongst the Birds.
The Jay, the Goose, and the Jack-daw being also Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Members of that Committee, concurring with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
the pretty King in the Chair was presently for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the House of such an uncouth Member, and began to
cry <hi>Walk Knave Walk:</hi> Whereupon the Owl thinking it
hard Measure, before he was well seen, or at all heard to
be ejected, began to set a good Face of the Business; and
raising his Ruff to shew its Feather, and stretching out its
Neck, to exalt its Voice, look'd so frightfully, and made
so hideous, loud, and screeching a Noise, that all the Birds
were so terrified, that they presently left all their Places,
and the poor <hi>Parochete</hi> fell out of the Chair in a Swoon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
its Note from <hi>Walk Knave,</hi> to <hi>poor Pall,</hi> and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up in a very sad Condition; and so all the Debates
ended, and the whole Assembly dissolved themselves.</p>

self; though I must confess I have no great Veneration for
Commonwealth-Parliaments; but the reason why I told
you this Story, is this, to let you see how you deal with us
of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> You set up a <hi>Creature of all Face
and Feather,</hi> to make an hideous Noise against us, who still
pretends to be a Member of our Church; as thinking us
so much to hate <hi>meer idle Drollery, Impudence and Noise,</hi>
that we will rather suffer him to say what he pleaseth,
though to the utter Dissolution of the Church, than trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves with such an Animal: For certainly no man
would have made such an Argument as this, who ever
imagined that it should be considered by any Person that
had Common Sence, unless he thought he could <hi>Out-face</hi>
any thing, even all Sence and Reason.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This is soon said, and any thing may be
soon misrepresented; but is it not clearly apparent</hi> That the
Dissenters preach Divine Truth, <hi>by that Argument,</hi> (p. 9. post
med.) <hi>viz.</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth Divine Truth.
The Dissenters teach the same Doctrine with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
therefore the Dissenters teach Divine Truth: <hi>How can
any Son of the Church deny this, unless he will deny that
the Church of</hi> England <hi>teacheth Divine Truth?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>We of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do sincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that our Church teacheth Divine Truth; and are
well pleased to hear you Dissenters to confess the same thing:
For by acknowledging this you condemn your selves: For
with what Face can you dissent from the Divine Truth?
The next Proposition, <hi>viz. That the Dissenters preach the
same Doctrine with the Church of</hi> England we cannot but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
deny: For that we think it absolutely impossible
to be true: For (First) how can the Dissenters preach the
same Doctrine with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when there is
none of them but do deny some of her very Articles? (Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly)
When few or none of them do think themselves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48598:12"/>
bound to obey scarcely any of her Canons. (Thirdly,)
When few or none of them will declare their Assent and
Consent to her Liturgy. (Fourthly) When many of the
Sects of them (not to say all) do differ continually in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Discipline from one another: And Lastly, when
all of them agree in nothing but in their Opposition to the
Church of <hi>England?</hi> He therefore that is not <hi>given over to
believe a Lye,</hi> can never make any true Conclusion from so
false an Assumption.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>You think now you have done the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Argument I warrant you; but you will find
your self much mistaken, if you consider even the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all that are moderate amongst your selves: For (as
you may read it <hi>p. 9. circ. fin.</hi>) even they <hi>confess, that as to
those who purely and out of Conscience refuse to conform, their
Circumstances are hard.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Very well; and what if they be hard? Is it not
much harder that our Church and State should be endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by such as design their Destruction, because some few
amongst them may be under Mistakes, and so may act out
of Principles of pure Conscience? Suppose some Persons,
because the Apostle saith, <hi>He that provides not for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
hath denyed the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they have no other way to provide for their Family
but by Stealing, should therefore List themselves for High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men,
and not only put this Opinion into Practise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but endeavor to persuade all other Men into the
same. It might seem hard, that men under such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
should be hang'd; but yet because there can be no
Property maintain'd without it, it is necessary that it should
be done, let such mens Circumstances be never so hard:
The Law cannot take notice of the Consciences of Men,
but of their Actions; and since there is no certain Method
of discerning the Conscientious Fools from the malicious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48598:12"/>
Knaves, there can be no difference as to their Legal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
unless all such as act contrary to the Law, should
go Scot-free; because the Circumstances of some few of
them may be hard. But (I pray) how are the Dislenters
Circumstances so hard upon the most Conscientious of them?
May they not have their Consciences better inform'd if they
will? Do they not constantly refuse the Lawful Means of
their right Information? Nay, hath not the Law taken
Care to indulge to their tender Consciences, by allowing
them to serve God according to their own Consciences, not
only with their whole Families, but with Five more Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?
If this will not satisfie them without making of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and drawing in the Multitude, as though they were
mustering their Forces against the Government, why should
not our Magistrates take Care of the Publick, by duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the Laws upon them?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>See further</hi> (ibid. lin. ult. &amp; p 10.) <hi>and you
cannot but acknowledge it very hard,</hi> That of all the Penal
Statutes, these only against the Dissenters, and not those against
the Crying Sins of the Nation should be so loudly awakened to their
Offices.</p>

               <p>This is insinuated like your self; by wiping
off the Dirt from your own Party, where it naturally sticks,
to throw it upon your Governors. Is this all the Thanks
they have for their Indulgence to you for so many Years,
after so many Affronts, and so constant Provocations, still
to be casting Dirt in their Faces? Who would break their
Oaths any longer, to spare such an ungrateful sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as these are? Do you not belye your own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by this Insinuation? For what Crimes are there that are
not punished according to the Laws of the Land, when
they are duly proceeded against? I am confident you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
instance in one of our Magistrates that ever neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Duty in this kind, unless to those of the Dissenting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48598:13"/>
Party. But besides, do you not know, that he that acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Laws, out of pretence of Conscience, gains Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Applause, and gathers Numbers of well-meaning Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be his Followers: Whereas another man that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of known Crimes, for which he hath no pretence (though
perhaps he might have for any thing as much Excuse as our
Dissenters have for their Divisions) does but bring Shame
and Odium upon himself, and makes all good Men afraid of
his Company? Now the business of the Magistrate is mainly
to take notice of Crimes, not so much according to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
considered in themselves, but according to their ill influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the Publick; now then, since no Crimes can have
so bad an influence upon Church and State, as Schism and
Faction; why is it so hard that the Laws against these should
be more vigorously executed, than against any other sort of
sins?</p>

               <p>Why, say you? Read on, read on (<hi>pag.</hi> 10.
<hi>ibid.</hi>) and you'll find that this renders our Magistrates more
cruel than the <hi>Turk</hi> himself; For the <hi>Turk</hi> himself, <hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
height of his Tyranny, and Popular reverence of his</hi> Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metisme,
<hi>yet lets the disconsolate</hi> Greeks <hi>have the free exercise

               <p>This is (as you think) home-put indeed: but
I pray do but consider how miserably poor he keeps them;
how contemptible he renders them to all his <hi>Mahumetans?</hi>
what pitiful Cells rather than Churches they are glad to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in, what Tributes he lays upon them for their Religion,
how he hath rob'd them of all means of Learning; so that as
Mr. <hi>Ricaut</hi> saith in his State of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their strict and constant Observation of the Feasts
and Fasts of the Christian Church, and their reverence to
their Priests (things which our <hi>Dissenters</hi> seem to make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of) doth preserve any Knowledge of Christianity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: Nay, how barbarously they are used in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48598:13"/>
and more particularly in <hi>Asia,</hi> by the <hi>Turks;</hi> and then
let the World judge whether their Circumstances are like
unto yours? How glad would those poor Christians be, that
they had but half those Priviledges of our Church, which you
Dissenters slight and contemn? They would think they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the extreamest Rigor that could be inflicted upon
them, should they make a Schism in so excellent a Church
for matters of meer Order and Decency. For the lesser and
more inconsiderable our Differences are, the greater is your
Crime in not uniting with us; and the more Severity you
deserve whilst you continue in your Divisions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
to propagate them amongst us. Farther, the Case is far
different as to the People themselves: The <hi>Greek</hi> Church
are but a handful of poor Beggars in comparison of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> and in no manner of possibility of raising any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
or Rebellions amongst them, the <hi>Turk</hi> having a
constant standing Army over them; but ours boast of their
Numbers, and Riches, and have already rais'd the most
Bloody and Unnatural Rebellion amongst us, which ended
in the Murder of the Best of Kings, and the Destruction
of the best of Churches; and since God hath been pleased
by a miraculous Power <hi>to restore us again as at the first</hi> by
the Restauration of our King that now Reigns, how many
Plots and Mischiefs have they continued amongst us? To
instance in no more, witness that Bloody Villany acted by
<hi>Venner</hi> and his Party in <hi>England;</hi> and the late Rebellion
rais'd by the <hi>Field-Conventiclers</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> Nay, they are
such a sort of People, that having got an Interest in the
Late Times (how unjustly it matters not with them) in the
Lands of the Church and Crown, and of most of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Nobility and Gentry in <hi>England,</hi> their Fingers itch to be
at them again, and they would willingly venture their Skins,
to have a fair Blow for them: And that this is the reason of
some of their Non-conformity I am fully convinced, having
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48598:14"/>
with these Ears heard one of them confess, <hi>That if they would
give him his Bishops-Lands again, he would be as good a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
as any is in</hi> England. They have no other way to come
at another push for them, but by drawing in the People
to their Party, by keeping up Conventicles amongst us:
For this I can speak of my own Knowledge, <hi>That they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
their old Titles to those Lands at some years purchase more
than they did before His Majesties Declaration for the suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the penal Laws against them.</hi> So grateful are they for
the King's Favors, and so excellent Designs do they carry
on by the pretences of Conscience!</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Case is quite different as to our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
our King hath not an Absolute and Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and a Standing Force sufficient at the first Rise to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
any Commotion that may be rais'd amongst them, as
the <hi>Turk</hi> hath; but he is pleas'd to govern us by Laws,
even of our own desiring; and therefore there is an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity that such Laws should be executed, unless we
would be ruled by the sole Power of the Sword. Now
let me refer it to the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will continue to break their Oaths in not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Laws to suppress Conventicles, and so force His
Majesty (contrary to his Inclinations) to govern by a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army; or whether they will let him see that the Laws
are sufficient to do it by a due Execution of them? For
let me tell you Gentlemen, we may talk of Liberty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
but there is no Monarchy under Heaven (that I
know of) where it is allowed; where there is not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power, and a constant Standing Force able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all Mutinies and Seditions that may be the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of it. Let us therefore consider well at present
(for now is the time or never) whether we will maintain
our Church and Laws, or whether we will submit to the
long Sword, or tamely yield up our Lands to them who
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48598:14"/>
think their former Possession hath given them a sufficient
Title to those Estates which they once possessed?</p>

Fanatick Plots and Plotters, though the Papist-plotters
have been visible enough at the <hi>Old-Baily, Westminster-Hall,
Tower-Hill,</hi> and the <hi>Gallows;</hi> yet they have not been able to
discover any such amongst the Dissenters; and though there
may be turbulent, factious, and seditious Persons of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
yet it is a great Imprudence to throw away a whole
Quarter of Wheat, for the mixture of a Peck of Tares.</p>

               <p>In the first place (Neighbour) why are the
<hi>Observator</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> call'd <hi>the two special Fathers of the
Church of</hi> England? I verily believe those Gentlemen think
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48598:15"/>
it Honor enough to be <hi>Sons,</hi> not <hi>Fathers</hi> of our Church:
But I'll warrant you, you think you have made a fine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
both upon them and our Church; but let me tell
you (friend mine) as to them, you had better let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
For <hi>Old Nobs,</hi> and <hi>Brisk Hall.</hi> will be even with
you one time or an other; and as for our Church, though we
own no such Fathers, yet I think they may pass as well
for Fathers as those Fathers of your Separation, <hi>Father
Heth a Iesuite,</hi> and <hi>Father Commin a Friar,</hi> which in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time preach'd against our Liturgy, and first
cried up that laudable Custom amongst you of <hi>praying by the
Spirit,</hi> as you call it; or Father <hi>Prin, Burton,</hi> or <hi>Bastwick,</hi>
who were the famous Martyrs and Fathers of your Schism:
For neither of them two have lost their Ears, nor done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to deserve it, as these did. As for <hi>Fanatick Plots
and Plotters, Heraclitus</hi> (whatsoever you say to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary)
<hi>Numb. 61. &amp;</hi> 64. hath produced as jolly a Crew of
them as ever were seen at <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> or the <hi>Gallows,</hi> to
which you have not answered one word; nor (I believe)
ever can, any other ways than by throwing Dirt, which is
all the Defence your Cause will allow you. And what
do you think of Brother <hi>Stephen</hi> that was fairly hang'd at
<hi>Oxford?</hi> do you think he had not a Plot to render the
King and the Governors odious, who represented them in such
abominable Pictures, and sang such ridiculous and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Ballads of them? or to summ up all in one, what do
you think of the <hi>Father of the Association?</hi> Was not High
Treason as clearly prov'd against him as against any of the
Papists, and that by the same Evidence, <hi>viz. Turbervile</hi> and
<hi>Smith,</hi> upon whose Credit my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> lost his Head?
Talk no more for shame of the Loyalty and Peaceableness
of your Party; but now for your pretty <hi>Simile</hi> which (I
doubt not) pleases you wonderfully, <hi>viz. Is it not a great
Imprudence to throw away a whole Quarter of Wheat for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48598:15"/>
mixture of a Peck of Tares?</hi> To give you <hi>like for like,</hi> let
me ask you, <hi>Is it not a great folly to take that for a quarter of
good wheat in which there is not so much as an handfull of any
thing but Tares?</hi> For amongst all your Schismatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles,
that act according to their Principles, (I believe)
it would Puzzle, the Philosopher with his Candle and
Lanthorne to find any that are, or can be good Subjects
and good Christians, so long as they continue in such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but this I must say for some reverend Dissenters that
I know, who though they have quitted their ministry;
yet conform as Lay-men, and live Peaceably, that they
are none of that number, and that no man hath a greater
respect for such then I have, nor would more readily serve
them.</p>

               <p>Yes, yes, I see you do; but I fear it is onely
a Copy of your Countenance to serve your turn at present;
for if you and your <hi>Cap-cloak-men</hi> do really think it a
fault, why do they not publickly and constantly preach
against it till it be amended? but they dare not do this,
because it would be adjudged by their Masters the people
(who have so often heard such a cry against all outward
Worship as meer Popery,) to be a deserting <hi>the Good Old
Cause,</hi> and the Fathers of their faction <hi>those precious thorough-Reformers</hi>
of the late times; and this they know they must
not do, as they tender the Contributions of the Brethren,
nay, (which is much more) of the Sisters.</p>

               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>You will never be satisfied, (I see) with
any thing but that which is impossible for them to do.
For they might sooner preach away their Congregations,
then preach off their hatts: let them alone then and defend
your selves. For if you will read on, you'll find I have
charged your manner of Worship, and Customes in it, with
no less Indecencies, nay I may say with far greater, viz.
<hi>Pew-door-Clapping, and Hopkin's-ballads-singing?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>But why do you charge these upon our
Church or Churchmen? Doth our Church command or
all owany such thing, or our Church-men countenance any
such things in their Sermons, to the people? If not (I pray
you) <hi>lay the burden on the right Ass,</hi> and you'll soon see that
your own backs ought to bear it.</p>
               <p>For (1st) as to <hi>slapping of pew-doors all the Prayer time;</hi>
who may we thank for this horrid Indecency but your
selves? have you not preached the people out of love with
our Prayers, and taught them that the main of God's
worship, if not the whole of it, consists in nothing but
hearing a Sermon? Doth not our Church, enjoin all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48598:16"/>
to be present at the beginning of the Prayers? and what
is the Cause of their neglect but your divisions amongst us?
for do not all our Churchmen cry out against it? was it
not for your Conventicles which hinder the execution of
Church-Discipline amongst us, this would soon be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by making the people perform their duties according
to the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Canons.</hi> And this might be done with
no great trouble, by not permitting any to have a Key to
a Pew, who are not well affected to our publick Prayers,
and (as you direct) <hi>to keep the Pew-doors open while Prayers
are done,</hi> but not as you say (p. 12) <hi>to slap them in sermon
time;</hi> but to shut those quite out of Pews who will not
come to the Prayers, as well as to a Sermon.</p>

               <p>Ay! but what say you to <hi>Hopkins</hi> and
<hi>Sternhold's Psalmes, the common nusance to the service of the
Church</hi> (vid. pag. 13.) not onely in <hi>London</hi> but all over
England, <hi>a translation that hath reviled</hi> David <hi>worse then</hi>
Shimei?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>They are Children of your own bringing into
the Church, and therefore it is very fit that you should
answer for them; they were at first translated onely for
the private use of the Translators, afterwards they were
brought into families, and then by your elder Brethren
<hi>the Puritans</hi> into their publick Congregations, at length
they were by them Printed at the ends of their Bibles, as
allowed to be sung in Churches, though no such allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
ever could be found: and so have continued in great
veneration amongst your Party. For it is not long since
the singing of one of <hi>Robin Wisdom's</hi> Psalms was enough to
make a man thought a great Saint amongst you. Our
Church appoints the <hi>reading-Psalms</hi> as they are pointed
in our <hi>Common-Prayer-Bookes</hi> to be said or sung in our
Churches and no others: but hath winckt at those, because
some of them are tolerably-well translated; (as supposing,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48598:17"/>
that where they are used, such of them would be chosen
to keep the People doing of something whilst the Minister
went into the Pulpit, and to prevent those worse inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies
of <hi>Gossiping,</hi> and <hi>gigling</hi> in the Church: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we do not think them so necessary to the Service of
God as to trouble our selves with a new Translation of
them, because even the old were never authorized by the
Church, but were sneak'd into use, in opposition to the
singing of the Reading Psalms according to her order.</p>

               <p>If you had put your question thus; why you of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> (who believe that the main of God's
worship consists in joyning in the publick Prayers) sit
injoying your selves in the Vestrey over a Glass of Sack
till they are quite ended, without any regard to them?</p>
               <p>This indeed had been a very necessary question, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48598:17"/>
for my part I acknowledge freely, that I am not able to
give a satisfactory answer to it, and do heartily wish
that they who have given the Scandal would take it off,
either by giving sufficient reasons for it, or else by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
off so Scandalous a practice; for I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
this is a worse indecency in our Churches then any
that the worst of our Enemies either have, or (I think)
can object against us. But as your question is stated,
you seem to take off all that contempt that you had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
thrown upon that Ridiculous Translation of the
<hi>Psalms,</hi> and to undo in 2 or 3 lines, all that you had been
doing in 3 or 4 whole pages. For you seem to make
the Divine worship to consist in Singing a stave or
two of <hi>Hopkins.</hi> For this is the grand fault which you
charge upon our Clergy, that they do not come into their
Pulpits when the <hi>Psalm</hi> is first named. Now if this be
all, it is very easily answered thus. That our Church
prefer's the Prophet <hi>David</hi>'s words, before <hi>Robin Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s:
and that therefore they think they are not bound
to countenance a non-sensical practice which is contrary
to her far more necessary injunctions: And though they
have indeed a perfect aversion to Phanatick harmony,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to howling and meer divisions and discord, yet I
doubt not, many of them have as great a love for true
Harmony as your worship, and believe that God gave
them their voices, not to <hi>baul, cant, or sing nonsence;</hi>
but to speak and sing sense, to his <hi>Praise and Glory,</hi>
not in <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s ridiculous Metre, but in the
<hi>Psalms</hi> of the holy <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>The Minister after he hath drank gives it

               <p>Well now, put all this together and what can
be more like the ordinary way of <hi>drinking an Health</hi> at a
freind's table then this is? onely at a person of Qualities table
you use a little more manners then to loll your Elbows
upon it. Did you never hear the story of an honest-Country
Fellow who observing the Cup to have gone round, came
in great haste to the Minister and cry'd out, Nay hold Sir, let
me drink my Land-Lord's Health too as well as you; and
down he pop'd himself upon his Breech, snatched up the
Cup and claping his Elbows on the Table, off he drinks
it, and claps his Hand on his Brest, and turns up his Eyes
in Admiration of the goodness of the Wine, as he had seen
others do before; not knowing that they did it out of
Sence of Humility and devotion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48598:19"/>I will not vouch for the truth of the Story, but I am
sure a Man that onely Judges of Mens actions by his Eyes
might very easily be so deceived. And now Judge you
whether this is not a greater scandal and Indecency then
any thing that is practised in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> For
shame make no more comparisons, till this is Reformed. You
see then how excellent advice Our Saviour gives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
Matt. 7, 5. <hi>Thou Hypocrite, first cast out also the Beam out

                  <hi>Onely your great kindness to our Clergy

you your self, or any <hi>Cap-cloak-man</hi> of you all were

<hi>Hum</hi> you, how could you help it? I don't think your great
modesty would force you to leave your Subject to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
them for it; why then must our Preachers be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for what they cannot help? How can they tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Auditory will applaud what they say or no?
Or how can you tell that they are pleased with any such
indecency? for my part I verily believe they desire their
heares would observe what they say and remember and
practise it, and not that they should in such a manner
shew how much they are pleased at it.</p>

was never more necessary to be observed then in this age.
All men are not pleased with <hi>slovenly similitudes, noise, and

it over and never came near it more, certainly you did not
find so many faults in them, nor so considerable as you

               <p>Why say you? there hath been so many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial

the Conformists, (that if something had not been said to take
off their reputation) the People might have thought that
there is as good Preaching in our Churches as in your
Conventicles, and so all the fat had been in the fire, for
they might have returned to the Church again, and then
the separated Contribution would have been a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to the guts of your <hi>Splay-mouth'd</hi> Teachers; so that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48598:20"/>
if you do not this well, you do nothing; it being so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easie a task to find faults, or else to make them, such

can throw a stone into a Well which an hundred wise

can throw dirt, some of which will stick wherever it lights.</p>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word (Neighbour) you have

               <p>That's very strange; if there were not

               <p>'Tis very true, and your objection signifies
nothing; for if good Plays were as common as good
Sermons their price would be as mean: and besides,
what fault is it in a Sermon, that men think their recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
more necessary then their instruction? If we should
turn the argument upon your Party, I believe you
would not like it: For I am very confident that one
might easily purchase a dozen of your most famous men's
Sermons in the late times for the price of one Play,
and so much good may it do you with your <hi>half peny

               <p>Aye aye, that may be because people
are frighted out of their wits, with the name of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick;</hi>
so that if the Author of a Sermon be esteemed

               <p>What I fail in my performances, I hope
(sweet Sir) may be pardoned for the sake of my good

that it signifies in plain <hi>English</hi> one that appears to be

or in short, an <hi>Hypocrite:</hi> As for a Description of him,
(For I dare not undertake to define him whom no Terms

whose Religion and honesty, (like that of the Pharisees)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48598:21"/>
consists in not being like other men; whose obedience
in Governours consists in breaking their Laws, and who
acknowledges no Supream but his own humour; or in
short, as a little Boy (to answer the famous saying of an old
Nurse,) told me, <hi>A Phanatick is one who if his lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
should command him to go on his feet, would (if it was
possible) go on his head.</hi> If you go on any St. Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
you shall find him at some one or other, or all

behead old Queen Mall, who was convicted of high Treason
against her?</p>

               <p>By your laughing one would think you were

that all this is nothing at all to your business you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to prove.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why, is not King-killing and Queen-killing
all one?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, as exactly the <hi>same as the Presbyterians Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and the Iesuits</hi> in that point, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is lawful for
Subjects (whose Trustees Soveraigns are, and from whom
they derive their Power) to call their Princes to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and to punish them with Deposition and Death
it self, if they are adjudged Tyrannical: But that ever
the <hi>Church of England-men</hi> taught any such thing all your
Arguments from <hi>Queen Elizabeth's-Church-men</hi> fall very
short of proving.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>How so for God's sake? how so? was not
<hi>Mary Q.</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> a Soveraign Princess?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt but over the <hi>Scots</hi> She was? But
what was that to <hi>Englishmen,</hi> or to <hi>Q. Elizabeth?</hi> Was
<hi>Queen Elizabeth Q. Mary's</hi> Subject?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>No. Who saith She was?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Then what is this to the Doctrine of the
Presbyterians, that Subjects may arraign, condemn, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
their own Soveraign Princes? All that this Instance
proves, is only this, That the <hi>Church-of-England-Men</hi> in
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time did hold that it was lawful for one
Soveraign Prince to kill another if it be in his Power, and
if the safety of his own Person, or his Subjects welfare
does require it: and what is this more then that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for one Soveraign to make War with another?</p>
               <p>Now (Neighbour <hi>Cap's</hi>) e'en go to <hi>Henry Care</hi> your Giant

to make an Argument that may not be quite from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
that you may not spend your precious Treasure of
Witticisms so much to no purpose in dressing up such
idle and impertinent proofs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>No. I'll go but to one of your Sermons, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Preached on the Anniversary of the Murder of K. Charles
I,</hi> 1682. and there I shall find an Argument that will do
my business, <hi>vid. p. 23 and</hi> 24.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>What's that I pray you? an Argument for <hi>King-Killing</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even so; and no otherwise. For</hi> (p. 6.
ibid.) <hi>he saith,</hi> We do not wonder at the ruine of <hi>Zedechia,</hi> nor
was the ruine of him a Crime on <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> 's part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>What would you inferr from hence?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Onely this, that then the using a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign-Prince
more inhumanely then Killing him is no
great matter; and therefore that even according to our
high-flown-Church of England-men, Princes Persons are
not so sacred as I thought they had been.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>You might have easily seen his meaning if
you had Pleased. For it is no more then this. That <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
to our Crime (who being Subjects Murdered our own
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48598:23"/>
Prince) what</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>did to</hi> Zedechia <hi>was no Crime
at all in him. For that in</hi> Zedechia's <hi>highest and best condition,
his power was but co-ordinate with the power of</hi> Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,
<hi>but after he was his Prisoner and</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>had
seiz'd his dominion,</hi> Zedechia <hi>was no longer a Soveraign
Prince but his Subject, and therefore his endeavoring to recover
his lost Crown was contrary to his fealty to</hi> Nebuchadnezzar,
<hi>and might be punished by him as an Act of Rebellion.</hi> If Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Princes have a Right of War one against another
who can help it? Does it therefore follow that Subjects
have the same right against their own Soveraign whose
Lives and Dignities they are bound by oath to maintain
even with hazard of their own?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well, but speak like a</hi> True-man <hi>now.
Is there not a little touch of</hi> nonsence in a subordinate Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign?
For there never was, nor ever can be any such thing. For a
Soveraign (p. 24. ibid.) though inferior in Power, is equal in
Priviledges and Dignity to the most puissant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well what then? The nonsense is not his,
but your own. For he doth no where in that Sermon (that
I know of) say that <hi>Zedechia</hi> when he was taken Captive
by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did still remain <hi>a Soveraign-Prince,</hi> but
his very Argument doth imply the quite contrary. But
none are so blind as they that will not see. For you your
self confess that <hi>if a Soveraign-Prince becomes Tributary,
he is onely Titular, and no Sovereign.</hi> Now had not <hi>Zedechia</hi>
not onely lost his Kindom, but his Liberty also? Where
then was his Soveraignty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Even where the Authors Liberty is.</hi> For
in his Dedication of the said Sermon, he makes himself the
most abject Slave in the World to pin a piece of Flattery upon
his Patron. p. 26.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>What Slavery is this you cry out of at such
a rate? If I mistake not it is onely this: That <hi>he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48598:24"/>
it as an Honour; not onely that he, but all his Ancestors
ever since the Reformation have been Chaplins to the Dukes
of Sommerset, and wisheth (as well he may) that it may continue
so, to all succeeding Generations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>But he expresseth it, as though he had
renounc'd <hi>Liberty it self that draught of God's gifts to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi>
onely that he might Flatter his Patron.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I think it so extraordinary
an Honor to himself and his Family; that there are scarcely
any Scholars in England but might well be ambitious of
it: and did really think that he had herein passed a
Complement on himself and not upon the Duke. But
I see <hi>Liberty</hi> is as dear to a <hi>Phanatick</hi> as <hi>nutts</hi> to an <hi>Ape;</hi>
and is not to be parted withal, no not so much as in
<hi>Civility,</hi> though it be never so much to his own <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Advantage.</hi>

               <p>If this will not pass for Flattery, I'll

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>What! In another Dedication I'll warrant
you? It seems those Church-mens-Sermons are very barren
of faults that you're forced to pick Faults with every little
Complement in a Dedication. You tell us <hi>of Reflexions
upon Sermons,</hi> but we have nothing as yet, but idle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon the <hi>Epistles.</hi> One would think Men might
have some Grains of Allowance in expressing their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and Civility. If it had been at a Sisters Funeral
(that used to bring you the refreshing-Tankard-full of
Cordial after your Sabbath-Dayes great Pains and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,

you even in your Sermon.</p>

               <p>Why, the little Vicour (I confess) is a
little too pert upon the ill Consequences of <hi>Pride (P. 29th)</hi>
in producing us as Examples of them. And give me lieve
to say he is not a little impudent (p. 26 of the same Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
after he had shown the most miserable effects of
<hi>Schisme and Faction</hi> in the destruction of <hi>the Iews</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
and the <hi>Christians in Affrica,</hi> to tell my Lord Major, &amp;c.
<hi>I wish the divisions amongst our selves proceeded not from the

would take Care to suppress them lest they proceed to
the same sad effects, viz. the utter ruin of the best Constituted
Church, and State in the World.</hi> Now, what Flesh and
Blood that lives by holding forth at Conventicles (as I
do) is able to endure such a Sermon as this is, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Aye, but then (me it thinks) you should

               <p>
                  <hi>Does it not argue</hi> a Seraphick piece of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophantisme
to attribute those sufficiencies to mortal frailty,
that neither <hi>David</hi> nor <hi>Solomon</hi> with all their Prudence and

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>But (I beseech you Sir) does he any Wayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
supernatural Aids? Does he not suppose <hi>the Lady</hi> to be
a Christian? And therefore her constant Devotion surely
doth not any Wayes hinder, but very much procure the
Graces of God's Spirit to direct her. For our Saviour
saith, <hi>Ask and ye shall have, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>We may well suppose that <hi>David and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
were supernaturally assisted, too; and yet <hi>(notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Very true, their falls were permitted that
all men might be more careful of their standing, and that
none might presume. And yet I believe many that have
neither been Indued with the <hi>Wisdom of Solomon,</hi> nor <hi>the
Devotion of David</hi> have (by Gods assistance) been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from their grand Crimes. To come a little closer to
you Neighbour, Do you think your self as Godly a Man as
<hi>David</hi> was, and as Wise as <hi>Solomon?</hi>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I suppose you would not be angry if a man
should say and believe that <hi>your Cap-cloak-ship</hi> is neither
so Wise as <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor so holy as <hi>David,</hi> and yet that
you're neither <hi>an Adulterer, a Murtherer,</hi> nor <hi>an Idolater;</hi>
nay (I imagin) you would be very angry if a Man

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>I conclude so? It is a lye. I would have
you to know, that I am better bred then so. All that
I concluded was onely this, that though she was as Wise as
<hi>Solomon</hi> and as pious as <hi>David</hi> yet possibly she might fall
into as great Sins as are arraigned in that Sermon; and
therefore that her Prudence and Piety canot be <hi>Sufficient
Guards</hi> against them.</p>

               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Can't you see the Consequence? Then

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your leave (good <hi>Neighbour Caps</hi>) to
ask you another question. Does not any man think a
good Cudgel a sufficient defence against a snarling Cur,
and yet is it not possible that the Tike may surprize a man
for all his Cudgel, and give him a snap or two by the
heels?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>But does not he himself confess his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
when he is forced to beg pardon of the Lady's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
before-hand?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all truely that I can see. For (as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>It may be I do, and it may be not; thus
much I know of him that he hath the Reputation of an
<hi>Honest plain-Dealing Gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and to have considerably
baulk'd his interest rather then he would fail of his duty
to the Church; and therefore I have more reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him then ten thousand of those that will say or do
any thing for the sake of Contribution-money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, believe him you may and if
you will, but surely no body will believe you, if you
do; who does but consider that <hi>incomprehensible Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that he passeth upon the <hi>Son. (vid. p. 27. Crape-Gown.)</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>All that he saith of him is this. That</hi> he knew
him in his Childhood, and that such was the goodness of his
nature, as though he had been made to show the loveliness of
vertue, and that one would almost think that he alone was
exempted from the general corruption of nature derived from
<hi>Adam. Now what if there should be nothing in all this
that did not become him to say upon this occasion?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>what?—Then I will be willing to
be exalted above my Brethren, and to be set upon the
next Sign-post, and to have my Head put through a
wooden Loope-whole, with these brace of dear Caps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, to be gazed at, <hi>for the Sign of the black silk-button
edged with white.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Have a care of that (man) you do not know
what may happen. Possibly you may have your deserts
before you dye. It is a great deal of pitty but you
should.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well. If this happens not till you
have vindicated your Author, I think I am safe enough.</p>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>But you may not be long so, for all as I can
see to the contrary. For it is not reasonable that he
should let the World know that he did not think those
to whom he dedicated his Sermon had more need of it,
then other men: for otherwise it must have been thought
that they were guilty of those sins which he there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns.
And can there be any better Argument to a
young Gentleman to persist in the Ways of vertue, then
to let him see how much he must degenerate from what
he was if ever he should fall into vicious courses; and
what a shame it would be for him to pervert so excellent
a Constitution of Body, and Disposition of mind? And
did it not become him, who formerly had the tuition of
him, to remind him of it?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Oh! But</hi> he hath made him almost a God
upon Earth: and had it not been for that almost, not much
more could have been attributed to the Humanity of Christ.

               <p>Did you never hear that a good man is the
most lively Image of God? If you think then a Person is
a good man, must you be affraid to say so, lest you make
him a God upon Earth? Does not the Apostle say <hi>that
Christ was</hi> (as to his Humanity) <hi>in all things like unto us,
sin only excepted?</hi> When I see then a Person of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
goodness of temper, and unblameableness of life,
what great Crime would it be if a man should say of
suchan one that <hi>one would almost think him like unto Christ?</hi>
and yet this is a greater Character then that which you so
much quarrel at.</p>

               <p>You might (if you had pleas'd) have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he doth not say that the <hi>young Gentleman was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the general Depravity of Humane Nature;</hi> but
only that judging by the sweetness of his <hi>Genius,</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48598:27"/>
the goodness of his inclinations visible in his actions from
his Childhood <hi>one would almost think so;</hi> and surely he is a
more capable judge of this who conversed with him, and
had that care of him, then you that confess you do'nt
know him. But if <hi>the almost</hi> had been quite: left out, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
much more might have been said concerning the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

               <p>Have a care, what you say, lest you throw
durt upon the preaching of the heads of your Party in
the late times. For then there was scarcely a sister that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that a great part of the Sermon was made up of <hi>her
Communion with God, her Godding it with God, and Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with Christ;</hi> and such like unintelligible Stuff, that
if it be not <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> I am sure 'tis <hi>grand Non-sence.</hi>

                  <hi>What? The best is still behind.</hi> See p.

and Chernbim'd the Lady and her Son, he wisheth them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48598:27"/>
all the Happiness of this World, and that which is to come: As
if the latter could be denied to Persons so <hi>Super-naturalized</hi>
and fitted for Heaven. <hi>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

               <p>Laugh on, Laugh on; but you might have

laughed with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I can't find where the Jest lies upon

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Oh Dulness, Dulness! It is pity you should
ever hear a good Jest again, or ever laugh more, if you
can't find in your Heart to laugh at this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but first make out the Jest, and then
let us laugh: Where doth it lie, in his Words, or in your
Comment upon them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if you can't see where it lies, 'tis
impossible to inform you, and I will never undertake a man
that is so abominably dull.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Then I'll endeavor to inform my self. All
that he saith in that Epistle is to this Effect, that he shall
scarcely find any persons that have less need of such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
than they to whom he dedicates it, because they
are not guilty of those Grand Sins against which his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
inveighs: Now is this to <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim them?</hi> Is
there no more required to make up a <hi>Cherubim</hi> or <hi>Seraphim</hi>
than not to be guilty of the highest Wickedness that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
can be guilty of? The Sins he mentions are these,
<hi>Pride, Envy, Schisin, Faction, Voluptuousness, Covetousness, Lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
and <hi>Anger, Gluttony</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness, Vncharitableness</hi>
and <hi>Injustice, Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Atheism.</hi> Now it seems you know
your own Party so well, that he (you think) may well
pass for a <hi>Cherubim or a Seraphim</hi> amongst you, that is not
guilty of some, if not of all these Sins; and that in the
highest manner that can be, and prosecutes them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.
For it is against such sort of Sinners, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48598:28"/>
in these Sins, and pursue them (not against such as
through Humane Infirmity or Surprize may happen to fall
into them) that the Sermon is directed; from which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
he thinks he may well exclude the Lady and her Son.
And what of all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>What then? Surely persons so <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliz'd
are sure enough of the Happiness of another World;</hi> and
therefore is it not a kind of a Bull for him to wish it them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why, may we not pray for that which we are
sure of? What do you think of those Petitions in the Lord's
Prayer, <hi>viz. Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done?</hi> Nay,
(Secondly,) How can any man be sure that he shall not fall
into the grossest Sins, and die in them; and so be deprived
of the Happiness of the World to come? Is any one more
<hi>Super-naturaliz'd</hi> than St. <hi>Paul?</hi> And yet he tells us, <hi>I keep
under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that when I
have preach'd to others, I my self should become a Cast-away.</hi>
Now if he thought himself in danger of being a <hi>Cast-away,</hi>
well may we think that any one else is in danger of it;
and therefore sure it is no great harm to pray for the best
of Men, that they may not fall short of the Prize they aim
at.—Now all this while, where's the Jest you talk'd
of?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why—the Jest—the Jest—say
you? The Jest was a good Jest if you could have let it
alone; but you have spoil'd it, and who can help it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Now I think on't, the Jest may lie in this,
that you should talk of a Jest when there is nothing like it:
or else, that you should imagine that they are said to be
<hi>supernaturalized and Cherubim'd and Seraphim'd,</hi> that are
only said not to pursue the greatest Villanies that men can
commit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I see this <hi>Lay-chair-man</hi> of the

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48598:28"/>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Don't be so confident (Neighbour) to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
your sweet Life upon such a Trifle: For if it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon this, for all you're so wise, you might e'en die
like a Fool: For it is possible, that neither he, nor any
<hi>Crape-Gown-man</hi> thinks your <hi>ridiculous Libel</hi> worth the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of; but one that is very ready to wait on you
whensoever you shall please to give him a further Occasion
of Discourse.</p>

               <p>So I thought; why should <hi>Goliah</hi> be afraid

say if I should produce you a <hi>Grave Saying</hi> out of one of

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>If you would have me answer you seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
I think there is not an abler man in <hi>England</hi> of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>In his <hi>Saints Rest.</hi> For there surely it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48598:29"/>
most becomes him to be most grave and serious where he
is treating of the most serious matters; the Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the Righteous, and the unspeakable joy's of
Heaven.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>So one would think. Yet in that very book
it is that this <hi>Grave-saying</hi> I told you of is to be found.

Qualifications for Heaven? Or that there can be no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

I think on't, before you urge my promise any further, give
me leave to consult <hi>Dick Medler,</hi> and <hi>Harry Monkey-face</hi>

chuse your Texts out of the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> or out of

                  <hi>From</hi> pag. 33. <hi>to</hi> p. 39. <hi>you proceed in your
Indictment to this purpose,</hi> viz. That you the said <hi>Crape-Gown-men,</hi>
in several of your Sermons at other times, and in
other places, not having the fear of God before your Eyes, out of
premeditated Malice against the good, Godly and sober Party
of this our Nation, have chosen certain malignant Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to prove to the People those damnable Doctrines of the
Excellency and Divine Right of Monarchy; and that in other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
you have defamed his Majesties best Subjects, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
(that were so instrumental to the bringing him in, for their own
Interest, and ever since his Restauration, have been most Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
endeavoring (because he will not let them be Kings) to
throw him out again) with a matter of Truth; and that you the
said <hi>Crape-Gown-men,</hi> to the great prejudice of his Majesties
Grammer-School of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. have made use of certain Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
out of <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> because they
were pertinent to your purpose; and lastly, that you the said
<hi>Crape-Gown-men</hi> in other of your Sermons, have proved,
that it is not lawful to make an Act of Parliament, to exclude
the Right Heir from the Crown, because <hi>Job</hi> tells us <hi>Ch. 36.
v.</hi> 21. that it is not lawful for a man to do evil that good may
come of it; and that you have most bitterly rail'd against such
as endeavored to settle the Crown and the Succession in the right
Line, by such an Exclusion of the true and lawful Successor, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48598:31"/>
the Godly Party have been very much lett and hindered in
doing God's Work, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in introducing an Holy and thorough
Reforming Commonwealth amongst us: And all this you have
done and said contrary to the peace of our Sovereign Lord the
King, his Crown and Dignity, and the Statutes made at the

Reign of <hi>Amadis</hi> de <hi>Gaul, c. 201. &amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I think there is no great need of a Verdict in

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your Pardon for that, Sweet, Dear Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:

               <p>You have hudl'd up together what I

but if you would consider particularly, as there you
may find it, I doubt not but you must be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Ridiculousness of such preaching.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I am mistaken if I have not delivered the
Sence of your Words according to the Truth, and the whole
Truth, and nothing but the Truth; and the reason why I
put your whole Accusation in one Summ of an Indictment,
is, because I did not see any thing that you have said that
deserved a more particular Consideration; but if you have
any thing more to say, I have Patience enough to hear it,
let it be never so impertinent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, I pray you let me know
why you talk of <hi>Malignant Texts of Scripture?</hi> I am sure I
made use of no such blasphemous Epithet: I have more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
for the sacred Scriptures than to blaspheme them at
that Rate.</p>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Possibly you may have now; but there was a time
when one of your <hi>Godly Committees of Sequestration,</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
an honest Clergy-man (for want of other Faults)
merely for chusing <hi>malignant Texts of Scripture,</hi> to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred,
and executed their Sentence upon him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and therefore you must pardon me, if (because I saw
you so hot against these Texts) I did imagine these
might be <hi>the very malignant Texts</hi> for which he was seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterd:
For I cannot but think that your hatred to <hi>Monarchy</hi>
may sometimes over-ballance your great Reverence for the
Holy Scriptures, when they oppose <hi>your most dearly beloved
Common-weath Doctrines.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>You mistake me; I was not hot against
any Texts of Scripture; but against the Preacher for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying
them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Let's see then how they are misapplied.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak man.</speaker>
               <p>For Example, to prove the Power of
<hi>Kings,</hi> a <hi>Wakefield Gent.</hi> takes this Text, <hi>Psal. 51. v.</hi> 4.
<hi>Against thee only have I sinned,</hi> vid. p. 33.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Had he not reason for it? For he that can
sin only against God, is accountable to none but God for
his Sin; and therefore cannot, nor ought not to be brought
<hi>to the Block</hi> by his own People and Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>I must acknowledge the Consequence to
be true in spight of my Teeth: but how are the Premises
true from that Text, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>David</hi> as a Monarch could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sin against God, or against God only?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>For all any thing that you have said to the
Contrary, this may be the very true and genuine sense of
the Words. I did desire a friend of mine to examine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
about them, and by the account he hath given
me I am much confirm'd in that opinion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Let us see your friend's account; for I
cannot but think it will prove a very strange one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:48598:32"/>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I will give it you truely in his own Words,
let it appear never so strange to you. He tells me that <hi>St.
Hierom</hi> (who possibly could have writ Hebrew in other
kind of Characters then you have done) renders the Words
thus. <hi>In te, In te solum peccavi.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon it, <hi>A te solo Poenas metuere possum. Nam Liberi
sunt Reges a vinculis delictorum, ut ait</hi> Ambrosius: <hi>&amp; secundum
dictum Rabbinorum, Nulla creatura judicat Regem, sed Deus
benedictus.</hi> That is in plain English if I can translate the
Words. <hi>Against thee, against thee only have I sinned. From
thee alone can I be punished for my sin. For (as</hi> Ambrose <hi>saith)
Kings are free from Punishments for their Sins. And (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the saying of the</hi> Rabbins) <hi>No creature can judge a
King; but only God blessed for evermore.</hi> Now (Sir) I hope
it is no great Crime if these authorities should perswade
the Gentleman to take the Words in this sense; and me to
believe them to be rightly applyed even against the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Word of your dear self; for I see very little reason you
have offered against this application, and I see less reason
to think that <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>saint Hierom</hi> did not understand
Hebrew as well as your learned Worship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>I do not at all question it. For I give you
the translation of the Hebrew in the very same Words <hi>that
Saint Hierom</hi> hath done; but I cannot assent to <hi>Grotius</hi> his
explication of them, for reasons I there give you <hi>p.</hi> 33 and 34.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I pray then what can be the reason that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
does here so Emphatically repeat this expression <hi>Against
thee, against thee only</hi> have I sinned, but only his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of God's sole power over him to punish him, or
to forgive him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>That cannot be the reason.</hi> For the
Words were without question uttered in reference to the privacy
of the fact committed, which lay conceal'd from all the World but
God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48598:32"/>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well faced out indeed! When were these
Words spoken of by <hi>David,</hi> after the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi>
had been with him and publickly told him of his Murder
and Adultery, or before? It must be surely after it, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that, he took no notice of his sin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>What if it was after? What's this to the
business?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>No more but this; that then <hi>David's</hi> sin when
he makes this Confession did not lye conceal'd from all the
World but God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> the uery next Words Explanatory of
the first, and to them annex'd, and made part of the sentence
seem to demonstrate the Reason that I have given to be the true
Reason of the Words, <hi>viz.</hi> and done this evil in thy Sight.
(i. e.) not in the Sight of any other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Nay surely they seem to demonstrate the
quite contrary. For I think Tautologies are not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in Scripture without a great Necessity. Why then
must these latter Words <hi>and have done this evil in thy sight,</hi>
be taken in the very same sense with the former <hi>Against thee
Against thee only have I sinned;</hi> when the sense may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
very clear and pertinent to his purpose?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because</hi> David could have no Reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to Heaven about his Power, <hi>but speak these Words to
this End,</hi> viz. to justifie the Almighty in what Punishment he
should inflict on him, as the last Words of the Text demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
imply, <hi>viz.</hi> to the end that thou mayest be Iustified in thy
Word, and pure in thy Iudgment. p. 34. ibid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>For that very Reason that you have given
from the last Words, I conclude that <hi>David</hi> had great cause
in his confession to remember the power that God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him in raising him up to be <hi>King of Israel.</hi> For this as
the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> urgeth it 2 <hi>Sam. 12. v. 7 &amp;c.</hi> was the
grand aggravation of his sin. <hi>Thus saith the Lord God, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48598:33"/>
thee King over</hi> Israel &amp;c. <hi>wherefore then hast thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the Commandment of the Lord? Now therefore the sword
shall never depart from thine House; thus saith the Lord, Behold
I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own House, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
shall ly with thy wives in the sight of the Sun. For thou
didst it secretly, but I will do this thing before all</hi> Israel, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>With all my Heart. <hi>David</hi> having seen this
threatning of the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> to be fulfilled upon him
in the Rebellion of his own beloved Son <hi>Absalom</hi> against
him, when he seiz'd his Father's Wives and Concubines and
lay with them even in the Gates of the City, in the sight
of all <hi>Israel;</hi> in the Agony of his Soul he pens this Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
Psalm to beg Pardon for that particular Sin of the
Murder <hi>of Vriah,</hi> which he could not but know was the
Cause of these so heavy afflictions upon them. In which he
confesses to God Almighty, <hi>Against thee, Against thee only
have I Sinned</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(i. e.) Thou O God hast raised mee up from
a Poor Shepherd's Boy to be King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and given me an
absolute Authority over thy People, so that they should have no
power to call me to an account for any of my Actions, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
any Punishment upon me. But I have abused ingratefully
all these thy Mercies towards me, and thine own power over
thine own People with which thou hast intrusted me hath been a
means and encouragement to me to take away the Life of Innocent
Vriah: thus heinously have I Sinned against thee, and more
particularly against thee, then any other of thy People could
have done.</hi>

               <p>This is hitherto very pertinent I must

               <p>Well go on then with your Paraphrase,

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>This great evil <hi>(saith David)</hi> I did in thy sight.
So privately that no mortall Eye could see that I was concern'd
in it, but thou O God who art every where present, and seest all
things didst manifestly behold it; and that thou mightest vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
thy power and Providence hast made my Crime visible to
all men in my Punishment according as thou didst foretell by
thy holy Prophet <hi>Nathan.</hi> That thou mightest be justified in thy
Word and pure in thy Iudgments. And hereby thou hast justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thy Prophets threatnings, and cleared thine own Iustice from
all Aspersions that mine Impunity might have brought upon it,
by inflicting such heavy Iudgments upon me which I acknowledge
I have most justly deserved. <hi>Now let me hear what you have
to say against this Gloss.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Truely (Neighbour) I have nothing to
say against this paraphrase but that it may be the true sense
of the Words for all as I know to the contrary at present:
<hi>but you can't think the Fellows that are hang'd are accountable
to none but God, because they sing these very Words at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</hi>
Me it thinks this renders that sense of them a little
ridiculous.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>After they are hang'd and dead, who (I
pray) are they accountable to but only to God?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they do not</hi> sing this after they are
hang'd, do they? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>No truely I believe not. But they are dead
in Law when they sing it, and have pass'd their accounts
before man, and so they can be accountable to none else
but God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>All this doth not satisfye me yet. I should
be very loath to use those Words upon the like occasion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I dare believe you in this without swearing.
You have no great Maw without doubt to follow <hi>Brother
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48598:34"/>
Hugh</hi> and go to Heaven in a string. But If ever I should
hear that you was going to the Gallows I would wait on
you, and doubt not but to give you full satisfaction that you
might sing those Wordes, as well as any Man can sing any
Psalm of <hi>David;</hi> and yet that <hi>David</hi> might understand
them in no other sense then what I have before proved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-clook-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly now I think on't, <hi>Brother Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
brought a great Scandal upon the Godly by his going
out of the World so like a dumb Dog as he did. Wherefore
because I do not know what may happen I should thank
you if you would now inform me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>That you may be a little serious and leave
your laughing and scoffing against all People that love the
Government (which I doubt nothing but hanging can make
you do) suppose then the Act of Indemnity was repealed
and that you was convicted for your old Treasons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
(because your new and latter Actions are not yet
discovered) and that Sentence had justly passed upon you,
and that you was mounted upon the Ladder just ready to
be turnd off. I believe then you would have some serious
sense of your sins, and would not think it impertinent to
apply <hi>David's</hi> Confession to your own circumstances, so
far as they are agreeable to them and no further.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>In the mean while I pray you tell me why it
is ridiculous that <hi>David</hi> should have a different meaning
suitable to his particular sin and punishment in this confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from that which other men may use the words in,
when they apply them to their own particular cases?</p>

<hi>Jud. 17. v.</hi> 9. In those Dayes there was no King in <hi>Israel,</hi> but

               <p>I never saw the Sermon, but as for the Text,
I think he makes himself most ridiculous, who excepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>How could this be? <hi>vid. page</hi> 35. A go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Science of <hi>Scoffing</hi> and <hi>laughing,</hi> you have studied them I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
much more then <hi>Logick.</hi> For generally I find them the
best Arguments you have quite through your Pamphlet.
It is but dressing up any Person in a fools coat, and though

               <p>You'll give me leave (I hope) to laugh at
such as make themselves fools, will you not? I cannot for
my Heart but laugh at so foolish an Argument as this is for
Monarchy. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>The Argument from the Text is his; but the

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>For my Life I can't see any Argument

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why, this very Text makes as much for
a <hi>Republican,</hi> as a <hi>Regal Government.</hi> For all that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from it is only this, that when there are no Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to execute Laws <hi>every man will do what is right in his
own Eyes;</hi> and therefore that <hi>Anarchy</hi> is worse then the
worst of Governments, and this makes no more for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> then a <hi>Republick.</hi>

               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Yes surely, something more: for the Misery
that is bewail'd came upon <hi>Israel</hi> by reason of the death of
him that judged or ruled them, who was <hi>Sampson,</hi> a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Person; there being at that time a perfect <hi>Inter-regnum.</hi>
Now if this Text doth prove (as you say) that no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all, is worse then the worst of Governments that
can be; then by Consequence it proves that <hi>Monarchy</hi> is
the best Government, because it is the farthest removed
from <hi>Anarchy.</hi>

               <p>Only this, that I think him a ridiculous Fool,
that doth not know that the wisest man in the world may

               <p>Yes, Yes, by all means; but yet there is no

for such a Story which other Authors contradict; or <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>Why no less a Man then <hi>Mr. Rushworth</hi> who
hath writ so many and so large volumns of Collections in
the behalf of the Good Old Cause. Do you not think now
the Old Gentleman would be much concern'd, if for all
his Pains he might not have the Honour to be styled an

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>Well then for <hi>Worthy Mr. Rushworth</hi>'s <hi>Sake</hi>
and <hi>his most Authentick Collections, Valer. Max.</hi> though he
was but a Collector of History, shall pass for an <hi>Historian;</hi>
but why should he be believed against the Authority of
better Authors, such as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Pliny?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Lives and <hi>Pliny</hi>'s History are but
Collections out of other Historians no more then <hi>Valerius
Max.</hi> his Book is; and why (I pray you) may not he be
believed as well as they? Or why might not there be more
<hi>Scylla's</hi> then one that dyed a strange and unnatural death?
However, surely we may believe, that <hi>Valerius</hi> had some
Ground for what he said, and that is enough to Authorize
a Preacher to take so useful a Story as this upon his
Credit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak man.</speaker>
               <p>Well; but why must he be quoted when

            <sp>

               <p>Possibly the <hi>Notae Variorum</hi> upon <hi>Valerius</hi>
would have furnished him with the Names of <hi>Plutarch</hi> &amp;c.
but he is more ingenious, then to mention such Authors as he
hath not read though he hath never so fair an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
offered him. I know your Author of that Sermon so
well, that I dare swear he scorns to appear more learned
then he is; now I hope it is no great Crime if he that hath
so much Business to do, so constantly lying upon him,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48598:36"/>

               <p>You know I have told you (<hi>p.</hi> 39.) That
<hi>it is Interest that governs the World; And that there's
the grand Cause of all our Misfortunes.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>You have said a great deal of Truth in a
few Words: for I verily believe, that our Divisions
will never have an end so long as you can reap so much
Gain by your seperate Assemblies: were but these prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
according to Law, and we should soon see an End
of all our Misfortunes and Factious Cabals.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cap-cloak-man.</speaker>
               <p>But have not I given you a better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
out of a Sermon of that Worthy Gentleman Mr.
<hi>Maurice</hi> Preached <hi>Ianuary</hi> the 30th. 1681? Would not
this do it without persecuting and ruining one another?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>True-man.</speaker>
               <p>I believe your Party will Conn you no great
thanks for speaking so much Truth of that Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who hath so ingeniously, modestly, and fully baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
your Father <hi>Baxter</hi>'s railing Legend against Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:
and as for his Direction, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>if we would
weaken that Faction, let us take away the open Scandal
and Viciousness of our Lives; Let us detect their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
not by washing off the Paint with Satyr; but with
Solid and sincere Piety,</hi> &amp;c. I fully assent to it as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary; But yet do not think, that this will be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48598:37"/>
enough so long as we suffer a Party to say what they
please of us without any Answer: For the more really
pious we are according to the Injunctions of our Church,
the more such as are our enemies hate us, and indeavor
the more to raise Lies and Scandalls of us. He that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
their Actions cannot but bear Witness to this: that
if the <hi>Devil</hi> himself will but appear for their Party, he
shall be cryed up for <hi>an Angel of Light</hi> amongst them,
and on the contrary, <hi>if an Angel from Heaven</hi> should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
against them, they would cry him down for <hi>a wicked
Impostor?</hi> and therefore a little Satyr may be sometimes
very necessary to wash off the Glorious Outside of such
Inward Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>And thus (good Neighbour) I take my leave of you,
only desiring you to take St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice, <hi>viz. Study to
be quiet, and to do your own Business;</hi> But if you will be
medling with other Men, you may expect to hear further
from me. In the mean while I bid you farewel till our
next Meeting.</p>
