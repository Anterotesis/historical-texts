            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHat thou findest herein,
are Collections out of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Antient Authors,
which (with no small trouble,) I
have carefully and diligently Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and Comprised into this
small Book at some vacant hours,
for the divertisement of such as thy
self, who are disposed to read it;
For as the several Climates of the
<pb facs="tcp:57821:3"/>
world, have not only influenced the
Inhabitants, but the very Beasts,
with Natures different from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
So hast thou here, not only
a Description of the several Shapes
and Natures of Variety of Birds,
Beasts, Fishes, Plants and Fruits;
but also of the Dispositions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
(though some of them Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and Inhumane,) of several
People, who Inhabit many pleasing
and other parts of the World. I
think there is not a Chapter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wilt not find various and
remarkable things worth thy Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and such (take the Book
throughout,) that thou canst not
<pb facs="tcp:57821:3"/>
have in any one Author, at least
Modern, and of this Volume. And
if what I have done, shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
thee, I shall possibly proceed,
and go on to a further discovery in
this kind, which doubtless cannot
(as all Variety doth,) please thee.
'Tis probable they are not so Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
dispos'd as some hands might
have done; Yet for Variety and
Pleasure-sake, they are (I hope)
pleasingly enough intermixed. And
as I find this accepted, so I shall
proceed.</p>

hot, and offensive;
so that to avoid the

thereof, and to have
the benefit of some fresh winds, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are accustomed to build high
Towers in all their Towns, in which
they use to solace, and refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Soil made fruitful by the
over-flowing of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> is
so exceeding plentiful of all sorts of
Grain, that it was called, <hi>Horreum

of the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> which

months Provisions. It abounds also
with Rich Pastures, in which they
feed great store of Camels, Horses,
Asses, Oxen, Sheep, and Goates,
greater of growth then usually in most
places else; and by reason of the
<hi>Moorishness</hi> of the Country, they have
great store of Fowls, Poultry they
have in great abundance about their
houses, hatched in a different manner
from all other Countries, not by sitting
of the Hen, but by the heat of Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or Ovens, in which their Eggs are
orderly laid in Dung, and by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
heat brought to animation. Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
there are in great store, growing
in couples, Male and Female, both
thrusting forth their rods full of Seeds;
but the Female is only fruitful, and
that not except growing by the Male,
and having his Seeds mixt with hers:
the pith of these trees is most excellent
Salad, in taste somewhat resembling
a Hartichoke; of the branches of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57821:5"/>
tree they make Beadsteads, Latices,

Fans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the outward husk of
the Cod, Cordage; of the Inner,
brushes; the Fruit it bears best known
by the name of a Date. Finally, it is
said to bear whatsoever is necessary to
the life of a man: It is the nature of
this tree, though never so ponderous
a weight were put upon it, not to yield
to the burthen; but still to resist the
heaviness, and endeavour to raise it
self the more upwards. For this cause
planted in Church-yards in the Eastern
Countreys as an Emblem of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:
Instead whereof we use
the Yew-tree in these more colder
Regions.</p>
            <p>The People, though the Country
be in the same Clime with <hi>Barbary,</hi>
are not black, but Tawny; affirmed to
weep and mourn over the Bodies of
their Dead, daubed over with Dung;
to have held it a great Impiety to burn
or bury them; but having Imbalmed

them; to lay them in some inward
Room of their houses: The Men to
keep themselves at home, for the
houshould business, whilst the Women
follow Merchandize and other Affairs
abroad; the Men to carry Burdens
upon their heads, and the Women
theirs on their shoulders; <hi>Antipodes</hi>
in these last to most other Nations; But
certainly they were witty and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
People, the first Inventers of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry,
Arithmetick, Physick;</hi> as also
<hi>Astronomy, Necromancy,</hi> and <hi>Sorcery:</hi>
They first taught the use of Letters to
the neighbouring <hi>Phenicians,</hi> accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at first to express their conceits in
the shape of Birds, Beasts, and Trees
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they termed <hi>Hyeroglyphicks,</hi>
of which, two or three examples will
not be Impertinent. For <hi>Eternity,</hi>
they painted the Sun and Moon, as
things which they believed to have
had no beginning, nor were likely to
have any ending. For a <hi>Year,</hi> they
painted a <hi>Snake,</hi> with his tail in his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57821:6"/>
mouth, to shew how one Year suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
another, kept the World still
in an endless Circle. For a <hi>Month,</hi>
they painted a <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> because at
every new Moon, it sendeth forth a
new branch. For <hi>God,</hi> they painted
a <hi>Faulcon,</hi> as well for that he soared
so high, as that he governed the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Birds For Integrity of life, they
painted <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> both because
these Elements are in themselves most
pure, and because all other things are
putrified by them. For any thing that
was abominable to the <hi>Gods,</hi> they
painted a <hi>Fish,</hi> because in their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
their Priests never used them.</p>

Another Plant, they tell us

            <p>IN <hi>Castile</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the times of
our Grand-Fathers (saith mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
was discovered in a valley scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
amongst high and impassible
Mountains, a kind of Patoecos or
salvage People, never heard of in
<hi>Spain</hi> before, the occasion of this. An
Hawk of the Duke of <hi>Ava</hi>'s, which
he very much valued; flew over those
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57821:21"/>
Mountains, and his men not being able
to find her at first, they were sent
back again to seek her, clambering
from one Hill to another; they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
at last upon a large and pleasant
valley, where they spied a company
of naked salvage People; hemmed in
amongst many craggy Rocks. The
Salvages gazing a while upon them, ran
into their Caves made in the hollows
of the Rocks, the best Houses they
had, which being observed by the
Faulconers, they returned again to
their Lord; telling him that instead
of a Faulcon, they had brought him
news of a new World in the midst of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and of a Race of People,
which came in with <hi>Tuball,</hi> strongly
affirming what they said, they obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Belief, and the Duke shortly after
went with a company of Musketteers,
and subdued them easily; they having
no offensive Weapons, but only Slings.
They worshipped the Sun and Moon,
fed upon nothing that had life; but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57821:22"/>
had good store of excellent Fruits,
Roots, and Springs of water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
a Nature was well content, and
though their Language was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
understood by any, yet many
of their words were found to be pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Busquish,</hi> reduced on this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
to Christianity, but easily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
by all other <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their
rawney complexions, occasioned by
the Reverberation of the Sun-beams,
from those rocky Mountains, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
on all sides they are incompassed.</p>

            <p>IN <hi>Norwey,</hi> there is a little sort of
Beast, called by the name of <hi>Lemers,</hi>
about the bigness of a Mouse, and
are by the Inhabitants said to drop out
of the Clouds in tempestious Weather,
like the Locusts, they devour every
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57821:22"/>
green thing on the Earth, and at a
certain time die all in heaps (as it were)
together; and with their stench so
poyson the Air, that the poor People
are long after troubled with the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and a giddiness in the Head: But
these Beast come not so often to infect
the Land, as the Whales do to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the shores; the Seas being there so
deep, and therefore a fit habitation
for those great <hi>Leviathans,</hi> against
whose violence and fury; the People
of the Sea-coast have found a remedy,
which is by casting some water inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
with Oyle of Castor; the smell
whereof forces them immediately to
retire, without this help there were
no Fishing on the Coasts.</p>

            <p>WE read of one <hi>Zisca</hi> a <hi>Bohemian</hi>
Captain, who in eleven Battells
fought in defence of the <hi>Hussites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Pope, and his Confederates;
prevailed, and went away victorious:
Insomuch that at his Death, he willed

if they so did, they would never

            <p>In some of the Forrests of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>

            <head type="sub">ASSIRIA.</head>
            <p>THe Country of <hi>Assiria,</hi> is said to
be so fertile, that the Hedges on
the high way sides, afford very good
Fruit, and the adjoyning Fields affords
to the Passengers the shades of Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,
were it not naturally so, it
would not be much helped by Art, or
Industry; as being but meanly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
and those few without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
either to the planting
Fruits, or manuring the Land. Their
Sheep are commonly fat and fair, but
so over-laded on the Tail both with
Flesh and Fleece, that they hang in
long wreaths to the ground, dragged
after them with no small difficulty,
the Tails of these Sheep frequently
weighing thirty pounds or upward.
'Tis said, that the <hi>Assirians</hi> have a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57821:24"/>
strange way of contracting their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iages,
their Wives they never see till
the day of their Marriage, but hearing
a good report of them; they negotiate
with her Friends, and when agreed,
they meet in the Chancell of the
Church; wherein there is a partition
with a hole in it: The Bridegroom
and his Friends standing on one side;
and the Bride and her kindred on the
other, then that Church-man biddeth
the Bridgeroom to put his hand
through the hole in the partition, and
take his Bride by the hand, which he
doth accordingly; the mother of the
Bride with a sharp pointed Instrument
made of purpose, pricking the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
hand all over with sufficient
eagerness, if when he feeleth the smart,
he lets go her hand, they take it for
a Sign, that he will not love her; but
if he hold her fast, and wring her hand
so hard, till She cry again; they take
it as a very good Omen, and are
glad, they have so well bestowed her.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57821:24"/>
After the Marriage is consummate, if
a Male child be born unto them, the
Father looseth his own name, and is
called after his Sons name; so as if the
Fathers name be <hi>Moses,</hi> and his Sons
name <hi>Ioseph;</hi> the Father is no more
called <hi>Moses,</hi> but Abba <hi>Ioseph;</hi> or the
Father of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> so highly do they
reverence Marriage, and the Fruits
thereof, Posterity.</p>

being absent at the time of her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
She commanded the Nurse to
kill eleven of them; fearing (it seems)
the like shame and punishment, as by
her Instigation was inflicted on the
poor Woman: The Nurse going to
perform this wicked command, was
met by the old Earl, then returning
home-ward: who asked her; what
she had in her Apron, she made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
whelps; he desired to see them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57821:26"/>
she denied him: angry at this refusal,
he opened her Apron, and there found
eleven of his own sweet Babes, and
most of them of promising counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
examining the matter; he
found out the truth, and enjoyning
the old Nurse to be secret in it, he put
the children out to Nurse; six years
being expired, the Earl invited to a
Feast, most of his own and his Ladies
kindred, and attiring the young Boys
all alike, presented them to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who suspecting by the number of

but this place, so beautified and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with such a wonderful Richness
of Soil, and other pleasures, that
might make glad the heart of man;
through the sinfulness of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
is so changed; that after the
Cities and Fields were destroyed by
Fire and Brimstone from Heaven, the
whole Country was turned into a most
horrid stinking Lake, called <hi>Mare
mortuum,</hi> or the <hi>dead Sea.</hi>
            </p>

stinking, bitter, and salt, beyond any

Creature liveth or can live, therefore
called the dead Sea. The River <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
runs into it, and is infected by it;
Insomuch that the Fish of that River
shun the Lake as a deadly Poyson, and
if at any time by the swiftness of the
River, they are driven into it, they
immediately die.</p>
            <p>No living thing can be drowned in

see it; and caused some Persons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Ignorant in swimming, to be
bound with their hands behind them,
and thrown into the Lake, but was
as it were repulsed, by a certain Spirit
of the Water; and like a Rock they
floated upon the superficies of the
Water.</p>
            <p>Every fair Sun-shiny day, it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the colour thrice, by reason of
the Sun Beams falling either. Rightly
or Oblickly upon it, as at Morning
Noon and Sun set, according to
which it varieth the colour, and yields
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57821:29"/>
a certain Pitchy substance, called in
Latin <hi>Bitumen,</hi> which swims upon
the top of the Lake, in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
some pieces as big as an Ox;
and is of such a Nature, that if any
small Ships come near to fetch it away,
they are caught and drawn away by
the Tenacity, or Limy catching
hold thereof, and not to be loosed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
but by application of Urine.
<hi>Tui menses mulierbres permixti sunt,</hi>

the building began to sink, and
was likely to fall, which <hi>Tiberius</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and having before-hand paid him
for the building of it; commanded
him to depart, and never to see him
in the face again. He afterward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
invented the way of making
Glass malyable, or to abide the hamer,
came to shew the same to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in
hopes of obtaining a reward for his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57821:44"/>
nvention, but instead thereof, his
whole Shop was pulled down and laid
waste, least Brass, Gold, and Silver,
should be undervalued in their price
and esteem, Some report that <hi>Tiberius</hi>
did it out of malice and envy, because
he naturally hated learning, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
men: <hi>Petronius</hi> relates the
matter after this manner, saying, <hi>that
there was a skilful Crafts-man, who
made Cups, and Vessels of Glass, of
that firmness that they would no more
break their Pots of Silver or Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when he had made a Viol of
this Glass, and thought it worthy to
be given to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he was brought
with his present before him; <hi>Tiberius</hi>
received the Viol, and much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the workmanship of it, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
more to amaze the beholders, and
that he might make himself a further
way into <hi>Tiberius</hi> favour; took the
Glass-viol again into his hand, and
threw it down upon the pavement
with so great a force, that had it been
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57821:45"/>
made of Gold or Silver, it had been
either broke or bruised. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was
hereat astonished, but the maker took
up his Glass again, which was only a
little bruised, but no where broken;
then taking a hamer out of his pocket,
he beat out the bruise again, and
brought it to 'its right fashion; which
being done, he thought he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
Heaven, gaining at once <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s
Favour and Admiration; But
it fell out otherwise, for <hi>Tiberius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
if any knew that Art but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
<hi>He answered,</hi> none that he knew;
whereupon <hi>Tiberius</hi> commanded, he
should be beheaded; For, (<hi>says he</hi>)
If this Art were publickly known,
Gold and Silver would be no more
esteemed of then Clay.</p>

            <p>'TIs reported, that in ancient times,
there was a certain kind of Flax,
which the Latins called <hi>Linum vivum,</hi>
whereof were made whole pieces of
Linnen-cloth, and Garments, which
could not be consumed by Fire, not
only so, but being cast into the Fire,
the Soil and Dirtiness of it would be
burnt away, and taken out again; it
became more white then any water
could wash it. The Bodies of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Kings were burnt in sheets
of this Linnen, least the Ashes of their
Bodies should mingle with the Ashes
of the Wood: This Flax is hard to be
found, and as difficult to be woven,
by reason of the shortness of it; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57821:47"/>
being found, 'tis equalled in price to
the most excellent Pearls <hi>Nero</hi> is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to have had a linnen Garment of it,
'Tis also reported, that <hi>Podocatarus</hi> a
Knight of <hi>Cyprius,</hi> brought some of it
to <hi>Venice,</hi> or at least a sort of Flax
that could not be consumed by Fire.
Now the Flax of <hi>Cyprus</hi> proceedeth
from no Plant, as our Flax, but from
the stone of <hi>Amiantus,</hi> which being
found in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and Broken, the
earthy dross being purged away, there
remains fine hair threads, like to Flax
which is woven into Cloth; this Flax
was seen in the house of the said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docatarus</hi>
by many men of worth
and credit; wherefore Lime being
made of this stone, and <hi>Incombustible;
Constantine</hi> the Emperour ordained,
that it should always burn in Lamps
in his Chappel at <hi>Rome:</hi> The same
reports <hi>Damasus</hi> in the life of Pope
<hi>Silvester.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith also, that
he saw Lamps at <hi>Paris,</hi> whose lights
never consumed. Also at <hi>Lovain,</hi> a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57821:47"/>
Napkin taken from the table at a Feast,
and thrown into the Fire; and being
red as a Coal, was taken out again,
cooled, and restored to the owner more
white then if it had been washed
with all the water and Soap in the
Town.</p>

to cold: yet in some places they have
Wheat in the Month of <hi>May;</hi> but
their Rice, which is their Principal
sustenance, they gather not before
<hi>September.</hi> The surface of the Earth
clothed with Woods and Forrests, in
which are some Cedars of so tall and
large a body, that one of them only
is sufficient to make a Pillar for a
Church: the Bowels of it stored with
divers Mettals; and amongst others
such inexhaustible Mines of Gold,
<hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> reporteth some of their

Pallaces of their Kings, to be covered
with sheets of Gold, as ours in <hi>Europe</hi>

full of Cattel, but hitherto
not made acquainted with making
of Butter, their Fens much visited with
wild Ducks, as their yards with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
Turtle, Quailes, and Putten.
The People for the most part of a good
understanding, apt to learn, and of
able memories; cunning and subtile
in their dealings, of Body vigorous
and strong, accustomed to bear Arms
till sixty years old, their Complexion
of an Olive-colour, their Beards thin,
and the one half of their hair of their
Heads shaved off, patient they are of
pain, ambitious of Glory, uncapable
of suffering wrong, but can withall
dissemble their resentments of it, till
opportunity of Revenge.</p>
            <p>They reproach no man for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
so it come not by his own
thriftness, for which cause they detest
all kind of Gaming, as the wayes or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57821:49"/>
ill Husbandry; and Generally abhor
Slandering, Swearing, and Theft.
Their Mourning commonly is in
White, as their Feasts in Black; their
Teeth they colour black also, to make
them more beautiful; they mount on
the Right side of the Horse, and sit
(as we use to rise) when they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
In Physiek they eat salt things,
sharp and raw; and in their Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they put off their shooes; The
very Antipodes of our World in
Custom, though not in sight; In other
things they much resemble those of
<hi>China,</hi> if not the more Ceremonious
of the two: washing their Infant
children in the nearest River as soon
as born, and putting on shooes when
they go to meat.</p>
            <p>The People have but one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but that so intermingled with
the words of other Nations, that it
seems rather to be many then one:
they have long used the Art of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

from <hi>China:</hi> the Characters whereof
are a kind of <hi>Burchigraphy,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
not only Letters, but some whole
Words also; in matters of Religion
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> Adorning Anciently the Sun,
Moon, and Stars of Heaven, and
giving Divine honour to wild Beasts,
and the Staggs of the Forrests: but
specially worshipping some of their
Deceased Priests and Princes, by the
names of <hi>Fotoques,</hi> and <hi>Cames;</hi> to
the first of which, they use to pray
for Goods of the other World, and to
the last for Temporal Blessings; Two
Famous Mountains there are, one of
which called <hi>Figenojama,</hi> is said to
Transcend the Clouds in height, the
other (but without a Name,) useth to
cast forth dreadful Flames like <hi>Corsican

Scituation under the torrid <hi>Zone;</hi>
yet very well Inhabited, full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and in some places always green,
well watered, and exceeding fruitful,
Especially in those parts, which lye
within the compass of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of the River <hi>Niger;</hi> and on
the further side of the River <hi>Sanaga,</hi>
abundantly well stored both with
Corn, Cattel, and Garden-ware for
the use of their Kitchings, well woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and those Woods well furnished
with Elephants, and other Beasts;
both wild and tame. Their greatest
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57821:56"/>
want (but such a want as may be born
with) is the want of Fruit-trees, few
of which they have; and those they
have, bear one kind of Fruit only;
which is like the Chesnut, but some
what bitterer; Rain here doth neither
help nor hurt; their greatest Welfare
consisting in the Over-flowings of
<hi>Niger,</hi> as that of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Innun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of <hi>Nile.</hi> In some parts very
liberally enriched with Mines of Gold
and Silver, very fine and pure.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants, till the coming of
the <hi>Portugals</hi> thither, were for the
most part so rude and barbarous, that
they seem to want that use of Reason,
which is peculiar to man; of little
Wit, and destitute of all Arts and
Sciences; prone to Luxury, and for
the greatest part Idolaters, though not
without some admixture of <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
When the <hi>Portugals</hi> first failed
into these parts, the People took the
Ships for great Birds with white wings,
and after upon better acquaintance,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57821:57"/>
they could not be brought to believe,
but that the eyes which were casually
painted on the Beaks of the Ships,
were the eyes by which they saw how
to direct themselves in their Course.
Guns seemed to them for their hideous
noise, to be the Works of the Devil;
and for Bag-pipes they took them to
be living Creatures; neither when
they had been permitted to touch
them, would they be perswaded, but
that they were the work of Gods own
hands: The very Nobles (if so noble
a Name may without offence be given
to such blokish People) are so dull and
stupid, that they are Ignorant of all
things, which belong to civil Society,
and yet so reverent of their King; that
when they are in his presence, they
never look him in the face, but still
flat on their Buttock, with their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows
on their Knees, and their hands
on their faces; they use to anoint their
Hair with the Fat of Fishes, which
makes them stink more wretchedly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57821:57"/>
then they would do otherwise. Of
Complexion they are for the most part
cole-black, whence the name of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes;</hi>
but on the South-side of the
River <hi>Senaga,</hi> they are tawney: The
Blacks so much in love with their own
Complexion, that they use to paint
the Devil White, which I find thus
versified.</p>
            <l>The Land of Negroes is not far from
thence,</l>
            <l>Nearer extended to the <hi>Atlantick</hi>

thereof cut and raze their skin,

the Hills Inhabited by neat herds, and
Sheep herds, breeding great flocks of
Sheep and Cattel; the People are of
no Religion, but live like Beasts
without propriety, so much as in their

differenced by names, as in other
Countrys, but by some mark upon
their Bodies; which though it seem
strange to us of this present Age, yet
was it thus in part with our <hi>Saxon</hi>
Ancestors, whence have we else the
names of White, Black, Brown, Gray,
and Tawney; or those of Long, short,
Low, Curle, Crisp, and others; but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57821:59"/>

their chief City is <hi>Borneo,</hi> where their
King resideth; A Potent Prince who
keepeth in continual pay 3000 Horse,

were of purest Gold.</p>

            <p>'TIs said, the People of <hi>ARABIA,</hi>
had anciently many strange and
barbarous Customs amongst them;
Adultery was punished with Death,
as in other places; but only he was
held an Adulterer, which enjoyed any
that was not his own Kins-Woman,
be she Sister, or Mother; and so they
kept themselves in their own Families.
Community of Wives or Women was
esteemed no Crime; and of this there
is a tale in <hi>Strabo,</hi> that a King of this
Country had fifteen Sons, but one
Daughter, who according to the
Customs hereof, was the common
Wife of all her Brethren; every of
which had a staff of like making,
which when he went in to his Sister,
he did leave at the Door; and by so
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57821:62"/>
doing did forbid enterance to the rest,
till it were removed. The young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
wearied with a continual supply
of Dalliance, secretly procured a staff
like to the rest; which when she was
desirous to prohibit their accesses to
her, she left at her Chamber-Door,
and by that means did many times
enjoy her desired privacy: At last it
happened, that all the Brothers being
together, one of them departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Sisters Lodging; where
finding a staff before the Door, and
knowing that he had left his Brethren
in one place together, he accused her
of Adultery; but the Truth being
made known, the Lady was quitted,
and their Visits afterward restrayned,
of dead Bodies they took no care,
not so much as of their Chiefs, or
Princes; but left them to the custody
of the next Dung-hill.</p>

Husbands on it in former times, they

note for a Remembrance, that they
needed not the use of the Sea, who
knew no better how to make use of

simple, that they could not reckon
