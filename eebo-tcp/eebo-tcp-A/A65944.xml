         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Work of God
IN A
Dying Maid.</head>
            <p>FRiends and People, to whom
these following Lines may
come, these may give you
knowledge, that being spoken unto
by a Friend, of the State of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Wonderful Expressions
that were uttered by this Maid now
Deceased, made me desirous to see
her, and as a Mother fearing God,
knowing what Joy it must be to
have a Child that had Transgressed,
to turn to the Lord with all the
Heart, and to find Acceptance with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100092:3"/>
the Almighty, as I have cause
to believe she did; for he was
with her, and I felt a living Power
to opperate in her, that neither her
Youth, nor Comliness, with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
outward Expectation, that she
formerly had or might have of the
Glory of this World, left a place in
her to desire any longer Life in this
World, but as she had before I
came, cryed out against her self, for
loving and going to these Vanities
and Parish Places of Worship; so
now in my hearing she was much
raised in her Spirit, in the Sense of
the Joy that she believed she was
entring into, praying and praising
the Lord with a pleasant Melody,
and desiring also that <hi>her Mother
might be taken out of this Wicked
World:</hi> I felt the Loving-kindness
of God unto her, and she was
brought near to me; the Lord
shewed me <hi>she must Dye,</hi> and being
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100092:3"/>
the Only Child of her Parents; and
having heard this tender-hearted
Mother, had buried her Only Son
not a Quarter of a Year before,
which by relation was an excellent
Child for his Years, not being Six
and an Half, for Wisdom and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Outward Comliness a very
Beautiful Child, and one of a great
Courage, yet of a very tender,
sweet, loving Nature, and more
than all, in Soberness pursuing of
the better part, so I felt and know
in these sudden and renewing Trials
there was Judgment; and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Mother's Quiet and Patient
bearing of it, had this brought to
my Remembrance, <hi>That they are
blessed that can stand in Judgment;</hi>
and none but a Tender Mother can
tell what it is to have Hopeful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
so soon taken from them, and
fee the Lord is Righteous in what
he doth; and I that have drunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100092:4"/>
this Cup, and a more bitter one,
must confess, <hi>The Lord is Righteous
in all, and his Judgments are true,
but his Mercies are over all his Works,
and his Love Everlasting, and who
lives therein, gives Thanks for all
things;</hi> and this appears to me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be known and retained, that
so Young a Hopeful and Beautiful
Maid should be taken off from her
Vanity, yet that the Mercy of the
Lord should so freely extend it self
unto her, that she might testifie
against her own, and the World's
Vanities and Worships; and tho'
but in the last Hour, the Lord of
Goodness granted her an Entrance
into his Vineyard, and Power she
received to magnifie his Justice and
Mercy, that out of the Mouths of
Babes and Sucklings will perfect his
own Praise: And sure I am, the

               <hi>SVsanna Whitrow</hi> sickned the <hi>5th</hi>
Day of the <hi>3d</hi> Month, 1677.
and lay until the <hi>9th</hi> Day, under
great Judgment and Terrors of the
Lord for Sin and Iniquity, and
about Four in the Afternoon she
broke forth in exceeding Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
crying to the Lord for <hi>Mercy,</hi>

her Cries, and answered the Desire

Mercy from the Lord, then
did she fall into an exceeding travil
in Soul and Spirit, praying mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Lord in the behalf of her
Father, and so lay four or five Hours
crying earnestly to the Lord for her
Father, before we writ down any of
her Words. Her Natural Spirits
were almost spent before these
Words were taken as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Lord, Remember not his Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
let me bear them, Lord, let
it be easie to him, Lord, make the
Way easie; make his Friends to

mayst have Mercy on him: Lord
his Temptations are great; Lord,
carry him through, O let him not
perish with the World; Lord, do

Lord, help him: O Lord, hear
me; O my Lord, I have not
strength left; O Lord take him
to thee; but, Lord, grant me my
Request; O Lord, help me; Lord,
take not away my Strength before
thou hast granted my Desire. O
Lord, my Desire is not to live in
this Abominable World: Lord, if
thou take me not to thy self the
Tempter will come again: O
Lord, my Heart can never rest,
until thou hast turned him to thy

without any Satisfaction? O
Lord, shall I have no help for my

Distress? O Lord, Lord, there is
no way for him but to Watch and
Pray continually, lest the Tempter

O Lord, had not my Eyes
been in those Vanities, my Heart

CONCERNING
Susanna Whitrow,
To her Mother. A few Words which were expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by this precious Child in
the time of her Illness.</head>
            <p>I Not thinking she was so near
her End, did not bear in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
as many of her Words as I
might have done: I can truly say,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100092:7"/>
I was much refreshed in seeing the
great Work and Power of the Lord
upon her, and hearing the precious
Words that proceeded out of her
Mouth: When first I came to see
her, she had lain about a Weekill;
she seemed to be in much Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Pain, and crying out to
the Lord, saying, <hi>O Lord, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
has wounded my Heart, he has
wounded my Head, and he has wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Hell; Come Lord, I make room,
I make room, my Heart is open: O rip
me up, and set me in thy Bosome, as
thou didst the last Night: O, I feel
the Enemy coming in like a Flood;
Lord, drive him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time I went to visit
her, when she was in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
of Spirit and Body, and her
Mother withdrew from her, to
seek the Lord, leaving her Father
by her Bed-side, in which time she
uttered little or nothing, but lay
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100092:7"/>
Groaning (she would hardly suffer
her Mother to be from her, if she could
help it) after a while her Mother
came again, and she said, <hi>O Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cease not, Cease not,</hi> though no
one had told her, that her Mother
was a praying to the Lord, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as she had a sence of it in her self;
and when her Mother came to her
again, she was in a sweet still
Frame of Spirit, and cryed out,
<hi>Ah! my dear Mother, O my blessed
Mother, the Lord has shewed me, my
Mother shall have a double Portion of
his Spirit, yea, my Mother shall have
a double Portion.</hi> This she spoke
several times over, with many more
precious Words, that are past out of
my Mind.</p>
            <p>Another time I came to see her,
a Day or two before she dyed, and
her Countenance was changed, and
she looked very sweetly, and lay
praising the Lord, saying, <hi>Oh my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100092:8"/>
Saviour, my blessed Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time her Mother went
out of the Room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in to the next
Room about some Business, and
she called earnestly to her Mother,
and said, <hi>Ah! Mother, I had much
in my Heart to have spoke to thee: Care
not for this World; a little will
serve us, we shall not want; the Lord
will feed his People as he did</hi> Elisha
<hi>by the</hi> Ravens; <hi>yea, the Lord will feed

            <q>
               <p> My
dear Mother, I thank you; but
that Man is no more to me than
one I never saw with my Eyes,
neither will I ever him, if he had
all the Possessions of the Earth: It's
true, there was something betwixt
us, he being very urgent with me
upon the account of Marriage,
proffering to settle a considerable
Estate on me, and my Father at
that time being a little harsh to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100092:9"/>
me, I thought I would set my self
at Liberty; but upon better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
I told him, I would do
nothing without my Father and
Mother's Advice, which he was
unwilling to; in that and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things I was dis-satisfied; I
considered, if I should have him, I
should be ruined; so, that small
Affection I had to him, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;
and before I fell sick this
last time, I did desire never to see
him more: And now, my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I am clear of him, and all
Men living.</p>
               <p>Oh, my bowed down and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted
Mother! What hath
been thy Sufferings in this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
Oh! how hast thou been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with our Iniquities? Ah,
bowed down! Ah! how often hast
thou told my Father, <hi>The Lord
would visit him with sore and grievous
Judgment if he did not Repent, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100092:9"/>
turn from the Evil of his Ways?</hi>
Ah! how often hast thou said, <hi>The
Lord would plead thy Righteous Cause
with us?</hi> Now the Day is come,
thou hast so long warned us of;
now the Lord is risen; now the
Lord is broke in upon us. Oh how
great hath been thy Care and Pains,
which thou hast taken to bring us
into the Fear of the Lord? Oh,
thou Blessed of the Lord! Great
shall be thy Reward, the Lord will
give thee <hi>Beauty</hi> for <hi>Ashes,</hi> and the
Garment of <hi>Praise</hi> for the Spirit of
<hi>Heaviness:</hi> Bleffed be thou my
Mother.</p>
            </q>
            <p> Her Mother being at
that time Praising and Magnifying
the Lord; then she said, <q>My bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

thee concerning me, <hi>That my Soul
should bless thee, and thy Soul should
bless the Lord.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p> Then she broke

Praises unto the Lord.</p>

Lord, I am Poor, I am Needy, I

stand by me, move not from me;
for if thou go, the Tempter will

art my Saviour; thou shalt save
me from the Tempter. My dear

me the other day; she is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

a Woman's speaking in a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
but now, whether it comes
from Man, Woman or Child, it is
precious indeed. O that I could be
with my Mother, the Lord is with
her, that I might have a little time
longer, that my dear Mother and I
might go in the <hi>Country,</hi> and walk

               <p>My dear Mother, thou often

my Mother, I have heard God's

Lyars, Drunkards and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers:
Ah! my blessed Saviour
said, <hi>We should know them by their
Fruits.</hi> O these were my Cursed
Fruits which I brought forth when
I was a Hearer of that Church,
Pride and Disobedience to my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents:
How often have I adorned
my self as fine in their Fashions as
I could make me, yet they have
looked upon me with Scorn, and
despised my Dress, and said unto me,
<hi>How like a Taudrey you have drest your
self? You are not at all in the Mode:</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100092:13"/>
then I came home on their Sabbath
Day, and gone immediately up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Chamber, and locked the
Door, and altered all my Laces,
and so I have gone to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the Afternoon Drest in their
Mode, and then I have pleased
them. Pray my dear Mother call
my Father, I have something to
say to him, I desire my Body may
not be laid in that abominable
place, but among the People of the
Lord called <hi>Quakers;</hi> for now I
am a true <hi>Quaker,</hi> now I tremble
before the Lord and his Holiness;
Come ye holy Prophets, who
were <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Tremblers</hi> at the
Word of the Lord; come <hi>Moses,
Jeremiah;</hi> come holy <hi>Habakkuk,</hi>
now I am one with thee, now my
Belly Trembles, my Lips Quiver,
and my Heart Drops, because of
the Lord, and the greatness of his

O my Lord, yea my Lord; for

               <p>O Lord, my Strength fails; my
Father, my heavenly Father; I
wait upon thee; renew my
Strength, my holy Father; be
pleased to restore me to my former
Health; then I will wait diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon thee, I will sit on the

after the sight of my Eyes. My
dear Mother, pray for me; for
whatsoever thou askest of the Lord
it shall be given thee. The reason
why I desire to live is, <hi>because I
have so greatly dishonoured the Lord
in my former Life, and now I would
live the rest of my time to his praise:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100092:14"/>
For now if I live, I shall be as one rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

would not believe.</p>
            </q>
            <p>She was exceedingly filled with
the Indignation of the Lord against
the Priests, and spoke very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Idle Practices and their
Abominable Ways, which is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the Maid-Servant writ down as she

<hi>there are degrees of Glory, and
as the Creature acts here for the Lord,
so shall its Reward be hereafter:</hi> I
have done nothing for the Lord,
but he hath done all for me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desire to live, that I might
live a Holy and Righteous Life,
that my Conversation might be in
Heaven, though my Body be here
on the Earth, that I might invite
all, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>to taste and see
how good the Lord is:</hi> They have
tasted of their perishing Life of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi>
yea they they have drunk a full
Cup, their Measure is running over;
O, but they never tasted the Joys,
the unspeakable Ravishments of
Soul that attend the humble holy
Life of <hi>Jesus:</hi> Oh, if they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tasted the least Mite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they would bid adue to all
their dirty Life of Vanity; ah, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100092:15"/>
would not dare to spend their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Time in adorning themselves
like <hi>Jezabels,</hi> Patching and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and Curling their Monstrous
Heads; but O the <hi>Christian Life</hi> is
another thing, they must not give
themselves the liberty to think
their own Thoughts, much less
to act such Abominations as these.</p>
            </q>
            <p>After she had lain a while Prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Magnifying the Lord, then
she spoke very deep and weighty
things, which are not set down,
concerning the <hi>Wise Virgins</hi> and
their <hi>Lamps burning,</hi> and exhorted
all to keep very diligently upon
their Watch; for said she, <q>The
Lord will come as a Thief in the
Night, and in a Day when he is
not looked for; therefore Watch
and Pray continually; here the
Tempter cannot enter; this is the
<hi>way</hi> my Saviour spake off, when
he said, <hi>You must take up your daily
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100092:16"/>
Cross;</hi> this is that <hi>Flaming Sword,</hi>
which is spoken of, you must <hi>pass
through</hi> mark that, you must <hi>pass
through, it before you can come to the
Tree of Life;</hi> this is the <hi>Cup</hi> my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
asked if you could drink off;
and this was that <hi>Baptism</hi> he asked
if you could be <hi>baptized</hi> withal:
Come all you that call your selves
<hi>Christians,</hi> what of the Life of Holy
<hi>Jesus</hi> is in you? who was a <hi>Man of
Sorrows;</hi> you light and airy Ones,
you wild and wanton Ones, you
that are Lovers of Pleasures more
than God, you Workers of Iniquity
who are always crying, <hi>Lord, Lord,
but do not the things that I say,</hi> this
shall be your dreadful Doom, that
<hi>you are SATERS, but not DOERS;</hi>
you Workers of Iniquity, that
think you can never have enough
of the Pride of Life, the Lust of the
Eye, which is not of my heavenly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100092:16"/>
Father; and so <hi>you are of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
the Devil; for his Servants
you are whom you obey.</hi>
               </q> At another
time she said, </p>
            <q>
               <p>I have heard them
say, that <hi>my Mother is so grounded
in her Religion, that it is impossible
ever to turn her.</hi> My Mother is
grounded indeed, she is established
upon the Rock that shall never be
moved; my Mother shall never
be moved; her Name is written
in Heaven; yea, in the Lamb's
Book of Life; it is sealed, it is sealed,
the Lord hath told me so, and bid
me tell her, <hi>There should none be able
to pluck her out of his Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come my blessed Mother, I have
something to say to thee, thou art
<hi>Mary,</hi> thou art <hi>Mary;</hi> my Mother,
thou hast chosen that good part
which shall never be taken from
thee; thou shalt sit continually at
the feet of thy Lord; Ay, this is
my Mother's Portion; O what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100092:17"/>
Portion is like this? this is more
than to sit in the Thrones of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be ye holy as I the Lord your God
am holy;</hi> this they say is <hi>Impossible.</hi>
O, would the holy, just and true
Lord command that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible?
In this they count the
Lord a hard Master: O but what
can my Soul say of thy Power,
when I sought thee, but could not
find thee, I knocked hard, but
none would open? for my Sins
stood like Mountains, that I could
not come near thee, I would fain
have prayed, but could not; I lay
several days and nights prostrate
before thee, strugling for Life, but
could find none; and I said, <hi>There
is no Mercy for me;</hi> then said I, <hi>I
will never leave thee; if I perish, I
will perish here; I will never cease
crying unto thee:</hi> Then I heard a
Voice say, <hi>Jacob wrestled all night
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100092:17"/>
before he obtained the blessing:</hi> O
then thy Word was strength to
my Soul; O then my stony Heart
was broken to pieces before the
Lord; and then the Spirit of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Supplication was poured
into my Soul; and now I can
sing, as <hi>David</hi> did, of Mercy and
Judgment; unto thee, O Lord,
will I sing; O with a rended
Heart, and my Mouth in the Dust
will <hi>I</hi> sing Praises unto thee my
blessed Saviour. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>For several days she had a very
great conflict in Soul and Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Tempter; and strong
were her Cryes to the Lord for
strength to overcome the Enemy;
she was so deeply engaged in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
War of the Lord against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
that she would not suffer her
Head to be removed from the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but said, <hi>It must be, as it were,
nailed there till she had overcome the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100092:18"/>
Tempter;</hi> she said, <hi>I would not suffer
a thought to wander, if I move I shall
be drawn off my Watch, and then the
Tempter will prevail;</hi> then she had
a Vision, and as it were the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of an Angel, giving us the
full description thereof, which we
have forgot, only that it was array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>White;</hi> she had also a Vision
of the Tempter, which she said
<hi>stood before her bound in Chains;</hi> then
she said, <hi>It is finished, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
my Saviour hath bound him;</hi>
then she broke forth into Blessing,
and Praising, and Magnifying the
Lord, that it is beyond the Tongue
of Utterance to give a Relation
thereof; for many Days and Nights
together she would hardly suffer
her self to Slumber, but would wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her self to sing Praises unto the
Lord, and to declare of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
Works that he hath done for
her Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:100092:18"/>
Some Friends came into the
Room, but she saw them not, and
after many sweet and precious
Words, she said,</p>
            <q>
               <p> Don't you Feast,
but Fast; you are the People that
must Fast and Pray; and be you
contented with mean things; O
what matter for fine Houses, or
silken Apparel; O remember him
that sate on the Ground, but wore
a Garment without a Seam, our
blessed holy Lord, who went up
to the Mountain to Pray, that
with-drew himself into Gardens
and Desolate Places of the Earth,
my Soul hath Fellowship with
him. O my dear Mother, if it
please our dear and heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to spare me this time, we will
get us into the Country to some
little remote Place, amongst the
Woods, where none can hear us:
O then shall our Crys pierce thro'
the Heavens, which shall make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100092:19"/>
the Earth to Ring, and the Birds
shall hear the Eccho thereof: O,
there, my blessed Mother, will we
sing Praises, Praises, Praises with
rended Hearts, and our Mouthes
in the Dust, to the one holy, holy
Lord. O thou Glorious One, thou
hast overcome my Heart, thou hast
ravished my Soul; O thou pure,
pure holy One, what shall I say of
thee? or what shall I render to
thee, for thy loving-kindness to me?
O my Heart is overcome with thy
love, Praises be unto thee for thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindness
to me. O how shall
I do to set forth thy Goodness;
for my Heart drops before thee?</p>
               <p>Lord, if it be thy holy Pleasure
to take me out of this Life, then
let me have, I beseech thee, one
whole Day, that my Tongue may
never cease Praising thee.</p>
            </q>
            <p> And
the Lord answered her Request.</p>
            <p>All that Day she was wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100092:19"/>
filled with the sweet Solace of the
heavenly Life, singing Praises and
Hallelujahs to the Lord, and spoke
very much concerning the Lamb
and his Followers, which had
washed their Robes and made them
White in the Blood of the Lamb;
and towards the evening, while the
Power of the Lord was upon her,
there came in two Persons to see her,
and she uttered many precious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Words, which were not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in Writing at which time these
Words were spoken by her, <hi>O what
matter for fine Houses and silken Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearel:</hi>
and so went on above half
an hour, and with a very great
weight upon her Spirit, saying, <hi>O</hi>
Israel, <hi>what hath thy God done for
thee?</hi> &amp; then uttering many deep &amp;
weighty Words, she said, <hi>The
Daughters of</hi> Sion <hi>are Haughty, they
go with their out-stretched Necks, and
their wanton Eyes;</hi> uttering many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100092:20"/>
more deep Words; then taking up an
inward Lamentation, she said, <hi>O what
shall we do for the Daughters of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem?</p>
            <p>After several Days lying in the
sweet Solace and heavenly Life of
the Lord (in which time she utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many heavenly things, which
were not taken in Writing) she did
express these Words,</p>
            <q>
               <p> O thou Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of my Soul! what shall I
say of thee? for thou art too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
for me: O Praises be unto
thee: O come all ye holy Prophets,
praise you the Lord with me: O
praise the Lord O my Soul, upon
the loud-sounding Instrument; ye
Glorious Angels, you that excel
in Glory, sing praises to him that
sits upon the Throne: O how am
I overcome! Ye Stones in the
Street why rise ye not up to praise
him that lives forever? O thou
Light, praise thou the Lord; and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100092:20"/>
thou Darkness, praise and exalt
him above all things forever: O
thou Son and Moon, ye Stars in
the Firmament of his Power, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Lord above all forever:
O all ye Fishes in the Sea, why
come ye not forth to praise the
Lord, the mighty God, who gives
you Breath and Being? I will
praise thee my holy Lord God,
whilest I have any Breath: O praise
the Lord O my Soul, sing praises to
the God of my Salvation: O my
holy One, my holy One, thou
hast overcome my Heart: Ah!
thou hast ravished my Soul. My
dear Mother, I shall be as a new
born Babe; I shall be very simple;
but bear with me; for the Lord is
with me.</p>
               <p>My dear Mother, I must lay
down this Body, the Lord will
not trust me longer in this <hi>wicked
World;</hi> happy am I, my Saviour,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100092:21"/>
my Soul loves thee dearly; thy
love is better then Wine; my
Saviour, my holy One; how Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
art thou? I have seen thy
Glory; I am overcome, my Heart
is overcome with thy sweet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
O how lovely art thou!
I am ravished, my Heart is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
with thy innocent looks,
with the sweet smiles of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Countenance: O come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
come away; why dost thou
stay? I am ready, I am ready.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then lying some time very still I
heard her in a heavenly Harmony,
in which frame of Spirit she depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without either Sigh or Groan.</p>

            <p>OH Lord! Did I ever ask Riches or
Honour of thee? But I have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Wisdom and Understanding; for I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100092:21"/>
said in my Heart, <hi>The Marchandise of
that, is better than the Marchandise of Gold
and Silver;</hi> O Lord, thou art that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
my Soul asked, which cometh from
above; that is first pure, and then holy,
and thou art that Understanding my
Heart sought for, more than for hidden
Treasures; and did I ever ask Silver
or Gold, or Houses, or Lands, for my
Childrens Portion? but I have asked the
Fear of the Lord; for I know right-well,
if they had that, they had all
Treasures: Ah! Glory, Glory, Glory be
unto thee for what thou hast given me;
O my Soul doth magnifie the Lord, &amp; my
Spirit doth livingly rejoyce in the God
of my Salvation, who hath had regard
to the low Estate of his Hand-maid,
Oh! what shall I render unto thee for
all thy Mercies towards me? but to
stand continually upon my Watch-Tower,
and to keep in my Wards whole
Nights, that when my Lord comes in
the second Watch, or in the third
Watch, he may find me with my Loyns
girded, and my Light burning, that so
I may be ready in Body, Soul &amp; Spirit, to
enter into the Joy of my Lord. Oh my
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100092:22"/>
Soul! what hath the Lord been to thee
here? even a place of broad Rivers:
O the Height and Length, &amp; the Depth
and Breadth of the Love of God to my
Soul, in this State: Oh! how hast thou
come in and Supped with me, and caused
me to eat of the Banket that thou hadst
prepared, and caused me to drink of the
Wine of thy Kingdom; so that my Cup
hath overflowed, as it doth at this time,
in the remembrance of thy gracious
Goodness, what thou hast been to me
in the day of Tryal, and in the many
Tribulations, how thou didst set my
Feet upon a Rock, and didst establish my
Goings, Praises be unto thee; and yet
this was a small thing of thy glorious
Goodness, and bountiful Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but thou hast also given my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
a Name amongst the Living, and
Crowned them with Eternal Life: Oh,
Eternal Praises, and endless Hallelujahs
be given unto thee, our everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Oh did I ever think in the day
when thou led'st me down into the
Deep, that I should have thus beheld thy
Wonders in this the day of thy mighty
Power, wherein thou hast returned me
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100092:22"/>
the Answers of my Petitions, when I said
unto thee, <hi>Let my Children be thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
otherwise I desire none; for one Child
in thy Fear, O Lord, is more to me, than a
Thousand in the Spirit of this World:</hi> Then
did thy Presence over-shadow me, &amp; my
Soul was sweetly solaced in thy Love;
Oh! then thou answered'st me and said
<hi>I will be a Father to thy Children, and a
Husband unto thee.</hi> Oh, thou Faithful
One! who is a God like unto thee,
keeping Covenant with them that Fear
thee? for now thou hast performed thy
Word unto thy Servant, Glory be to
thee forever. Oh, thou Holy One! what
hast thou done for me? no Heart can
conceive, no Tongue can express the
Riches of thy Love; for thou hast given
me my Children again in the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy most holy Life, though their
Tabernacle be gone to its place, yet they
live with me in the Spirit, for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is with the Holy One. And
now, O Lord, what am I, or what
is my Family, that thou shouldst
shew this great Kindness to? not unto
me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto
thy Name be the Praise; for what am I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100092:23"/>
that I should offer up an Offering unto
the Lord? for out of the Willingness
of my Heart have I offered my Children
unto the Lord, although my Children
were as dear to me as my Life, and I
could have laid down my Life for theirs,
if the Lord had required it; yet I durst
not ask thier Life of the Lord, although
my dear Child so much desired it; but I
said unto the Lord, <hi>Glorifie thy Name, let

Hand thou hast brought this to pass, and
for the Exaltation of thy glorious Name,
thou powerful God, art striking Dread
and Terror into the Hearts of thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and all that will not bow to thee

of thy Princely Dominion, whose

have robbed thee of thy Right, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained

now thou art come, now thy Day is

of thy holy Prophets, <hi>That thou wilt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

the Man of Sin out of his Throne,
and set thy Son upon thy holy Hill; yea the

            <head>Concerning my dear Son JASON.</head>
            <p>I Need not speak much; for most that
knew him, did know what manner
of Child he was; both in Person and
Parts natural; therefore I shall only give
a small Relation of some of the sensible
Words that came from him before he
fell sick, for the Satisfaction of some
that desire it. Before he went to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
School,</hi> he was in a most sweet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
frame of Spirit, and had such a
Zeal for Truth, that if any Lightness or
Airyness did appear in any, at that time
he was a continual Reprover of such;
the precious Words that came from him
at that time are past out of Mind; I writ
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100092:24"/>
down some of them, but they are lost,
he delighted exceedingly to hear me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
the noble Acts of the Lord, and
would be exceedingly broken; he would
often pray when he was alone; he did
earnestly desire his Father upon his
Death-bed, <hi>That he would let him go from
him to the Wall, that he might pray to
his God:</hi> He desired much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with me concerning God and his
Kingdom, and would ask me deep
Questions, with such heavenly Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to the Astonishment of the
Hearers, that I have often said in my
Heart, <hi>This is the Inspiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
that gives my Child this Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:</hi>
He loved the Lord and his
People, and would often say, when he
saw any that he thought were good
Friends, <hi>It made his Heart glad to see
them:</hi> He would often say, <hi>If I live, I
shall be a good</hi> Quaker; <hi>I shall go forth,
and declare the Word of the Lord; I shall
be a true Minister; I will not Preach for
Hire; I will proclaim the dreadful Day of
the Lord against the Wicked.</hi> About three
days before he fell sick, he said unto me,
<hi>Mother, the next time I go to the Tavern
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100092:24"/>
they will bid me preach a Sermon to them in
Latine; then I will say unto them, I will
preach you a Sermon in English; and they
will bid me say on; then I will say,</hi> Wo to
the proud Persons, Wo to the Scoffers,
Wo to the Drunkards of <hi>England;</hi> Wo
unto them that rise early to follow
Drunkenness, and to them that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
until Night, till the Wine doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
them; you Workers of Iniquity,
what will you do in the dreadful Day of
the Lord, that is coming upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
for because you have wasted the
good Creatures upon your Lust, the
Lord will bring a Famine upon <hi>England.
Mother, sometimes I have such a Trouble
in me, that I am not so good as I would be,
that I play so much, and do not every thing
as you would have me; I pray to the Lord,
and I say,</hi> Lord, destroy this wicked
One in me, and put thy fear into my
Heart, that I may never do any thing
that shall displease thee; <hi>yet for all this,
the Devil will come in, and take my mind
off the Lord; oh, then I am so troubled that
I say,</hi> Lord have Mercy upon me. The
day before he fell sick, he did take me
by the hand, and said, <hi>Mother, I shall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100092:25"/>
dye, oh, that you might dye with me, that
we might both go to the Lord together:</hi> Then
I said, <hi>my dear Child, why dost thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to dye?</hi> He answered, <hi>That I might
be always with my dear Lord God, and out
of this Wicked World.</hi> When at any time
he had seen me retired unto the Lord, he
hath sate down by me, and would be
mightily broken, and hath often said,
weeping, <hi>Oh that I did enjoy that that you
enjoy Oh, that I did know what the Fear of
the Lord was, that my Heart might be made
glad, as yours is.</hi> The Lord shewed me
when he was three Years of Age, <hi>he was
his beloved Child, and he would take him;</hi>
and from that time I have expected his
Death.</p>
            <p>He departed this Life, not being Six
Years and a half Old.</p>
