            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IN the late ſcribling age, having caſt my eye upon ſeveral Books, Pamphlets, or what elſe they might be called, (things in Print) and conſidering the Contents, I have often thought the Authors could have no other ground or deſign for expoſing them to publick view, but a ſtrong deſire to be ſeen in Print. Believe me, I am not troubled with any ſuch ambitious Itch: No, 'tis ill luck preſſes me to the Print, to make relation of my friends and own miſhap; which may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the greater, in that it fell in a time when I and all our</hi> Engliſh <hi>World were joval and pleaſant, in that merry moneth of</hi> May <hi>wherein his ſacred Majesty returned to his Kingdoms, and great part of it on the day (when my ſelf and many thouſands more were attending on his Princely train) before his return to his Royal Palace of</hi> White-Hall, <hi>viz.</hi> 28. Maii 1660. <hi>Expect not from me any neat, polite diſcourſe, (for I am as bad a Poliſher, as a Polititian.) I ſhall only preſent thee with a bare relation of matter of fact, and my deſign of making it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, is two fold, respecting thee, that by what thou ſeest to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my friends and me, thou mayſt be admoniſhed to be very cautious and wary how thou haſt to doe in any deſign of Trade and Commerce, where the</hi> Dutch <hi>have any pretence of Concern or Intereſt, and</hi> bonum eſt fugienda aſpicere alieno in malo, <hi>And my ſelf, to beg the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and help of thy good Counſel for my future demeanor, whether I ſhall be farther active, and if ſo, how to proceed; or meerly paſſive, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quietly ſtill, and bewailing the latter loſs with the former; for I have been at a very great (it may ſeem incredible) expence in</hi> Zealand, Holland, <hi>and ſome here, in ſeeking reſtitution of (or ſatisfaction for) our unjuſtly ſurprized and detained Goods. I ſaid I would preſent thee with a relation of matter of fact.</hi> Know therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43899:3"/>That having done ſome ſervice to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> my Partner <hi>Abraham Jacob,</hi> an Engliſh Merchant reſident in <hi>Lisboa,</hi> in the latter end of the year 1658. procured a licence for ſending a Ship to the <hi>Brazil,</hi> in the Interval of fleets, (for by our Articles with that Crown, <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips, or ſhips fraighted by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> men, may go in company of their <hi>Portuguez</hi> fleet to <hi>Brazil,</hi> and freely trade there) and by reaſon of the warre with <hi>Spain</hi> no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship of conſiderable burthen arriving in the Harbour of <hi>Lisboa</hi> that would embrace a fraight for <hi>Brazil,</hi> he was forced to make uſe of a <hi>French</hi> ſhip (not out of choice or kindneſs to that Nation, to give <hi>French men</hi> imployment; but meerly in abſence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men) that accidently put in there, and wanted a fraight, One of thirty four Guns; this Ship was hired by the ſaid <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Jacob,</hi> and in the beginning of the year 1659 diſpatched away for the <hi>Rio de Janeiro</hi> in <hi>Brazil,</hi> with a very conſiderable Cargazon of Goods from himſelf, beſides what was laden by ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants (and ſome by <hi>Portugueſſes</hi>) reſiding in <hi>Lisboa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Ship belonged to St. <hi>Mallo,</hi> was called the <hi>Golden Sun,</hi> commanded by one <hi>Nicholas le Bretoa du Pre,</hi> &amp; returning for the Port of <hi>Lisboa,</hi> the place of her diſcharge, laden with Sugars, Hides, <hi>Brazil</hi> wood <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the two &amp; twenty day of <hi>May,</hi> 1660. near the Rock of <hi>Lisboa,</hi> was met by four <hi>Fluſhing</hi> men of warre commanded by <hi>Touſain le Sage, Philip Ros, Albert Janſon,</hi> and <hi>Mattyas Q<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

of thoſe people that were in Hoſtility and Warre with them, as aforeſaid. But the Commanders of the Men of Warre, or Capers, (for ſo are they called in <hi>Zealand</hi>) thought not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to the obſervance of any Treaty of Peace, or Law, or Juſtice; and therefore inſtead of permitting (as they ought to have done) the Ship to follow, and proceed in her Voyage, they ſet on ſhore many of the Ships Company in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and took poſſeſſion of the Ship, and ſent Her and her Commander accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed by one of the Men of Warre for <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> where arriving, the <hi>French</hi> Commander addreſſes himſelf to the <hi>States</hi> General, and demanded to be reſtored to the poſſeſſion of the Ship and Goods, according to the Articles of <hi>Marine</hi> aforementioned, and reparation for the damage ſuſtained, by being ſeized on and brought in thither, and was aſſiſted therein by <hi>Mounſieur de Thou,</hi> then at the <hi>Hague</hi> Ambaſſador from the <hi>French</hi> King, who was the ſame Perſon that concluded the ſaid Treaty of <hi>Marine</hi>; and a ſhort time after I received advice and information from my Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Abraham Jacob,</hi> and from <hi>Robert Carre, Chriſtopher Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, William Peachey, Thomas Boſtocke,</hi> and <hi>William Truſſel, Engliſh</hi> Merchants reſident in <hi>Lisboa,</hi> of their ſeveral intereſts aboard the ſaid Ship, and their Procurations or Letters of Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for looking after them, and procuring ſatisfaction on their behalf; whereupon I humbly repreſented their caſe to his moſt Sacred Majeſty our Soveraign, who was graciouſly pleaſed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſend his Letters to the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Zealand,</hi> requiring and preſſing them to cauſe a reſtitution to be made of ſuch part of the Ships lading as belonged to his Subjects aforenamed, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty uſed an expreſſion enough not only to have won upon, but to have commanded any ingenuous natures; <hi>For,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he would look upon ſuch a reſtitution, as an Action demonſtrating their willingneſſe of holding amity and confederacy with him</hi>: This Letter was dated 5th. of <hi>July</hi> 1660. and a few dayes after I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Zealand,</hi> who were at that time aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Midleburg.</hi> They ſeemed to be very glad to receive a Letter from his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> being the firſt they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had from him, (at leaſt ſince his happy Return to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.)

            <p>This Anſwer or reſolution was an invitation or introduction to a Law-Suit, which I was very much averſe from entring into, well knowing what bad ſucceſs, ſome of our Country men had had by ſuch like proceeding in <hi>Zealand,</hi> neither could I obtain a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, or Order, that in caſe of making due proof of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I ſhould have the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt cleared and reſtored to me.

            <p>Upon conference and adviſing with friends here in <hi>England,</hi> 'twas thought fit we ſhould Proſecute our Claimes in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of <hi>Zealand,</hi> according to the States direction, and chiefely for this reaſon, That we could not have any great cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or make out an aggrievance whereupon to beg relief from his ſacred Majeſty our gratious Soveraign, till we were denyed Juſtice there, it not being known, but that they would decree to us our Goods with damages; and withal being informed, that the Lords of the Admiralty could if they pleaſed in ſhort time bring the cauſe to ſentence, their cuſtome being to ſit in Court 3. days in a week, I therefore gave order for proceeding with a Claime before them, in the names of my ſeveral friends intereſſed, And for proof of their property did referre to the Evidence in the poſſeſſion of the Capers, as the Commanders Book, the Bills of lading, Invoices and Letters of Advice, of which they had ſecond and third Via's alſo, and my friends, as yet, none at all,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43899:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for it happen'd that a few days after, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 27. or 28. <hi>May</hi> old ſtile, the three remaining Capers, or Men of War, near the place where the 4. ſurpriz'd the <hi>Golden-Sun,</hi> met with the ſhip <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Commanded by one <hi>John Kingſman,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Port of <hi>Bahia</hi> in <hi>Brazil,</hi> whom they alſo ſurprized, (aboard which ſhip my friends aforenamed had Goods likewiſe to the value of 1200 <hi>l. ſter.</hi> and upwards, and in her company took 2. <hi>Portugueſſe</hi> Veſſells that came from the <hi>Rio de Janeiro</hi> (the ſame Port whence the <hi>Golden Sun</hi> was laden) and in them 2d. and 3d. avizo's of what had been laden for account of each particular perſon reſpectively aboard the ſaid ſhip, Which (by command of the Lords of the Admiralty) being brought before them into Court, there appeared there were conſigned unto them aboard the ſaid ſhip for their own accompts 271. Cheſts and 11. Fechos Sugars, all (except ſome few) whites, (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>) worth 5000 <hi>l. ſter.</hi> which was afterward confirmed, and made out by ſuch like Evidence which came to my friends own hands from <hi>Brazill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I began to follow my Claim, I ſoon found the Adverſe parties that appeared againſt me were very great and powerfull perſons in <hi>Zealand, viz.</hi> (beſides the Commanders of the Men of War, who had alliance ſtrong enough there) the whole <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Company of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as Granters of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Everard Gyſelinck</hi> who was at the ſame time Burgo Maſter for <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and conſequently one of the States of <hi>Zealand</hi>) <hi>Jacob Van Hoorne,</hi> — <hi>Everſon</hi> of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and ſeveral other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons as Owners &amp; ſetters out of the men of War; And the Capers of <hi>Fluſhing</hi> are eſteemed men of ſuch deſperate incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and ſo impatient of being demanded to give account of, or reſtore ought they have any way got into their power, that hardly could I get any One to follow in my abſence my Claime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
            <p>And there was a whiſpering of a ſuſpition went up and down the world, as well in <hi>Zealand</hi> as other parts, That the Lords of the Admiralty themſelves were concerned (as well as other great men of that Country) in ſetting out men of War, Whether they are ſo concern'd or not, I will not ſay; My charity is ſuch, as rather to believe the Negative. But they ſeemed to be pretty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43899:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrongly allyed to our Adverſaries (if not by conſanguinity or affinity) in affection, That whatſoever they moved for, was granted, though ever ſo equitably, rationally and forcibly impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Advocate. Take one Example among others: (long before they gave ſentence) By vertue of a Joynt Procuration I I proceeded joyntly 2. or 3. Moneths in one claime, Then the Capers and other our Adverſaries move for a ſeparation of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or claimes, for each man to claim a part, which was a meer dilatory deſign to increaſe and multiply Expenſes, thereby to deterre thoſe whoſe intereſt was ſmall from looking after it, becauſe the remedy might prove worſe then the diſeaſe, the charge for following the claime of one Cheſt being as great as for one hundred. Our Advocate pleaded the Motion was unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, urging there was in the claimes no difference of caſe; That the perſons claiming were all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, all reſiding in one place, the Goods they claimed only ſuch as appeared to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to them for their own account, that they were laden in one Port, in one ſhip, and conſigned to one Place. And added, that 'twas the part of Judges to abbreviate and contract (not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply) ſuits; withall remembred to them, that the States in their reſolution had promiſed Expedition, And therefore prayed the Lords of the Admiralty not to grant the Motion; But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they did: not declaring in this, (as in no other point) the ground for their Decree, which they ſay is their cuſtome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that to themſelves, <hi>stat pro ratione voluntas.</hi> I put it to my Advocate, and others reſiding in <hi>Midleburg,</hi> to deal plainly with me; in telling me in their Opinions what ground or cauſe our Adverſaries could have for making, or the Judges for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Motion? who ingeniouſly confeſſed they knew none, but what I have already ſet down; a deſign to deterre thoſe whoſe intereſt was ſmall from making their claim, fearing the remedy to be worſe then the diſeaſe. And indeed that deſign was gratifyed with ſucceſs, for the expenſive and dilatory proceſs conſumed more then the value of ſome mens ſugars claimed, though ſentence had been pronounced in their favour, yet could I not avoid proceeding in ſuch a claime, for I let it lye, and went on with the moſt conſiderable, but our Adverſaries brought it on, and moved that I ſhould proceed therein, or they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed therefrom. I then moved the Court for Order for one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43899:6"/>
cauſe to be proceeded with, (which they ſhould appoint) offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that according to the ſucceſſe of it all the reſt ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and to this the Fiſcal confented, (The Fiſcal is a perſon concerned in all claimes of this nature, he proceedes <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> Appears in right of the Province, and his office is ſomewhat like to that of his Majeſties Atturney General in <hi>England</hi>) But the Capers refuſed to joyn with him; Neither would the Lords of the Admiralty enjoyn them to comply, ſo that of One Cauſe they begat Six: And before I could proceed further I was forced for every cauſe to give ſecurity for the coſts, which muſt be done by a ſufficient Inhabitant of the Place.</p>
            <p>The 12. <hi>October</hi> 1660. <hi>st. n.</hi> was appointed for a publick ſale of the whole Cargo of the Ship <hi>Golden-Sun</hi> at <hi>Fluſhing</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> Commanders 23. Cheſts excepted) where I was preſent, and addreſſed my ſelf to the Lords of the Admiralty, deſiring the Goods I claimed might be likewiſe exempted from the ſale, till the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were determined. But they anſwered me, they ſhould be ſold with the reſt in <hi>Uſum jus habentium.</hi> Then I moved that the Contents and Quality might be noted and ſet down a part, which I confeſs they granted, and to that purpoſe ſent a Meſſenger with me to the Officers of the <hi>Weſt India</hi> Company; who had the management of the ſale. But they anſwer'd, 'twas not to be done, the Goods being mingled in Lots with others, ſo they made ſale of them before my face (a comfortable ſpectacle) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly ſet down the Contents with other goods, as not doubting of a ſentence in their favour, or dreading ever to be called to accompt for them.</p>
            <p>By ſome little diſcourſe I had with our Adverſaries and others of that Country, I found there ſeemed to be put by them ſome difference between <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, living in <hi>England,</hi> and thoſe reſiding beyond Sea, eſpecially in <hi>Portugal,</hi> though they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make ſuch reſidence only by vertue of Articles of peace made between the Crownes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> To remove any ſuch obſtacle, ſhould it be offered, and appear to be valid, I procured a ſecond Letter from his Majeſty, wherein (being informed by ſome perſons of Honour, who in the time of their Exile, came to have knowledge of the perſons intereſſed, That they were not only loyal ſubjects, but to have ſincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Majeſties ſervice) He was graciouſly pleaſed to declare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43899:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>Edward Adams, Abraham Jacob, Robert Carre, Chriſtopher Trenchard, William Peachey, Thomas Boſtock,</hi> and <hi>Will. Truſſel,</hi> were not only his ſubjects, but that he alſo lookt upon them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting his protection, as well as any others ſoever of like quality inhabiting any part of his Dominions. This Letter was not preſently delivered, but was thought fit to be reſerved for ſome more opportune time, which was judged to be when the cauſes were ready for ſentence, and then it was preſented, but to ſmall effect, for they ſlighted it; And the Capers ſtuck not publickly to ſay, That the Secretaries framed Letters, and his Majeſty ſigned them without ever reading or knowing what they contained. The <hi>French</hi> Commander at the ſame time went on with his claim, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his ſhip, the Fraight, &amp; 23. Cheſts of Sugars in particular, &amp; the whole Cargo in general according to the Articles of Peace.</p>
            <p>The Cargo according to the Commanders book, was 1100. Cheſts and Fecho's of Sugar, 1000. Hides, 4000 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Vigonia</hi> Wool, ſome Boxes of Balſome, a parcel of <hi>Jacaranda</hi> Wood, Whale fins, and ſome Tobacco.</p>
            <p>Upon his preſſing whereof, the Lords of the Admiraltie-asked him one day in Court, what he would do with the Cargo ſhould it be reſtored him? To which he made anſwer, That he would carry and deliver it at the proper Port of his Diſcharge, according as he ſtood obliged by Charter party and Bills of lading, at which the Lords ſmiled, As if it were a ridiculous thing for them to be thought obliged (by any tie whatſoever) to give ſentence for the Capers to part with a good Booty once got into their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>During the tranſaction of theſe affaires, the States of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadors to the Court of <hi>France</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Alliance with the <hi>French</hi> King, who (being informed from his Ambaſſador at the <hi>Hague</hi> of their non-complyance with the former Articles) refuſed to treat with them, till there were juſtice done his ſubjects according to the Articles of <hi>Marine,</hi> which was concluded at the deſire of the States themſelves. Whereupon the Ambaſſadors writ to the States deſiring the cauſe of <hi>Le Breton</hi> may be judged, who thereupon Order the Lords of the Admiralty of <hi>Zealand</hi> ſo to do; But they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for a while deferred it, till new complaints were made,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43899:7"/>
then they give ſentence, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 24. <hi>September</hi> 1661. <hi>ſtilo novo.</hi> Decreeing to the <hi>French</hi> Commander his Ship, Aparrel, Furniture, &amp;c. Fraight, and 23. Cheſts of Sugars which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him and Company, with 2000. Gilders Damages. And the ſame day condemned the Engliſh mens (ſome whereof were Fraighters of the ſhip) goods for prize.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> man not contented with his ſentence, finding the ſum ordered for damages to be too little, demands further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in matter of damage: which by means of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador at the <hi>Hague,</hi> is made known to the <hi>French</hi> King, who commanded <hi>Monſieur de Lionn</hi> a Miniſter of State in <hi>France,</hi> to ſignifie to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, that in caſe of non ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for <hi>Le Bretons</hi> ſhip, he would grant Letters of Repriſal. Whereupon they again writ to the States General touching that particular; Who order the cauſe to be brought before the Judges apointed in caſe of appeal at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and a review thereof without charge to him, and to that end diſpatch their Meſſengers into <hi>Zealand,</hi> where the States had a meeting extraordinary about it, who give for anſwer, that they cannot conſent to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, becauſe the <hi>Fatalia</hi> were paſt (which are 4. Months after the ſentence pronounced, within which time the review ought to be deſired.) But this being upon a Point extraordinary, to prevent Letters of repriſal, a ſecond Meſſenger was diſpatcht, who return'd with a Better anſwer, And upon the review is decreed to the <hi>French</hi> Commander 12000. Gilders more for damage, over and above the former 2000.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Commander recovered his Fraight according to Bills of lading which belonged to us the Fraighters, which was more then was due to them by Charter party by 910 <hi>l.</hi> Flemiſh, ſo that with what he had formerly received from us, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed for his account, He was indebted to us 1440 <hi>l.</hi> Flemiſh, for which (he refuſing to accompt with us) we deſired we might make an Embargo, or Arreſt in the hands of thoſe who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to pay him money, and in this requeſt we hoped to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (becauſe it might be a mean for them to keep ſomething in their hand, which was a thing they love to do, as being in that kind naturally tenacious;) But in this neither were we prevailing, for they were reſolved not to gratifie the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in any motion, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43899:7"/>
at leaſt durſt do nothing againſt. the <hi>French,</hi> they telling us they could not permit one ſtranger to ſue another, ſo the <hi>French</hi> man marched off with flying colours, carrying all away with him, as well ſome of our as his own money. And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> remain'd <hi>forlorn.</hi> And by what hath been here related, which is nothing but undeniable truth, it plainly appears we are truly unfortunate <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants.</p>
            <p>Our Goods were condemned as Prize, but as I have already ſaid, they tell us not wherefore; they never declaring the cauſe or ground of their ſentence, reſerving that in their own breaſt; ſo that we are ignorant where the Gulf lay that devoured, or the Rock that ſplit us: But by what we gathered by common diſcourſe with perſons in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and ſome Occurrences, we may gueſs it to be, becauſe the perſons claiming were for the moſt part reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in <hi>Portugal</hi>; for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man that was paſſenger upon an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip which they had taken comming from <hi>Brazil</hi> had Goods (being of no great value) reſtored him. And this is founded upon an Order or Edict made for their own people that none of them living in <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhall trade to <hi>Brazil</hi> without their licence, or if they do their goods being taken in company of <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> ſhall run the like fate with them, and this was made for preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Subjects colouring <hi>Portuguez</hi> Goods: (tis evident we colour'd no <hi>Portuguez</hi> Goods, claiming only what was conſigned for our own account, and this by evidence of their own produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and all was under 300. of 1100. Cheſts and Fecho's which the ſhip brought.) And ſay they, perſons living in any part ought not to enjoy two Capacities or Priviledges. To that we gave ſatisfactory anſwer, (Beſides what his ſacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hath been pleaſed to write on our behalf) That we enjoyed no Priviledge the <hi>Portugueſſes</hi> did, but reſided in <hi>Portugal</hi> by vertue of the Articles of peace concluded between the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and for ſuch were own'd and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed by his Majeſties Conſull. If they will have paſs for Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, that what Sanctions and Edicts are made by them for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their own people, muſt be obliging to the Subjects of other Princes, 'tis right <hi>Hogan Mogan</hi>; But the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it is, That the King of Great <hi>Britaine, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt not treat of or conclude peace with a Forraign Prince, or provide for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43899:8"/>
the increaſe of Trade and priviledges of his own ſubjects without asking the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> leave.</p>
            <p>I humbly repreſented our caſe to his ſacred Majeſty and his moſt Honourable Privie Council, makeing a Summarie relation of what had paſſed, which his Majeſty &amp; their Lordſhips taking into their conſideration, did Order, that the Commiſſioners who are to treat with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſadors, do inſiſt upon our ſatisfaction, in like manner as is done in claims of any other of his Majeſties Subjects.</p>
            <p>I alſo repreſented our aggrievance to the Honourable Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Parliament appointed to conſider of the Trade of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where I made out our loſſes ſuſtained by the ſurprizall of the Shipps <hi>Golden Sun, Experience</hi> aforemention'd, (and two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shipps more taken by the <hi>Dutch</hi> a little after, called the <hi>Falcon,</hi> and St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>) to amount unto 8000l. <hi>ſter.</hi> But (like a bad accomptant,) I omitted to ſet down the intereſt, which for 4. years at 6. <hi>per Cent.</hi> comes to 1920l. Beſides which I have in the tedious vexatious ſuits expended 780<hi>l.</hi> 12<hi>s,</hi> 3<hi>d. Flemiſh,</hi> beſides what is to be ſet down for my friends paines who aſſiſted in the ſolicitation, and I have endeavoured all good husbandry, having been ſometime thought to be too penurious. And now may be ſeen the effect of the full aſſurance of expedition promiſed us, <hi>viz.</hi> a Suit of 14. moneths, (which if I had pleaſed might have been 14. years, I could have procured conſent of parties,) and for the juſt judgment we ſhould receive, our Goods condemned for Prize, but upon what ſcore, <hi>ſubintelligitur.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> mans Ship which, by the Univerſal cuſtome &amp; conſent (if not Law) of Nations (to ſay nothing of their particular Obligation) ought to have made free Goods, with 23. Cheſts of Sugar granted free, with 14000. <hi>Gilders</hi> for Dammages.</p>
            <p>Thus Courteous Reader, I have done with my ſad tedious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and crave thy pardon for exerciſing thy Patience ſo long therewith, begging as formerly the benefit of thy Counſel. But before I take my leave I muſt ſpeak one word in vindication of my profeſſion (at leaſt of my own particular) from an aſpertion which ſeems to be caſt upon it. There is a rumor flies up and down the world, that in this preſent conjuncture of affairs, the Merchants are great incendiaries to a Warre with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and if there happen one, 'twill be called the <hi>Merchants Warre,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43899:8"/>
I ſuppoſe is a great miſtake; for to me it ſeems not rational for any intelligent Merchants to be forward to that War, the maine diſpute and deciſion whereof muſt be argued at Sea, the place where he is moſt concerned, and to the inconveniences and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards attending ſuch a War the Merchant of all other perſons is moſt obnoxious. If any ſuch Merchants there be, that are ſo Warlike, and promiſe to themſelves great gain by Trading in troubled waters; I do declare my ſelf to be none of them, I do confeſſe I am for ſatisfaction for the unreaſonable uſage and injuries done my friends, and me: nay I have been, and am very earneſt and zealous for it, I ſay I am for the <hi>Rem,</hi> but <hi>modum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirendi</hi> I wholly ſubmit to his Sacred Majeſty (whom God many years preſerve in peace) and his Great Council.</p>
