            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Persians</hi> in time past, and also, by credible report at this day (right Worshipfull) at vacant and idle times, when they are not busied in the affaires of their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, nor troubled in their owne priuat matters, vse commonly to whittle small twigs of birch, to keepe them selues from vaine imaginations and idle cogitations, but nothing either profitable to the weale publique, or to their priuat persons. In like manner, <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> an Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> was wont to busie himselfe with pricking and thrusting flyes through with needles, in his window: so that this reproachful prouerb sprang vp of his so vaine spending the time: for when any of his subiects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded who was in the Emperors presence (if he then were not about his foolish labor) his seruants would answere, <hi>ne musca quidem,</hi> not so much as a flye: which commonly was spoken after a reproachful sense. Therefore Sir, for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of such vnprofitable labors, and also for the shunning of blameable idlenesse, in spending my time about such fruiteles toyes, and friuelous toyles, I trust I haue after a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort imployed my vacant times, not in whitling or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of sticks, nor in killing of flyes, neither as <hi>Myrmecidas Milesius,</hi> or <hi>Callicrates Lacedemonius</hi> did, who spent and consumed a great time in making a small waggon, to bee drawne with two couples of horses, which might easilie bee

It is further reported (right worshipful) that <hi>Satyrus,</hi> a certaine bagpiper, being present at the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher <hi>Aristos</hi> disputations, finding what sweete me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and pithie sentences, were included in his learned say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, sayed:

            </p>
            <p>In like sort my selfe conferring with my books, at conuenient leasure, finding what proffit is reaped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and taking pleasure in the sweet harmonie and pleasant melody of the wise sayings of the learned Philosophers, am constrained with <hi>Satyrus</hi> to lay a side and cast of all vaine toyes, and superfluous toyles, vntill my minde be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied with their learned conference. But for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient leasure, and vacant times alwaies at will are not commonly incident to my coate (as your Worship right well knoweth:) wherefore I am forced to write, as the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptian</hi> dogs doo lap their water: the curs of that countrey by a naturall inclination, doo knowe, that in <hi>Nilus,</hi> and in other Riuers and floods of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> certaine venymous beasts, and stinging Serpents doo lye closely hid vnder the water, waighting for their praye, and therefore they to shun that perrill doo run a long the shores and bankes of the streames, and lap their water (as the olde saying is) by sniches, &amp; catches, as they may without danger come by it. So my self being compelled to take such vncertaine leasure, as conueniently I may: wherein I haue by fits, penned this my slender worke, hoping that your Worship will bee to

the booke, as <hi>Achilles</hi> shield was to <hi>Vlisses,</hi> or as <hi>Hercules</hi> club was to the Daughter of King <hi>Euritus: Vlisses</hi> thought himselfe safe vnder the shield of noble <hi>Achilles,</hi> which he knew (for the Masters sake) would terrifie the beholder, <hi>Iole</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Euritus</hi> did make the knees of mightie men to stoupe, by holding in her hand the weapon of the most renowmed Conqueror <hi>Hercules.</hi> So I crauing your Worships patronage; whose noble nature, vertuous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and learned experience, I knowe to bee of sufficient force, to shield and couer this my homelie and rude stile, from the hatefull hand of all repiners, from whose mouth it is as hard a thing to get a good word, as to wrest perforce the club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> handes: and would willingly that a man should reape for his paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour the thankelesse crop of <hi>Cholchos</hi> soile, which is to the wearie tiller present destruction. It may be that your Worship doth rather expect at my hand a badge or token of my profession, coming so lately from the Hawks perch, than to treat of matters too high for my learning and skill: Notwithstanding, when I call to minde your wonted cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies and accustomable affabilitie, I imbolden my selfe to sollicite your Worship with this my slender muse, hoping that you will with <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> receiue the good will of the simple meaner; not expecting cloquence so aboundantly to flowe from the Hawkes perch, as from <hi>Aristotles</hi> Schoole. But if I may perceiue that this my diligent paine is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with friendly acceptance, I shal rest right happy and well contented, and my Booke shall thinkest selfe as safely shrowded and defended vnder your fauourable protection, as vnder the patronage of a farre higher State: for that both your Worships vertue, good gouernement, learned dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and courteous behauiour, is sufficiently knowne in this our Countrey, amongest your louing neighbours, where your countenance will make the simple worke to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie more credite, than of it selfe it deserueth, thorough the good affection that our Countrie-men doo beare to your name.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight curteous, gentle, and learned Reader, as dutie bindeth mee, I am determined to inuite thee to a base and simple banquet: for knowing that thou art dayly inuited &amp; bidden to manie more curious and daintie dishes, that thy appetite is sufficed with all kinde of delicates: therefore, in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by staying thee from thy delicious meates, by inuiting thee to more homelie fare, thy stomacke may be the more whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; sharpned to take thy repast of those dainties, when occasion serueth. It may be, that when thou shalt perceiue my principall and chiefest Guest, for whom this banquet was first proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (whose mouth is daylie vsed to the sweetest delicates, and whose tongue is of sufficient iudgement to make a difference betwixt the sower taste of vnpleasant cates, and the sweete relish and sauer of well seasoned meates:) for manner sake to commend the dishes, and gratefully accept the good will of the inuiter: that then thou wilt accordingly take in good part and well like of such homely cheere, as the willing bidder hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for thee. But if it should so fall out, that thy mouth being so often accustomed with the sweete taste and relish of daintie fare, that thy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke can hardly digest the homelines of my reare supper: yet I assure thee, that the cates themselues be as daintie &amp; neweltie as the best, thogh not so well dressed by the vnskilfulnesse of the Cooke. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee to vse the part of a friendly guest, in taking it in good woorth and reporting the best: and further I request thee, if thou findest fault or mislikest anie dish, being not well dressed, rather to winke priuelie at the Cooke, than openly to discredit his workmanship Perhaps, it may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obiected to the discredit of the workman, saying, It was great pitie that such daintie delicates hapned to be bought of so simple a cater, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to so homely a cooke, to be dressed in so smokie a kitchin: wherby the dishes haue not their right, and their taste and relish spoyled, by reason of the basenesse of the roome. To which obiection, with reason I thus may reply: that the vnskilfull cooke may sometime take in hand to dresse the daintiest dish, as well as the cunning and finest workman to learne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: for he that ventreth not the marring or making, shal neuer attain to good workmanship. Thus (gentle Reader) hauing inuited thee to this base banquet, play thou not like the dogge in a manger, that will eate
<pb facs="tcp:2148:5"/>
no hay, nor suffer those that would: wherefore I pray thee either fall too thy selfe, or giue others leaue to satisfie their hunger, whose stomackes are sufficiently prepared to feed. I would not haue it thought, that I tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a vainglorious minde, goe about to edifie and instruct the learned, whose ripe iudgements, wise conceipts, and learned experience, is of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force to teach better Schollers than my selfe, for then should I goe about, <hi>arenas in littus fundere:</hi> but for that I right well know, there are diuers, whose learning is not of that profunditie, but they may take both pleasure and profite, by reading this homely worke. Is it not reported, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> comming to <hi>Carthage</hi> (there viewing and perusing the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Troy,</hi> being painted on the wall of <hi>Didoes</hi> pallaice) with his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companion <hi>Achates,</hi> to haue more imaginations and thoughts in his minde concerning the effect and substaunce, than the wall by painting could signifie, yet notwithstanding the picture first caused those thoghts (by representing the matter) to reuolue in his experienced minde: so that the setting downe of a part, causeth the wise to conceiue the whole: and by penning a briefe, the learned coniectureth a volume. Therefore (curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader) I am content to appeale to thy learned iudgement: for <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> setting foorth his picture to heare each mans opinion in his worke begun, was verie wel content, when the shoomaker found fault with the shooe, and the taylor with the hose: knowing these men to be artificers in the Science which they had reprehended, did willingly reforme his errour. But when the vnskilfull intruded themselues to the iudgement of the legges, armes, and other parts of the bodie: then he drewe in his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, knowing that hee should neuer please and satisfie the humour and fancie of all men. Thus, Fare thee well.</p>

               <p>Yea truely, for on that, hangeth and dependeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues requisite to the state and life of man: it is the good ground of al gouernement, a right direction to honest liuing, and the true nurse and fosterer of prouident wisedom, it keepeth the vnsatiable appetites of ambition vnder the yoke of reason, and holdeth downe the immoderate desires of superioritie: to be short, I referre thée to the definition of <hi>Cicero,</hi>

                     <hi>Cicero.</hi>

               <p>Well sir, then I perceiue, that this gift is a most necessary and speciall maxime, to the life and gouernement of man, wherein I trust to be better instructed heereafter, by some familiar examples, which doth shew the fall and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the wanters thereof, and the quiet state and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the possessors of the same.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
               <p>Friend, I will rehearse a very briefe example in the meane time, for your better vnderstanding, which shall shew a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the vnsatiable appetite of aspiring minds, and the quiet state and peaceable contentment: which is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to be perceiued, in the life of <hi>Aleaxnder</hi> the Great, and <hi>Diogenes</hi> the philosopher.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scho.</speaker>
               <p>First sir, crauing pardon for interrupting your speeches, me think this comparison is very vnfit, &amp; vnseeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the difference of vertue and vice will hardly be made manifest by the liues of these two, the one being a great Prince and Emperour of many stately countries and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the other a poore seely beggar, who liued by the almes of the people, hauing for his house a simple tunne or barrell to harbour himselfe in, without any other wealth or substaunce at all.</p>

               <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
               <p>Nay then, my good friend, you will driue mee from the matter, and cause me to make digression for argument sake; but before I proceede any further, it shall not be amisse to manifest the state of these two, and descry your errour; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> indeede was a great Prince, and Emperour of the most part of the world, and yet not so rich as <hi>Diogenes</hi> was: for whereas you think the comparison altogether vnfit, the one being a beggar and wonderfull poore, the other a king, and inestimable rich, therefore I referre thee to the wise say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cato.</hi>
                  </note> who saieth, <hi>Qui contentus est sua sorte, Diues est, He that is content with his owne estate and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is sufficient rich:</hi> We find that <hi>Diogenes</hi> was content with his poore estate, and <hi>Alexander</hi> not satisfied with al his kingdomes; wherefore, according vnto the opinion of <hi>Cato Diogenes</hi> was rich, and <hi>Alexander</hi> poore: for truely he can not be rich which is not satisfied, neither can he be poore that is contented. And further, to confirme this argument, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi> a wise philosopher of <hi>India,</hi> to whom this <hi>Alexander</hi> sent messengers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In vita Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopho.</hi>
                  </note> commanding him to come to the feast of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi> sonne, which was holden at <hi>Babilon,</hi> (meaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the sonne of <hi>Ioue</hi>) declaring further, <hi>That if hee would come, he should haue great rewards and riches giuen him, but if he refused, and would not obey his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he should be put to a most cruell death:</hi> wherevnto the graue Philosopher answered stoutly, saying, <hi>That Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander was neither the sonne of God, nor yet certaine lord of any part or parcel of the earth, but was as mortall as himself,</hi> &amp; as for the gifts &amp; rewards of him that was himselfe so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable couetous, hee nothing regarded, returning this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, <hi>That if it wold please him to receiue &amp; accept a gift at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he would willingly giue it, &amp; might very conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently spare it, which was, his good counsel,</hi> that he should holde himselfe content and satisfied with sufficient, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet no more than were necessary, saying, <hi>That his abilitie was better able to giue than Alexanders: for</hi> (saith he) <hi>hee woulde giue mee that which himselfe wanteth, whereof I haue sufficient, but I will send him that which hee lacketh, and I my selfe haue abundantly: and as for threats and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2148:7"/>
I nothing at al regard; for if I liue</hi> (saith he) <hi>my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie will bring foorth things sufficiently, to furnish my life withall, so that I shall not need his rewards; as for death I do nothing feare, but exceedingly desire it, which shall deliuer me from my old withered carkas.</hi> Thus you may perceiue, that this wise philosopher accounted them poore which were not satisfied, and those rich which were contented.</p>

               <speaker>Scho.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I doo verie well perceiue my error, and doo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; for it standeth with good reason, that the riches of this world is contentment, and that a coueting and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented minde is extreame pouertie: therefore if it please you to procéed forward according to your pretence, I shall accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my promise be attentiue.</p>

               <speaker>Fa.</speaker>
               <p>Well séeing you are satisfied heerein, I will proceede further; The Philosopher <hi>Diogenes</hi> (as I said before) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the vnconstancie of vnfriendly fortune,<note place="margin">

Thus liuing in contentment, it chanced that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great king of <hi>Macedony,</hi> hearing the rare fame of this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, thought good to visit <hi>Diognes</hi> in his tub, to heare his wisedome and the cause of his so solitarie liuing, came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him being set in his tun, saying; <hi>My friend I haue long desired to see thee, and to inrich thee being so a poore a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher: therefore aske of mee what goods or liuing thou needest, and I will inrich thee with it to thy great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                  <hi>then I pray thee take not that from me which thou canst not giue me; but stand from before the mouth of my tun, that I may haue the light and warmnes of the Sunne, which is to me great riches; for now thou detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest that from me and canst not giue me the like: therefore do me but this fauour, and I will craue of thee no other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> Then said <hi>Alexander, My friend, how much possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lands, and reuenues woulde satisfie and content thee, if now I should giue thee thyful contentment:</hi> to whom <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> answered, <hi>Euen as much, Alexander, as thou must be thy selfe contented with all in the end:</hi> But at the first he misconstrued the meaning of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and thought him wonderfull couetous, knowing, that he himselfe had nowe most part of the world in possession, and dayly striued to get the whole, therefore he thought it an vnsatiable appetite of him not to be contented with lesse: but after consideration on the cause, he perceiued that <hi>Diogenes</hi> meant his length of ground to be sufficient patrimony for himselfe, which in the end the greatest king of the earth must be contented withall: then said <hi>Alexander</hi> to him againe, <hi>My good friend, what thing best contenteth thee in this world?</hi> to whom <hi>Diogenes</hi> replied, saying, <hi>That thing, sir King, which thou art most discontented withall in the worlde, which is a satisfied and contented mind, to couet for no more than sufficeth, which in thee,</hi> saieth he, <hi>I finde contrary. Alexander</hi> was nothing at all offended at the reprehension of the wise Philosopher, but rather smelling his owne follie said at that time, <hi>Truely, if I wer not Alexander I would be Diogenes.</hi> But we see that he was <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> therefore he could not be <hi>Diogenes</hi>; he was couetous, therefore he could not be contented, wherefore it appeareth that <hi>Diogenes</hi> had the gift of temperance not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet his owne destruction as <hi>Alexander</hi> did, but being rich in contentment despised fortune, for that her force coulde not molest or touch him, reiecting honour, because of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablitie and varietie of the same, regarding not life for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of it, but liued as a man contented fearing no cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

               <p>Truly, it doth appeare most plaine, that this man had the gift of temperance sufficiently, and that he was nothing subiect to the wauering wheele of fortune, neither passing of her smooth countenance, nor louring looke, liuing a stranger to her, whereby he kept himself free from her force, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I would faine know if the end and death of him were as worthie as his life: for <hi>No man is called happie before his end, which being answerable, I must needs confesse the man deserued merit.</hi>

               <p>Surely, in mine opinion, it were in vaine, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is rather to credite and followe the precepts and doctrine of those that are dead, than to giue audience, or be instructed at the mouth of the wise who liueth; for <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> himselfe in his life was forsaken of al his friends, because he vsed to reprehend them most sharpely, therefore they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him a Cinike, or doggish Philosopher, but after his death, his deedes were recorded and had in great reuerence. <hi>Socrates</hi> also was hated amongst his countrimen because he would tell them thorowly of their faults: Wherefore in the ende he was accused and put to death, but after had in great reuerence and admiration, folowing his rules and precepts, in gouerning their common wealth. In like sort, <hi>Aristotle,
<pb facs="tcp:2148:10"/>
Demosthenes, Plato, Callisthenes,</hi> and diuers other, were had in greater estimation after their death, than they were in their life time.

But if the Philosophers would haue giuen themselues, to please men, to flatter their follie, and to maintaine their vice, they should haue beene in great estimation in their life, but they should neuer haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the name of Philosophers.<note place="margin">

of the goddesse whom she serued, to giue her children the greatest benefite which GOD might giue to man. After the feast, in the night when the mother did take rest with her children, in the morning her two sonnes were founde dead: whereby it was gathered, that the greatest benefit that man could haue, was, in the middest of his glory and praise, to end his fraile life, that the vnconstancie of fickle fortune might not blot out any part of that which he had before gotten. <hi>Croesus</hi> the rich King of <hi>Lydia,</hi>

After these great victories &amp; huge slaughters of so many thousands, <hi>Caesar</hi> marched home to the gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the conquest of 300. seuerall nations, and 800. stately townes at the least: yet not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with the proy of his victorie, nor filled with so many blodie slaughters, spared not, but beate down the stately walles of his owne natiue Citie <hi>Rome,</hi> because his countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, fearing his crueltie at the first, would not open the gates of the Citie vnto him: for which cause hee made the Romans yéelde themselues on their knées, to become his faithfull and true subiectes, making himselfe Emperour ouer the <hi>Romane</hi> State, which was neuer subiect to Emperour before his time. Thus did the pride of his minde still clime for dignitie, not bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing satisfied but catching at the verie heauens, if his power had extended so farre, being fleshed with so manie bloudie broyles, and animated with such lordly statelinesse, that no <hi>Roman</hi> péere or potentate might stirre or speak against his wilfulnes.

But now sir, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to your last conclusion, Is it possible that by any quantitie of worldly goods, or by any honour and duety done to man, or by any felicitie, or happie successe in this world, so to eleuate the minde of man with such stately pride, that he will not acknowledge himselfe to be a mortall man, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund himselfe to be honoured as an immortall God.

For which his stately pride, and vaine folly, he was accordingly punished, as is before rehearsed. Where he most hartely repented himself of his foolish vanitie.

But it séemeth that the vices of men doe much longer continue, and are of more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient antiquitie than their vertues. For a few speciall vices do dimme and ouershadow a great number of good qualities, and shall longer be remembred to their reprochfull infamie, than the other to their praise and merite. We also read of diuers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Princes, who by a few inordinate follies, haue drowned a number of their especiall vertues, as most plainly appeareth in your last examples. For what good vertues are to be picked out of the liues of those, that for their madde pride would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as Gods on the earth: although indéede diuers good

qualities, and examples of vertue procéede from them before. Yet notwithstanding, this most monstrous pride, obscured and blotted out their meritorious remembrance: shadowing, as it were with a thick and darke veile, their notable vertues from the face of the earth. Therefore I beséech you to vnfold and lay open part of those monstrous vices, which are such enemies, and so repugnant to vertue, which suffereth not the worthie fame of man to rise and flourish, but croudeth, and thrusteth it downe into the darke graue of obliuion, wherein is drowned his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie merites, by the ouerflowing of his foolish follie.</p>

First of all falling into most pitifull wéepings casting himselfe on the carkas of his dead friend; imbracing the corps, féeling &amp; handling the wounds which he had made in his frantique moode, filling them with his teares, making most pitifull and lamentable moane, as if the carkasse should haue heard his sorowfull outcries, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the weapon, turning it to his owne brest, and woulde foorthwith haue slaine himselfe, had not the standers by hindered and preuented his purpose.

that intollerable vice to most lasciuious and licentious liuing; from that vile and detestable sinne to most odious and filthie quaffing and imimoderate bibbing; which bad life and disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red gouernment, dooth soone purchase to the practisers thereof most condigne punishment, as by our aforesaid conference doth most euidently appeare: were it possible that the bloud of the innocent should not be reuenged, or that the murthering hand should scape vnpunished: No, there is no doubt, but that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God dooth aswel plague the Prince and péere as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest person for such cruell and tyranous déeds, &amp; will be sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenged on their intemperancie. For first it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that for lack of temperance man runneth headlong to those wilfull murders, either by an ouer coueting mind, or by despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quarrelling, or otherwise beeing ouercome by inordinate swilling and vnsatiable quaffing of liquor, al which proceedeth through the default of the aforesaid gift. <hi>Iezabel</hi> wife to <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King her husband had required <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi> to part with his vineyard, which lay verie conuenient for his vse, profering him as great possession in some other place, but <hi>Naboth</hi> denying his sute as a thing vniust, saying, <hi>God for bid that I should passe ouer my patrimonie which my Father left me: but be contented therewith, and leaue it to my sonne, as it was left me.</hi> Wherewith the king being not content went home sorowing, remaining verie pensiue and heauie for that he could not lawfully or without great shame take away the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of <hi>Naboth</hi>: but when <hi>Iezabel</hi> fully perceiued the cause of the Kings sorowing and heauines, she directed letters to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place wher <hi>Naboth</hi> dwelt, making them priuie of her bloudie practise, wishing and commaunding them to proclaime a fast in their Citie, and then to hire and suborne two witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that should falsely accuse him before the Iudges, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently therevpon to lead him out of the Citie, and stone him to death: which cruel doome and execrable murder was forthwith accordingly executed. But notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, although for a time reuengement was deferred, yet could she not scape vnpunished: for so soone as <hi>Iehu</hi> was annointed King, he was straightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that should pisse against the wall; wherefore he presently warred on the Citie of <hi>Iezrael,</hi> and spoiled the house and frends of <hi>Ahab,</hi> vntill he came where <hi>Iezabel</hi> lodged, who was most cruelly vsed, in consideration of her former trespasse: for she was throwen and tumbled downe headlong from a lofty win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to the hard pauements of the stréete, wherewith her bloud sprong about the postes and walles of the stréet, so that dogges came and licked vp her bloud, and eate her flesh, the rest being troden to durt with horseféete and marching souldiers: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there remayned no more vnspoyled and defaced, but onely the palmes of her hands. Thus was <hi>Iezabel</hi> most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly slaine and miserably vsed by the very commaundement of God, for the murdering and sheading of innocent bloud. Also <hi>Olimpias</hi> wife to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> king, and mother to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted diuers most horrible &amp; shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murthers:<note place="margin">

Further, when his body did hang on the galous, she came thether the first night and crowned the dead head of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias</hi> with a crowne of gold, taking also the carkasse from the trée, burying it most nobly, and made a famous Tombe in the same place for his remembrance. Which causes being thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, can import no otherwise than an accessary and guilty mind.

safetie into the Citie <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> where not long after she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so was taken. Then seised Quéene <hi>Olimpias</hi> into her hand, all the whole Realm of <hi>Macedon</hi>: howbeit she very vngently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated these her prisoners. For first she caused the king and <hi>Euridice</hi> his wife to be put into a straite prison, that they could hardly turne themselues within, and had their meat geuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in at a little hole: but after they had béen there awhile thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably dealt withall, <hi>Olympias</hi> perceiuing that the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> for very compassion they had of the said captiues, greatly maliced and hated her, wherefore she caused King <hi>Philip</hi> by certaine souldiers of <hi>Thrace</hi> to be slaine, after he had reigned king sixe yeares and foure moneths. And for because that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridice</hi> not well digesting her shamefull crueltie in so treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously betraying her dead husband, and also somewhat insolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spake, &amp; said that she had better right and title to the crowne and realme of <hi>Macedonia</hi> than <hi>Olympias</hi> had: she therefore either without regard of the late dignitie royall that the sayd <hi>Euridice</hi> had béen in, or yet the common mutability &amp; variety of fortune, sent her three liberall gifts to make her choyse thereof: which was, a sword, a halter, and poyson, to end her life withal, who of necessitie was forced to take one. Thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wofull Queene, had receiued this present of <hi>Olympias,</hi> seeing no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but that needs she must take and accept of one, she said, <hi>The Gods graunt like choyce to this cruell Olympias, and that she may receiue like guerdon for her liberalitie heerein.</hi> Thus when she had adorned the bodie of her husband <hi>Philip</hi> slaine in her presence, and stopped vp the wounds to couer the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of them; then refusing the aforesaid presents of the curteous Queene, in the best manner she could with her own girdle stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled her selfe, and so died. Yet was not <hi>Olympias</hi> satisfied with these lamentable and execrable murders, but soone after she had thus shamefully put them to death, she made <hi>Nicanor Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> brother to be slaine, and spitefully defaced the tombe of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> his other brother.

Being also forced thorough extreame and miserable hunger to feed on the dead carkasses of the pined men. The townesmen seeing theyr lamentable estate, yeelded vp the Citie against <hi>Olympias</hi> will, and humbled themselues willingly to the mercie of <hi>Cassander.</hi> Then after this Queen was taken prisoner, <hi>Cassander</hi> caused all the friends of them whom she had murdred, to accuse her in the common place of iudgment before the assembly of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians.</hi> Which thing they accordingly did: where the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> in the absence of <hi>Olympias</hi> hauing there neither any patrone or aduocate to defend her vniust cause, condemned her to death. For execution wherof <hi>Cassander</hi> sent 200. of his tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiest souldiers to kil her, which entered her Pallace where she was.

With which boldnes the souldiers were all astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, sauing certaine of the friends of those whom she had slain before, which stabbed her thorow the body, whereof she present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died. Yet this manly courage is to be noted in her, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she felt the wound to be mortall, and that she fainted, ready to yeeld vp her life, she nesled her garmentes about her body, plucking downe her neather skirts to her féete,<note place="margin">

friend in the Citie, to defend his cause; nor enemie nowe with him to ende his life) <hi>I haue liued vilely, I will perish as filthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> and therewithall thrust himselfe through, and so died. Thus miserably ended <hi>Domitius Nero,</hi> after hee had reuenged the cruell murther which his Mother committted, and in the ende himselfe was driuen to the same shoare, and forced to arriue at the same Port of miserable Destinie, to be cut off with vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death for his most vile slaughters and cruelties. Also <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stobulus,</hi> sonne to <hi>Hircanus,</hi> vnnaturally committed to prison his mother, and his brother <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and after most cruelly slew his said brother in prison; for which grieuous offence, God so strake him, that all his bowells rent in his belly, and hee vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited vp all the bloud in his bodie, and so most pitifully he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in recompence of his former crueltie. In like manner, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Illustris</hi> sonne of the great <hi>Antiochus,</hi> did also imbrew his hands in the bloud of his friends. For giuing his sister in marriage to <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and vnder pretence of familiaritie came to visite his brother in lawe, vnder the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of alliance, and that he might by treacherous meanes take from him the Kingdome of <hi>Aegipt:</hi> and finding him sitting at supper saluted him with his sword, which presently he thrust through his sides: thus traiterously he slewe his brother <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome,</hi> and ceazed on all <hi>Aegipt</hi> to his owne vse. And after hée had done manie other cruelties, at last hee was striken with a most horrible sicknesse, that his bodie stanke, and his flesh was so corrupt and putrified, that no bodie could abide the sauour therof, liuing wormes créeping and scrauling out of his bodie: insomuch, that in his great extremitie, hee was forsaken of all his friends and seruants, and so died; as a iust recompence for his villanie. It is farther well knowen, that <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was murthered by the hands of <hi>Crate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> his Paramour, who sore thirsted after his said kingdome: which shamefull act beeing committed, and <hi>Cratenas</hi> placed in the regall Throne, according to his long desire, raigned King not past thrée or foure dayes, but was himselfe slaine in sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner by other mens meanes, whereunto this saying may be well applyed;
<q>
                     <l>Qui struit insidias alijs: sibi damna dat ipse.</l>
                     <l>

                  </q>
So that this man possessed his princely seate but a short space, which he had purchased by wilfull murder. I trust it is very well knowen also to the English Nation, what cruell murders and miserable slaughters were committed by King <hi>Richard</hi> the third, brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and sonne to the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> for that the Chronicles doo make mention thereof at large. First bringing his owne brother the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> to vntimely death, then shewing his tyrannie on the Barons and Nobles of the Land; and after that his brother <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth died, he miserably smoothered the two sonnes of his said brother <hi>Edward,</hi> which were committed to his tuition and gouernment, not sparing the néerest of his kinne, but imbrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in their bloud, to the ende he himselfe might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the Crowne and Diadem of the Realme: which in deede consequently came to passe. But were it possible that such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull murders, and execrable slaughters as he committed, both in slaying of the Nobles of the Land, and also in the deprauing of his swéete Nephewes of life and Kingdome, should scape vnreuenged: No truly, it were altogether wonderfull, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnlikely, but that the liuing GOD (who punisheth with shame such shameful murderers) would be sharply reuenged on him for his monstrous crueltie in so slaying of the innocent. For not long after, he was slaine in Battaile by the right noble <hi>Henrie</hi> Earle of <hi>Richmond:</hi> where his mangled corpes was laid (being first despoyled of armes and stripped naked) ouer a horse backe, hanging downe in such sort, that the filthie durt and myre did both spot and sprinkle the ill shaped carkasse of this abhorred Tyrant; which was a most odious and detestable sight, yet too worthie a funerall, for so murderous a wretch. This recompence happened to him, for his intollerable cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus it plainly appeareth, that murder is sharply punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well in the Prince and Péere, as in the silliest sot, and poorest slaue: for further proofe whereof, to showe the iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement of God on meaner personages, this one example shall suffice.</p>
               <p>The true and certaine report goeth, that one <hi>Macharcus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2148:35"/>
a sacrificing Priest of God <hi>Bacchus,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Mityline,</hi> in his exteriour countenaunce and fauour resembled great gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and courtesie, yet in life, manners, and inward practises no man that liued coulde bee more wicked or abhominable. It fortuned on a time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a certaine soiorner lodged at his house, and committed to his credite a certaine summe of mony in gold: this <hi>Machareus</hi> being assaulted with auarice, and carried as it were into captiuitie to couetousnesse, makes a hole in a secret place of the temple with a mattocke, and therein hides the gold which he was put in trust withall. After a few dayes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, the soiourner desired to haue his own again: vpon which request, <hi>Machareus</hi> led the man (mistrusting no mischiefe, nor doubting anie danger) into the temple: where, vnder pretence, cloake, and colour to restore the man his right, and hauing (as he thought) opportunitie, time, and place to worke his villanie. murdred the man; which being compassed to his contentation, he tooke vp the golde, and laid the right owner thereof (whome he had iniuriously slaine) in the selfe same place, couering him ouer with earth, and damd vp the pit, in such sort as all things in his thinking were cock sure, perswaded himselfe that as men be deceiued and mocked, so the powers supernall (the eternall God I meane) might be deluded and blinded. But the matter fell out vnhappely inough, and had another euent than was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for on <hi>Machareus</hi> part; for after a few dayes were passed, the solemne Seruice and Obsequies of GOD <hi>Bacchus</hi> (which were yearly) approached, and was celebrated according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custome: wherein <hi>Machareus</hi> behauing himselfe after a gorgeous and glorious estate, being verie busie in the festiuall Ceremonie, it chaunced that his two sonnes which were left at home as that day, did imitate their Fathers order in holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, in such sort and effectuall manner, that the yonger brother cast himselfe prostrate on the ground, and laid his head vpon a blocke verie méekely, which the elder brother with an olde rustie whinyeard or cankred wood-knife did chop off from the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Anone came in the seruaunts which dwelled in the house, &amp; séeing the childish murder that was committed, gaue a great shoute, making a terrible outcrie and pitifull noyse, as men meruailously confounded and amazed at sight of so strange and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2148:35"/>
bloudie a spectacle. The vehemencie of which lamentable cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and outragious roaring, speedely pearced the eares of the frighted mother, who came like a mad woman to vnderstand the meaning of the matter: and then séeing one of her sonnes slaughtered, and weltering in streames of bloud, and the other holding still a rustie glaue in his hand, &amp; all to be stayned with the crimsen blood of his brothers flesh, she caught vp a firebrand very fiercely, and in the heate of her great rigor did so thumpe and souse her liuing sonne, that he died the death in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Then was tidings brought to <hi>Macareus,</hi> what butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were committed at home in his priuate house, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly vpon the report therof left the holy seruice, &amp; like a man moonesick, or rather a fiend of hell, ranne home with might and maine, hauing in his hand at the same instant a burning torche or taper, where with he did so beate, bounce, and baste his wife ouer euery limme and ioynt, that she in like case was soone dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched of life. Thus when the multitude had intelligence of these rare and lamentable murthers, they forthwith apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Macareus,</hi> and vrged him thorow examination and torment to confesse each circumstance of this bloudy Tragedie: and as he was opening the matter, and discouering the mischief which he had committed in the holy temple, prophaning a seuerall and sacred Chappel, with two notorious and inexpiable trespasses, the paines of death oppressed him, insomuch that he died soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the whole assembly of people. These miserable chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hapned to <hi>Macareus</hi> by reason of his monsterous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as a terrible and most fearfull example to the followers and imitators of his horrible profession.</p>

               <p>O miserable ende, and yet deserued hap: no better successe is to be hoped for than such ruine and cruell destruction to those that doe imbrue their hands in the bloud of the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, contrary to the law of God and nature. Besides these your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, we sée dayly what reuengement falleth to the share of those bloudy minded persons, though their villanies for a time he did, yet in the end the true God will not suffer them to scape vnpunished. For I thinke is no people of ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so voyde of good and holesome lawes in this cause, but that they prouide a sharpe punishment for wicked murtherers,
<pb facs="tcp:2148:36"/>
prouided alwaies, that whosoeuer shall transgresse, or willingly breake the saide ordinances and decrées, that then such persons by vertue of the law shall suffer worthy punishment: namely, losse of life. In your exaumples it is also manifest that those whose power and person far excéedeth and surmounteth a lawe, and whose high dignitie disdayneth to stoupe to the law and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée of the lande notwithstanding, when neither people nor Péeres may decrée sentence against them for such detestable sin and cruell murthers, the liuing God plagueth them in the ende with most sharp and grieuous punishments without remorse, being much higher aboue them, then they aboue their lawe, whereby it seemeth that if Princes by reason of their high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and dignitie, doe escape the punishment and decreed sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a law, yet the very prouidence of the highest bringeth them in the ende to open confusion &amp; vtter destruction, as your aforesaid examples haue verified it. Further it remayneth to vs, that at what time the people craued answere of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, expecting from thence the very flat determination of their God, heard often most sharpe decrees against murtherers, by their diuine Oracles pronounced: for at such time as a certayne Musicion who played on the harpe singularly well, did both play and sing at <hi>Sybaris</hi> in a solemne feast, made and set forth in the honour of <hi>Iuno,</hi> there at that time arose about him a great variance amongst the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> some saying they neuer hearde his equall, other affirming they haue often heard his Peere and and better thus diuersly contending, in the end it grew amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them to be a great quarrell, and the contention could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be ended but by harnes and weapon, the giltlesse Harper seeing the controuersie like to come to such issue, knowing he had offended neither partie, nor willing to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in their presence any longer to moue their patience, meekly departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to the alter of <hi>Iuno,</hi> thinking thereby to be safe from their fury, but the <hi>Sybarites</hi> being mightely moued against the originall cause of their argument, though he indeede had nothing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, yet notwithstanding some of them ranne to the altar, laying hands on the Musicion, and there without respect of the place, or pitie of his giltlesse person, they with murthering ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds most cruelly slew him. For which monstrous deede their God
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2148:36"/>
whom they serued, in signe of wrath, caused the Temple to flowe with bloud like streames of water from a riuer immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after that slaughter, then the <hi>Sybarites</hi> sending to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for counsaile in this case of crueltie, receiued this sharpe and bitter answere, saying;

               <p>Wherefore it is manifest, that the very Oracles cried out, and prophecied reuengement to those cruell murtherers, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them from the very thresholde of the holy temple, as men not worthie to treade on sacred ground: yet notwithstanding, the hande of the giltlesse man may shedde the bloud of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent person against his will, and not be holden as culpable or giltie in murthering his friend; for it is certainly reported, that at what time three young men being all of one City, went to <hi>Delphos</hi> to aske counsell, and to be aduertised by the Oracle of a weighty cause, falling into the hands of theeues, one of the three tendering his owne life, took his heeles and ranne away, and so escaped peril. Another (after all the villayns were hackt,
<pb facs="tcp:2148:37"/>
he wen, &amp; killed, except one, whom he also inuaded with might and maine) bent his force to haue slayne the theefe which then liued: but it fortuned (ah grieuous chaunce) that as he foyned with his sword at the villaine, thinking to haue thrust him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he missed his marke, and smote his owne fellow with such a bloudie blowe, that he gaue him his deaths wound. To him therefore that by flight auoyded danger this answere was made by the Oracle, pronouncing him guiltie of the murther of his fellowe, and therefore not worthie to come into holy Temple, saying;
<q>
                     <l>Occidi socium presens &amp; passus amicum,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And to the other asking aduice of the Oracle, this answere was rendered, for all that his hande had committed the acte.
<q>
                     <l>Defendens socium, verso mucrone necasti,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore it seemeth that the accessarie is in as damnable a case as the executor himselfe, of such villanie: for here the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle pronounceth him as giltie, and not worthie to stande in the Temple, for seeing his fellow slayn which he might easilie haue saued: being adiudged giltie in this; then much more if he had consented willingly to the murther of his fellowe which was slaine, but thorow his negligence. See againe what a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable answere the other receiued, who committed the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his owne hand, and for that his mind was free from the very thought to hurt his louing friend and fellow, was adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Oracle the true defender of his slayne friende. To conclude, according to the answere of the Oracle, it is lesser of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and easier to be pardoned when the hand doth slaye, the mind being giltlesse, and not consenting to the murther, than if the minde doe willingly stay although the handes cannot exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the acte,<note place="margin">

support vertue, and also sharply to correct and reprehend vice, lewd persons, and such disordered fellowes as contrarie to the lawe viciously liued in the weale publique. Hauing thus (as he thought) confirmed and established his Countrey in ciuile go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment by the vertue of his decrées and statutes, this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was demaunded of him, saying; <hi>Why had he not among so manie good institutions, wholesome lawes, and prescribed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, set also downe, what punishment should fall to the share of those, who with willing consent murdred or depriued father or mother of life, and so should be found guiltie of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide?</hi> Whereunto he answered, saying; <hi>Truly it falleth out not through negligence and forgetfulnesse heerein: but rather when I had thoroughly considered on the cause, I bethought me, that such offences were mightely repugnant to nature, and therefore it could not be that anie so vnnaturall should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such wicked and detestable villanie, contrarie to the law of God and nature, on those whome first procreated &amp; made them of nothing: and therefore</hi> (said he) <hi>as a needlesse thing haue I left it out from the other decrees.</hi> But the auncient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> when they had perceiued, that this odious and detestable sinne began to be practised amongst them, and in other Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Dominions vnder their iurisdiction and gouernment, (as most commonly the wicked inclination of mans nature is so apt and prone to commit such villanies how far so euer they be repugnant to nature, that no vnnaturall act or villanie can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnaccomplished) they then séeing such impietie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall actions proceed and dayly to go forward among them, that in that behalfe they were forced to constitute and ordayne this sharpe sentence and punishment against all such wicked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, prouided alwayes that whosoeuer should bee found guiltie of parricide,<note place="margin">

and honour: insomuch that he coloured his hoarie head ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growen with graye haires. This olde man comming into an Assembly of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> discouered his head for them to behold, and made a declaration of such matter whereabout he came, But <hi>Archidamus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> rising vp, said in this wise; <hi>What sound or true tale can the tongue of this fellowe report, whose heart is stayned with the spots of hypocrisie and double dealing, and whose head is couloured with counterfet comelinesse?</hi> Thus would hee in no case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the wordes of the olde man, but vtterly reiecting them, taunted the euill inclination of the olde mans nature, by those circumstances which were obiect to sight, and apparant to the eye.</p>
               <p>It is also certainly reported, that <hi>Condalus</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Mausolus</hi> King of <hi>Caria,</hi> perceiuing the people of <hi>Lysia</hi> (wherein hee was Lieutenaunt) to haue a great pride in their trimme bushes and long haire,<note place="margin">

                  </note> on a time fained that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued letters from his Master the King, that the People of <hi>Lysia</hi> should cut off their bushes of haire, and send them to him. Wherewith (perceiuing they were all astonied, fearing least that they should loose their brauerie wherein they much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) he said, If they would charge themselues with a péece of money, that then he would not doubt, but to finde out meanes, that mens haire should bee bought in <hi>Greece,</hi> and sent to the King his Master, therewithall to satisfie his minde, and they should keepe and weare still all their trimme lockes and bushes: which follie and pride to maintaine, they presently collected an infinite summe of money, which euerie priuate man disbursed willingly.</p>
               <p>Therefore my good friend, we see that this vaine and foolish pride hurteth none so much as themselues: wherefore it is more tollerable than the other though in both verie bad: for the state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride of the minde farre surmounteth the foolish pride of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell (as is before more sufficiently spoken of) the boye with his golden shooes, his gilden pouche, his cap and feather, and such other his childish toyes, thinketh himselfe and peerelesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, thrusting himselfe into the sight and viewe of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and childish mates, crauing no other Kingdome or glorie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2148:39"/>
than such peacocks pride, offendeth none nor abuseth any so much, as his owne vaine conceite and foolish fantasie. But the pride of the mind lieth hid couertly, being shrowded and shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in base and simple geare, reaching &amp; catching after king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, to the great hurt and preiudice of many. For when as a certain Roman professing méeknes vnder the colour of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly garments, being a man of good account in his countrey, and had in great reuerence and estimation, yet notwithstanding would alway goe barefooted, and in wonderfull simple attire, hauing also his table where he dined alwayes couered with a net, to make a further shewe of his méeke minde farre to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from statelines. By which counterfet humilitie be attained to diuers stately offices among the <hi>Romanes</hi> which were of great and high dignitie. In the end the <hi>Romans</hi> thinking none more fitte than he to gouern, by reason of his humilitie &amp; méek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, insomuch that they preferred him to the chiefest seate and highest place of the <hi>Roman</hi> commonwealth. But nowe being setled in this place of Maiestie, and soundly confirmed in the seat of authoritie, being now come to the very top of his long ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for desire, thought it not good to counterfette any longer with the <hi>Romans,</hi> but turned his méeknes to most hautie stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and in stead of his base attire he had the most gorgeous apparrell and costliest garments, with pretious iewels, &amp; riche stones that might any where be found. And when his seruants came according to their accustomed maner to spread the net on his table where he should féede or dine, thinking that the same méeknes had still been in their master, he said; <hi>Away with the net ye fooles, for the fish is already caught.</hi>

               <p>Truely a pretie iest, the fish being caught, to what end serueth the net. The old prouerbe before rehearsed, was not verified in him: for the <hi>Romans</hi> (belike) trusted ouer much to that olde saying, <hi>By the outward shewe ye shall knowe the inward conuersation.</hi> Wherein they clearely deceiued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: for after he possessed his place, <hi>Honores mutabant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Honor and dignitie changed his former manners.</hi> Surely the stately pride of this man being so secretly couered with meeknes, farre more offendeth than the meek and simple mind whose body is richly furnished with costly apparrell of all vaine
<pb facs="tcp:2148:40"/>
and fond colours. For surely in mine opinion the wearing of such gorgeous and painted garments, with other such plumes of peacocks pride, may well be called a vaine and foolish follie, but no such stately pride as the other: for it doeth represent to the beholder a meere weaknes of the wearers minde, and no deepe conceated fellow, but such a one as had rather stand in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his goods presently, than by any deepe reach or cunning practise to purchase himselfe authoritie or dignitie. Which minde no doubt is altogether hurtles to other, though priuate reproch to his person. There is also a kinde of pride in diuers proudly to vaunt them selues, boasting of their auncient pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, noble parentage, standing on their generositie, as though the noble acts of their auncesters were sufficient to colour, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe and hide their vaine and lewd life by their vaunting vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not considering that the good qualities, courteous behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and gentle demeanours of a man, maketh him to become a Gentleman: but rather will challenge their gentilitie from their auncient Parents, if any of them had either name or fame by any good vertue or act, although diuers of the same race and stocke, were both wicked, vaine and lewde. This also in my iudgement is in mans nature a proud vanity and ridiculous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. The wise <hi>Aristole</hi> hearing a certaine man boast &amp; vaunt that he came and descended from a noble and famous Citie, and therefore arrogantly chalenged a kind of duetifulnes to be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by reason of the noble fame thereof,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                  </note> said; <hi>Bragge not my friend of that, but first see thou be worthie to be of so noble a Citie, and not digresse from and shame so auncient a stock.</hi> Truely they deserue dispraise &amp; extreme laughter, which brag and boast of their progenitors, and thinke themselues trim men because their forefathers were famous. Who was the sire of noble <hi>Marius</hi>? assuredly no great state: his valiantnes and pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance is recorded in sundrie histories, but yet who begat him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth doubtfull and vnknowen. The same we affirm of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Seruilius, Hostilius, Romulus,</hi> all notable &amp; puisant péeres in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: neither indeed maketh it any matter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they spring or descende, if their vertue be of sufficient force to defend their parentage. Was not king <hi>Darius</hi> sonne of the meane man <hi>Histaspis,</hi> first quiuerbearer to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and yet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2148:40"/>
became noble and honourable? The last <hi>Darius</hi> whom <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> vanquished, was borne of the body of a bondwoman, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in the end became a mighty Prince. <hi>Archelaus</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> king came of the loynes of <hi>Smicha,</hi> a poore maydseruant, <hi>Menelaus</hi> the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather of <hi>Philip</hi> was nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred among bastards, and <hi>Amintas</hi> was but a seruingman, who was grandfather to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and wayted vpon <hi>Aeropa. Eumenes</hi> had but a poore fellow to his father. <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Philip</hi> first serued for salarie. The great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Themistocles</hi> was the sonne of a very simple and poore woman named <hi>Abrotone. Phocion</hi> surnamed <hi>Iustus,</hi> was at the first but a spoonemaker, or ladlemaker. Also the nobleman <hi>Epamino<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>das</hi> had but a poore and simple man to his father. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, Phalareus, Hiperbolus, Cleophon,</hi> and <hi>Demadus</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended but of poore parentage, and became in the end right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and famous. The learned <hi>Lycurgus</hi> seeing some of the hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> daily sticking and standing on their ancient parentage and generositie, thereby digressing from good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; made a law, wherein was graunted that such as continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their children in good exercises, which was no lesse profitable to the common estate, then necessarie to their priuate persons, should be called Gentleman, and haue this prerogatiue before others to haue free passage, without interturbance, to offices of dignitie in the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> commonwealth. On a time the wise <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had this cast in his dish, that although he was now a man of great fame, and had in estimation and reuerence, yet notwithstanding, his father was but a base and obscure fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and glad to get his liuing by playing the master of fence, as indeede he was as <hi>Valerius</hi> reporteth. Whereunto <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi> was not ashamed thus to reply, saying; <hi>Qui parentibus obscuris nati, ad decus praeclarnm virrute propria ascenderunt, non inferiorem laudem merentur, quàm qui nobilitate maiorum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbise iactant. Maior enim est gloria virtutibus proprijs niti, quàm alienis intumescere. They which are borne but of meane and base Parents, and rise to high honour by their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vertues, deserue or merite no lesse praise, when they which brag and boast of their right noble Progenitors.</hi> Therefore far better is that baunt to sticke and cleaue fast to their own proper
<pb facs="tcp:2148:41"/>
vertues, than ouermuch to swell with the pride of another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s glorie. But <hi>Iuuenalis</hi> reporteth of this mans father otherwise, saying;<note place="margin">

               <p>It is very true indeede, such vaunting vanitie remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in many: but it is very hard to finde such a one as is risen to great honour and dignitie in his Countrey, being descended from meane and base parentage, to vaunt and brag in causes of controuersie, of his poore Progenitors: much lesse ought he who is descended and sprong from the stocke of generositie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poore or in base estate, ouer proudly to vaunt thereof, for that either his fall was by the vicious vice of his predecessors, wherof he ought rather to blush than brag. Or els it proceedeth of his owne lasciuious or licencious vanitie, whereof he ought greatly to be ashamed. Well let this suffice, that vertue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Gentleman, and the want thereof causeth the stock and graffe to wither and fall downe. And whereas we haue alredy sufficiently touched the misdemeanors and bad behauiours of noble Peeres and high estates, and what they gain by such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered gouernment: now againe we will shew and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest how much good gouernment is commended, what praise it deserueth, and what perpetuall memorie it registreth to the eye of immortall fame: and also how farre clemencie, courtesie, humilitie, and mercie in Princes and high estates auayleth and is of force, where neither cruelty, tyrannie, or other rigorous dealing can preuaile. First concerning modestie and the fruites thereof, <hi>Demetrius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent by his father to <hi>Rome</hi> to answere the greeuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of the <hi>Grecians,</hi>

                  </note> who made a great &amp; hainous complaint against him to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for certain abuses which he had offered them in <hi>Greece,</hi> when this <hi>Demetrius</hi> was in the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> hearing his father greeuously complayned on, would forthwith haue executed the office, for which cause he came, wherefore he stoode vp and began to answere to the accusations which they so vrgently obiected against his father. But the Ambassadors of <hi>Greece</hi> so vehemently interrupted and interturbed his speach with vnpleasant babbling and rayling, insomuch that the young
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2148:41"/>
Gentleman could not be heard by reason of their great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunacie: for which cause, the yong <hi>Demetrius</hi> being greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed, with blushing chéekes in most modest manner sate him down (being greatly ashamed at their outragious railing) plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his cause with silence, because he would not be troublesome to the graue Senators, he gaue the Ambassadors his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries leaue to scolde and rayle their fill. Which when the graue Bench of the Senators perceiued, they also commaunded the antragious <hi>Grecians</hi> to silence, and dismissed them the Senate, suffering them to returne home to <hi>Grece</hi> without reformation of their wrongs, pardoning the offence of the yong mans Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sending letters into <hi>Macedon</hi> to this effect; <hi>Philip King of Macedon, we the Senatours of Rome pardon thine offence, remit the trespasses of thee done against the Cities of Grece: not for thy sake Philip, but for the modest behauiour of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius thy Sonne shewed heere in the Senate of Rome before vs, to the great wealth and good of thy Countrey, and to his perpetuall remembrance.</hi> What praise and commendation also did yong <hi>P. Cornelius Seipio,</hi> (otherwise called <hi>Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus</hi>) purchase by his singular clemencie, notable curtesie, and bountifull liberalitie: for at such time as he had taken the Citie of newe <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> with a number of prisoners &amp; captiues, and also great quantitie of riches and iewells: there at that time also was taken among the rest, a virgine of rare &amp; singular beautie: who with diuers other were brought before <hi>Scipio,</hi> after whom the people wonderfully thronged and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, delighting to sée her for the rarenesse of her beautie. But the noble <hi>Scipio</hi> enquiring of her, of what Countrey she was, and of what kindred she was descended, and perceiuing by her that shee was betroathed or made sure to a yong Prince of the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Polib. li.</hi> 10</note> whose name was <hi>Luceius.</hi> Whereupon (when he had committed the other Matrones and Maides to right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie &amp; honest persons, to the intent their chastitie might be both honestly and carefully preserued) he presently sent for the said yong man, and also for her parents. At whose comming, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the yong Prince was sore enamored of her, he thus said to him, <hi>Sir, I being a yong man, haue sent for you that are also a yong man, to come to me: the cause is, for that when this yong
<pb facs="tcp:2148:42"/>
maide being fianced or ensured to you, was brought to me by my souldiers, I heard say that you entirely loued her, as her beautie witnesseth you had good cause so to doe. If I might lawfully enioy her pleasant loue, &amp; were not otherwise occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in my minde about the affaires of the Common wealth, I could perchaunce beare her my loue, and desire to enioy the same. But now I will beare fauour to your loue, that of right ought to haue her. She hath been here with me as well and honourably kept, and her virginitie as carefully preserued, as though she had dwelled still with her owne parents, To this intent I might make of her a present to you most acceptable, and also for the preseruation of mine honour. And for this my gift, I require of you but onely this one reward, that is, that you from hencefoorth become a louing, true, and faithful friend to the Romanes, and if you esteeme me to be a good and honourable man, as my father and vncle before me were reputed to be, then thinke that there are in the noble Citie of Rome, many like vnto vs, and trust me neuer, if any people this day can be found on the earth, that you will be more glad to haue the loue and friendship of, or that you would be more sory to haue the displeasure of.</hi> The young man after great thankes geuen to him, prayed the Gods to reward him for all his goodnes, where his power sufficed not. Then were the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the mayd called foorth, who had brought with them a great summe of golde for the raunsome of their childe. But when they perceiued that the noble <hi>Scipio</hi> had geuen her fréely to her husband, then they desired him to take and accept a parte thereof, as of their gift, for the better declaration of their good hearts towards him, affirming that his receiuing therof should be as ioyfull vnto them, as the restitution of their daughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled. Then <hi>Scipio</hi> being ouercome with their long and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement intercession, caused the saide summe to be layd on the ground before his feete, and calling <hi>Lucius</hi> againe to him, hee said; <hi>Beside the dowrie that you shall receiue of your Father in law for the mariage of his daughter, ye also shall take this gift at my hande.</hi> With which his great gift, and also much honor done to him beside, he returned home to his house &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,

declaring to euery man the honor &amp; magnificence of noble <hi>Scipio,</hi> saying; There was a young man come most like a God, who both with his power in warre, and also with his gentlenes and liberalitie in peace, had ouercome all the countrey. Not long after, this young Gentleman leauing his house and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in good order, returned to <hi>Scipio,</hi> bringing with him 1400. good horsemen to the ayde and succour of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Thus first <hi>Scipio</hi> began with mercy, lenity, and gentle courtesie, which was the cause that he gote in the end to the <hi>Romanes</hi> such nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mightie victories.

For when in his warres against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> he had taken certaine noble matrons, and beutifulll virgins, he caried a vigilant eye ouer them, neither abusing any of them himselfe, nor suffering his captains or souldiers to dishonour or dishonest them in any case, calling them all together before him, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with sweete wordes in the best maner he coulde, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That none vnder paine of death should offer them villanie, graunting foorth his safeconduct to them, that they might be conueyed to their husbandes, parents and friends with honour vndefiled, richly rewarding them with iewels which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his warres, protesting also vnto them, that he for his part, was most heartely sorrie that it was his hap so to fright and terrifie such hurtlesse creatures, requesting them to take it in good part, for such was the chaunce and casualtie of warre: for which gentle behauiours, (had it not béen for certaine other lewd vices which are before mentioned) he had attained to péer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse praise.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. <hi>Alexander</hi> beeing greatly mooued with pitie, séeing their bitter teares, and considering the hard hap and bad destinie of so noble Dames, bewayled their distressed case with wéeping, further comforting them saying, that <hi>Darius</hi> theyr Lord and King was aliue, and at libertie still with his owne force and power; and although he was ouercome in that fight, yet was he readie to giue newe battaile againe (as in déede hee did) causing them to banish feare from them, for that no iniurie or wrong should happen to them, giuing also commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they should be prouided for and vsed, as to their high estate and dignitie appertained, giuing good words and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto the two yong Daughters of <hi>Darius,</hi> wishing them assuredly to thinke, and firmely to perswade themselues, that hee woulde haue as great care to bestowe them in marriage (if King <hi>Darius</hi> their father did die and perish in these warres)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2148:43"/>
as he liuing with a fatherly care would prouide for them, and that with no base or obscure mates. Which thing when <hi>Darius</hi> was truely certified of, and of the courteous entertainement of his mother, wife and sister, being all prisoners and captiues, at the hands of <hi>Alexander</hi> his enemie, although he then was able to geue battaile to the strongest king of the earth (for he agayne had gathered a most mightie and huge armie) was already o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome and conquered with the gentle courtesies of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, altogether vnwilling to fight against so friendly a foe, wherfore he sent his letters to <hi>Alexander,</hi> requiring him that he might redéeme his captiues, promising a mightie summe &amp; masse of money for their raunsome. Notwithstanding <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> would receiue no money, but required his whole kingdome for their redemption. <hi>Darius</hi> not willing to fight with so frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an enemie, sent his letters to <hi>Alexander</hi> the second time, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering one of his daughters in mariage, with part of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to him, if it might please him to accept thereof. But the vnsatiable <hi>Alexander</hi> could not be content with part, vnlesse he might haue all the whole. And as for the offer of his daughters, he returned this answere, saying; <hi>He had them already, and could doe with them his pleasure.</hi> Now was <hi>Darius</hi> forced to goe against his friendly foe the thirde time, hoping to get his prisoners, and yet notwithstanding louing and honouring the very name of <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the great courtesie and lenitie he had shewed to his familie. The army and power of <hi>Darius</hi> was at this time foure hundred thousand footmen, and an hundred thousand horsmen, thus marching toward his enemie <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> it was told him in his iorney that his wife was dead, whose death <hi>Alexander</hi> lamented with teares, and caused a noble fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to be appointed, doing to her the greatest honor he could deuise, comforting the rest, requesting them not so heauely to take the death of their friend, whose life by no meanes he coulde saue or preserue. Now was <hi>Darius</hi> ouercome (when his power was most strongest) with the benefites and friendlinesse of his foe, so honouring in his heart his aduersarie, that for loue he bare him, he could not arange his battaile against him, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing greatly in himselfe, and also saying to his friends, <hi>If I am ouercome in this warre, yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I haue great cause
<pb facs="tcp:2148:44"/>
to reioyse that I shall be conquered by so noble a minded prince.</hi> Wherefore againe he sent his letters to <hi>Alexander,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him the greater part of his kingdome, to the riuer of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> with his other daughter: and for the other captiues he offered three hundred thousand talents. But <hi>Alexander</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this answere, refusing the compositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying; <hi>It was need lessethankes of his enemie, for he alwaies had vsed to reuenge himselfe on armed men, and on his fighting foe, and not vpon hurtlesse women.</hi> Thus by the hautie courage of <hi>Alexander, Darius,</hi> was forced and drawen into the fielde vnwillinglie to fight against his enemie, whom he estéemed as a friendly foe, notwithstanding there was fought betwixt them a fierce and cruell battaile, the <hi>Persians</hi> in the end being ouerthrowen with great slaughter, for that <hi>Darius</hi> their Captaine could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or stirre them vp to fight against his friend. In which conflict certaine of the friends and alliance of <hi>Darius,</hi> séeing the battaile vtterly lost, and that <hi>Alexander</hi> was like presently to be Lord of the field, sought to betray their king into the hands of <hi>Alexander,</hi> thereby to pick a thanke, or as they say, to currie fauour. In acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishing of which thing <hi>Darius</hi> was sore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his allies, notwithstanding he escaped &amp; preuented their purpose. But <hi>Alexander</hi> not hearing of <hi>Darius,</hi> sent out seuen thousand horsmen to prosecute after him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they could not finde, they requested leaue to rest themselues and their ouer wearied horses: then one of the souldiers going to water his horse at a certaine riuer thereby, by chaunce found out <hi>Darius</hi> lying in a coach or chariot, being mortally wounded with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gréeuous hurtes, ready to yéeld vp his life, &amp; comming néere to the coach, he did plainly perceiue that it was <hi>Darius,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> did well knowe that he was one of the crewe or bande of <hi>Alexander,</hi> wherefore he called him to his coache, saying; <hi>My good friend, I greatly reioyce that it is my good fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I die, to haue so fitte a messenger as yourselfe, to carrie these my last words, not to my enemie, but to my good frend Alexander, at whose handes I haue founde great fauour: say thou my friende, that I confesse I die greatly indebted vnto him, being altogether vnable to requite the very least of his courtesies shewed to my mother, wife and children, and that I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2148:44"/>
haue of him a more happier enemie, than my kinsmen are frendly. For my mother, wife, and children haue found both fauour and life at the hand of mine enemie: and I my selfe am depriued of life by my kinsmen and allies, to whom I gaue both life and land. Wherefore I wish as great happines to fall on him, as he being victor can wish or desire: and that I euen now dying, doe wholy committe and betake both myself, my landes and goods, into the hands of so noble a minded prince, praying both to the high Gods, and also to the infernall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, that he may be victor against whomsoeuer he wageth warre: and that all blessings may happen to him according to his owne hartes desire. And for the further acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of my vnfeined loue, and well wishing desire towardes Alexander my approued friend, take here of me this my right hande (which thou seest me cut of willingly being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue) and carrie it to thy Lord and master my good friend, as a sure seale and firme pledge of my vnfeyned good will and hartie well wishing towards him.</hi> Thus died <hi>Darius,</hi> when hee coulde no otherwise gratifie and recompence his friendly foe, for the great fauoures and courtesies shewed to his familie, than by the acknowledging of his clemencie and and gentlenes. This friendly fauour of <hi>Alexander</hi> was soone spred thorow the world, and more often repeated to his high praise and commendation, than the great and famous victorie which he had against the <hi>Persians,</hi> which was a most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conquest, and remayneth at this day the very chiefe and most principall praise and merite to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was there not likewise singular courtesie, and wonderful gentlenes in King <hi>Darius,</hi> which <hi>Alexander</hi> conquered. For at such time as certaine of his noble men sought to entangle and take him by treason, which were of no small account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Persians, Darius</hi> the King hauing intelligence of their wicked practise, thus considered with himselfe, and brake it vnto his secrete friend, saying; Here are diuers noble men which traiterously haue conspired my death: if now I shoulde put them all to the sworde, there is no doubt but that I should stirre vp against me many of their friends and allies, and so be
<pb facs="tcp:2148:45"/>
forced to make great effusion of bloud, which truely is contrarie and repugnant to my nature. The cause surely to me is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, why they should thus wickedly worke my hurt. It may be they would be better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with another king to raign ouer them, than with me now their present prince: yet truely I rather chuse to haue it registred of their disloyaltie toward their Prince, by my death, than to purchase to my selfe the name of a cruell tyrant, by their bloudy slaughters. With these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he concealed the matter, making a shew as though he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mistrusted any such thing: on a time riding foorth a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, these noblemen which had conspired against him, flocked together, hoping now to get some conuenient time and place for their purpose, riding with the king to the forrest, making a shewe of great ioy and gladnes, to the end the king should sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no euill: but he full well knew their intent though he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the matter. Thus following their game they trouped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, hoping that the king would come that way which they had laide and stauled for him, which indéede he did. The King séeing their intent, and spying their order, singled himself from the rest of his companie, going directly to the traytors, who stoode in ambush redy to fulfill and accomplish that for which cause they came. The king boldly rushed into the middest of them, saying; <hi>Now ye traytors, dispatch and committe that which ye are determined to doe, I haue long time knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your intent, &amp; for because I would not be counted a bloudy prince I haue spared you all, rather chusing that your handes should be unbrued in the bloud of your giltlesse Prince, to your euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting infamie and dishonor, than my sworde should be stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the slaughter of so many Subiectes, wishing rather here to die and free your troubled mindes, than to liue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine such an eyesore to so many noble estates, though tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to their Prince. Therefore,</hi> said he, <hi>Quid igitur non exequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini id cuius gratia venistis? Why doe ye not dispatch your purpose in respect of the accomplishment whereof you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted hether?</hi> Then they all looked on ech other in the face, being troubled in their mindes, greatly repenting their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, that euer they went about to worke such villany to so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a minded Prince, who knew their practise before, and yet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2148:45"/>
spared to punish them, rather choosing himselfe to die, than to vse tyrannie on his subiects (which indeede had been no cruelty but vpright iustice) wherefore they all with one accorde threwe downe their speares, and lighted from their saddles, confessing their trespasse, humbly submitting themselues on their knees, crauing mercie at the hands of <hi>Darius,</hi> proffering their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie seruice to doe whatsoeuer hee hencefoorth gaue them in commaundement.</p>
               <p>Thus with the great mercie and clemencie of <hi>Darius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloudshed, the vnbrideled stomackes of his nobles were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and made quiet, which by a bloudy hand he coulde neuer haue brought to passe. And from that time foorth they were mindfull of so gratious a benefite, remayning euer after most faithfull, obedient, and full of duetie to <hi>Darius</hi> their milde and gentle Prince. In like maner <hi>Titus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, sonne to <hi>Vespasianus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aurel. li.</hi> 7.</note> excelled in humilitie, clemencie and courtesie: for at such time as two of his chiefest Péeres had consented &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired to the murthering of their master the king. <hi>Titus</hi> hauing knowledge thereof, first calling them into a priuie chamber, telling them home of their wicked intent, wishing them (by milde and gentle meanes) to become better Subiectes to their hurtles Prince, who, so farre as he knew, had not deserued at their hands the very thought of such a wicked inuention. And afterward taking them both with him to a common game or play, setting himselfe betweene them both, willing them to sit neere his person; and so soone as the sword-players came out with their glittering swords, <hi>Titus</hi> called for one of them, which was presently deliuered to him: then he foorthwith gaue it to the one, and after to the other, vnder colour of feeling how sharp it was, beholding them with a smiling countenance, saying; <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detisne potestates fato dari, frustràque tentari facinus potiundi spe, vel admittendi metu? See ye not saith he, that authoritie and power is geuen by destinie, therefore it is vaine to trie by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practise to possesse the place, and as vaine it is to feare the losing thereof?</hi> Meaning thereby, that although they had the sword in their handes, yet could they not displace him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God had setled. Thus courteously did <hi>Titus</hi> intreate his Nobles, saying that he had greater pleasure, and more delight to correct
<pb facs="tcp:2148:46"/>
offenders with lenitie, than to chastice them with cruelty, which caused him to raigne more quietly in his life, and also at his death to be bewayled thorow the whole earth, calling him the darling and delight of mankind. He was wont to say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night, that the day before he had not geuen well to the poore, or béene liberall amongst his friends; <hi>Amici, perdidimus diem. Frends, we haue lost a day. Gelon</hi> king of <hi>Syracusa</hi> behaued himselfe wonderfull mildly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eli. li.</hi> 6.</note> gently, and peaceably in his kingdome, yet notwithstanding he was of some tearmed a tyrant. But this is most certaine, that when diuers of his commonwealth sought wayes to shorten his life by cruell murther, wayting for fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to execute and accomplish their vile pretended villanie. Whereof when <hi>Gelon</hi> was enformed and certified, he called a court, and sommoned an assemblie of <hi>Syracusians,</hi> which being done, in the presence and countenance of them all, hee went vp, into an hauty and high place, in maner of a pulpit, hauing on his bodie harnesse, and in his hands weapons bright and glistring. In which sort and order he stoode before them, making a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his faithfull care which he alwayes had ouer the weale publique, tendering the welfare of them all euen as his owne life. Hauing thus done he vnarmed himselfe, laying down both armour and weapon at his féete, and vttered these words to the congregation which was there assembled, saying; <hi>En amictus tunicula, nudus armorum asto, dedo me vobis, vt pro voluntate, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitóque mecum agatis. Behold, I stand before you naked, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, in a thinne wastcote, I yeald my life into your handes, my body is at your commandement, deale with me according to your pleasure. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>I detest the place if you despise my person, neither doe I wish any longer to liue in my calling than you shall well like of my gouernment.</hi> When <hi>Gelon</hi> had thus yealded himselfe to his subiects, the whole assembly of the <hi>Syracusians</hi> were much amased, and thereupon were so affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in mind, that néeds they would (there was no way to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) deliuer those traiterous varlets, and rebellious villaines to the kings power, to punish them according to the proportion of their offence, and gaue him their suffrages &amp; vniuersall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to continue ouer them his dominion &amp; gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: yet not withstanding would not <hi>Gelon</hi> correct those offenders, but fréely

forgaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their trespasses, counselling them euer after to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better subiects, and to wish to him in their harts no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than he would deserue at their hands. Which great mercy and fauor of <hi>Gelon</hi> the king, made the <hi>Syracusians</hi> to honor and duetifully obey him so long as he liued among them, and after his death to haue him in perpetuall remembrance for his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courtesie, and notable clemencie. They erected and planted a standing image wearing a single peticote, representing to the beholder that this king did raigne and rule by gentle and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous meanes, more safer, and far stronger than he that should raigne like a tyrant, with harnes and armour of proofe.</p>

               <p>Truely Sir, it is now in these our dayes most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest how mightely the lenitie and gentlenes of Princes is of force, and auayleth: and with what willing hearts their subiects will venture both life, land and limme in the seruice and defence of their so milde and gentle a Prince: yea if it were possible that one body should venture the losse of life ten times, or presently to runne to ten deaths for the preseruation <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

heart and noble courage in his countreis cause, willing to lose his life for the profite and welfare of his weale publique.

who being thereupon presently taken, and his pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose further knowen, <hi>Porsena</hi> the king caused a great fire to be made to burne <hi>Sceuola</hi> in, which when he came to the place, hee thrust his right hand willingly into the fire, first suffering it to burne to ashes, couragiously saying; <hi>I willingly committe this my hand to the fire, which fayled to kill Porsena the tyrant.</hi> Further affirming at his death, that there were thrée hundreth <hi>Romanes</hi> more redy prest, which had also sworne the death of the king, if he fayled, and would as willingly venture themselues in their Countreys cause, as he before them had done: and as it were among themselues striuing who first should doe that good seruice to their countrey.

               <p>I confesse that euery subiect ought willingly to offer his body in defence of his Prince and natiue Soyle, and not to haue so great a care for the preseruation of his priuate person, as for the benefit and welfare of his Prince and Commonwealth. Were it not a vile reproach and ignomie to those people that should by their cowardlines suffer their king to be slaine in the field, and they themselues to remaine aliue and geue the looking on? Contrariwise, is it not great honor to him that shall hazard his life, yea or run to right desperate exploites in the good cause or quarrell of his Prince? To conclude, it is the part of euery good prince to haue a care of the welfare of his commonwealth, and of the preseruation of his subiects: and also the part of all honest Subiects to haue a duetiful care to preserue their prince and a manly courage to defend their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey.

<pb facs="tcp:2148:53"/>
which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> long time most greeuously helde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, being also mightely ouermatched with the subtile and wilie <hi>Hanniball,</hi> chiefe General of the hoast of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,</hi> who came marching to the very walles of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the <hi>Romans,</hi> staying their Consuls, and beating downe their strongest powers: whose force and policie made the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> to shake for feare, the Senators &amp; graue fathers to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in despaire, the noble matrones and young damsels to cry out and lament most pitifully, as if the Citie euen then shoulde haue beene sacked, knowing not how by any meanes to repell the enemie, being in this distresse, and ready to be spoyled by their mortall foe, when all their flourishing young Gentlemen were almost slaine, and their chiefest Captaines and most noble warriors put to the sword. Now in this great extremitie, the noble <hi>Scipio</hi> required leaue of the sorowfull <hi>Romans</hi> to reuenge their iniuries on the bloody minded <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> not doubting but that with a lusty courage, and circumspect care, to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter the power and policie of fierce <hi>Hanniball.</hi> Thus when the graue Senators, and the rest of the distressed <hi>Romanes</hi> did see such willingnes in the noble youth <hi>Scipio,</hi> knowing that both his father and vncle were slaine in the same warre before, also seeing such inuincible courage in the braue minded Gentleman, they all with willing consent made him gouernour almost ouer their conquered band: requiring him with lamentable teares, (hanging about his necke) that at this time he would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their miserable and distressed estate, and seek to hold vp and maintaine their wauering Common wealth, which was nowe ready to fall into the hands of their cruell enemie. Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> hauing taken his Countreys cause on him, with a noble heart marched against the hardie <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and draue him (as well by policie as by force) out of the borders and confines of <hi>Italie,</hi> ouercomming him in diuers notable battailes in <hi>Spaine,</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also the whole Countrey of <hi>Spaine</hi> againe, which the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> had lately woon from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> not resting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had chased and driuen <hi>Haniball</hi> back into his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Affricke,</hi> yea and in the end penned him vp hard to the very walles of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which was his chiefest defence and refuge, where was fought a cruell and bloudy battaile betwixt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2148:53"/>
two of the most noblest captaines of the world, contending in that fight for the Empire of the whole world, watching to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now it should fall. For the pride of these two empires of Rome and Carthage, could neuer digest or brooke the statelines of each other, which first was the cause of this bloudy warre, but now at this time it was turned to a whole Monarchie, for <hi>Scipio</hi> in this battaile ouercame the Carthaginians, and caused stately Carthage to be yeelded to his mercie. Now when <hi>Scipio</hi> had finished this perilous war, he returned with the conquest of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica and Spaine, making the stout captaine <hi>Hanniball</hi> to fly for his safetie, causing the hautie Carthaginians to yeeld them selues on their knees to the mercie of the Romanes, returning into Rome with the Empire (in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner) of the whole worlde, to the great ioy and euerlasting fame of the Romanes. Surely a great and sodain change, to see the Romans raigne as victors, when that not long before the dreadfull Captaine <hi>Hanniball</hi> had ranged all Italie ouer, and driuen the Romanes into their citie of Rome, who euery day expected the destruction of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their Citie; and now not onely to be Lordes againe ouer their owne Empire, but also ouer the stately Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who before had sought their subuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and confusion, which hapned by the wise gouernment, and valiant courage of noble <hi>Scipio.</hi> The Romanes being now fréed from all miseries and calamities, and againe ruling as kings ouer the whole worlde, could not chuse but defile themselues with notable ingratitude, and spot themselues with wonderful vnkind dealing: for <hi>Scipio</hi> who had thus pleasured his countrey, because the world had him in great honor and admiration, comming dayly from far to the citie of Rome to behold and doe honour to so valiant and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a Gentleman, who had so manfully defended his countrey, and gotten such peereles prayse to the Romanes: wherfore the Romanes disdayning that the honour of <hi>Scipio</hi> should dayly so increase, repining and grudging at him, séeking by all meanes possible to hunt him from the citie, because they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themselues to be beholding vnto him for his noble actes, despising that any one should liue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, that should be accounted the preseruer or vpholder of their common wealth, which was by reason of their intollerable pride: therefore they
<pb facs="tcp:2148:54"/>
sought by all meanes to banish and exile him from the Citie; (which was by his meanes preserued, as the world at this daye can wel witnesse) inuenting against him strange and diuers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations. First hee was charged with the olde matter betwixt the <hi>Locrenses</hi> and <hi>Pleminius,</hi> wherein (as they say) he being Consull was corrupted with mony, and therefore ministred not true Iustice. Againe, they layd to his charge, that his sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prisoner to <hi>Antiochus</hi> (their enemie) was deliuered to him without raunsome, which they thought was verie suspitious. For these small causes, he was called before the Senate to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to their obiections, which were but of small importance, euen as if he had béen a meane man &amp; base person, vrging cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against him with extremitie, without fauour, or hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie respect to his noble actes done for the Common wealth; which ingratitude he tooke so displesantly, that he departed from the Court, and went into the countrey to the towne of <hi>Lytarne,</hi> where he dwelled as long as he liued, exiling himself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> for euer: and at his death he commaunded his bodie to bee bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there also, that his bones might not rest in that vnkind Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The most worthie Captaine <hi>Hannibal</hi> was also banished <hi>Carthage</hi> by his vnkinde country men, when he had done won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull exploytes in his Countreys cause: and although he was in the ende conquered by <hi>Scipio,</hi> yet was he well knowen to bée the most famous and worthiest Captain liuing in the world at that time, notwithstanding Fortune fauoured him not. Thus we sée, that diuers are most vile &amp; hardly recompenced by theyr vnkinde countrey men, for their good seruice done.</p>

All which sayings of the Poets, are but to showe the piercing force and ancient anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of Loue: faining also, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> being chiefe of al the Gods, could not withstand the furie of Loue, (much lesse then could anie of the inferior Gods) but oft did change his shape to haue his pleasure, <hi>Nam Iouem ipsum, modo in Cygnum, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do in Taurum transformauit, quandoque in aurum conslauit: Neptunum equi,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:2148:55"/>
and blindly without consideration doe fall to foolish fancie, and doting desire. But this no doubt is but foolish babble of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Poets, rather encouraging fonde men to goe forwarde in their folly: for that (say they) the Gods could not bridle their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the force of loue, therefore much lesse men. Well let this suffice, what greater calamity hath hapned to man than such as hath beene procured by inordinate and vnsatiable loue. Was not <hi>Paris,</hi> sonne to <hi>Priamus</hi> king of Troy, the very cause by his inordinat loue, that brought to passe such cruell wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Gréekes and Troyans, wherein both his aged father and brethren were slaine, his countrey spoyled, and the citie of Troy mightely defaced with fire, &amp; throwen flat to the ground, with the slaughter of many thousands of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What was the first occasion of the great warre betwixt the Thebanes and Phoceans, which could hardly be ended in ten yeares, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fonde loue of a certain Phocean, who tooke perforce a Theban woman out of the hands of a Theban. What also was the cause that <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedon so oft and sodainly returned from his warres, leauing all, as the prouerb saith, at six &amp; seuen, with out order, to his reproach and wonderfull losse, but only the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate loue he bare to <hi>Cleopater.</hi> Did not noble <hi>Achilles</hi> purchase great dishonor by doting loue? For when he lay at the siege of Troy, because <hi>Atridas</hi> had taken his swéet loue &amp; gréen sléeues from him, he would no longer fight in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis cause which was the death of many a thousand Gréeke, vntil his swéet heart <hi>Briseis</hi> was restored againe, or els (as some say) because <hi>Hector</hi> had slaine his louing companion <hi>Patroclus</hi> in his own armour. Wise <hi>Vlisses</hi> was in like sort intangled in the same snare, for when <hi>Agamemnon</hi> and the other captains of Gréece called for him to goe to Troy to reuenge the villanie which the Troyans had offered, enrolling his name as a chiefe Peere of the Greekes: but <hi>Vlisses</hi> newly maried to <hi>Penelope,</hi> was not willing to goe to Troy in his countreis cause, but to play and daily with his late loue at home, insomuch that when the king and captaines of the Greekes were fully prepared and ready to goe to Troy, <hi>Vlisses</hi> fayned himselfe mad, and out of his wits, and because he would the better perswade them of his madnes, hee coupled dogs together, and ran with a plowe raging ouer

the fieldes sowing salt, making as though he were starke mad without either wit or sense, but <hi>Palamides</hi> loathing to loose so fit a mate as <hi>Vlysses</hi> was, tooke <hi>Thelemacus</hi> the sonne of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses,</hi> and layd him in the way as his father came running with his plow: but <hi>Vlysses</hi> not so madde, but lifted vp the plow, and missed the child, whereby <hi>Palamides</hi> perceiued that he dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the matter, and cried out, thy craft and subtiltie <hi>Vlysses</hi> is bewrayed and found out, therefore leaue off thy counterfaite madnes, and goe with vs to <hi>Troy.</hi> Thus when <hi>Vlysses</hi> had disgraced himselfe (by his doting follie) to his shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, was in the ende forced to goe to <hi>Troy</hi> with a flea in his eare. <hi>Hercules</hi> that noble champion and Conquerour of the world, when he had done many notable and worthie exploites, whereof the world at this day beareth witnesse; at the last to the vtter defacing of all his former actions he fell to doting in such fond sort, that he laid his weapons at the foote of <hi>Iole</hi> his loue, and became her spinning slaue, refusing no toyle whereunto she commaunded him, which thing (notwithstanding his valiant déedes) at this day remaineth a vile reproch and blot to his dead carkasse. What was the cause that the most valiant <hi>Sampson</hi> lost his great force and strength, but by the peeuish loue he bare to <hi>Dalila,</hi> who had oftentimes attempted his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but could neuer bring her purpose to effect, vntill such time, that he thorough inordinate and doting loue, must néedes reueale his secrets, which was the chiefe cause of his vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: for these causes did the Poets faine, that women are to men an euill, yet notwithstanding they owe them this fauour, to say, they are necessary euilles, <hi>Homerus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:2148:56"/>
cause is vtterly to be condemned: for vnder the colour that all women are euill, they goe about to hide and cloake the foolish follie of mad doting men, making women a veile or shadow to hide and couer the doting fondnes of vnsatiable men. Indeede the olde prouerbe is, <hi>Ignis, mare, mulier, tria sunt mala. That sire, the sea, and a woman, are three euils.</hi> Truely a strong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then may it like wise be said that men are euill, for that one man hath killed another: and surely by this reason the former three are also euil. For if a man will cast himselfe into the fier, no doubt but that he shal burne, or into the sea, where he may be drowned, or els into the calamities of such a mariage, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ouer fondly to dote, which he well knew before would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase his trouble and vexation. But my good friend, my purpose is not to exclaime on, or blame faultlesse women, who cannot bridle the fond affection of their importunate louers: wherefore I will somewhat more amply speake of fonde and doting loue, which is as well in the one as in the other, and what inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience doth consequently follow their doting folly. <hi>Semiramis</hi> being the most amiable Lady of the world,<note place="margin">

For being drownd in such fond affection toward his sonne <hi>Darius,</hi> (not content himselfe with his scepter and kingdome which he quietly possessed) hee presently aduanced him to taste the secretnes and sweete of his kingdome, not satisfieng himselfe to be a commander ouer his people, but would be a seruant, and be commanded by his sonne, &amp; so it hapned to him as he deserued, for this princox his sonne,
<pb facs="tcp:2148:57"/>
being established in the kingdome by his doting father, became at the last so lordly ouer his foolish father that hee woulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him in all causes as his duetifull and obedient subiect, it chanced that his father <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had married the concubine which he before had taken in his warres, who at that time was péerelesse in beautie. Now <hi>Darius</hi> being in possession of his fathers kingdome, by vertue of his authoritie he called his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his presence as a common subiect, saying, Father, as you haue put the kingdome into my hand, and made me ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute King thereof: so whosoeuer this kingdome containeth, is also my subiect, and vnder my authoritie, therfore sir, my pleasure is, that you deliuer and yéelde into my handes, your wife (which was the concubine) for she is faire in my sight, and therefore I greatly desire to haue her, and by vertue of my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie I straightly commaund, no resistance to the contrarie. But <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> although he had made his sonne King, knew that hee was his father, wherefore hee contrary to his sonnes minde, detained <hi>Aspasia</hi> his newe married wife; which deniall caused his sonne <hi>Darius</hi> to conspire the death of his resisting father, because (as he thought) hee was not absolute King to commaund, as after the death of his father hee should be, and also did associate in this his vnnaturall confederacie, fifty bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were begotten by his owne father <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by diuers concubines. But this doting King (as it chanced) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had made himselfe a subiect to his prowd sonne, yet by good helpe of his nobles, he detected the cause, and found out the treason. And in the same day that <hi>Darius</hi> made account to accomplish his wicked enterprise, he was himselfe and all the rest of the confederates taken, and fell into the same snare that they had prepared for their aged father: for <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> put both them, their wiues and children to the sworde, that none of that wicked race should remaine aliue, the aged King for verie griefe that he had conceiued by his owne follie, soone ended his life, a more happier King than a father. It were but a tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call historie of <hi>Leyr,</hi> sometime King of this land, which is so sufficiently set down and made manifest in their English Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, what enormities, calamities and infinite miseries, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, by the fond and doting loue which he bare towards
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2148:57"/>
his daughters. For by a foolish conceipt which he had taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, so farre doating in an vnmeasurable sort, and as it were being ouer much blinded with a fond conceipt and foolish affection towards the yong nice wenches, that hee must néedes (forsooth) diuide his Kingdome betwixt them in his life, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly dispossesse himselfe, standing euer after to their reward &amp; courtesie. Thus when hée had displaced himselfe, and deuision of the Kingdom was made ioyntly to the vse of his daughters, being bestowed and married in seuerall parts of the Land, hée himselfe thought good to remaine a time with the one, and as long a space with the other, vntill the good olde King had tyred both his daughters; who soone began to be wearie of their aged Father, denying and abbridging him in a maner of things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie and néedfull: so that the poore old King was forced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough extreame néede to séeke redres at his yongest daughters hand, whom he neuer could well fancie, neither had euer giuen anie thing vnto; remaining out of his Kingdome, because hee had bequeathed her no part thereof: at whose hand the poore distressed King found reliefe and also redresse of his wrongs, to his great comfort in his olde age. Thus it remaineth euident &amp; extant at this day, what miseries, calamities, enormities, infinit troubles and dayly vexations, consequently doo fall to man by that fond conceipt in doating folly, inordinately louing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately fonding ouer wife, sonne, daughter, or others who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, as the tenor of our conference hath hethertoo tended and expressed: therefore my good friend, leauing to your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our former speaches, to be well and diligently noted, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may somewhat hereafter perceiue that you are profited, and then I shall thinke my paines well bestowed, and our first méeting right happie.

            <head>The miserable calamities, and lamentable distresses of bloudie Battaile and ruinous Warre, with the vnspeakable mischiefes that consequently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth disdainfull enuie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas diuers calamities and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries incident to man, are alreadie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently explayned and set downe; wherein he wilfully runneth to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and present destruction, by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and vnsatiable appetites: not withstanding there remaineth as yet vnspoken of the greeuous enormities of despitefull Warre, with the infinite miseries and distressed calamities thereunto belonging, which also hapneth to man by his immoderate and vntollerable pride. But now first to decipher the cruell state of ruinous Warre, it hath béene most vainely prooued by Logicall probations, that Warre is incident and vneuitable to a Common wealth. For (as they say) Warre bringeth ruine, ruine bringeth pouertie, pouertie procureth peace, and peace in time increaseth riches, riches causeth statelinesse, statelinesse increaseth enuie, enuie in the end procureth deadly mallice, mortall mallice proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth open warre and battaile: and from warre againe as before is rehearsed: so that by this argument, the weale publike must either be in pouertie or els in war, (which truly we oftentimes sée to fall out accordingly). But is this sophisticall argument of sufficient force to blinde and cloake the badde corruption of mans nature, as though riches were master to the man, &amp; not the man ouer his riches; either is it consequently incident vnto him that is rich, to carrie mallice, enuie and mortall hatred in his minde, or otherwise to him that is in pouertie to séeke for peace; Then let vs attribute it to the whéele wherein one thing successiuely followeth another, and not to bee redressed by the prouident gouernment of man. Surely I am not of that mind, although riches doth oft abuse the man, and the man his riches yet notwithstanding it is no generall consequent, that all rich
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2148:58"/>
men are malicious persons, séeking after ruinous warre &amp; bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die battaile: for then should I thinke it a vaine thing for a man to striue with the corruption of his nature, to preuent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint such miserable calamities by his prouident wisedome, as maye after incidently happen and fall out; but rather wish him to runne headlong with his vnbridled affections to such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall chaunces, as may (howsoeuer the world falleth out) come to passe. But truly I am of this opinion, that whosoeuer hath the gift of temperance, can neither bee proud in authoritie and high dignitie, whereby mallice and enuie maye growe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; nor in pouertie to be so vnsatiable couetous, that suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent shall not serue him; but whether riches encrease, continue, or diminish, no doubt but that Temperance hath such a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent foresight and prudent care to holde it selfe content without battaile. Wherefore to make frustrate this former fond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Warre is not so incident to man, but that by wisedome it may easely be preuented.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to our purpose againe concerning the calamitie of warre;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iustin. li.</hi> 1.</note> the ancient Historiographer <hi>Trogus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Ninus</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> first made warre, being stirred vp with pride and couetousnesse, and first of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers assayed to bring other Nations and Regions vnder his subiection, fighting with his neighbours and confines for supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, wherein he made great effusion of bloud and mightie slaughters of people. Yet notwithstanding the same <hi>Trogus</hi> affirmeth, that there were certaine Kings before him, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded barbarous Nations and rude Regions, to the intent to bring them to be ciuill people. For (saith hee) <hi>Fuere quidem temporibus antiquiores Vexores rex Aegypti, &amp; Scythiae rex Tanais, quorum alter in Pontum, alter in Aegyptum exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit: sed longinqua, non finitima bella gerebant; nec imperium sibi, sed populis suis gloriam tenebant, contentique victoria, imperio abstinebant.</hi> There were before him, <hi>Vexores</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Tanais</hi> King of <hi>Scythia,</hi> the one going into <hi>Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the other into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and making warre a farre off, and not on their neighbors: neither did they séeke to get principalitie to themselues, but perpetuall glorie to their Countrey men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themselues with victorie, refrained to holde them vnder
<pb facs="tcp:2148:59"/>
subiection, sauing in repressing their barbarous maners. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith <hi>Pompeius; Ninus</hi> was the first that made warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he inuaded his confines and borderers, striuing for regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fighting for superioritie, and earnestly going about to get the Kingdomes of his neighbours vnder his subiection; and not these Kings who sent their power into forraine countries, to tame and make ciuill such barbarous people, and to bring them to good gouernment, and then to leaue their kingdomes to their owne authoritie. But <hi>Ninus</hi> hath béen so rightly imitated and iustly followed, that at this day warre increaseth of trifling cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to most bloudie battaile. Did not the cruell warre of the <hi>Persians</hi> growe of a small occasion and grudge betwixt <hi>Mena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Samius,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Also the bloudie conflict called <hi>Praelium sacrum,</hi> began about the exaction of the iudgement of the <hi>Amphictions?</hi> the <hi>Cheronean</hi> warre bred of a light occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Which warres, although they sprang but of friuolous causes, could not be ended without great slaughters. Therefore it is an easier thing to begin war, than to end it: wherefore a man ought first to haue a care howe to finish that which he taketh in hand, or else he runneth blindly to his enterprise, hauing also consideration, that whosoeuer shal first begin warre, sounding the trumpe of defiance vpon small occasions, doth as it were open his gate to be spoyled, as well of the forren as domestique enemie; such misgouernment &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order there is in warre: for the rude and vnbridled rascall doth gape after so fit an opportunitie, to deuoure, spoyle and rob the honest and true subiect, boystrously intruding himselfe into the houses, &amp; arrogantly challenging to be partakers of the goods &amp; substance of the quiet people, which they haue long time trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for with great paines and carefull toyle, so that he who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be content to enioy and possesse his owne proper goods pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately with quietnes, let him proclaime open warre, &amp; hee shall soone be rid of that griefe. Who is so prone to bloudie broyles, as such as haue by euillhusbandrie (as they terme it) spent their lands,<note place="margin">

Was not <hi>Rome</hi> in great perill to haue béen spoyled by a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crue of bankrupts. For <hi>Lucius Sergius Cataline,</hi> a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Rome,</hi> when hee had by riot spend his patrimonie, beeing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2148:59"/>
altogether vnable to maintaine his prodigalitie and wanton vaine in immoderate spending, went about to spoile, sack, and destroy his owne natiue citie and countreymen, associating to him in this his greeuous conspiracie, such outlawes and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>routs as either stoode in feare of a law, or els such vnthrifts as himselfe, as had wantonly and most vainly spent and consumed their goods and possessions, which presently were as soone allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as himselfe was ready to entise, hoping to be made rich by the spoile of their owne countreymen, when they had vnthrifte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wasted their owne. This rable rout of vnbrideled riotors had wrought their mischieuous purpose to such effect, that their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enterprice had taken place, if by the prouident &amp; wise fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of <hi>Cicero</hi> it had not beene preuented, neither was it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen that any one <hi>Roman</hi> of good gouernment, or any one that liued orderly in the commonwealth, without riot or other bad and lewd conuersation, was found culpable or gilty in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conspiracie, although diuers principall and chiefe men at the first were suspected, notwithstanding they were in the ende cleerely defended, and apparantly freed from that slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reproach and ignomie by their owne Citizens.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Liu. li.</hi> 5.</note> Did not <hi>Brennus</hi> in like manner leade and conduct a mighty &amp; huge bande of <hi>Gaules,</hi> who had before spent their goods by ryot, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie, and disordering themselues in many bad and vile mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors, spoyling and robbing most vnmercifully the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys as they marched, committing sacriledge, with a number of most vile villaines, to recouer againe their former vaine expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Did they not in the end after many cruell acts, vnsatiable spoyles, and shamefull robberies, most miserably perish, to the wonderfull example of such spoyling outlawes? What was the cause that the <hi>Troyans</hi> inuaded <hi>Italie,</hi> making such hauock and spoyle in what countrey soeuer they arriued, but their greedy &amp; couetous mindes to recouer their vnthriftie losses? For when they had by their own vnfaithfulnes greatly abused their frends the <hi>Greekes,</hi> with a most shamefull abuse, the <hi>Greekes</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement thereof sacked and spoyled their citie, slaying and murthering the vnfaithfull <hi>Troyans</hi>; sauing certaine which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward made warres in <hi>Italie,</hi> which were saved at the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Troy,</hi> for betraying their king and citie into the hands
<pb facs="tcp:2148:60"/>
of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> this remaine of the disloyall <hi>Troyans</hi> so scoured and pilled the coastes of diuers countreyes, to get and take per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force whatsoeuer they could finger, arriued at the last in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they made sharp warre, spoyling the people, and wasting the Countrey, vntill such time as they had taken the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from the lawfull inhabitors thereof. Thus it is most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that first warre is begun and set forward either by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable person, or els by the rebell, bankrout, or outlaw: the one to satisfie his vnbrideled appetite, plaguing diuers for his owne priuate gaine: the other for his misgouernment and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both to Prince and law, to whom warre is swéete and most pleasant to answere their gréedy expectation withall. But war to the contented person and quiet subiect, is a hell, and the very scourge of God, the name whereof is most odious and terrible to the quiet minde, for it bringeth all miseries and calamities to man, as namely, plague, pestilence, sodain death, murther, bloudy battaile, cruel slaughters, miserable destruction of many towns, ouerthrow of stately cities, sword, fire and famine, with a thousand miseries incidert to man by such a spiteful guest. The olde prouerbe saith, <hi>Dulce bellum inexpertis, sed acerbum expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientibus. Warre is sweete and pleasant to the vnskilfull and ignorant, but bitter and vnsauerie to the skilful.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, although war be most fierce and cruell, yet is it stoutly to be maintained against the vnsatiable and inuading enemie, and with might and maine to be folowed, to the beating downe and suppressing of such spitefull foes, as are euer ready prest and bent to disturbe a quiet and peaceable kingdome, &amp; being blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with auarice, doe right soone consent to lamentable slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and effusion of bloud: it is much more easier to defende a kingdome being already possessed, and to repell the aduersarie, than to inuade other regions, or conquere forraine countreis, for it is to be thought that the people will fight more couragiously, both for their prince, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, libertie, wiues and children, house and familie, than the proud inuading enemy, who fights to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his vainglorious minde, and vnsatiable appetite.

For when first the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> entered <hi>Italie,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make a whole conquest of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, without cause at that time offered by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the <hi>Romanes</hi> then seeing their Empire in danger, their whole state in perill, their wiues and children likely to be spoyled, the Citie defaced, and their countrey vtterly to be ruinated and destroyed: they then with manly courage, and specially by the good help of the wise and valiant <hi>Scipio,</hi> repelled them <hi>Italie,</hi> draue them home into <hi>Affrike,</hi> &amp; in the end to the very walles of their chiefest refuge, which was to the stately towne and citie of <hi>Carthage:</hi> &amp; there in the last battaile they were ouercome by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and forced to sue for fauour at the handes of them whom before they had inuaded.

For when the <hi>Persians</hi> vnder the conduct of king <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were driuen backe, and forced by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiages</hi> and the <hi>Medes</hi> to retire, being most eagerly chased by the fierce inuading foe, with cruell force and bloudy minds, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>Persian</hi> women rebuked the cowardlines of their flying men, in this sort; <hi>Nam matres &amp; vxores eorum obuiam occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, orant in prelium reuertantur, cunctantibus sublata veste, obscoena corporis ostendunt, rogantes num in vteros matrum vel vxorum velint refugere.</hi> The men by this sharpe reprehension of the women, went backe againe into the battaile, and put vnto shamefull flight those who before had caused them to retire. For then they bethought themselues whether they should flie if they lost their owne kingdome, thinking it very harde to liue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite vnder the rule and dominions of other, when as they could not enioy and quietly possesse their owne patrimony: and also when they looked backe toward their women, who came vpon them in such vndecent sort as hath before beene shewed, they were greatly ashamed considering their own cowardlines, who were faine to be stirred vp, and put in minde by their vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant women to defend their countrey and familie. Therefore the arte of warre is to be exercised, and the feates and actes of chiualry highly to be commended, not so much for the inuading of others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Valer. f.</hi> 345</note> as for the defending of their owne, and beating down of the prowde vaunting foe. This was an auncient order &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> to set open the Temple gates of <hi>Ianus</hi> in the time of warre, and in peace to close them vp again, for when they had thorowly seene the mutabilitie and vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of frowning battaile, and the casualties of cruell warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerwearied and tired with the calamities and miseries thereof, at last they erected and buylded a temple in their city, placing therein the image and picture of <hi>Ianus,</hi> which was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2148:61"/>
pictured with a bifronce or double forhead, looking plainely and sensibly both wayes, the temple dores and gates beeing closely bolted, locked and shut vp in time of peace &amp; tranquilitie; and in the time of warre (either forrein or ciuill) they commaunded to vnlocke and set ope the gates of the same temple: to this end &amp; purpose, that the people of the Citie, might thoroughly behold the double face and backward looke of <hi>Ianus,</hi> which signified and represented to the beholder, a foresight of future thinges finally to happen, aswell as for the prouision of the present state. Thus it was continually vsed in peace to be shut, and in warres to bée open, wherby both the Senators, Centurions, Captaines and other Officers and Gouernors of the people, were put in minde (in the time of warre) to haue a prouident foresight &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect care what might happen thereby, therein, or thereafter, as well as what séemed to stand good by their present knowledge.

earnestly maligned and inueied against him, both openly by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the Campe, and also by letters sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> on set purpose spitefully to worke him displeasure at home with the Senators. He folowed still his wise course and procéeding, in following the enemie from place to place, camping alwais him selfe as neere to <hi>Hanniball</hi> as conueniently he might, to waite on him at all assayes.

Thus by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident wisdome and carefull foresight he had gotten many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at <hi>Rome,</hi> and especially by the meanes of this young hotespur <hi>Minutius,</hi> insomuch that he departed from the camp, and went to the Citie to answere the ouer-light beleeuing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, who so hardly had conceiued of him. It so fortuned at that time when he was in <hi>Rome,</hi> that word was brought to the Senat from <hi>Minutius,</hi> who gouerued the armie in the absence of <hi>Fabius,</hi> that he by his valour and pollicie had geuen <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> a great ouerthrow: which indeede was partly true, for the wily <hi>Hanniball</hi> had gotten certain knowledge by his espials, how the case stoode betwixt <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Minutius,</hi> and also that <hi>Fabius</hi> was now in some displeasure at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the meanes of <hi>Minutius</hi> their young Captaine, wherfore he began to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise wholy to thrust <hi>Fabius</hi> (whom he feared) into vtter hatred and displeasure with the chiefe Senators and gouernours of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>By which meanes the <hi>Romanes</hi> (peraduenture) might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the whole armie to the gouernment of <hi>Minutius,</hi> and so
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2148:64"/>
displace <hi>Fabius,</hi> whose wisdome and policie alway made the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to feare and dread him. Wherefore the subtile <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> knowing that already the <hi>Romanes</hi> had conceiued a very good opinion, and good liking of their young couragious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, if now therefore he should geue in the absence of <hi>Fabius</hi> some small victorie to <hi>Minutius,</hi> that then the <hi>Romanes</hi> would be in further liking of him, insomuch that they would repose further trust in him: by which meanes he hoped soone to be the Lorde ouer all <hi>Italie.</hi> With these considerations <hi>Hanniball</hi> brought foorth his armie, for he knew full well that <hi>Minutius</hi> would presently fight, which fell out accordingly. <hi>Hanniball</hi> had in that fight slaine sixe thousand men, and so gaue grounde and retired into his Campe, before the fierce pursuing <hi>Minuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Notwithstanding, it was no great victorie to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> for they lost in the same fight fiue thousand. But <hi>Minutius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right ioyfull of this his good fortune, foorthwith sent vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting word thereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might perceiue, this hée had done in the absence of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and greater exploites hee would haue done, if he had not beene hindered heretofore by the slacknes of <hi>Fabius.</hi> By meanes of these his boasting letters the whole Citie was much comforted, notwithstanding <hi>Fabius</hi> (when all the Citie was merry and in common ioy) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther credite the newes, nor beleeue the letters. At the last he said; <hi>If all were true that was reported, hee rather greatly feared their prosperous and fortunate aduenture, than any way reioyced therein.

            </p>
            <p>For which words he was euen in the Senate house among them all openly rebuked by <hi>Marcus Metellus,</hi> who saide and affirmed, That he kept his Souldiers and men of warre in their Campes, more like Captiues and Prisoners, than men of warre. And especially it was not to be suffered, that hee himselfe (their chiefe gouernour and Generall) being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent amongst them, would not onely permitte and suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to be done valiantly against the enemies, but now also being absent, held against the thing that was well done by the master of his Horsmen.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:2148:65"/>
               <hi>Fabius</hi> at that time answered fewe wordes, for he thought they would be euill heard, but this he said; <hi>Whereas two yeares past the Citie had sustayned great harmes and losses, thorowe the foolish hardines of the desperate gouernors, that nowe hee doubted not but if he might beare rule, and haue his minde without controlment, he would make it euident and manifest to all men, that Fortune could little doe or worke against a good Captaine, but that Wisdome and Reason shoulde haue the dominion ouer all her chaunces.</hi> Yet for all that, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates determination at that time was, that <hi>Minutius,</hi> who had so nobly behaued himselfe, &amp; gouerned the army in his absence, should be halfe ruler of the hoast with him, and the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance thereof to be parted betwixt them both. This fell out right to the expectation of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> but a heauie and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hap to <hi>Fabius,</hi> who tenderly fauoured the welfare of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, and although he could very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue yeelded and resigned vp the whole armie, and his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie there withall to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who had offered him this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, yet notwithstanding, the duetifull care which he had ouer his countrey, and the present perill which hee sawe the whole armie to stand in, caused him to take and accept the half, hoping to preserue them at the least. But <hi>Minutius</hi> perceiuing himselfe to be had in such estimation at <hi>Rome,</hi> as well of the common people, as of the Senators themselues, wherefore he was not a little proude, he then began to take much more on him, prowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boasting and vaunting on himselfe, saying; <hi>That in their great heauines and calamitie, he alone was found out a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine able to match with couragious Hanniball.</hi> Now fell <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference about the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the armie committed to both their charges.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Minutius</hi> would haue it so parted, that he might beare rule one day or one weeke, and then <hi>Fabius</hi> to take place the like time accordingly. But this order liked not <hi>Fabius,</hi> for that he knew how the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele would fall out, which he might easilie coniecture by the vnequalitie which was betwixt wilfull <hi>Minutius</hi> &amp; wilie <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball,</hi> therefore <hi>Fabius</hi> would needes haue it deuided betwene them, saying; <hi>That if in case he could not by his counsell saue the whole hoast, yet he would assay to saue and preserue halfe

thereof as well as he might.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> being thoroughly certefied of these things, presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a double ioy; one was, for that he thought to vanquish the foolish hardines of <hi>Minutius,</hi> euen as he would himselfe; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, for that halfe the power and strength of <hi>Fabius</hi> was minished, by reason of parting the hoast. Wherefore he neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no time to intrap and insnare this ouer venterous Youth, who had béen fleshed before with a final victorie; knowing that he could no sooner offer, but <hi>Minutius</hi> wold he ready to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt. Whereupon, when he thought that <hi>Fabius</hi> had bin far inough from his fellow, so that he could not aide him on the sodaine, he trained foorth to battaile the rash and desperate youth, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him round about in places of great disaduantage to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> minding there to giue an vtter ouerthrowe to <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> (which indéed he had done, if present succour had not bin.) Now <hi>Minutius</hi> séeing himselfe in great danger, thinking it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that he should scape that present perill; also, séeing his men slaine on euery side, so that the field was vtterly lost on his part, had not this happie chance hapned, as followeth; <hi>Fabius</hi> was not so much displeased with the ouerthwart dealing of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> but that he carried a watchfull care to the welfare of his Countrey: for when he espied his fellow and the <hi>Romanes</hi> in such daunger and distresse, he said; <hi>Fortune hath caught their follieno sooner than I feared she would; now he that is ioyned with Fabius in the Empire, hath found Hannibal ouerhard for him both in power and also in fortune: but it is not now time</hi> (said hee) <hi>to chide, I will referre that till more opportunitie.</hi> Then presently caused hee his men to display his Banners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a hill (for neither his fellowes nor the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he had béen so néere them) comming sodainely to the aide of his despairing fellowe and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whereof some were fled, some slain, and other some flying to saue themselues,
<pb facs="tcp:2148:66"/>
in great distresse; so that they all thought hee came as it were a man sent from heauen to their succours: and before hee coulde ioyne battaile with the <hi>Carthaginians, Hannibal</hi> called backe his men from chasing anie further the enemie that fled, being so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid at the present approaching of <hi>Fabius.</hi> Insomuch that hee sodainly withdrew himselfe into his Campe, saying; <hi>That hee had ouercome Minutius, but that hee was also ouercome by Fabius.</hi> Then some of the dispersed <hi>Romanes</hi> ran to the campe of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and the rest that fled before went to <hi>Minutius,</hi> wher the remnant of the discomfited succors were. Thus when the wilfull <hi>Minutius</hi> had séene himselfe so deceiued by the flights of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> &amp; tried the frendly succor of his fellow (whome by all meanes he had sought to discredite,) he called the remainder of his hoast about him, saying; <hi>I oftentimes, louing souldiers and friends, haue heard say, that he is most wise that can giue good counsaile, and tell what is to be done in weightie causes; and that he is next wise, that can obay him that giueth good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile: but he that can neither giue good counsaile himself, nor hearken to the graue aduice of the wise, is of al other most foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; now therefore, seeing that the first of these giftes fortune hath denied vs, let vs keepe the second, and while we learne to rule, let vs also purpose with our selues to obay them that bee wise. Wherefore I pray you, let vs now (though too late) ioyn our tents with Fabius, &amp; when you heare me salute him as my father, salute you his soldiours likewise as your noble patrones, by whose strength and hardines this day ye are preserued.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently, they remooued to the Campe of <hi>Fabius,</hi> wherat hee meruailed not a little: now when their legions were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and salutations had, after long protestation made by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> to <hi>Fabius,</hi> they tooke either other by the hand, &amp; the soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of either dooing the like, <hi>Minutius</hi> submitted himselfe, and all the authoritie of the Empire (which was committed to him by the Senators) into the hands of <hi>Fabius,</hi> as a man far more worthie thereof, accounting it rather a burden to himselfe than honor: desiring <hi>Fabius</hi> that he might be in the office of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the horsmen, as before he was. When this was knowen at <hi>Rome,</hi> and affirmed to be true, not onely by the letters of the Captaines, but also by the reports of the soldiours of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2148:66"/>
the praise of <hi>Fabius</hi> was extolled to the verie heauens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting their hard opinion which they had conceiued against him before, confessing openly that they had greatly abused him, in reiecting and condemning his wise and approoued counsaile so foolishly, whose words they had found to be too true, wishing that they had been ruled by so graue and wise a counsailor, now submitting themselues as it were at his feete, requiring him to defend their Countrey by his approoued pollicie and wisedome in so perilous a time, and against so dangerous a foe as <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> was: but first they felt their owne follie, before they would giue anie credite or audience to the admonition of the wise. Not long after, <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> was chosen Consull, and was to fight against <hi>Hannibal:</hi> but before he departed the Senate, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> made an Oration vnto him, in the conclusion whereof, hee said thus to the new chosen Consull; <hi>Paulus, if thou doo anie thing, doo it soberly &amp; according to reason, not rashly trusting to fortune: followe not the occasion that thy enemie will giue thee, neither be too hastie; for hast is blinde, and worketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely.</hi> Notwithstanding, <hi>Aemilius</hi> at that time gaue little héed to the wise precepts of the graue <hi>Fabius,</hi> saying (for a fashion sake) <hi>Indeed they were more true, than easie to bee followed.</hi> At the last, this <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> was ouerthrown at the great fight of <hi>Cannas,</hi> where he lost all his power, and was himselfe sore wounded, whereof he soone died. But before he ended his life, <hi>C.

To whom <hi>Paulus</hi> made this answere; <hi>C.

Therfore I say, that may not be allowed to encourage the soldiors, which the world may laugh to scorne: the soldior doth get more glorie to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and greater praise to himselfe through his victorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, than by his ridiculous and superfluous brauerie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my iudgement it were farre more necessarie, that what cost and charge were bestowed in time of warre, should only be to the preseruation of both Common welth and souldior, which cannot be so well defended with vaine toyes, as with good and warlike furniture. What was the cause that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, with so small a number of men, subdued and conquered such a great part of the world? Was it through the youthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Captaines and brauerie of his souldiors? No true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it came to passe by their braue mindes and ablenesse of bodie, who had hardned themselues to the warre of purpose; and not through their nice brauerie in apparell. For when <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> first set foorth to such a mightie enterprize, his Armie was but 32000. footmen,<note place="margin">

The cause why is easely coniectured: for that <hi>Alexander</hi> alway had this prouident care and foresight in placing officers in his Armie; insomuch that he by no meanes would admit or suffer anie one, to beare rule as a Captaine or Leader in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, vnlesse hee were well knowen to be a man of great graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wisedome, pollicie, and good gouernement: prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that he should be a man of the age of 60. yeares, to the intent hee might haue all these aforesaide qualities the better:

But now it may be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning the hardines of young Captaines, saying; <hi>Haue we not knowen or heard of such lustie young Gentlemen, or youthfull Captaines, who by their valiant prowes, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious mindes, haue brauely and desperatly set vpon such a strong Castle, Towne, or Fort, and being as eager on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie as a hauke on her pray, haue atchieued most wonderful &amp; notable exploites by their lustie braue courages. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, say ye, what are young Captaines to be disalowed, &amp; not worthie to beare charge?</hi> Whereunto I answere, that although some braue Gentleman, or youthfull Captaine, haue by his des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate boldnes, or ouer hardie valour obteined or atchieued some notable victorie or great exploite, to the great glory and fame both of his Countrey and himselfe, yet for all that, it is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no consequent, that victorie followeth desperate boldnes, nor conquest rash hardines. For although that Fortune at some one time doeth fauour rash atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts, yet presume not ouer much on her, for she is mutable and vnstedfast, least that subtile <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> may insnare wilfull <hi>Minutius: Achilles</hi> desperat <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi>

                  <hi>Liu li</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; Val. li.</hi> 3</note> that then he mistrusted and feared her mutabilitie most of all. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when he triumphed in the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> for certain noble actions by him most happely atchieued, seeing the people so woonderfully praise and extoll his name, clapping of their hands, flinging vp their caps, and honouring him in such maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall sort, seeing Fortune so sweetly smile and fauour him, after such an extraordinarie manner, he turned to the people, and said with a lamentable voice, <hi>I greatly seare me least that Fortune doeth meane highly to displease and disquiet mee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this her vnaccustomed flatterie.</hi> Which indéede fell out accordingly. For the same time returning to his owne house, in this most sumptuous manner, he found his sweete sonnes sodainly dead. The wise and learned <hi>Cicero,</hi> thorowly percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the vncertaintie and mutable estate of vnfriendly fortune, seeing likewise by his prouident wisdome, how much more prudent counsell and wise gouernment auayleth, than force and strength of the body, was not ashamed boldly to pronounce and declare in his owne behalfe, saying; <hi>Plus ego togatus, quàm ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati decem.

Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented many miseries, which otherwise might haue hapned to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sorow &amp; heauines. I would not it should be thought I altogether disalow yong captains, condenming them al with vnaduised iudgement (as the Emperor of <hi>Greece</hi> did the young ambassadors of <hi>Athens</hi>) to be either rash, wilful, or foolish hardy, or voyd of any good gouernment: for then should I speak fondly
<pb facs="tcp:2148:73"/>

Thus being in such perplexitie, lamenting sore their distressed state, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the present subuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their Citie, then in this their great extremitie, yong <hi>P.

But the distressed <hi>Romanes</hi> seeing the tender yeares of the young Gentleman, were doubtfull to committe such a waighty cause into his hande, some of them speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his yeares, as a man not alowable in such extremitie: and againe some for that his father and uncle were both slaine in the same warre, wherefore, said they, it is greatly to be feared, considering his youthfull yeares, and also the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, least that he should be ouer rash in seeking speedy reuenge, to his owne perill, and their losse. Notwithstanding, the graue Senators wisely considering on the cause, seeing the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the young man, and his wittie Oration vttered there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, at the same time, committed their whole state in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hande, who gouerned it with such wise policie, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full foresight, that he did not onely match the worthy <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but also draue him out of <hi>Italie</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaine,</hi> who before had viewed the <hi>Roman</hi> walles, minding foorthwith to haue taken their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, forcing him also to flie into his countrey of <hi>Affrica,</hi> and at the last home to the very walles of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he vtterly vanquished him, seising on the whole Empire of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to the vse of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Thus when the graue and valiant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were some slaine, some put to flight, and other some not

daring to incounter with such a victorious Captaine as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> was, the yong <hi>Scipio</hi> by his manly valour, wise policie and circumspect leading of his army, both fréeed his Countrie from such a perillous enemie, and also made the stately Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Carthage</hi> subiect to the Romanes, to the great glorie and renowne of his Countrie, and to the euerlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his name. In like sorte, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, the most famous Captaine and leader that euer liued, was but twentie yeares olde when he ouerthrewe most mightie Kings and strong Princes, with a very small number; therefore wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and pollicie consisteth not in gray haires, nor victorie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dependeth in olde age, notwithstanding youth ought to haue a speciall care to ground all their actions vpon tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with an open eare to sage aduise and wise counsaile, and then, no doubt, victorie will not altogether consist and depend on fickle fortune.

cause of mistrust with the Romans, that also the Senat might easily thinke there were some conspiracie or confederacie betwixt him &amp; <hi>Hanniball,</hi> he vsed this craftie practise, sending out a great number of soldiors to spoile &amp; rob the Countrey of <hi>Italie</hi> in diuers places, straitly commaunding them, that they should spare and not once touch the goods, cattells and landes which were knowne to be the possessions of <hi>Fabius,</hi> but spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and wasting round about them, they should leaue them whole vnminished, to the end, that the Romans should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue such displeasure against him, as that they might in no case per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or suffer him to deale in their affaires, which thing woulde beene most pleasant to <hi>Hanniball.</hi> And surely, this subtile practise, sounded much to the discredite of <hi>Fabius</hi>; and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken further effect, if he by his wise policy had not somwhat qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified their hard conceit by this means, presently thereupon he sent his sonne into the country to sell &amp; make away those lands and goods which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had spared, for litle or nothing, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pising to possesse any thing which <hi>Hannibal</hi> preserued; which deed made the Romans somwhat better to think of him. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, though <hi>Hanniball</hi> was the wisest captain that in those dayes liued, mocking and deceiuing the Romans at his pleasure, yet in the ende, hee himselfe was kindely flouted by a Roman Captain, suspecting no stratagem or policy at all to be practised, insomuch, that on a time when he had long besieged the great city <hi>Cassilinum,</hi> &amp; could by no means take the Town, he assayed to famish them &amp; make the city perforce yeeld to his mercy, not suffering any necessaries to be brought them. <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> then captaine of a band of Romans which lay thereabout, waiting if <hi>Hanniball</hi> would remooue his siege, seeing what great extremitie they suffered, receiuing letters daylie from them, which signified in what lamentable case they stoode and what mortalitie was in the city, for want of sustenance, so that they were faine to eate their boots and other straps and thongs of leather, being much moued with these great miseries, &amp; also seeing the Citizens to stand on the walls, to the end, that some dart, shot, or other weapon might abridge and shorten their griefe; yet for all this hee might not fight with <hi>Hanniball,</hi> although hee surelie thought hee might wyth ease haue rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2148:75"/>
the Towne, for that hee was commaunded to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the Dictatour, nowe seeing the Citie in such distresse, and that he might not fight for their succours, he gathered cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine corne, and put it into barrels and hogsheads, sending pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie word to the towne, that the next night he would sende them downe the riuer with the tide, willing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ready to receiue the barrels as they came, for the riuer came close to their citie. Thus at diuers times he beguiled <hi>Hanniball,</hi> vntill at last the craft was bewrayed, and then againe the citie disappointed of vittaile. Which when the cownesmen perceiued, they then had no other shift, but secretely to steale out of the towne, and get grasse and rootes such as they could finde, and bring it in for their reliefe. Which <hi>Hanniball</hi> had soone espied, therefore hee caused the ground thereabout to be plowed vp, to preuent them of that hope also. Then the Citizens séeing there was no way to hold the towne, and saue their liues from the fury of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, sent word to <hi>Gracchus,</hi> that they perforce must yeelde the citie to <hi>Hanniball.</hi> Whereat <hi>Gracchus</hi> seeing their great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, requested them to haue patience yet for two or three dayes, also shewing them, that it in case they would follow his his aduice and counsell, he doubted not but shortly to free their citie, and set them at libertie, willing them to take parsnipseede and sowe it on the plowed ground without the Citie, defending themselues manfully for that time if need should be. They all being willing to try what effect this could worke, sowed a great quantitie of parsnipseede on the ground which was plowed vp about the citie. Of which thing when <hi>Hanniball</hi> was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, hee foorthwith remoued his siege, and departed from the towne, saying; <hi>What, shall I stay here vntill these seedes bee rootes, that will I not for ten such Cities as Cassilinum is.</hi> Thinking that they had sufficient in the towne to relieue them in the meane time, or els they would neuer haue beene so fonde to sowe their seede. Thus was subtile <hi>Hanniball</hi> drylie flouted himself, who in se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blable sort had often beguyled others: for the citie could not haue indured the siege foure dayes longer at the vttermost. Yong <hi>Pub.

<pb facs="tcp:2148:76"/>
to bring <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> into mistrust with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> now in the end plagued him with such like practise. For when the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were driuen out of <hi>Italie,</hi> and lost their owne Empire of <hi>Affrica,</hi> and <hi>Hanniball</hi> their chiefe captaine forced to flie to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who then had prepared a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to warre on the <hi>Romanes.</hi> At the same time this young <hi>Scipio</hi> was sent by the Senate to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to know why hee prepared himselfe to warre on the <hi>Romanes,</hi> his friends, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there arriued, he perceiued that it was much by the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pricking on of <hi>Hanniball</hi> their auncient enemie, who already had gotten full graunt to leade and conduct halfe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Antiochus</hi> against the <hi>Romanes,</hi> both for his great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and policie and also for his approued experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as well in the countrey of <hi>Italie,</hi> as of the <hi>Romanes</hi> themselues. Which thing yong <hi>Scipio</hi> diligently noted, fearing least the <hi>Romanes</hi> should be againe troubled with such a cunning warrior and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued Captaine as <hi>Hanniball</hi> was. To preuent which cause he practised this meane: He would often frequent the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> falling into friendly conference about the battailes fought betwixt them before in <hi>Italie,</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> feeding and pleasing the humor of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> least that hee might leese his companie, and so faile of his purpose: for his meaning was, by priuie speech and communication with him, to bring <hi>Antiochus</hi> in mistrust of him, to the ende he should not committe his power into his hand. Thus dayly <hi>Scipio</hi> vsed the companie of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> comming priuely to his lodging, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly talking and conferring with him, making as though <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> or his companie should not once suspect him, wherfore he would most commonly come in the night, yet he woulde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chuse and picke out such a time, that he would be seene by some of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his friendes, to the ende the cause might the more be suspected, and also if in the day <hi>Hanniball</hi> and hee had beene in any conference of causes, so soone as he had espied ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antiochus</hi> himselfe, or any other of his friendes, then hee foorthwith would holde his peace, &amp; sodainly depart, as though he woulde not haue them to heare what conference they had: which indeede was nothing but what they might haue heard ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well without offence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:2148:76"/>This inuention of last fell out accordingly, and happy for the <hi>Romanes,</hi> for <hi>Antiochus</hi> grewe greatly to suspect their priuie meetings, and secrete whisperinges, fearing least there were some compounded trecheries agreed vpon betwixt them. And further, for that <hi>Scipio</hi> had alwaies so praysed the wisdome, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and circumspect carefulnes of <hi>Hanniball</hi> openly, to be both the wisest captaine, carefullest Leader, and valiantest man that then liued, saying; <hi>Happie were the Souldiers that marched vnder his conduct.</hi> Which thing <hi>Antiochus</hi> liked not well of, thinking that <hi>Scipio</hi> did it for this purpose, that he should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit his armie into the handes of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and then to be betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as their secrete meetings argued. Wherfore he would not that <hi>Hannibal</hi> should bear any charge of his, being so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant with his enemie, saying he was glad he had so found out their practise, before it took effect, and that yet it rested in him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent their inuention.

of their Countrey. Nowe in this great extremitie, yong <hi>P.C.

<pb facs="tcp:2148:85"/>
had not sufficient to defend their owne Countrey, wherefore they were forced to compremit the matter to Ladie Fortune, whom although, for a time she had swéetely smiled on, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing at the last she shewed her selfe no equall or indifferent Iudge, but partially tooke part with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to the quite ouerthrowing and subduing of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> before the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the great and mightie battaile which was at that time fought betwéene them for the Empire of the World. Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> defended both his owne Countrey and Empire, inlarging it with the Empire of the gréedie Enemie, and also caused the Senators of <hi>Carthage</hi> to sue both to him, and to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> humbly on their knées crauing for their liues, and to haue mercie at the hands of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whome before they would take no peace withall: falling now prostrate at the féete of <hi>Scipio,</hi> embracing and kissing the ground whereon hee stood,<note place="margin">

Also it is to be noted, that after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, <hi>Scipio</hi> demanded a certaine summe of money to bee gathered amongst them, and presently paid vnto him: which money was so gréeuous to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> because theyr

stocke and common substance was before greatly wasted: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the leuying of the said summe of their priuate substance, great lamentation and wéeping was made in all partes of the troubled Citie; which <hi>Hannibal</hi> beholding, could not forbeare to laugh.

Neuertheles, this my laughter is not so inordinate, nor commeth so out of time, as your teares doo: for first you shuld haue wept, when your armour was taken from you, and your ships burned before your eyes, and when your libertie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre with anie stranger (but onely by the license of the Romanes) was taken from you, wherein rested your chiefest fall and vndoing.

First to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute this foolish error; It is most certainely knowne, that there was no such king in <hi>Syria,</hi> who was called by the name of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> for that no ancient Authour of the <hi>Syrians</hi> make mention of any such name, neither of his daughters, which as the English Chronicles at this day affirme, were put into a small vessell or boat by their father <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and committed to Sea without either pilote or guide, chauncing to land in this Ile, naming it after one of their names, who was called <hi>Albion,</hi> as the fond saying goeth; and then forsooth, this Ile being inhabited with deuills, at their first arriuing, the sisters were carnallie knowne by the deuills themselues, and thereof did spring mightie and huge Giants which afterwardes were slaine by <hi>Brutus,</hi> who descended from the gods, as they also affirme. Which vaine opinion in like sort, is both ridiculous and foolish, for that neyther the Commentaries of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> the works of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> nor the Histories of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> who did write of this noble Ile, made anie mention at all of any such <hi>Brutus,</hi> being descended from the <hi>Troyans,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo the Romans themselues, nor the <hi>Greekes</hi> write of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one called <hi>Brutus,</hi> before <hi>Iulius Brutus,</hi> who did expell <hi>Tarquinius</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was long since the time of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius Posthumus.</hi> It is also to be considered, that if <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> who made a conquest of this Ile a thousand and fiue hundred yeares since, had then knowne, that the people thereof had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from the <hi>Troyans,</hi> as both himselfe and all the other Romans did, no doubt, he would not haue made warre against this land, but rather haue sought to ayd and succour it. But the
<pb facs="tcp:2148:95"/>
vanity of the English nation is such to deriue their genealogie from the <hi>Troians,</hi> for that (as I haue saide before) they sprang and descended from the gods, or els to fetch their original from <hi>Albion,</hi> who brought forth huge giants by the helpe of diuells, so that they must, there is no remedy, either descend from the gods, or else from the diuells themselues: this follie first sprang vp amongst the Romans, who chalenged their pedegrée from the <hi>Troians,</hi> which, as they say, descended from the gods; and in like sorte the Englishemen, to the intent they would spring from the gods as well as the Romans, faine that <hi>Brutus</hi> sonne to <hi>Posthumus</hi> one of the <hi>Troian</hi> stocke arriued in this Ile, and named it after his owne name <hi>Brytannia:</hi> which truely, in mine opinion, can not bee true, for that his name was <hi>Brutus,</hi> which, if you marke it, is altogether vnlike vnto <hi>Britannia:</hi> and to mend the matter also, they affirme, that first they sprang of deuills, a goodly commendation to this noble Ile. But for that the proude Romans thorow their vaunting vanity, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue themselues from the gods, which they right well knewe were but earthly kinges, for that the heathen kinges in those dayes were called gods: notwithstanding, since the corruption of the time, both the Romans and the Englishmen thinke that they are linially descended from the gods themselues, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Romans would not be so proude and stately, as at this day they are wellknowne to be, nor the Englishmen so vaine to challenge their pedegrée, or recount their genealogie from the most wicked <hi>Troians,</hi> vnlesse they were fully perswaded, that the <hi>Troians</hi> came from the immortal gods; which foolish opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on first sprang from the Romans by ouermuch esteming their progenitors. Which fond and vaine errours to confute, diuers learned men are of this opinion, by studious seeking out of the workes of ancient historiographers, that the <hi>Greekes</hi> when first their Cities became populous, waxing rich and puissant, after they knewe the cunning Art of Sailing, first of al other people found out this Ile naming it <hi>Olbion,</hi> which in Greeke is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, for the abundance of all thinges necessarie that they founde there, therefore no doubt but that in so long a time as hath bene since <hi>Olbion,</hi> by the corruption of the continuaunce might well he called <hi>Albion:</hi> or else they at that time finding this land by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2148:95"/>
the white rockes and cleeues, with which the Ile was inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned withall, named it <hi>Albion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ab albis rupibus,</hi> and also <hi>Britania</hi> of <hi>Britaniae,</hi> which are the Iles that lie in the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and not <hi>Britania</hi> of <hi>Brutus,</hi> the supposed <hi>Troyan.</hi> And so this noble Ile may be knowen to spring and descend from the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Greekes,</hi> who suppressed the periured <hi>Troyans,</hi> and beate downe their prowd towne, which they by vnfaithfulnes had buylded; and not to come from that wicked race, who alwayes were the chiefe cause of their owne destruction, and procurers of their fatall destinie by their periurie, vnfaithfull dealing, churlish conditions, and vnsatiable lecherie, as the whole world at this day doth witnes against them, to the euerlasting reproach of their line and Successors.</p>

                  <l>The sliding flouds that smoothly passe had husht me soone asleepe.</l>
                  <l>And as I slept on greenish shore, by help of warbling streames</l>
                  <l>Strange fearefull fancies frighted me, by dreadfull drowsie dreames.</l>
                  <l>In slumber sound me thought I spied a wight both fierce and fell:</l>
                  <l>A thing despisde, in viler sort no creature was in hell.</l>
                  <l>A woman vext with eager lookes in frantike fierie moode.</l>
                  <l>With clapping hands and rowling eyes vncertainly she stoode.</l>
                  <l>She ran about with flaring haire, much like to horses stout,</l>
                  <l>When sodain fright had pierst their minds, with strouting tayles did strout.</l>
                  <l>Euen so or worse she roude about with head and shoulders bare:</l>
                  <l>And oftentimes from senselesse pate her pendant lockes she tare</l>
                  <l>With bloudie nayles and hands imbrued, her palmes she oft did smite:</l>
                  <l>And reaching for the heauens, as though she to the Gods had spite.</l>
                  <l>With irefull cries and fearefull notes the hollow groue did sound:</l>
                  <l>In yelling sort from gulled bankes the ditties did rebound.</l>
                  <l>Like mightie bulles that fiercely meetes, and filles with noise the skies.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:96"/>And for a token of their wrath the dustie grauell flies,</l>
                  <l>By tearing vp of earth, so she in such like frantike fits</l>
                  <l>Doeth snatch vp grasse in griping hands, as one beside her wits.</l>
                  <l>Still stalking on, vntill at last she found me where I were:</l>
                  <l>Thus fancie fed my dreadfull dreame with grieuous gripes of feare.</l>
                  <l>But when that she approached neere, and stood me by, at length</l>
                  <l>Me thought my trembling ioynts did quake, to flie I had no strength.</l>
                  <l>With starting steps I sought to flie, to shun that fearfull sight:</l>
                  <l>But all in vaine I oft assayed to saue my selfe by flight.</l>
                  <l>My fainting feet did often faile by striuing still to start:</l>
                  <l>No forced pace would ought preuaile, or suffer to depart.</l>
                  <l>Thus stil me thought amid my dreame (as one that were in maze)</l>
                  <l>With quaking corps and haire vpright full still I stoode at gaze.</l>
                  <l>For feare my faltring tongue did stay, I durst her not behold,</l>
                  <l>Vntill at last with friendly cheare she said, my friend be bold.</l>
                  <l>I wish to thee no harme at all, wherfore be not dismayde:</l>
                  <l>But call to minde thy frighted sence, and be thou not afraide.</l>
                  <l>Ne maruell why though I disguisde, haue furiously been vext:</l>
                  <l>In raging sort so strange to thee for that I am perplext</l>
                  <l>In minde and soule, to thinke how far fell Fortune hath abusde</l>
                  <l>Both me and mine in spitefull sort, when hautie Gods refusde</l>
                  <l>To succour vs in greatest need, she turnde her face and fround,</l>
                  <l>Who long had smiled, but now gaue help to croude vs to the ground.</l>
                  <l>Wherfore good friend, quoth she, geue eare and marke what I shall tell.</l>
                  <l>Lift vp thy minde, be not dismayd, and note my speeches well:</l>
                  <l>For I must needes declare the cause to ease my pensiue brest</l>
                  <l>Of haplesse hap that Fate assignde, and then in hope to rest.</l>
                  <l>With that me thought I banisht feare, and quaking limmes reuiude.</l>
                  <l>I courage tooke againe afresh, of which I was depriude.</l>
                  <l>Then boldly thus I said at last, what madnes doeth possesse</l>
                  <l>Thy vexed soule? Be sure if that thy paine I may redresse,</l>
                  <l>To finde some ease of this thy griefe or els I were vnkind:</l>
                  <l>Therefore be short, to ease thy smart, and let me know thy mind.</l>
                  <l>It pities me to see the plight of thy distressed state,</l>
                  <l>And makes me shrinke at all to gesse on this thy heauy fate:</l>
                  <l>For that no fiend that comes from hell could any more lament</l>
                  <l>Their peruerse lot for wickednes and sinnes already spent,</l>
                  <l>Than thou hast here before my face with bounsing blowes and cries,</l>
                  <l>Whereat the caues reuerberate, and Echo roles in skies.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:97"/>But now dispatch, shew me thy mind, if so to ease thy griefe</l>
                  <l>Thou thinke it best: I am content that way to geue reliefe.</l>
                  <l>Then she began to shew her minde, and tell her griefe forepast</l>
                  <l>With grieuous grones in wofull wise, these words she spake at last.</l>
                  <l>If euer any wofull wight had cause to rue her fate,</l>
                  <l>And pleade with teares her heauie hap for change of her estate:</l>
                  <l>My selfe haue iust cause to bewayle my state which I thought sure.</l>
                  <l>But woe is me vnhappy wretch, what ioy doeth aye endure?</l>
                  <l>On Fortune fell I doe complaine, the cause of my mishap,</l>
                  <l>That thus hath dealt with me alas, when first within her lap</l>
                  <l>She lulld full sweet, and vsde right well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then ere that I wist</l>
                  <l>Did tumble downe from top of throne, thus Iudas like she kist.</l>
                  <l>She lifted me so high aboue my mates and fellowes all,</l>
                  <l>For that more grieuous when I fell she meant to make my fall.</l>
                  <l>But would from beggars broode at first my chance had beene so good</l>
                  <l>To spring, and that I had beene borne and bred of meanest blood,</l>
                  <l>Then would the world not so haue musde to see my sodaine chance</l>
                  <l>To fall so low, whom Fortune earst so highly did aduance.</l>
                  <l>Yet geue me leaue to ease my minde although I wish in vaine:</l>
                  <l>For now tis past by wishing I doe ease my pining paine.</l>
                  <l>The trueth is thus, I did descend from Cysseus that king</l>
                  <l>A mightie Prince of Thrace wel knowen, whose praise each where did ring.</l>
                  <l>And from his house I higher stept to highest place of state:</l>
                  <l>For Pryamus the king of Troy did take me for his mate.</l>
                  <l>Who was the stately Emperour of Asia, and there</l>
                  <l>Amongst the hautie Phrygians the diademe did weare.</l>
                  <l>Then Queene was I of flaunting Troy. The Troyans all reioyce</l>
                  <l>That Priamus their Lord and king had made of me his choice.</l>
                  <l>There many noble sonnes had I, the world doeth witnes beare:</l>
                  <l>No Nation vnder heauen that day with me durst once compare</l>
                  <l>In valure with so many sonnes by one brought foorth to sight:</l>
                  <l>Each people on the earth as yet will yeeld to them their right;</l>
                  <l>That for so many bretheren, as I brought foorth (poore Queene)</l>
                  <l>I say againe that neuer since by any hath beene seene.</l>
                  <l>And that I meane to prophesie, wherefore I dare be bold</l>
                  <l>To say the like will neuer be while heauen and earth dooth hold.</l>
                  <l>But for because I would not wish thou shouldst my name mistake:</l>
                  <l>Whom Greekes and Romanes long agoe in dolefull verse did make</l>
                  <l>The world to know, and now my selfe shall verefie the same:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:97"/>Who called me olde Hecuba, so truely was my name,</l>
                  <l>A wretched wight too olde indeede, for that I liude so long,</l>
                  <l>To scape the fire that burned Troy, to suffer further wrong:</l>
                  <l>O would to God I then had died, when Pryamus my mate</l>
                  <l>By Pyrrhus sword receiude the wound, but now I wish too late,</l>
                  <l>Fell destinie denide me that and sparde me for the nonce,</l>
                  <l>To plague me with a thousand woes, ten thousand all at once.</l>
                  <l>But first to tell my fatall hap, and orderly proceede</l>
                  <l>To shew, howe that the angry gods against me had decreede</l>

                  <l>As after thou shalt knowe: but first I wish to ease my minde,</l>
                  <l>In shewing how that destinie and haplesse fate assignde</l>
                  <l>To me poore wretch such mischiefe vile, as none did euer taste</l>
                  <l>Before nor since, though long agoe my miseries were past:</l>
                  <l>For first within my body I, to my great paine, did beare</l>
                  <l>And nourish vp the fruit which was the cause of all my care,</l>
                  <l>With childe I was, but then vnknowne what fruit I foorth should bring</l>
                  <l>To ioy my selfe, or else to please olde Pryam Troyan king</l>
                  <l>My louing mate, who vsde me well, wherefore I wisht to please</l>
                  <l>His quiet minde, by my good will, that we might liue at ease:</l>
                  <l>But see how froward fortune frownd, a dreame did me molest,</l>
                  <l>And fearefull fright did trouble me when I was layd to rest,</l>
                  <l>Me thought I was deliuered of such a fearefull sight,</l>
                  <l>For all was fire which I brought forth, and flamde as fire bright,</l>
                  <l>With furie great the fire waxt, with flames the aire did streame:</l>
                  <l>Thus doubtfull dumpe, by fright did pierse my breast in dreadfull dreame.</l>
                  <l>When that I wakde I tolde the king, how Morpheus had delt</l>
                  <l>With me in sleepe, and further how what agonie I felt,</l>
                  <l>Who presently to oracle would haue no nay, but sent</l>
                  <l>To know what by this fierie flame and dreadfull dreame was ment,</l>
                  <l>The dreame resolude, the Oracle, for answere did returne,</l>
                  <l>That I a sonne should beare, and he should cause strong Troy to burne</l>
                  <l>With fire bright, and for his cause olde Pryamus his sire,</l>
                  <l>And I his mother should behold our towne to burne with fire,</l>

                  <l>A mightie foe for his abuse should sharpe reuengement take.</l>
                  <l>Which to preuent the father sought, to slay his harmelesse boy,</l>
                  <l>For that he thought some mischiefe might by his meanes hap to Troy,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:98"/>And for because the Oracle on him vnborne, did giue</l>
                  <l>Such sentence which did fright his sire, wherefore he might not liue,</l>
                  <l>That when his sonne was borne, foorthwith the father did betake</l>
                  <l>The childe vnto a trusty friend, that he away might make</l>
                  <l>The boy which well I loude, but yet such pity did remaine</l>
                  <l>Within my breast, that I reserude my sonne which should be slaine,</l>
                  <l>And closly spake vnto the man, that he my childe shoulde spare,</l>
                  <l>And tell the king, at his returne, that cruell beasts did teare</l>
                  <l>The tender limmes of his yong sonn: wherefore he now was free</l>
                  <l>From such suspect as erst before the Oracle did see.</l>
                  <l>The aged King was then content, and thought all things were well,</l>
                  <l>He feared not the prophesie which these things first did tell:</l>
                  <l>Thus did I breede and foster vp euen him that did destroy</l>
                  <l>Both parents, friends and countrey kinde, and sought our great annoy,</l>
                  <l>The lad did liue with heard in field, and shortly vp was growen,</l>
                  <l>So that he for King Pryams sonne by secret signes was knowen,</l>
                  <l>Then was the youth callde home againe, and Pryam was content</l>
                  <l>To take him for his sonne, and did his former acte repent.</l>
                  <l>But when sir Paris came to Court, for so we callde his name,</l>
                  <l>The doting boy began to loue and follow Venus game,</l>
                  <l>Enquiring oft when fame would bring newes of a peerelesse peece</l>
                  <l>And passing dame, which that ere long had tidings thus from Greece,</l>
                  <l>That there the flower of all the world six Menelaus helde,</l>
                  <l>The like to her on all the earth no Nation then could yelde:</l>
                  <l>For whom vnknowne my sonne did dote, in such exceeding sort,</l>
                  <l>That he to Greece by sea would passe, to see if that report</l>
                  <l>Had blazde a truth: but first before to Grecian soile he went,</l>
                  <l>He craude of me and Priamus, to yeelde him our consent:</l>
                  <l>Then shippes were built on seas to saile, king Pryam willd it so,</l>
                  <l>And mates for him were picked out, and hence to Greece they go,</l>
                  <l>At Lacedemon he at length, a place of Greece so calld</l>
                  <l>Ariude, and in their safest rodes, his wearie shippes in halld</l>
                  <l>By Menelaus his consent, who foorthwith did inuite</l>
                  <l>The Troyans all vnto his court, suspecting no such spite</l>
                  <l>As after did betide, for that sir Paris did conuay</l>
                  <l>Faire Helen thence, his louing wife, and so without delay</l>

                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:98"/>To see how Paris plaid his prankes, when Menelaus had</l>
                  <l>Receiued his guest in frankest sort, and did him friendly vse,</l>
                  <l>Whose courtesie to recompence, the letcher did abuse</l>
                  <l>His honest host by spitefull rape, in stealing of his wife,</l>
                  <l>Which hatefull cause did soone procure sharpe warre and deadly strife:</l>
                  <l>Yet first the Greekes, I must confesse, like honest minded men</l>
                  <l>Did send to Troy, to haue againe faire Helena which then</l>
                  <l>Was brought to Troy, and their demaund, to end the bloody iaerre,</l>
                  <l>Which likely were to followe fast, and turne to deadly warre.</l>
                  <l>But Priam he, with his fierce sonnes their lawfull sute denide,</l>
                  <l>For which the Greekes, to take reuenge to Pryams Kingdomes hied:</l>
                  <l>From Greece they saile to Phrygia land, which haughty Pryam held,</l>
                  <l>And there arriude in dreadfull sort well armed with speare and sheld:</l>
                  <l>The warre began great slaughter was, for mightie Mars did raigne:</l>
                  <l>Full fierce they fought for ten yeares space, yet neither party gaine,</l>
                  <l>Such losse there was on either side in lamentable sort,</l>
                  <l>That Phrygia soile did flowe with blood, the world can giue report.</l>
                  <l>When Phrygia thus was ouer-run by Grecians ouer stout,</l>
                  <l>Vnto the Troyan walls they marchde and compast it about,</l>
                  <l>Where Pryam held his stately court, not passing of their spight,</l>
                  <l>Nor fearing future hap at all, but still maintained fight,</l>
                  <l>Where from the top of stately walls we dayly might beholde</l>
                  <l>Right neere our sight the slaughters great of Troyan youth full bolde,</l>
                  <l>And Greekes likewise on euery side the Troyans fierce did daunt,</l>

                  <l>Nor brag, for that their mighty peeres in bloodie broile were slaine,</l>
                  <l>Wherefore to end the warre begun to sue did not disdaine</l>
                  <l>To haue faire Helen backe againe, for whom this warre begunne,</l>
                  <l>And eke to boote they offer made yong Polidore my sonne,</l>
                  <l>Whom Polymnestor King of Thrace had to the Greeks betrayde,</l>
                  <l>When Pryam first had placed him there, in hope of better ayde:</l>
                  <l>For when we knew the Greekes did minde to make sharpe warre with Troy,</l>
                  <l>To Polymnestor King of Thrace, we sent our yongest boy,</l>
                  <l>A mighty masse, and treasure great with this our sonne we sent,</l>
                  <l>In hope to keepe him free from warre, and from the Greekes intent:</l>
                  <l>But then the Thracian King betrayde (O vile disloyall wretch)</l>
                  <l>The harmelesse lad vnto the Greekes, this was the traitours fetch,</l>
                  <l>To holde the coyne which then he had, and so to yeelde the childe</l>
                  <l>Vnto the Greekes for lucres sake, lo thus we were beguilde,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:99"/>Which boy the Grecians brought to Troy, and made request againe,</l>
                  <l>That Helen Menelaus wife in Troy might not remaine</l>
                  <l>But be restorde, then Polidore from their hands should be free,</l>
                  <l>And we our sonne might haue againe, and warre should ended bee:</l>
                  <l>But if in case that we denied, and Helen did detaine,</l>
                  <l>Then Polidore for brothers fault should presently be slaine.</l>
                  <l>Olde Pryamus would not consent that Helen backe should goe,</l>
                  <l>But helde perforce the wanton wench in spite of proudest foe,</l>
                  <l>And willd them for to doo their worst, for Helen meant to bide,</l>
                  <l>Wherefore he would not yeeld her vp what euer might be tide.</l>
                  <l>It well was knowne vnto the Greekes, that Pryam bade her chuse</l>
                  <l>To stay in Troy, or goe to Greece, which she did flat refuse,</l>
                  <l>And forbecause she willing was with Paris to be still,</l>
                  <l>He would by no meanes send her backe against her owne good will.</l>
                  <l>Then sent he word to Grecian campe, if that they had decreed</l>
                  <l>His sonne should die, his other sonnes should make them rue the deede,</l>
                  <l>And that the fieldes of Troy should flowe with gorie blood full fast,</l>
                  <l>Vntill the Grecians did repent their enterprised hast.</l>
                  <l>But now alas began my woe, my sorrowe did increase,</l>
                  <l>For neuer day from this time foorth mine eies from teares did cease,</l>

                  <l>From Troyan walles I did behold how fast the Grecians run</l>
                  <l>To doe thee wrong, my harmelesse childe, and mightie stones did bring</l>
                  <l>Thicke thronging fast with furie great, at Polidore they sling,</l>
                  <l>Who sure was tyed at fastned stake, which I from Troyan wall</l>
                  <l>Might well beholde how bouncing blowes did make my childe to sprall,</l>
                  <l>Not ceasing till my sonne were slaine, nor then, but still did smight</l>
                  <l>The brused bones of my sweet boy within his mothers sight:</l>
                  <l>O hellish plague, O torture vile, me thinke I see it still,</l>
                  <l>How Grecians raging mad did strike, the harmelesse soule to kill,</l>
                  <l>With wringing hands I looked on, yet loath to see him die,</l>
                  <l>I turnd my backe, and strait againe I coulde not chuse but prie</l>
                  <l>For this my sonne, who bleeding lay so bobde with waightie stones,</l>
                  <l>The flesh with blowes was mangled so, eche man might see the bones,</l>
                  <l>Yet would mine eies haue passage still to this his carkasse dead,</l>
                  <l>Till that my liuing sonnes from top of Troyan wals had lead</l>
                  <l>Their mother downe, whose folding feete her body could not stay:</l>
                  <l>Which they perceiued, so that from thence me wretch they did conuay.</l>
                  <l>To Grecian campe a messenger we did commaund to trudge,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:99"/>To craue the body of my sonne, which thing they did not grudge,</l>
                  <l>But sent the martyrde corps to Troy, as custome did require,</l>
                  <l>They said not nay but graunted straight when Priam did desire.</l>
                  <l>And also did a present send to breede me further woe:</l>
                  <l>The bloudy stones that kild my sonne on me they did bestowe.</l>
                  <l>VVhose bloud and braines in vgly sort about the stones was seen:</l>
                  <l>A homely present to be sent to me most wretched Queen.</l>
                  <l>Then shrinde we vp with weeping teares, our sonne so vilely slaine,</l>
                  <l>And put the stones in tombe with him, for euer to remaine.</l>
                  <l>His brothers mad with this mischaunce, for battell strong prouide:</l>
                  <l>And to reuenge their brother slaine to Grecian Campes they hide.</l>
                  <l>VVhere from the walles we had in view such cruell sturdy fight,</l>
                  <l>That mightie men to death were sent, thus battell raignd downright.</l>
                  <l>The Greekes by thousands fell to ground, their people goe to wracke:</l>
                  <l>And that ere long the Troyans stout by Greekes are beaten backe.</l>
                  <l>Thus Fortune playes in double sort, sometime with vs to stand,</l>
                  <l>And then to flie to thother part, and geue the vpper hand.</l>
                  <l>But while that Hector liued in Troy, king Priams eldest sonne,</l>
                  <l>The proudest Peere that came from Greece his mightie hand would shun,</l>
                  <l>And fly the field before him fast, they feared so his name:</l>
                  <l>So fierce he fought amongst their men, each Greeke dooth know the same.</l>
                  <l>At last my lot was so extreame to see him likewise die:</l>
                  <l>In turret top from lofty towne his death I did espie.</l>
                  <l>For when as he had slaine that day in mighty battell strong,</l>
                  <l>Of kingly Peeres the chiefe of all that oft had doone vs wrong.</l>
                  <l>And there amongst the rest he had a noble Grecian slaine,</l>
                  <l>VVhose armour all was beaten golde, which pray he went to gaine:</l>
                  <l>And drew him vp vpon his steede, and rode foorth of the throng,</l>
                  <l>And for his better ease his shield vpon his back he slong.</l>
                  <l>VVhile he did spoyle him of his weedes, carelesse of any wight,</l>
                  <l>His naked breast vnarmed then Achilles had in sight</l>
                  <l>How he was busie, and therefore from couert where he lay</l>
                  <l>By stealing steppes behinde his backe he tooke the ready way,</l>
                  <l>And suddenly with fatall speare ere that he could aduert,</l>
                  <l>He vnawares with furie great thrust Hector to the heart.</l>
                  <l>Thus died he thorowe auarice, whom thousands could not kill,</l>
                  <l>Vntill his wilfull foolishnesse himselfe did fondly spill.</l>
                  <l>My selfe, I say, that time did see from top of lofty towers,</l>
                  <l>The Troyan fieldes besprinckled with dew of bloudy showers,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:100"/>That Hectors launce had letten out, but now his latest fate</l>
                  <l>I soone had spide, and did lament to see the wofull state</l>
                  <l>Of this king Priams eldest sonne, and eke my chiefest ioy:</l>
                  <l>For well I wist that while he liude no harme could hap to Troy.</l>
                  <l>But now Achilles ouercrowed him whom he fearde before:</l>
                  <l>Wherefore he stabde him thorowly that he might liue no more.</l>
                  <l>I saw, I saw how Hector lay as dead as any stone:</l>
                  <l>And yet the tyrant would not leaue but mighty blowes layd on.</l>
                  <l>For if my sonne had beene aliue and armed for to fight:</l>
                  <l>Achilles durst not come in place, nor once be seene in sight.</l>
                  <l>But when by chance my naked sonne Achilles launce had payde,</l>
                  <l>The eager Greeke to lay on lode was nothing then afraide.</l>
                  <l>When noble Hector thus was dead, yea dead, and dead againe,</l>
                  <l>Achilles then to spoyle my sonne began to take some paine.</l>
                  <l>I sawe how that he handled him, I could not looke beside:</l>
                  <l>And if I did, yet straight againe my sight that way would glide.</l>
                  <l>The tyrant vile, the bedlam beast his carkas would not spare,</l>
                  <l>Who was a man, a valiant man, his noble mind was rare.</l>
                  <l>Another of king Priams sonnes that day was caught in fight,</l>
                  <l>Whose hands chopt off the Greeks sent home to worke vs further spite.</l>
                  <l>And wilde him thus to say in Troy, and tell his aged sire</l>
                  <l>That Hector now by Grecian launce was payd his earned hire.</l>
                  <l>And that Achilles had no doubt but Paris so to slay,</l>
                  <l>VVho was the cause of all that warre, and bred that bloudy day.</l>
                  <l>Thus came my sonne with losse of hands before his mothers face,</l>
                  <l>To tell how Greekes had dealt with him, a lamentable case.</l>
                  <l>And how that Hector now was dead, whom Troyans soon should misse:</l>
                  <l>VVhich was no newes for that before mine eyes had seene all this.</l>
                  <l>And while my boy besmearde with bloud his heauie hap did waile,</l>
                  <l>A seruant came and shewde vs how Achilles vile did hale</l>
                  <l>Dead Hector round about the walles in all the Troyans sight:</l>
                  <l>VVhich was because his frends should see, as easily they might</l>
                  <l>His naked corps in mire drawne at horses taile fast tide:</l>
                  <l>And that the doer of the same before did vaunting ride.</l>
                  <l>Then came I to the wall to see slaine Hector so misusde:</l>
                  <l>From whence I cride for that I knew the Greekes had him abusd</l>
                  <l>VVho was king Priams eldest sonne wherfore against all law</l>
                  <l>In cruell sort to spite his friends, his carkasse dead to draw.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:100"/>VVith that I strainde my voice and said, Achilles, let me haue</l>
                  <l>My sonne whom thou hast slayn, that I may send him to his graue.</l>
                  <l>But he for all my mournfull cries, full fierce without remorce:</l>
                  <l>Did hale my naked sonne about the Troyan walles perforce.</l>
                  <l>VVhich when his aged sire be held, from top of lofty wall</l>
                  <l>For griefe conceiude did yeald himselfe in desperat wise to fall</l>
                  <l>Down headlong from the turrets height, if friends had him not stayd:</l>
                  <l>And throngd about to succour him who then had need of ayd.</l>
                  <l>But when at last he did perceiue Achilles cruell hart,</l>
                  <l>VVith beckning hand he spake aloud, Be sure for this hard part,</l>
                  <l>If that I liue, thou shalt repent, and Gods the same will graunt</l>
                  <l>Thy wicked act: and that ere long, vile wretch, thou shalt not vaunt</l>
                  <l>Of this despitefull fact, wherfore I wish thee to restore</l>
                  <l>My slaughtered sonne, as I haue done thy slaughtered Greeks before.</l>
                  <l>Yet would not fierce Achilles cease from doing Hector wrong:</l>

                  <l>Who there on knees with wringing hands before Achilles face</l>
                  <l>With brinish teares made humble suite, to find as then such grace,</l>
                  <l>As that he would as then restore the corps of this her brother slaine.</l>
                  <l>And for which cause to pleasure him she euer would remaine</l>
                  <l>His seruant base, or bondslaue vile, to satisfie his mind.</l>
                  <l>For which, if that it pleasd him well, she then would stay behind</l>
                  <l>To be a faithfull seruant true to him at all assayes:</l>
                  <l>And pray the Gods to prosper him, and send him happie dayes.</l>
                  <l>With that Achilles stepped foorth, and gaue to her his hand:</l>
                  <l>In courteous wise he greeted her, and wilde her vp to stand</l>
                  <l>Before his face, and waile no more, and then as she thought best</l>
                  <l>He was content it should be so, and graunted her request.</l>
                  <l>This did my daughter bring to passe such was her peereles hewe</l>

                  <l>That Hectors corps was brought by her home to her aged sire.</l>

                  <l>Achilles he a certain summe of mony did require.</l>

                  <l>But for her sake and such a summe he seemed well content.</l>
                  <l>The money now without delay we sent away in hast:</l>
                  <l>And willingly did pay the same for daughters promise past.</l>
                  <l>O wretch most vile, O tyrant bad, that thus with Hector delt:</l>
                  <l>VVhat stonied heart in brawned breast would this not make to melt?</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:101"/>The cause of this his furie great, and of such cruell hate</l>
                  <l>Was by Patroclus haplesse death, who was his louing mate,</l>
                  <l>Whom Hector slewe in open fight, with many a Greeke that day,</l>
                  <l>And spoylde him of his armor bright, that naked there he lay,</l>
                  <l>Which armor was the chiefest canse that brought him to his end,</l>
                  <l>The angry gods displeasde with vs such haplesse hap did send.</l>
                  <l>All things thus done, my other sonnes reuenge did vowe to take,</l>
                  <l>On vile Achylles for this deede, and for slaine Hectors sake,</l>
                  <l>That presently vpon the Greekes with mightie force they went,</l>
                  <l>And thousands on ech part that day to dreadfull death were sent.</l>
                  <l>Thus dayly they did still contend by force of cruell warre,</l>
                  <l>And Princes fell on eyther side, that thither came from farre:</l>
                  <l>The Greekes did waxe, the Troyans grew as desperat men in fielde,</l>
                  <l>To daunt eche others haughty minde, and make eche other yeelde:</l>
                  <l>At last againe as fortune woulde Achylles fierce did slay</l>
                  <l>My other sonne, sir Troylus, who was our chiefest stay.</l>
                  <l>A valiant youth the Greekes can tell, although he thus did die,</l>
                  <l>For that before the proudest Greekes he forced had to flie.</l>
                  <l>In turrets tall from toppe of towne, my hap was still so bad,</l>
                  <l>To see my louing sonne to die, a wofull sight most sad</l>
                  <l>For mothers eie still to beholde her louing children so</l>
                  <l>To end their dayes, and be abusde by such a spitefull so,</l>
                  <l>From loftie walls I then beheld sir Troylus my sonne,</l>
                  <l>To course the Greekes on euery side, and made them fast to run,</l>
                  <l>Vntill that fierce Achylles came, who sure I thinke was borne</l>
                  <l>To breede my woe, and that the gods against me wretch had sworne</l>
                  <l>To plague with hellish torments vile, the plagues of furthest hell</l>
                  <l>Should hap to me, and greater paines than any tongue can tell,</l>
                  <l>For that what time soeuer I on walls did see the fight</l>
                  <l>Some childe of mine was sure to die, within his mothers sight.</l>
                  <l>When nowe to turrets top I climde with many Ladies more,</l>
                  <l>Whereto I did not once ascend, since Hector dide before:</l>
                  <l>But then too soone such was my chaunce, I thinke the gods decreede,</l>
                  <l>That while I did behold the fight no better they should speede.</l>
                  <l>Achylles braue, on horse did mount, whom Troylus had spide</l>
                  <l>To brag amongst the Greekes, his mates, well mande on euery side:</l>
                  <l>But when my sonne had found his foe, and thought on Hectors foile,</l>
                  <l>Like mighty Mars he layd on lode, and made that day great spoile:</l>
                  <l>He thrust amongst the thicest throng Achylles out to finde,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:102"/>That he might knowe his brothers death, as yet he had in mind.</l>
                  <l>With couched launce and courage good, my sonne did run amaine</l>
                  <l>In hope to haue by manly force his cruell foe there slaine,</l>
                  <l>He mist the marke, but yet he strake Achylles from his steede,</l>
                  <l>And if the Greekes had not giuen ayde, he then had done the deede:</l>
                  <l>And yet for all the Greekes could do, he gaue his foe a wound</l>
                  <l>Thorowe plated thigh, he thrust his launce a handful in the ground.</l>
                  <l>Achylles horsde by helpe of Greekes, and mounted vp anew,</l>
                  <l>And then with troupe of armed Knights my sonne he did pursue:</l>
                  <l>The wounded Greeke that folowed fast, sir Troylus had spide,</l>
                  <l>Who turnd his horse, and willd his mates his fury to abide,</l>
                  <l>With monstrous force, the Greekes did fight, the Troyans did not flie</l>
                  <l>On either side to lay it on, the people fiercely cry:</l>
                  <l>At last the Greekes had giuen the horse that then my sonne did beare</l>
                  <l>A mortall wound, that paind him so, the iade did fiercely fare,</l>
                  <l>In plunging sort, the horse did play with mighty gyrds, at last</l>
                  <l>From setled seate my haplesse sonne the winsing iade had cast:</l>
                  <l>In falling downe (ah heauy chance) his foote the stirrop helde,</l>
                  <l>The wounded horse so scard before, ran raging in the field,</l>
                  <l>And dragd my childe before my face vpon the bloody ground,</l>
                  <l>For blood did flow that day ful fresh from many a mortal wound.</l>
                  <l>Achylles hauing spide my sonne in such a woful case,</l>
                  <l>With piercing speare to him halfe dead, he hied him then apace,</l>
                  <l>Through backe and side his launce he sent, and cride, I now am quit</l>
                  <l>With this my wound receiude before, and therewithal did hit</l>

                  <l>A messenger we sent to craue the carkasse of our childe,</l>

                  <l>I did not thinke such curtesie at his handes then to finde.</l>
                  <l>But with my sonne to comfort me, these louing words did send</l>
                  <l>My friend (quoth hee) tel Hecuba, that oft I do intend,</l>

                  <l>Til such time serue, wish her to take of me this mangled boy.</l>
                  <l>Thus Troylus was brought to Troy, a heauie sight God knows,</l>

                  <l>Her sonne whom fierce Achylles vsde with such extremitie,</l>
                  <l>His martyrde corps I did intoombe, though part were left behinde</l>
                  <l>Which Grecian iades did tread to dirt, yet al that I could finde,</l>
                  <l>To graue was sent: the funerals and al things else wel done,</l>
                  <l>The Troyans al in woful wise do much lament my sonne,</l>

                  <l>Now did the Greekes afresh begin the Troyans to suppresse,</l>

                  <l>I did inuent in secrete sort to cry the Grecian quit.</l>
                  <l>For slaying of my sonnes, and for a thousand Troyans slaine,</l>
                  <l>VVhich vvere my frends, for vvhose sake novv such frendship I did faine.</l>
                  <l>The presently <hi>I</hi> cald my sonne, vvhom Fortune yet had sparde:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:104"/>And made him priuy of my mind, how that I had preparde</l>
                  <l>To worke my foe a spitefull part when least he did suspect:</l>
                  <l>And sure I was no liuing wight as yet could it detect.</l>
                  <l>And thus I said, my louing sonne, euen as thou art my child,</l>
                  <l>And hast a care to wish me well that am thy mother mild,</l>
                  <l>And as thou knowest I tendred thee when Priam sentence gaue</l>
                  <l>Thou shouldst be slaine, yet I as then sought meanes thy life to saue.</l>
                  <l>Wherfore good Paris haue a care to ease thy mothers griefe:</l>
                  <l>And that I pine in paine not long before I find reliefe.</l>
                  <l>Which soon may be by thy good help, wherfore lay to thy hand:</l>
                  <l>And shrinke not now in time of need, but to thy mother stand.</l>
                  <l>Thou knowest my sonne (quoth I) how that thy brethren both are gone</l>
                  <l>Whom well I loude, and now in Troy aliue there is not one</l>
                  <l>That dares so valiantly in field against our foe to fight.</l>
                  <l>But trembling we (thou knowest it well) doe feare Achilles might.</l>
                  <l>Euen now the time is come that we may banish feare away:</l>
                  <l>For that Achilles hath set down a certaine meeting day,</l>
                  <l>To meet thy sister and my selfe, with others of my traine:</l>
                  <l>What time the wretch doeth make account my daughter for to gaine.</l>
                  <l>Apollos temple is the place where Hectors bones doo rest:</l>
                  <l>VVhich stands in field vvithout our rovvne, a place mistrusted least.</l>
                  <l>In vvhich Achilles mindes to be, and vovves if that he liue</l>
                  <l>To keep the time, expecting then my daughter I should giue:</l>
                  <l>So likevvise I haue promised, vvherfore my sonne geue ayd:</l>
                  <l>Let not the terror of the Greek make Paris heart afrayd.</l>
                  <l>But hie thee to the place, and there in secrete sort goe hide</l>
                  <l>Thy selfe before Achilles come so that thou be not spide.</l>
                  <l>With vveapon good prouide thy selfe against so fierce a foe,</l>
                  <l>And vvhen thou spiest conuenient time then strike the fatall blovv,</l>
                  <l>That shall procure the Troyans ease, and pleasure to thy frends,</l>
                  <l>And pay the debt that Hector ovves to make the Greek amends.</l>
                  <l>My sonne as vvilling as my selfe to vvork Achilles spight:</l>
                  <l>Did soon consent to my request, and thether stole by night,</l>
                  <l>And closely by his brothers tombe himselfe he did conuay:</l>
                  <l>And there vntill Achilles came in secrete sort he lay.</l>
                  <l>Polixena my daughter faire in gorgious vvise I clad:</l>
                  <l>For that I knew her pleasant hue would make Achilles glad.</l>
                  <l>According to appointed time we passe the Troyan gates</l>
                  <l>With certaine of the Troyan dames, we had no other mates.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:104"/>And to the temple straight we hide, where we Achilles met,</l>
                  <l>According to the place and time which he before had set.</l>
                  <l>Then did the Greek vs Troyans greete, he faind a sober cheere,</l>
                  <l>And said he grieud at Hectors death that was so braue a Peere.</l>
                  <l>And further that he knew his death was to his mother paine,</l>
                  <l>And to his sister whom he loude, wherfore (quoth he) againe,</l>
                  <l>I am content to make amends for that which I haue done.</l>
                  <l>And that in stead of Hector slaine I mind to be thy sonne.</l>
                  <l>And for assurance of the thing, by Ioue he did protest,</l>
                  <l>That after this (by his good will) the town of Troy should rest</l>
                  <l>From further war, and therwithall his loue he did embrace,</l>
                  <l>And fixt his eyes in doting sort vpon my daughters face,</l>
                  <l>Not fearing any future hap, nor doubting any ill:</l>
                  <l>For that in all respects we did according to his will.</l>
                  <l>Which Paris spide, behind the tombe, when hand in hand we went.</l>
                  <l>His sword prepard with mighty force, through back and side he sent.</l>
                  <l>That down Achilles falles right soon all groueling on the ground:</l>
                  <l>From gored sides the bloud did flow foorth of his mortall wound.</l>
                  <l>There lay the wretch that earst we feard, now breathing out his last</l>
                  <l>Whom Paris wild to eager curres should presently be cast.</l>
                  <l>For vsing of his brethren so in such despitefull wise:</l>
                  <l>Their bodies dead he did abuse before their mothers eyes.</l>
                  <l>Wherto my sonne sir Helenus by no meanes then would yeeld</l>
                  <l>How that the body of the Greek should lie in open field,</l>
                  <l>Where beasts and foules might feed their fill: but craude the Greeks might haue</l>
                  <l>The body of their slaughtered friend to lay in resting graue.</l>
                  <l>Which thing was done, though vndeserud on vile Achilles part,</l>
                  <l>That euer sought by spitefull meanes to slay my wofull hart.</l>
                  <l>Then home we came with this reuenge more mery than before:</l>
                  <l>For well we wist Achilles fierce should neuer hurt vs more.</l>
                  <l>Now Fortune faund on me awhile, awhile it was indeed:</l>
                  <l>For that the angry Gods against me wretch had still decreed.</l>
                  <l>Achilles dead, the Greekes afresh fierce war did vndertake:</l>
                  <l>And vowed reuenge on all my frends for slaine Achilles sake.</l>
                  <l>And on my daughter chiefe of all for working them such spight:</l>
                  <l>VVith one consent on either part they faithfull promise plight.</l>
                  <l>If that in case our towne they take, wherof before they boast</l>
                  <l>My daughter they will sacrifice to dead Achilles ghost.</l>
                  <l>But hauing slaine so fierce a foe the Troyans all were glad.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:105"/>And craued the field against the Greekes, who now remayned sad</l>
                  <l>For losing of so braue a Peere, who was their chiefest ayd,</l>
                  <l>Wherfore to fight with vs we thought the Grecians were afrayd.</l>
                  <l>Yet were we all deceiude for that more fiercer than before</l>
                  <l>The Grecians fought, that down there falles on either side great store.</l>
                  <l>Their rage was great for to reuenge the death of this their Peere:</l>
                  <l>And fiercely fought in desperate sort, as men without all feare.</l>
                  <l>At last I climde to wonted place where often I had been:</l>
                  <l>Yet neuer there but some mishap by me poore wretch was seen,</l>
                  <l>From whence I viewd the bloudy broyle which grieude me to behold</l>
                  <l>How that the Greeks and Troyans stout in bloud together rolde,</l>
                  <l>At last I spied where Paris was (my sonne) who then did chase</l>
                  <l>A Grecian Peere, Sir Aiax stout, who fled before his face.</l>
                  <l>Not Aiax Telamon I meane, but Oelius Aiax he</l>
                  <l>Whom Paris chasdin open field that all the Greekes might see.</l>
                  <l>At last the Greek receiud a wound though he full swiftly flew:</l>
                  <l>For that my sonne the flying chase did eagerly pursue.</l>
                  <l>A greeuous wound it was indeede, for Aiax feeling paine</l>
                  <l>By flight could not preuaile, wherfore perforce he turnde againe,</l>
                  <l>And did encounter with my sonne who first had made him smart:</l>
                  <l>And with his sword (O haples hap) strake Paris to the hart.</l>
                  <l>There died my sonne before my face, which Helen well doeth know</l>
                  <l>Who stood with me when that her mate receiude that fatall blow.</l>
                  <l>The Greek like bedlem beast layd on, for dolor of his wound,</l>
                  <l>And stabd my sonne through back and side, starke dead vpon the ground.</l>
                  <l>Whose corps when that the Greeks had spied, with mighty force they run</l>
                  <l>To haue a part of Paris dead, for his offences done.</l>
                  <l>For well they knew he was the man that stole their Prince his wife:</l>
                  <l>Which was the chiefest cause of all that bred that bloudy strife.</l>
                  <l>VVherfore each Greek to haue him dead did mightely contend:</l>
                  <l>And sure had got my sonne, but that the Troyans did defend</l>
                  <l>The mangled corps of Paris dead, and kept from Grecian force</l>
                  <l>My sonne whom they would faine haue caught to plague his senslesse corse.</l>
                  <l>VVhose life was gone they right well knew, but they like hellish hounds</l>
                  <l>Did hunt to haue his carkas dead to plague with grieuous wounds.</l>
                  <l>His senslesse corps they could not hurt, yet they as men starke mad:</l>
                  <l>Of worldly wealth would geue great store so that they might haue had</l>
                  <l>Aliue or dead, or but a part, to satisfie their will:</l>
                  <l>For well they wist he was the man that did Achilles kill.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:105"/>Wherefore they fiercely fought to haue the body of my sonne,</l>
                  <l>Who slewe Achylles traytrously, and first that warre begunne,</l>
                  <l>But by the ayde of Troyans stout in maugre of their might,</l>
                  <l>The body of my sonne was brought foorth of that bloody fight,</l>
                  <l>Whose corps was laide before my face a grieuous sight to see:</l>
                  <l>The armes and legs which Greekes hewde off, was likewise brought to mee,</l>

                  <l>Faire Helena for this her mate in wofull sort did morne,</l>
                  <l>Who was the cause that all the Greekes against our state had sworne,</l>

                  <l>The Greekes came in, our gates were ope, loe thus we were betraide.</l>
                  <l>Now was my woe afresh renude, my miseries forepast</l>

                  <l>With murdring minds so laide about, a greeuous thing to tell,</l>
                  <l>And so be hact and hewde our men vnarmed as they stoode,</l>
                  <l>That like to streames the Troyans streetes did flowe with gory bloode:</l>
                  <l>There lay the States and Peeres of Troy, whome angry Greekes had slaine,</l>

                  <l>But now (quoth I) graunt my request, that this vile Greek may rue</l>
                  <l>This cruell deed in time to come, that euer he so slue</l>
                  <l>The aged King, for reuerence of gray and aged haires:</l>
                  <l>VVhose youth was come by yearly course to old and aged yeares.</l>
                  <l>Let not the slaughter of a King make proud his hauty hart:</l>
                  <l>Nor that he long may make his vaunt of this so hard a part.</l>
                  <l>But as your iustice now is seen, in so reuenging wrong:</l>
                  <l>So Pyrrhus proud by your consent may rue this deed ere long.</l>
                  <l>VVhen Priam thus by Pyrrhus sword had breathed out his last,</l>
                  <l>And that the town was quite subdude by Grecians fighting fast,</l>
                  <l>The Greeks demaund Polixena, because she first procurde</l>
                  <l>Achilles death by fained loue, through which he was allurde:</l>
                  <l>VVhom when they found, this Pyrrhus craude to haue my louing child</l>
                  <l>That so had causde his fathers death by working such a wilde,</l>
                  <l>But when she knew the earnest suite of fierce Achilles sonne:</l>
                  <l>For succour to me helples wretch, with vaine hope fast did run.</l>
                  <l>VVith clasping armes about my neck on me she cride for ayd,</l>
                  <l>For Pyrrhus, dead Achilles sonne, had made her sore afrayd.</l>
                  <l>Help mother now at need (quoth she) still weeping on my brest:</l>
                  <l>A place too weak, for greedy Greeks, for there she might not rest.</l>
                  <l>Grim Pyrrhus with an eager look did teare her from my lap:</l>
                  <l>VVith churlish fist he gript the girle, O hard and cruell hap?</l>
                  <l>That still mine eyes should witnes beare of this my wofull case,</l>
                  <l>And that both mate and children deare should die before my face.</l>
                  <l>By haire of head Polixena was drawne along the street:</l>
                  <l>VVhere diuers of her wofull frends in sorrowing sort did meete</l>
                  <l>To waile with her, for well they wist to dreadfull death she went.</l>
                  <l>Achilles death now to reuenge they knew proud Pyrrhus ment.</l>
                  <l>And as they thought it came to passe, for Pyrrhus did deuise,</l>
                  <l>Vpon his fathers tombe as then my child to sacrifise</l>
                  <l>Vnto the ghost of his slaine Sire, his death to recompence:</l>
                  <l>And that Achilles ghost might know it was for her offence.</l>
                  <l>Polixena so halde along by such a cruell foe:</l>
                  <l>VVhat should become of this my child as then I did not know.</l>
                  <l>VVherfore to see I followed fast what would to her betide:</l>
                  <l>VVhere round about Achilles tombe a troup of Greeks I spide,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:109"/>Which readie were to giue their aide if need should so require,</l>
                  <l>My daughters death with one consent each Gretian did desire:</l>
                  <l>And there before my face they bound both hand and foote full fast</l>
                  <l>Of this my child, that willing was of bitter death to tast.</l>
                  <l>But hauing spide me where I stood, her hands and feete fast bound,</l>
                  <l>In token of her last farewell, her head towards me she twound,</l>
                  <l>And fixt her eyes on me (poore wretch) with such a wofull looke,</l>
                  <l>With nodding head for want of limmes, her last farewell she tooke.</l>
                  <l>Then Pyrrhus mad vntill reuenge did drawe his fatall blade,</l>
                  <l>And slewe my child vpon the tombe, which he before had made</l>
                  <l>In honour of his father dead, and there with gorie blood</l>
                  <l>Imbrewd the graue: which cruell act did all the Gretians good.</l>
                  <l>These words he spake which well I heard (quoth he) take here thine end,</l>
                  <l>Thy soule vnto my fathers ghost for thine offence I send,</l>
                  <l>And for the fault of Paris slaine, King Priam late did rewe</l>
                  <l>His sonnes vile part; for with this hand the aged man I slewe.</l>
                  <l>O fortune vile, that sparde my life to see this wofull day,</l>
                  <l>My friends starke dead whom Grecians slewe, in euery corner lay,</l>

                  <l>Which cruell acte (though then starke mad) in minde I still did beare</l>

                  <l>And all was for the Troyan wracke, to plague my sonnes offence.</l>
                  <l>For Paris needs to Greece would goe, and soon returnd from thence.</l>

                  <l>But now I know I wish too late: the angry Gods had sworn</l>
                  <l>To plague our state for some offence. For Paris being born,</l>
                  <l>VVhose desteny the Oracle did openly declare,</l>
                  <l>And yet to see, my hap was such that wicked babe to spare.</l>
                  <l>VVho was the cause of this mischaunce, and breeder of our woe:</l>
                  <l>His death had been to vs a life, and life to thousands mo.</l>

                  <l>O what offence did we commit that all the Gods should frowne:</l>
                  <l>And thus decree with one consent to pluck our Empire downe?</l>
                  <l>Did they appoint that I should breed, and foster in my lap</l>
                  <l>A scourge to plague the parents sinne, and cause of their mishap?</l>

                  <l>I cannot tell, but well I know it was a recompence</l>

                  <l>For then these wofull miseries I wretch had neuer seen.</l>
                  <l>Why did the Gods cause me to liue? why did they thus decree?</l>

                  <l>Sir Satire sonne to Pariside, of Bosphore sometime king,</l>
                  <l>Was wild by Oracle to shun a mouse of any thing.</l>
                  <l>For that a mouse should be his death except he took great heed:</l>
                  <l>The Oracle did tell him flat his fate was so decreed.</l>
                  <l>But he to shun the warned harme did slay the silly mice</l>
                  <l>In field and town, that none might liue his death to enterprice:</l>
                  <l>And in his land no man might dwell that mouse was cald by name:</l>
                  <l>He sought each way to saue himselfe, he feared so the same.</l>
                  <l>He stopt the holes of creeping mice in euery place full sure:</l>
                  <l>For that the vermins by no meanes his death might once procure.</l>
                  <l>Yet see the end, when least he thought of this forewarned harme:</l>
                  <l>He wounded was vpon the brawne or muscle of the arme:</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Musculus</hi> a little mouse in Latine we doo call:</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Mus</hi> a mouse which Satire slew, as after did befall.</l>
                  <l>A dagger piercd Sir Satirs arme right where the muscle grew:</l>

                  <l>For being slaine, the sword that slew the King was brought to sight</l>

                  <l>Because he should take heed of him, and shun the warned foe.</l>
                  <l>When he was doing of his rights vnto his fathers ghost:</l>

                  <l>Did counsell Iason being young to Colchos Ile to sayle.</l>
                  <l>To fetch the golden fleece from thence: wherin he did preuaile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
                  <l>His meaning was that Iason should be lost or drownd therin,</l>
                  <l>The conquest seemd vnpossible the golden fleece to win.</l>
                  <l>And for because he might not feare the prophesie forepast</l>
                  <l>He shipt his neuew speedely, and sent him thence in hast.</l>
                  <l>But Iason soon returnde again, and brought away the fleece:</l>
                  <l>And brought Medea home with him to be old Pelias Neece.</l>
                  <l>To Thessalie Medea came, and hearing what was done;</l>
                  <l>Against the aged Pelias, she presently begun</l>
                  <l>To practise treason at the last, and causd the aged sire</l>
                  <l>By his own daughters to be slaine, this was for Pelias hire.</l>
                  <l>For he that could not trust the man that was his kinsman near:</l>
                  <l>But purposely did seek his death to free himselfe from fear.</l>
                  <l>Had such a chance, ere that he wist Medea did the deed.</l>
                  <l>His ielous mind was chiefest cause that made him so to speed.</l>
                  <l>The Oracle long time before did know old Pelias mind:</l>
                  <l>Wherfore it told what destenie was to the man assignde.</l>
                  <l>Of fiftie daughters Danaus to be the sire was knowne:</l>

                  <l>Aegiptus would haue all these his sonnes his brothers daughters wed:</l>
                  <l>But Danaus would not consent, wherfore away he fled</l>
                  <l>And tooke his daughters all with him, because he did suspect</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>A</hi> sonne in law would be his death, therfore he did reiect</l>
                  <l>The offer that his brother made, but why he did refraine:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:2148:113"/>The cause was thus, the Oracle did say he should be slaine</l>
                  <l>By him that was his sonne in law, wherefore he sought to shunne</l>
                  <l>Such destinie as might befall through such a wicked sonne.</l>
                  <l>Aegyptus wroth with this his deede, did send his sonnes to stay</l>
                  <l>Their vncle that before was fled, and pact from thence away.</l>
                  <l>His sonnes according to his will old Danaus did take,</l>
                  <l>And causde him there against his will a marrige day to make:</l>
                  <l>His daughters all were wedded then against their fathers will,</l>
                  <l>Eche man his cousin germaine had, Aegyptus did fulfill</l>
                  <l>His mind at last, and did reioyce in this so strange a march.</l>
                  <l>But Danaus not well content, did worke a swift dispatch,</l>
                  <l>Because he fearde the prophecie, least that on him should light:</l>
                  <l>He did commaund his daughters all they should appoint a night,</l>
                  <l>Wherein eche one with willing minde her slumbring mate should slay,</l>
                  <l>And disappoint the prophecie before the morrow day:</l>
                  <l>His iealous minde did vexe him so, he still did doubt the worst,</l>
                  <l>Til it was done he could not rest, the man did so mistrust:</l>
                  <l>According to the fathers minde they did commit the act,</l>
                  <l>The nuptiall bed was so defilde with such a filthie fact,</l>
                  <l>All sauing one was slaine that night, a hard and cruel part,</l>
                  <l>Whose life was saude, for that his wife did wil him thence to start,</l>
                  <l>For very loue she bare to him, though all her sisters had</l>
                  <l>Destroyde their mates, which deede she thought to be right vile and bad.</l>
                  <l>Thus being saude by such a meane, the sonne in law did wexe</l>
                  <l>Right fierce against his father law, and earnestly did vexe,</l>
                  <l>He vowde reuenge on Danaus, that thus vniustly delt,</l>
                  <l>He swore that he should taste the same that they before had felt:</l>
                  <l>And in the end he slue the wretch, for doing of that deede:</l>
                  <l>The Oracle pronouncde before how Danaus should speede,</l>
                  <l>Thus seeking how to shunne his fate his death he did procure,</l>
                  <l>Himselfe was cause of his dispatch, when he thought all things sure.</l>
                  <l>The Theban king that Laius hight by Oracle was tolde,</l>
                  <l>That Oedipus his onely sonne would proue a man too bolde,</l>

                  <l>He killde a pig, and tooke the heart, and brought it to the King,</l>
                  <l>And blooded certaine linnen clothes in token of the thing,</l>
                  <l>And tolde him that his childe was dead, and there he might behold</l>
                  <l>The heart and heart blood of his sonne, wherefore he might be bolde</l>
                  <l>To banish feare, for this his childe should neuer him molest,</l>
                  <l>For he was dead and dead againe, and therefore he might rest.</l>
                  <l>Now see the hap that to this man did afterward betide,</l>
                  <l>For Phorbas king of Corinth soile, by chaunce that way did ride,</l>
                  <l>VVho spide the child as then aliue, which wofully did cry:</l>

                  <l>He causde his man to take it downe, to saue the infants life.</l>
                  <l>Right glad he was, wherfore foorthwith he brought it to his wife</l>
                  <l>VVho barren was, and had no child: then this as for her own</l>
                  <l>She did receiue, from whence it came to them it was not knowne.</l>
                  <l>The child did grow, they loude it well, and then in course of yeares</l>
                  <l>Of noble linage comes the boy (quoth Phorbas) it appeares.</l>
                  <l>For that the lad vvas dayly geuen to Martiall exercise:</l>
                  <l>And did delight to take in hand some noble enterprise.</l>
                  <l>At last king Phorbas sends his sonne vvith mighty men of vvar,</l>

                  <l>Sir Oedipus in battell strong did vtterly confound</l>

                  <l>VVherof he presently did die: thus Laius had his end:</l>
                  <l>The Gods that knew hovv all things vvent, such fate to him did send:</l>
                  <l>And Oedipus his mother takes, and maries her in hast.</l>

                  <l>Did flowt and mocke at their request, and openly denide</l>

                  <l>And that no warre should once arise betwixt our Empires stout:</l>
                  <l>So gently they did intreat, but if I went about</l>
                  <l>To holde her stil, they threaten warre, and vowed by gods aboue,</l>
                  <l>That they would fight to haue againe, sir Menelaus loue,</l>
                  <l>Whom I perforce vniustly held, and stoutly did maintaine</l>
                  <l>So vile a part that would in time cause thousands to be slaine,</l>
                  <l>But I did giue them answere thus, I minde to holde her still,</l>
                  <l>Not Greece, nor all the Princes there, in this shall breake my will.</l>
                  <l>Let Agamemnon do his worst, I passe it not a straw:</l>

                  <l>I mind to holde dame Helen still, against all law and right:</l>
                  <l>I haue her now, and here with me I minde she shall remaine,</l>

                  <l>With one consent the Roman state decreede that he should die:</l>
