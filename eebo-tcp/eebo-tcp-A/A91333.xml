         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and ſince by force of Armes prepared to invade his
Great Councell (as we conceive) doth now expect a
concurrence therein according to ſeverall meſſages
and commands, not onely from divers perſons of both
houſes of Parliament, but alſo from all his loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
amongſt whom we of the Citie of <hi>London</hi> are no inconſiderable
n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mber.</p>
            <p>That we conceive (as the caſe now ſtands) that it cannot be, but a
moſt impious and miſchievous thing in us, either to forſake, or by arms
to ſeek the d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtruction of that ſacred Court; for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe in former ages this Kingdome hath very ſeldome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſht
its repreſentative, elected, intruſted Councell, and when it
hath, it hath ſoon found cauſe to repent that Treachery, and inſtability,
&amp; commonly that Repentance proved fatall both to King &amp; kingdom.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That private Councell by which his Majeſty is incenſed
againſt his generall Councell, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bſcures it ſelf from the world; neither

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> names nor qualities, nor their grounds of exception are declared
or avowed. And ſince his Majeſtie is now attended by ſo many Peers,
Councellors of ſtate, Judges, and Lawyers, and hath ſufficient Forces
to commence warre, and cannot be imagined to obey the conduct of
meere private reaſon, in a matter of ſuch tranſcendent conſequence,
we a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e apt to thinke, that the promoters of this horrid warre would
not conceale themſelves and their grounds, if they were not Papiſts,
Prelates, Delinquents, neceſſitous Courtiers, or ſuch mercinary Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as no Nation nor age ever expected faith or pietie from. And there
is a rumour here ſpread, that divers of the Nobles now in his Majeſties
traine departed not from hence without great ſolicitation, and have
not that freedome now of advice, or of acceſſe to his Majeſtie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to the Parliament, as was expected, nor does any thing under
their hands publikely teſtifie, how fare they adjudge this Parliament
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:124327:3"/>
trayterous, or this warre gainſt it juſtifiable. And yet policy, juſtice,
honour muſt needs inforce this, and doth challenge it both from his
Majeſtie and from them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we having lived nearer and beene more jealouſly intentive
eye and eare witneſſes of Parliamentary proceedings, then remoter
count<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies, have not beene able to diſcover any diſloyaltie in the major
part of Lords and Commons, but on the contrary, have ſeene all the
ſlaunders of their enemies, detected of villanous falſhood and malice, as
in the maine matters of ingroſſing the publike treaſure to their owne
uſe, or ſeeking to corrupt the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Land, that thereby they
might tirannize over King and kingdome, we beleeve, we ſee, we know
the contrary, and ſo muſt needs all ſober men.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if his Maieſtie did not relie upon allegations without
proofes, and if thoſe allegations alſo were not full of uncertaintie and
inſuffiency many times, no blood need to be ſhed in this difference,
a legall debate even in Parliament it ſelfe would ſift out the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruth to the
ſatisfaction of all the kingdome, and neither the Orators tongue, nor
the ſouldiers arme (whom none but times very calamitous uſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy)
neede here to be ingaged: for ſometimes his Maieſtie profeſſes to
have honorable thoughts concerning the Parliament, blaming onely
the too great influence which ſome malignant partie hath upon both
houſes, yet his Maieſtie names no malignants, nor ſpecifies the nature
of that influence; ſometimes his Maieſtie chargeth by name ſome few
of each Houſe, and promiſeth particular charges, but publiſheth none,
ſometimes his Maieſty inveigheth againſt ſome particular Votes of the
maior part of both Houſes, condemning them as treaſonable, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
illegall, but taketh no iſſue, nor aſſigneth any legall tryall, nor
alloweth any appeale from his owne breaſt and Sword, and though in
very te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmes no warre is confeſſed againſt the Parliament, yet it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifeſtly
levied againſt Sir <hi>John Hotham, &amp;c.</hi> for being an Actor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Parliament, and treaſon is fixed upon all ſuch as obey the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of both Houſes: and yet both Houſes themſelves muſt not be
thought to be aymed at; and as there is uncertaintie in the parties
charged ſo there is the like in the crimes imputed, for ſometimes the
ordinance concerning the <hi>Militia,</hi> beares the burthen of all, ſometimes
ſome other plots &amp; conſpiracies of bringing in an arbitrary power, and
Ariſtocraticall uſurpation over King and kingdome, both are intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and a more ſatisfactory narration of particulars are promiſed, but
we ſee no ſuch thing as yet pe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>formed. And thus the caſe not being
yet rightly ſtated, nor the certaine traytors nominated nor the certaine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124327:3"/>
treaſons declared, nor <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny other interpreter of Law, but his Maieſtie
alone without any of his Peeres or Judges admitted, yet we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to betray that <hi>treſhault</hi> aſſembly, whom all law, conſcience and
intereſt, nay, all that is ſacred or can be neare or deare unto us, bindes
us to defend with our lives, till wee are clearely convinced of their
falſhood to us.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, divers exceptions taken againſt the Parliament much inſiſted
on, as that they may vote the King to be at <hi>London</hi> when he is at <hi>Yorke,</hi>
or declare treaſon to be loyaltie, and loyaltie treaſon, &amp;c. ſavour of
meere merriment, and require no other anſwer, if the ſadneſſe of the
times would allow it, for though generall conſent inable the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
very farre, whilſt it is not abuſed, yet that being all the <hi>Baſis</hi> of
their power when that ſhall fall away (as it doth when groſly abuſed)
all derivative power vaniſhes with it; and Story tells us that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>metimes hath cauſeleſly out of levetie and love of noveltie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
the Parliament, but no Age ever ſaw one Parliament that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
treacherous to the whole kingdome.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, as we ſee none but good fruits in this publike Councell, ſo
we ſee none but bad in its private oppoſite, for when we ſee his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
at the ſame time rayſing Forces here againſt a Parliament, not iuſtly
convinced of treaſon, and yet not affording his ready aſſiſtance to
ſupplies for <hi>Ireland,</hi> whilſt many Proteſtants are murdered daily there
for want of the ſame, and that by the hands of thoſe bloody miſcreants
whom his Maieſtie never mentions without horror. And when wee
ſee all intentions of forces abiured, and with ſuch high imprecations
diſclaymed, except for a guard onely, and yet as ſoone as Forces are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
thereby, open defiance proclaimed to all which adhere to the
Parliament in orders made for publique ſafetie. And when we ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting
of the publike <hi>Militia</hi> into faithfull hands by Authority of the
whole ſtate thundred againſt as oppreſſive to the Subiect, and yet at
the ſame time, Commiſſions of Array iſſued out to ſuch as may Lord Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
&amp;c. the ſaid Commiſſions being as illegall and vexatious, and
dangerous, and ſo generally known to be; as the Ship-Scot was, when we
ſee theſe things and many other like we grieve, we bleed inwardly for
his Maieſty, &amp; it ſeemes prodigious to us that ſo gentle a Prince ſhould
indure ſo much, ſo many yeares together for ſuch Miniſters ſakes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the prayers and advertiſements of this whole glorious Brittiſh
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, his Majeſtie reſts onely in generalls (which according
to his Majeſties owne words amount to juſt nothing, for as generall
complaints of ſubverting Law, and ſubjecting both King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124327:4"/>
to lawleſſe Arbitrary rule, are preſſed againſt the Parliament, ſo
nothing but generall promiſes, of making us a happy people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to all juſt requeſts, are uttered by his Ma<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſtie: at this preſent
when his Maje<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tie prefers private adviſe before publique, yet
he attributes generally all due reſpe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to Parliaments: And when
his Majeſtie takes up the Sword againſt the Parliament, the higheſt
Court of Law in <hi>England,</hi> and not condemned, but by Edict Law
onely, (no Peere, Judge, &amp;c. appearing in the condemnation) yet
this ſword is ſaid to be taken no meerely to protect the Law; This
ſtrange perſecution of a Parliament, and all its favourers, by fire and
ſword, which to our ordinary ap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rehenſions ſeemes ſo diſmall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
eſpecially at this time, when it is as great a benefit to Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as it is a ſcourge to loyall Proteſtants in <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp; this
muſt ſeeme not only to ſtand with his Majeſties generall expreſſions
of Grace, but in a generall ſenſe it is it ſelf an a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of Grace.</p>
            <p>And this is not wonderfull, for we know that whilſt the Ship-ſcos,
and all other Projects and M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nopolies lay heavveſt upon us, in all our
ſore grievances and violations, generall expreſſions of Grace did ever
accompany them, though they r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther added than diminiſhed to the
weight of our ſorrows. And therefore we have now the leſſe reaſon to
comfort our ſelves with generall aſſurances, eſpecially ſince deeds of
hoſtility faile not to attend our ſweeteſt words of clemency; Nay,
and in the ſame Manifeſtoes, as we finde profeſſions favouring all of
Law, right, and limited power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo we finde withall intermingled di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
poſitions placing the King beyond all Law, right and limitation,
and reducing Parliaments to leſſe power than ordinary Courts.</p>
            <p>In all ſubmiſſive humility therefore we humbly proſtrate our ſelves
before his Majeſties feet, with the pious tender of theſe our earneſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it would pleaſe his Majeſty, in a war of this confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nature to the three Kingdomes at once, and to the true Religion, in
them to have recourſe to the impartiall adviſe of former ages, rather
then of this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to abandon the Councels of Papiſts, as well ſuch as goe
to Church by diſpenſation, as not, and as well ſuch as ſend inſtru<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions
from beyond the Sea, as thoſe which are here more viſible; and in the
ſame manner to reject the advertiſem<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nts of Delinquents, Prelates,
Souldiers, &amp;c. whoſe known intereſts makes them incompetent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers
in this caſe, no age having a paralell to it, and if his Majeſty
conceives publike adviſe to be partiall at this time; yet to let the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124327:4"/>
know what private adviſe is hearkened to, and what the quality
and grounds of it is, for the better vindication of his Majeſties Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and the more full ſatisfaction of all true Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To make a further gueſſe at ſome of his Majeſties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
by thoſe falſe ſlanders of Treaſons which they have powred
into his Majeſties eares, and are now diſproved to all the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That his Majeſty would not admit of any crime in the
Parliament, but ſuch as beares the ſtamp and form of a legall and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

accuſation; and inſtead of generall invectives, to publiſh the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
kinde of Treaſons, and names of Traytors, and the certainty of
his Majeſtie evidence and how far his Majeſty will refer the tryall

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eemes a ſtrange
ground for ſuch an uncouth diſmall war, at ſuch a time as this, when
it makes our Lords and Commons worſe Rebels then the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and
chuſes rather that the Proteſtant Religion, together with the Crowne
there ſh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll periſh, then any truce ſhall be granted here, or any umpirage
admitted. It cannot but be better that the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to mediate and arbitrate in this difference, then that ſo unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and unnaturall a war ſhould be waged. For if Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi>
be not fitter to be truſted than Captain <hi>Leg,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Warwicke</hi>
then Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington,</hi> yet the Kings intereſt is not altered, nothing
but the ſubordinate perſon is changed, and if this be not allowed to a
parliament, the Subject hath no remedy nor power of defence in any
danger when the King miſtakes both his friends and foes: but if this
be allowed, the King ſuffers nothing by it. He which ſerves the State
faithfully, muſt needs ſerve the King faithfully, (it is to be wiſhed, the
contrary were as true) a generall defection is not to be feared, nor
could be redreſſed if it ſhould happen, and except in caſe of generall
defection, the State cannot chuſe to the diſadvantage of the King: But
if the <hi>Militia</hi> be not the main cauſe of this war, if any other ſuper-emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
exceptions, againſt any particular perſons, in, or out of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this may be debated, and accommodated legally
without blood, except one ſide will declare it ſelf not to be ſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isfied
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124327:5"/>
otherwiſe then by blood. Till theſe things be better cleared no Force
ought to be uſed, and if the King will admit of no truce, it will not be
ſaid that the Parliament takes up Armes againſt the King, but the whole
kingdome in its repreſentative Court defends it ſelfe againſt ſuch as
have ſeduced, and uniuſtly incenſed the King, and ſuch, as though they
have uſurped the Kings perſon, and word, and command, yet have not
ſo true a right to his vertue, and authoritie, nor ought to bee held ſo
friendly thereunto as the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, not to make the Parliaments arbitrary power in declaring
Law, &amp;c. any ground of charge ſince this ſtrife betweene prerogative
and libertie muſt be decided, and by the Law it ſelfe without ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
cannot, and ſince his Maieſtie does not claime that ſole inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
and ſince the Parliament cannot be ſuſpected therein.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, to judge of the Councellours and Fomenters of this warre
by the favour which it beares to the Iriſh Rebellion, and the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof with his Majeſties former gracious profeſſions: and at
leaſt to hearken to a truce till the Iriſh warre be ended, except the
Lords and Commons ſeeme more deteſtable Traytors than the Iriſh
Rebells.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That his Maieſtie will let us know ſomething in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
concerning our priviledges, in and out of Parliament, and what
latitude of authority and power ſhall be granted to the repreſentative
body of the whole Kingdome, even when his Maieſtie likes better of
private adviſe; and alſo how farre his Maieſtie will grant his Royall
Prerogative to be within the Cognizance and Declaration of the
Lords and Commons, becauſe in our underſtanding to have no right,
and no impartiall Judge of that right, and to have no limits, and no
knowne limits is one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now therefore our humble and heartie deſires to his Majeſtie are,
that he would be gratiouſly pleaſed to condiſcend to theſe ſo neceſſary
things, now that ſo ſtreaming a Comet of bloody aſpect hangs over our
heads, and ſo abominable a warre is commenced amongſt us, it will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
a happy and faire accommodation, it will diſappoint the greateſt
adverſaries of the Church and State, it will make his Majeſties raigne
more bleſſed now, and his ſtory more candid and unſtayned with blood
hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>And his Maieſties moſt humble Petitioners
ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
