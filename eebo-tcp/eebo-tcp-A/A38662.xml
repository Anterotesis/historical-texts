         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the hardest Censure, and bloudy devises:
they possiblely can inflict upon this our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
For these Counties <hi>viz. YORKSHIRE,

with the smiles of many Peers, of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and they are growne to such a higth that

Wherevpon the Citizens of <hi>Yorke</hi> foreseing the
danger that would ensue, caused the gates to
be shut up, they having a long time groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dominering of the Cavileers.</p>
            <p>The truth whereof was reported to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
House of Commons, on <hi>Saturday</hi> last
the sixteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> both Houses taking into

            <p>And the Lords and Commons, in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>That it is both against the Lawes of the Land

            <p>His Royall Majesty likewise declareth that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96840:3"/>
neither the testimony of, so many of our Lords
now with vs can credit, with divers men that
they proceed to Levie Men, and Money, and raise
Horse.</p>
            <p>Therefore Wee are not to be misliked if
after so many gratious expositious vpon consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
purposes and reasons, which they answer
by Ordering that wee answer to be Reason and
so appear to leavie Warr against Us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Wee make such Provision, that as we have
beene forst from <hi>London,</hi> and kept from HVL
Wee may not be surprized at <hi>YORKE,</hi> but in
a condition to bring Iustice on these men, who
would perswade Our People that their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is in danger, because wee will not consent, it
shall be in their power, and that their Votes and
liberties are in danger, because Wee will allow
no Iudge of that liberty, but the knowne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the land.</p>
            <p>Yet whatsoeuer prouison, wee shall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

and if this be not submitted Wee shall with as

<hi>Militia,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> who keeps Our
Towne of <hi>HUL</hi> from Us, as Wee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
persons that come in a farre greater way;
And therefore Wee shall repose and require our
City of <hi>London</hi> to obey our Commands, and not
to be misled by those men who are led desperat
by their fortunes who tell them that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
liberty, and propertie, is to be preserved
by no other way but by their disloyalty.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee propound unto them that they

draw their swords when nothing pursues them
