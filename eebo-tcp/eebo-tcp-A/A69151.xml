            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS ſoone as the Houſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria had incorporated it ſelfe with Spaine, and by their new Diſcoveries gotten to themſelues the wealth of the Indies, they began to affect and haue ever ſince purſued a firſt Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The Emperour CHARLES the fift would firſt lay the foundarion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Italy, by ſurpriſing Rome: from this, hee was thruſt by the force and reſpect of Religion: HENRY 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>Caput foederis</hi> againſt him. He then attempted it in high Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, practiſing by faction and force to reduce them firſt to Pettie States, &amp; ſo to his abſolute power. Thus HEN: 8. againe preuented him, by tying the Lutheran Princes under his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie and aſſiſtance. His ſoone the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond PHILIP, purſued the ſame am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in the Nether Germany, by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9321:3"/>
reduction whereof hee intended to make his farther way into the other. This the late Queene of England in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, by ſiding with the afflicted people on the one part, and making her ſelfe the head of their Proteſtants league with the Princes on the other: drawing in as a ſecret of State the countenance of France, to giue the more reputation, and aſſiſtance to them, and ſecurity to it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Spaine ſeeing his hopes fruitleſſe by thoſe vnions ands ſtraights, began firſt to breake if hee may the amitie of France and England; but finding the common danger to bee a faſt tye, hee raiſeth vp in that Kingdome a faction of his owne, by which the French King was diſtreſſed, that had not the Engliſh Counſell and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance relieved him, Spaine had there removed that next and greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of his ambition: his Counſell
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9321:3"/>
now tels him from theſe Examples, that the way to this great worke is impaſſable, ſo long as England layes a net in his way; and the remoue of that muſt bee the firſt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>This drew on thoſe ſecret practiſes often againſt the Queene, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen furie in 88. againſt the State; which ſhee ſeeing by following the advice of a free Counſell, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after admit of Peace, winning thereby the hearts of a loving people, who ever found hands and money at home, and keeping ſacredly her Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances abroad, ſecuring to her Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates all her time, freedome from Spaniſh flattery, and ſo ended her old and happy dayes in glory.</p>
            <p>Spaine then by the wiſedome and power of that great Lady diſpoiled of his meanes to hurt, though not of his deſires, makes vp with her peacefull
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9321:4"/>
Succeſſour of happie Memory, that golden League, that diſcerning vs at home by opinion of ſecuritie, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a power in our Counſell by believing their friendſhips, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented mariages, gaue them a way to cheriſh amongſt vs a partie of their owne beliefe, of power abroad to leade in jealouſie, and ſow diviſion betweene vs and our confederates, by which we ſe they haue ſwallowed vp the fortune of our Maſters brother, with the reſt of the Imperiall States; diſtreſſed the K. of Denmarke, by that quarrell, diverted the Swedens aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by the warres with the Pole, and maining him now with the ofex of the Daniſh Crowne. And now whether from the plot, or our fatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it hath caſt ſuch a bone betweene France and vs, as hath made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by our quarell of Religion a faſt Confederate, and vs a dangerous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9321:4"/>
ſo that now wee are left no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance againſt their malice and ambition, but the Netherlanders where the tie of mutuall ſafety is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, by daily diſcontents bred and fed betweene vs, from ſome ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to both our ſecurities; that by the doubtfulnes of friendſhip, as we now ſtand, wee may rather ſuſpect from our owne domeſticke faction: if they grow too furious, they will rather follow the example of Rome in her growing, that held it equall ſafetie, honorable &amp; more eaſie <hi>dare Regem,</hi> then <hi>ſubiugare Proviciam,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the power they haue in their hands, then to giue any friends aſſiſtance to ſerue the preſent condition of our ſtate.</p>
            <p>You may therefore ſee in what tearmes wee ſtand abroad, and I feare me at home for reſiſtance in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate: There muſt be to withſtand
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9321:5"/>
a forraine invaſion, a proportion both of Sea and Land forces for to giue an Enemy an eaſie paſſage, and a Port to relieve him in, is no leſſe then to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all at one ſtake; and it is to be conſidered, that no march of land can be of that ſpeed to make head againſt the landing of an Enemy, nor no ſuch prevention as to bee maſter of the Sea: To this point of neceſſarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, there can be no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 24000. for the Land forces: if it were for an offenſiue warre, the men of leſſe liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood were the beſt ſpared, and were vſed formerly to make ſuch warre <hi>Purgamento Repub:</hi> if wee made no farther purchaſe by it: and for a ſafetie of a Common-wealth, the wiſedome of all times did neuer inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe the publique cauſe to any other, then ſuch as haue a portion in the publique aduenture, and that we ſaw in 88. when the care of the Queene
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9321:5"/>
and Counſell did make the body of that large Army no other then the trayned band with which the auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the whole Realme amounted to no leſſe then 24000. men; neither was any of theſe drawne from forth their Countries and proper habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before the end of May, that there muſt bee no long agrievance to the publique: ſuch diſcontentments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euen to vs a more fatall Enemy then any forraine Force: the carefull diſtribution and direction of their ſea and land Forces, being more fitting for a Counſell of warre, then a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to adviſe of. I paſſe it over, yet willing when I ſhall bee called humbly to offer vppe ſuch obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as I haue formerly gathered by the former like occaſions in this Realme.</p>
            <p>To make vp this preparation, there is requiſite two things; Money, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9321:6"/>
for they cannot be properly ſeuered.</p>
            <p>It was well and wiſely ſaid of the great Counſellor the L. BVRLEIGH in the like caſe to the Queene, win hearts and you haue their hands and purſes. And I finde that of late, diffidence hauing bin a defect in the one, it hath unhappily produced the other.</p>
            <p>In gathering then of money for this preſent need, there is requiſite three things, Speed, aſſurance, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the way to gather as others in the like caſe haue done, muſt be by that paith-way that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Via Regia</hi>; being more ſecure and ſpeedy, for by vnknowne and vntrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wayes it is both rougher and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and ſeldome ſucceedeth: this laſt way although it tooke place as it were by a ſupply at firſt, and received no generall deniall; yet ſince, it hath drawne many to conſult with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9321:6"/>
and others in the conſequence, and is now conceived as a preſſure on their Liberties and againſt Law; I much feare, if now againe it bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eyther in the ſame face, or by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Seale, it will bee refuſed wholly; neyther finde I it, that the reſtraint of thoſe Recuſants haue produced any other effect then a ſtiffe reſolution in them and others to forbeare: beſides, although it went at firſt with ſome aſſurance, yet when wee conſider your Commiſſions and other formes incident to ſuch like ſervices; that how long it hangs in hand, the many delayes that wee may eaſily ſee, that ſuch a ſumme by Parliament granted is farre ſooner and more eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
            <p>If any make the ſucceſſions of time, to produce an inevitable neceſſicitie to inforce it; if denied, whether in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or by exciſe, or by impoſition, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9321:7"/>
particular in ſome ſelect perſons, which is the cuſtome of ſome Countries, and ſo conclude it as therefore the publique ſtate <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Sege,</hi> hee muſt looke for this to bee tolde them; that ſeeing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie muſt conclude alwayes to gather money as leſſe ſpeedy or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, then that ſo practiſed, which cannot bee fitter then by Parliament, the ſucceſſe attendeth the humour of the heedleſſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that are full of jealouſie and diſtruſt; and ſo vnlike to comply to any vſuall courſe of leavie but by force, which if vſed the effect is fearefull, and hath beene fatall to this ſtate: where as that by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſteth principally on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall perſon, who may with eaſe and ſafety mould them to his fit deſires, by a gracious yeilding to their juſt Petitions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:9321:7"/>If a Parliament then be moſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, aſſured and ſafe way, it is fit to conceiue what is the faireſt way to act and worke it to the preſent neede: firſt, for the time of the vſuall ſummons, reputed to bee 40. dayes, to bee too large for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity; it may bee by the dating of the writs leſſened, ſince it is no poſitiue Law, ſo that care be had that there bee but one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty day; if then, the ſame to bee leavied bee once agteed of for the time: in the body of our graunt there may be aſſignement made to the Knights of every Shire and County reſpectiuely, who vnder ſuch aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may ſafely giue ſecurity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the receipts, to ſuch as ſhall advance in preſent for the publique ſeruice any ſummes of money,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:9321:8"/>The laſt and weightieſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if a Parliament be thought fit, is how to remoue or comply the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betweene the King and the Subiects in their mutuall demaunds, and what I haue learned amongſt the better ſort of the multitude, I will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare, that your Lordſhips may be more enabled to remoue and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thoſe diſtruſts, that either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Religion, Publique ſafety of the King and ſtate, or the iuſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Common-wealth: for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a matter that they lay neereſt to their conſcience, and they are led by this ground of jealouſie, to doubt ſome practiſe againſt it: Firſt, for that the Spaniſh match was broken by the gratefull induſtrie of my Lord of Buck: out of his religious care; as there hee declared, that the Articles there demanded, in ſome ſuch ſufferance as may endanger

the quiet if not the ſtate of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion heere. Yet there haue (when hee was a principall actor in the conditions of France) as hard, if not worſe to the preſeruation of our Religion paſſed, then thoſe with Spaine; and the ſuſpect is ſtrenghthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the cloſe keeping of his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; In the point there conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>It is no leſſe argument of a doubt to them of his affectios, in that his Mother and others, many of his Miniſters in neere imployment about him are ſo affected, they talke much of his aduancing, men papiſtically deuoted ſo placed in the Campe of neereſt ſervice and chiefe command; and that the Recuſants haue got theſe late yeares by his power, more of courage then aſſurance) then before. If to cleere theſe doubts (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are worſe in fancy then in truth)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9321:9"/>
hee take a courſe, it might much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the publique ſervice againſt the ſqueamiſh humours, that haue more a violent paſſion then ſetled judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are not the leaſt of the oppoſite number in the common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The next, is the late loſſes, misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and loſſes both of men and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and how in our late vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings abroad, which the more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſpirits impute to want of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and the more ſublime wits to practiſe.</p>
