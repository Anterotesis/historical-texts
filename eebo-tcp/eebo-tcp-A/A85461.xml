            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To my honoured and beloved friends in <hi>London,</hi> who in a ſolitary ſeaſon in that populous Citie, were ſo great refreſhment unto me, by their unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſociety.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas of late I received letters from ſom of you, wherein I read that name, <hi>which is as an oyntment poured out,</hi> cauſing the parties to whom it appeares, to fall in love therewith, carrying in it a ſpirit which can produce a reall preſence, where there is an abſence in bodily reſpects: and that not only in reſpect of divine nature ſimply conſidered, but alſo in point of Chriſtian relations and reſpects, which is never deſtitute of humane, conſidered therein, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant therewith; otherwiſe, the goings forth of the ſpirits of the Saints could not be peculiar, and diſtinct from that of the wicked, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and omnipotent power reachethalſo; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints communicate in prayers, interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſupplication, &amp; giving of thanks, ſo as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cannot intermeddle therewith, nor with their joy ariſing there-from.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome of you requeſted mee to
<pb facs="tcp:118751:3"/>
write unto you concerning the opening of a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word of God, which ſome years agoe urged my ſpirit, and put me into travell to bring forth but Satan hindered: Your letters viſited me immediately upon the employment of my ſpirit in another portion of the word of God, which was then the proper ſtrength I walked by, which made me to think it might be a refreſhment unto you; which I could not lay aſide, till God opened ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther into which I might enter. Neither could wee depart from that place till the cloud removed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo-much that I was forcibly conſtrained to employ my ſelfe about the inſtruments and ſervices of the Tabernacle, to bring the ſight thereof unto your ſelves in the firſt place.: And ſo made bold to ſet upon the writing of it, yea when others ſlept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eauſe of my daily occaſions; and when it was writ, I was much urged to endeavour the printing of it, that ſo it might come to more view: and being it was written in haſt, and ſo would be tedious to read, I conſented thereto; although there is nothing which I have ſpoken in publique ſince I ſaw your faces, but I could as freely commend it unto you. The occaſion of the Ark pitching upon this place, which me-thinks looks like <hi>Elim</hi> in this wildernes, where there are twelve fountains of water, and 70.
<pb facs="tcp:118751:3"/>
Palm-trees, <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 9. For our Apoſtle writes to the twelve Tribes, out of which we may draw plenty of the water of life: and there is perfection and fulneſs of palm trees, from which you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plenty of branches, to carry as ſignes of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only of the abatement of that deluge of wrath, but alſo of overcoming <hi>by faith this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world,</hi> for Faith is the victory whereby we do it. I ſay the occaſion of the Arke pitching on this place was this;</p>
            <p>We being met together to exerciſe our ſelves in the word of God and prayer, there was one who occaſionally named this Chap, and read ſome part of it, in which action the ſcope of it ſeemed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it ſelf unto me; and to deale plainly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with you, my thoughts had never been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly upon any part of it, ſo as intending to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelfe from it, but only as I have read it as other hiſtories and writings of the word of God.</p>
            <p>Whereupon my ſpirit was moved preſently to ſpeak from it what I did receive, and immediately uttered to the ſame effect, which I have in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines commended unto you, out of my love unto you, and engagements beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, moved hereunto by your loving &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like letters, joyning themſelves unto me like
<pb facs="tcp:118751:4"/>
               <hi>Philip</hi> to the Chariot of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of it, encouraging my heart hereunto, which otherwiſe I had not takenupon me, leſt it ſhould have been thought a worke not worthy your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>
            <p>But if you pleaſe to take the payns carefully to peruſe it, I doubt not but it may give occaſion of further thoughts unto you, then can be expreſſed in ſo ſmall a volume; it may point (as with a finger) unto ſuch things, as to write them the world would not contayn the books, the matter being of an infinite and an eternall nature, holding proportion with <hi>Melchiſedech, who is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes, or end of life.</hi> Therfore the world cannot contain it, unto whom this Scripture, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the motion of the cloud hath brought us, where we now abide, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. For other place of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, I may not ſignifie unto you; for ſome of our Neighbours have profeſſed before the ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> that the place of our bodily aboad is a <hi>non ens,</hi> that it hath no being: and others have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that <hi>we are no people,</hi> not affording us ſo much as God gives to the <hi>Conies,</hi> which he calls a people, though a ſmall people, yet they make their abode in the <hi>Rocks;</hi> and it is that rock of Ages, in whom only we deſire to be found, &amp; to take theſe
<pb facs="tcp:118751:4"/>
courteſie a patiently, as we do other kindneſſes under which we yet abide, as in that point of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, only for ſuch matters as in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeech we tender unto you.</p>
            <p>Whereas you make mention of a Sermon prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>new heavens and the new earth,</hi> in the reſtauration of the Church; from which it was concluded, that ſuch an excellent eſtate of <hi>Religion</hi> was to come hereafter, as never yet appeared, which ſome could not be ſatisfied in ſuch <hi>Expoſition</hi> or <hi>Concluſion:</hi> we ſee it to be not onely the <hi>common doctrine,</hi> but <hi>deceipt</hi> alſo of the world, not to give Chriſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being, but hold men in expectation, as in the ancient <hi>Jews, who when he appears, ſeek his ruine,</hi> and that is the top of that ſpirit.</p>
            <p>By <hi>new heavens</hi> and <hi>new earth</hi> in that place, we underſtand the ſtate of Chriſt, or of that <hi>holy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or <hi>Christianity,</hi> that as the viſible heavens &amp; earth <hi>(to which he alludes)</hi> make a <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>fruitfull world,</hi> even ſo do God &amp; man in Chriſt make one durable and fruitfull <hi>condition, wherein righteouſneſs dwells,</hi> as our Apoſtle witneſſeth, which according to that law of the ſpirit, is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with infinitely more <hi>relations, operations,</hi> and vertues then all the Creations in Heaven and Earth can ſet forth, which hee calls new,
<pb facs="tcp:118751:5"/>
not with reſpect unto theſe viſible, but with reſpect unto that oldneſſe of the letter, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations according to the <hi>carnall Command,</hi> wch the Apoſtle calls old, becauſe it is weak, fading, and ready to vaniſh away, and ſo is called <hi>the olde heavens, &amp; the old earth that paſſe away,</hi> and that Miniſtry which exerciſeth according to that, being ever conſcientious of the preſent want of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and power of God in it, is conſtrained to form a time to come, which will attayn thereunto, or elſe it could gayn no acceptation in the world, but through Conception of hopes which are like the ſpiders web.</p>
            <p>But the Miniſtry of the ſpirit according to that word of life, gives preſent being to the thing it expreſſeth, or elſe it carries not in it that power of God, the nature of whoſe word was ever ſo to do, and ever will be, and they are ſayd to be new.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe of the ground thereof, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new themſelves only by meanes of that which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity it ſelfe; for in the unity of God and man in the faith of Chriſt, the ſpirit of God being an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite fountaine, muſt ever give out it ſelfe by new operations, and not as one in want, to gather up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſame thing in all reſpects conſidered, in which he hath been formerly exerciſed, no more then
<pb facs="tcp:118751:5"/>
a living fountaine gathers up the ſame water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vented to diſtribute it againe: and by reaſon of this infinite and eternity of ſpirit and life, the ſoule of a Chriſtian, or this ſpirituall ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in Christ, is in an eternall act of newneſſe, like that new commandement that the Apoſtle writes of, and that old commandement which is from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>they are new according their manner of being; for in what point of the Goſpel ſoever Chriſt is made, it ſtands of as firm grounds of aboad, and as impoſſible to remove as heaven and earth: and we know that the very nature of the earth eſtabliſheth it ſelfe in its repayring unto the Center, in ſuch ſort hath God eſtabliſhed the ſtate of his ſons &amp; daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and yet when another point of the Goſpel is made manifeſt, it is upon like ground, but to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in as differing a reſpect, and variety of furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and glory, as though it were another world, and ſo in every appearance of Chriſt, it hath his whole and compleat condition comprehended and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the ſame, as the whole world is in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth, for Chriſt, or chriſtianity is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver piece-meal'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for example; <hi>If he be revealed as Father, with reſpect to a Son, it hath the whole furniture
<pb facs="tcp:118751:6"/>
of heaven and earth, the whole eſtate of Chriſt, as Husband with reſpect to a Spouſe, there is the furniture of the whole world; for it is Chriſt who is all in all, if as King, with reſpect to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, there is whole Chriſt, all chriſtianity is to be found there imbodyed: and ſo in all points whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, elſe Chriſt is not preached as all in every thing; no office or operation of Chriſt, but it hath in it whole Chriſt, and ſo ought to be revealed, elſe we preach a humane Christ, and not divine, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Chriſt, and not a ſpirituall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And where it is ſayd, the new heavens and the new earth which I</hi> will make; <hi>the word may as truly be read, which</hi> I do make, <hi>or which</hi> I have made: <hi>For it is Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that as the ſtate of Chriſt which is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Son, muſt needs remayn, ſo ſhall the fruitfull condition of this estate, therefore their name and their ſeed muſt remayn, like heaven in name or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for operation or power: and as the earth, to conceive &amp; bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſs, as that which is ever in motion, for the renewing of the glory and fame thereof,: but I doubt not but ſomething in the ſpeech following will give farther light to this point, then now we have time to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.

Only note thus much; that ſuch Doctrine as ſets forth a time to come, of more worth and glory then either is, or hath been; ſuch Doctrine keeps the</hi> Manna <hi>till to morrow, to the breeding of wormes in it: Yea it hath in it that worm that dyes not for if Chriſt our Paſs-over be eaten according to the law of the ſpirit, there is nothing to be left till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: And if it be the bread that comes downe from heaven, it muſt be compleatly eaten at preſent, and there wil be no want to morrow, for it fals anew, &amp; afreſh, otherwiſe the word of God, that food of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is corrupted, by reſerving that for to morrow, which belongs to this preſent day: and in the ſixe dayes labour, in the operations of God, we have plenty to feed on; In the ſeventh, as a ceſſation from all our own works, keeping a perfect Sabboth unto God, ſo that the kingdome of Chriſt is to be declared, and whole poſſeſſion and preſent enjoyment given, and yet it is a Kingdome to come: So that wee have it in expectation as to come, as well as we fetch it up from that eternall eſtate of the Son, to give it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being; for if wee have it not as from the firſt, and to the laſt, we give it not its preſent being, and then uo Kingdome of Chriſt; for no man can make him the firſt and the laſt, that is, eternize the Son, but he muſt give him a preſent being without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a moment of time.</hi>

            <head>AN EXPOSITION UPON The Fifth CHAPTER of JAMES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, Obſerve the Coherence and connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of this Chapter, with that which goeth immediately before, wherein our Apoſtle tells us what is the proper ſpirit, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the men of this world, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto us by their ſeeking after car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and corruptible riches, in the neglect of the durable and unfading treaſury.</p>
            <p>Therefore they reſolve in the latter end of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>to goe out into ſuch a City, and to buy and ſell, and get gaine;</hi> that is, to caſt themſelves into ſuch a forme and order, wherein through their exchange and traffique in the things proper to a creeature, they may get an advantage to advance themſelves as ſuch as are more excellent and eminent then others, and yet in the meane time are ignorant of the event and ſucceſſe of things; <hi>for they know not what will be to morrow,</hi> that is, what iſſue is ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably annexed to their works and endeavours:</p>
            <p>For he declares unto them, that they are as uncertain of the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue as they are of their life, <hi>which is but as a vapour,</hi> or as a breath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118751:9"/>
(as the word ſignifies) that vaniſheth in the ayre and comes to nought: So uncertayne is every carnall man of his owne ſpirit what it is, or what will become of it, <hi>though it grows up with him, and is of him, and he cannot be ſeparated from it;</hi> yet knows he not what it is, nor the thing whereby he maintains it; being the very vaniſhing of the life and ſpirit of the Son of God, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations and wiles of that Serpent and evill one, of whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſpirit and practice he himſelf is, preferring things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to carnall ſence of greateſt excellency and moſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas they ought to ſay, if the Lord will we ſhall live and do this or that;</hi> that is, the thing to be ſought after, is the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>law</hi> of God, even <hi>that law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> whereby we live and receceive ability to do every good and acceptable thing.</p>
            <p>But contrarily, <hi>they glory in their boaſtings;</hi> that is, they glory, rejoyce, and make it their only treaſure to praiſe themſelves, as the word <hi>boaſt</hi> ſignifies; that is, they count the things proper to the creature to be their chief treaſure and excellency, and not the things of the Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All ſuch rejoycing</hi> or <hi>glorying</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is evill;</hi> that is to ſay, is of that evill one, namely the Devill.</p>
            <p>Whence he infers, <hi>That he that knows to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſinne;</hi> that is, he that cannot but acknowledg that the things that are of God, which fade not, nor vaniſh away, are the chiefe and principall good to be deſired and ſought after, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved above the things of the Creature, and accordingly to be rejoyced and gloryed in, in the poſſeſſion of them, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he chiefly prefers and glories in the things of the Creature more then they; this is the ſin of the world, that idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Creature, and ſetting it in the place of the Creator, which is <hi>not to do,</hi> or <hi>not to be;</hi> that goodneſſe that is of God, but is properly the evill of that wicked one: For who knowes not that it is good to ſeek after, and to have erected the beſt Citie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be poſſeſſed of the richeſt treaſure; to be encamped in the ſtrongeſt Hoſt, to be inveſted with the wiſeſt Councell, and to be honoured with the moſt Princely dignity.</p>
            <p>And yet who is it, that prefers, and principally endeavours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in all his travells and negotiations, that order compoſed of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118751:9"/>
God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>that Citie of the living God,</hi> the chiefeſt and moſt eminent order that ever was, who is it that trades for thoſe treaſures conſiſting of thoſe divine and ſupereminent excellencies compiled and topped up in that inexhauſtible Store-houſe of the Sonne of God: and who is he that imbodyeth himſelfe in that Army conſiſting of <hi>that hundred forty and foure thouſand following the Lamb on mount Zion,</hi> bearing the flagge of their Fathers power and authority written in their fore-heads, openly proclaiming their courage and magnanimity to be of God, and not of man? and where is he that prefers, and is found in <hi>that generall Aſſembly of the firſt born of God,</hi> as the choiſeſt counſell and moſt grave advice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, having an equall Royalty and intereſt in all things that concern the government of the Kingdome, and of <hi>that Citie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a foundation, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, put all theſe things together, and whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and eternally good, <hi>in that one Chriſt of God,</hi> who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and alſo the Center to which all things tend and ſtand on tip-toe to ſtretch themſelves unto him, that are of God.</p>
            <p>And who is he that knows not that Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who is God bleſſed for ever,</hi> is the chiefe and moſt deſirable good to be gloryed in, and yet do it not, <hi>ſuch are concluded under ſinne</hi> by the verdict of the ſpirit of God in our Apoſtle; that is, ſuch as know the beſt thing is to be preferred and ſought for, though with the neglect and loſſe of all other things <hi>(as he that found the pearl in the field, &amp; ſold all that hee had to purchaſe that field)</hi> even ſo he that cannot but confeſſe God to be beſt of all, and yet prefers his traffique in ſome other things before his attaynment of that, yea cauſing the things of God to ſtand aſide and give way to his vaine and lofty luſts (of what nature or kind ſoever) to ſatisfie them: That man doth not the good which he acknowledgeth, or as the word will beare, <hi>he is it not;</hi> that is, he is not of the faith of Jeſus, he is not ſtated in the condition of the Son of God, who ſeeks only to do the will of the Father, and prefers and glories in that above all things; and he that doth not that, he is of that evill one, and doth the things that are proper unto him, being under the ſtate and power of ſinne, which is as a tranſition into the fifth Chapter.</p>

And he that ſhall take the ſcope and driſt to be otherwiſe, he miſſeth of that mark which the Spirit of God directs unto, and ſhoots his ſhafts in vaine, and this death is layd down unto us, and for us in a double reſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the parts of this Chapter, and they are properly four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt ſets down unto us, the death of Chriſt as he is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the world, <hi>by wicked hands,</hi> or corrupt adminiſtrations through the luſts of men, unto the decay and death of <hi>that law of the ſpirit of life (which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord)</hi> in, and by the men of the world, as once the body of Jeſus was crucified and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led doctrinally, by thoſe wicked Jews and all ſorts of people then united in one, and this is contained from the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It containes the depth of the Lord Jeſus, as he is crucified to the world in reſpect of the fleſh; that is, to all carnall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt things contained in <hi>the law of the carnall commandement, and hand writing of humane Ordinancs which is againſt us, and therefore nailed unto his Croſſe:</hi> And thus he is ſlaine in the Saints, even in all the Subjects that appertaine and belong to his Kingdome, which conſiſts not of the matters and affaires of this preſent world, and this is expreſſed from <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. to the 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It gives out an eminent and univerſall Prohibition, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an exhortation, together with the danger enſuing the not obſerving thereof, and that is contained in <hi>verſe</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It ſets beforre us, or rather romidgeth our hearts to finde out in us, and to bring forth by us thoſe excellent and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruits which ſpring up in the godly from the death of Chriſt, and obſervation of the prohibition aboveſaid.

            <p>And firſt of the death of Chriſt, as he is crucified in the world, in reſpect of his proper ſpirit and vertue, &amp; that by wicked hands and adminiſtrations both of Jewes and Gentiles, that is, ſuch as are ſtrict in Religion according to the literall command and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall notion, being engaged thereto by that ſpirit of bondage, and of fear, and others looſe and licentious, not having the bond of the ſpirit of God upon them.

               <p>OUr Apoſtle here expreſſeth himſelfe to the wealthy of the world as rich men, or collectively (Rich man) as of all in one; that is, <hi>man of Sin,</hi> or <hi>men of Belial,</hi> who greed and gripe after all manner of good (falſely ſo called) in the neglect of that one and alone goodneſſe in Chriſt, <hi>that one thing neceſſary,</hi> that better or beſt part, which can never be taken from him, who chooſeth it as his chiefe and only treaſure.</p>
               <p>But to make choiſe of, and to rejoyce and glory in, as an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rich trade and treaſure beſides that, is to ſtiflle in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuffocate the life and ſpirit of the Lord Jeſus, which is thereby extinct, and in them breaths not.</p>
               <p>He bids them therefore, <hi>Go too now,</hi> or come on, as if he would encourage them in their courſe. A like phraſe is uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. at the building of <hi>Babell, Go too now,</hi> or come on; give a word of exhortation and encouragement one to another for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of your worke: As if he ſhould ſay, Take your liberty, uſe your accuſtomed trade and traffique to get and gather in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of your corruptible riches, that moth and ruſt can ſeize upon; and ſpare no pains, miſſe of no opportunity to make your ſelves excellent, and glory in it; only with this proviſo, namely that you will aſſure your ſelves of the income and proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, together with your adventure, and this your practice, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that condition, take your beſt advantage, and full ſwinge in your courſe, for the juſt reſiſts you not, as is expreſſed, <hi>verſe</hi> 6.

For the Goſpel of God is not a hinderer of wickedneſſe in the men of <hi>Belial,</hi> no more then the ſop which Chriſt gave to <hi>Judas,</hi> together with his ſpeech thereupon, <hi>What thou doſt do it quickly,</hi> hindered him not in the execution of ſo trayterous an office; for <hi>it is a ſavour of death unto death</hi> unto the unbelievers, and of no leſſe power to accompliſh it, through that ſpirit which is in the world, then it is of vertue to be a favour of life unto life in the Saints through that ſpirit which is in them: And it is as unpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that one member of that body of ſinne ſhould come to the knowledg of the truth, as it is that any one of the choſen of God ſhould be deceived with errour and wiles of Sathan, which Chriſt affirms <hi>it is unpoſſible they ſhould be deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as Chriſt keeps his family intire and compleat, <hi>So that none of them is loſt but that ſonne of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</hi> in point of wrath proportionable to grace and mercy, which ſonne of perdition (comprehending all the children of deſtruction) was loſt once and for ever.</p>
               <p>Even ſo doth <hi>Antichriſt</hi> mayntaine his intereſt in all the ſeed of the Serpent, and parteth with none, only that <hi>loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, as a brand is plucked out of the fire,</hi> being found to be one of the flock of God once and for ever.</p>
               <p>No marvell then, though our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Go too now,</hi> unto the wicked and wealthy (in point of Phariſaical excellencies) for as the ſtate of death and darkneſſe diſcovered by the Goſpel, doth ſharpen and provoke the godly unto joy &amp; thankfulneſs for their deliverance and eſcape therefrom: Even ſo doth the ſtate of life and peace diſcovered in the Saints by the ſame Goſpel ſharpen &amp; provoke the wicked to enmity and deſpair, which is the expelling of the ſpirit of God, &amp; <hi>quenching the ſame</hi> in themſelves: Therefore he bids them <hi>weep &amp; howl for the miſery that cometh upon them;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and by weeping he ſignifies unto them the departure and loſs of all good, even that life of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>whom they crucifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh unto themſelves, and make a mock of him,</hi> in whoſe life all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is treaſured up, and comprehended, which unto them <hi>is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as a vapour;</hi> therefore he bids them <hi>weepe,</hi> for the loſſe of good cauſeth tears: and by howling, he minds them of that preſent wrath and torture which abides upon them, and poſſeſſeth them; which however it may lye as <hi>Dormant</hi> for a time, yet this ſin of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118751:11"/>
killing Chrſt in the Spirit, is the ſame with that of <hi>Caines</hi> killing his brother, and lies at the door, as the proper and only in-let of the deluge of Gods wrath into the ſoule, and indeed into the world.</p>
               <p>For it cuts off the Sonne of God from being propagated and brought forth in the world, according to the ſpirit and power proper to himſelfe: as that wicked act of <hi>Cain</hi> cut him off from being brought forth in his geneologie after the fleſh, in the way of <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſo makes a nullity of <hi>Schin,</hi> that makes all things, and therefore muſt have all guilt in it, which is the doore and in-let for execution of vengeance: Therefore he adds, <hi>for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that ſhall come upon you;</hi> or as the word may be read in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenſe, <hi>is come upon you;</hi> For in theſe twain, that is to ſay, in the loſſe of all good, and the poſſeſſion of all evill, perfect miſery and wretchedneſſe doth conſiſt. The word tranſlated <hi>Howle</hi> in the Hebrew is <hi>Shadad,</hi> and ſignifies to deſtroy; of which <hi>Zadai</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, a title given unto God ſignifying power, or Almighty; and here is an elegant alluſion unto the etymologie of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall phraſe uſed by the Prophets, ſignifying unto us, that no leſs then Gods Almighty power is exerciſed and put forth to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, in the ſcattering and deſtruction of all ſuch as ſtifle the Son of God in the breathings of his holy Spirit in themſelves, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring &amp; glorying in other things before it; or as it is in others, by vilifying, contemning, and perſecuting it, whereupon the next phraſe is brought in, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>By twaine there, is not meant creature and creature joyned together, but God and the Creature are become one in that way of the harlot; that is, they are become one carnall, corrupt, and ſinfull eſtate; for there is as neere a unity between God and man, in that man of Sin unto all unrighteouſneſſe, in prophaning all the holy things of God unto deſtruction, in which the holy one is cleare from being a proper actor or agent in any of them all, as there is in Chriſt that man of God, unto all righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, by ſetting ſinfull man apart to all honour in ſalvation, whereby <hi>being joyned unto the Lord, is made one ſpirit with him;</hi> that is, they twayn are but one holy, happy, and righteous eſtate and condition, wherein man is excluded from being any proper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or actor, as in any thing proper and naturall to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: So that man putrifies and corrupts the Son of God in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe through principles and aptitudes of mind proper to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not unto God, ſubjecting the things of God to the law of the carnall Commandement, naturally ingraffed and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mans ſpirit, which is the law of ſin and death.</p>
               <p>And God ſanctifies and makes holy man in himſelfe through principles and aptitudes proper to the Creator himſelfe, and not unto the Creature, by ſubjecting it to the will of God according to his wiſdome, which is that ſtate of righteouſneſſe, and law of the ſpirit of life, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>The proper riches and excellencies of the world then are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and are become the proper <hi>mammon of iniquitie;</hi> for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may count upon truth to come within the compaſſe of their eſtates and reckonings, to advance their excellencies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, yet it is corrupted unto them, for <hi>they have changed the truth of God into a lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed they lay claime to Jeſus as a Saviour, on whom they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118751:12"/>
hang all their vaniſhing, carnall, and Spider-web like hopes. But he is corrupted, and as a moth in them, being become <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad,</hi> or <hi>Shedim,</hi> a waſter and deſtroyer.</p>
               <p>They monopolize Churches and Congregations of God unto themſelves, but they are corrupted, and are become Synagogues of Satan, and an aſſembly of evill doers.</p>
               <p>For they are no true Church of Chriſt, or congregation of the firſt born of God (whoſe names are recorded in heaven) that ſo expound the word of God, as they can but apply ſome one part thereof as their preſent ornament and furniture, for they may as well (as indeed they do) lay aſide ſome part of Chriſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſo divide him, and make a nullity of him, as to lay aſide ſome part of the word of God, as not in preſent uſe in their dayes, being a garment not holding proportion with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed body.</p>
               <p>But the true Church knowes that the end of the Law is Chriſt, and can tell how to adorn it ſelfe in all ages, with thoſe ancient orders extant in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, as alſo with all the ornaments exerciſed amongſt thoſe Princely Tribes, or Scepters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as under the conduct of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah, Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak, David</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> Chriſt and the Diſciples, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and all Nations.</p>
               <p>Yea, and as under the conduct and miniſtery of that Angelical conſtitution and order ſet forth unto them in that book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that all ſhall harmonize and agree as one joyfull and triumphant ſong, and ſhout of deliverance, righteouſneſſe, and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And when the Sun of righteouſneſſe lends his irradian beames through any of theſe bright clouds of witneſſe, commending it ſelfe unto us in any of thoſe particular wayes of adminiſtration, wherein the Saints of God have been exhaled and gathered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unity and intimacy with the Lord: Yea, when any of the Saints do Evangelize out of any of the fore-named Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they can effectually and aſſumptively expreſs that ſignificant word <hi>Selab;</hi> which in a way of aſſeveration, as alſo of elevation of the ſame thing, affirms it to have a preſent being, and reall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, abiding without any end or ceſſation thereof, of which nature the things proper to the Son of God exiſt.</p>
               <p>And of ſuch nature is the word of God in all its wayes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118751:13"/>
being rightly interpreted; and ſuch as manifeſt and declare it otherwiſe, they may indeed aſſume the riches and glory of a Church, and boaſt of it as theſe do, but it is a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a vaniſhing, and vaporous one.</p>
               <p>Therefore he ſaith, <hi>That their garments are motheaten,</hi> that is, all their honourable Ornaments, wherein the Miniſter for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and deifying of their corrupted treaſure, are inervated, and voyd of vertue; for the very ſubſtance, pith, and marrow of them is conſumed and waſted: ſo that when ſhee put them on to appeare glorious, then their nakedneſſe appears to all men, ſo <hi>as they glory in their ſhame through minding earthly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a gorgeous garment the world puts on in that point of its Miniſtry conſiſting of an imputed Righteouſneſſe, reſident in another, but not in him that confeſſeth it; this garment hath lyen ſo long in that Arke of Tradition, that it is moth-eaten, the ſtrength and vertue of it is taken away, and it was brought out of the treaſury of a carnal Chriſt, who is ſometimes preſent with, and ſometimes remote from his Church. So that in his abſence they are forced to form unto themſelves an imaginary righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for it is a meer <hi>Emedullatus,</hi> the pith and marrow of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is taken away.</p>
               <p>For that righteouſneſſe which is profeſſed out of, or at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, when or in whomſoever that ſpirit appears, is not the rigteouſneſſe of him who is really preſent with, or in his Saints <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> that is, to the ending and vaniſhing of all ſuch worldly and carnall concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the publication of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>For if we give another form to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, differing in the nature, efficacy, or dignity in the profeſſor, from that which it is in the profeſſed, it is not the <hi>righteouſneſſe which is by the faith of the ſonne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as faith is alike reall and reſident in all that come unto God, even ſo is righteouſneſſe, and <hi>He that comes unto God, muſt beleeve that God is;</hi> that is, that he is that to him, or in him, that he comes unto him; for what ever it is, which is that glorious reward or end given, or accompliſhed in all the diligent ſeekers of him; never did any come to God but by faith, for it is the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis, or being of God and man in one and the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for it is ſaid of our ſpiritual <hi>David, He believed, and therefore he ſpake; we alſo believe, and we alſo ſpeake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118751:13"/>
Faith never differed in nature, form and vertue in any, for then it were not of God, but of the Creature, no more doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; for where the righteouſneſſe of God admits of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ſame relation and reſpect, as in point of juſtification, if the man Chriſt or Jeſus ſtand righteous before God, by a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in himſelfe; that is, in that individuall, and the Saints of God ſtand righteous by that which is in another, and not in that individuall juſtified; that is not the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it is not the ſimplicity of him, but is made a compound; Chriſt is made voyd to ſuch.</p>
               <p>Chriſt differs not in any of his excellencies whereever they are in uſe, nor did he ever come <hi>to deny the inheritance between bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> but to ſtate the whole Kingdome entirely as upon one only ſonne, in whom ſoever poſſeſſeth any part thereof, even as the firſt-born of God: but if the world ſhould not go upon mans principles to make one man as a Monarch in heaven, it would harldly maintaine the Monarchies upon the earth.</p>
               <p>But as it is in the kingdome of God, ſo it is in all the things of God, and <hi>his kingdome is an everlaſting kingdome,</hi> and ſo is his righteouſneſſe; but the Doctors of the world have no uſe of their imputed righteouſneſſe; when once their inherent ſanctity is perfected, they may as well put an end to the Kingdome of God, and become companions of the bruit beaſts, as to put an end to the uſe of any thing that appertayns and belongs to the Sonne of God in his Saints.</p>
               <p>We conclude therefore, that imputed righteouſneſſe in the worlds acceptation is a moth-eaten garment, a meer phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall diſtinction of Antichriſt, to delude the world.</p>
               <p>Of like worth is the garment of their ſanctification, wherein they ſo confidently enwrap themſelves, for they hold it to be a holineſſe ſubject to increaſe and diminution; and then it muſt be a creature-like holineſſe, and not a God-like, which is holineſſe of truth, or the truth of holineſſe, which is not found but in the Son of God, which cannot admit of abatements, for that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a creature from whoſe ſtrength proceeds all their power of performances.</p>
               <p>Againe, the holineſſe profeſſed by the world (that is by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men) may have the vertue and office of Prayer in it, but not of propheſie alſo: and it may have the vertue &amp; office of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118751:14"/>
in it, but not the vertue of healing alſo; this is a moth-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten holineſſe, the vertue and power of the Son of God is eaten out of it, Chriſt is crucified in ſuch according to the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>For take away one of the vertues of Chriſt, and they all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, for he is that bundle of life bound up without parting, or any ſeparation: His veſture is ſeameleſſe, and goes all one way by lot and inheritance, whether it be the robe of mercy in his, or the garment of vengeance in them that ſo crucifie him, it may not be divided.</p>
               <p>So that he who denies a Chriſtian to have power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from God to publiſh and preach unto the world the myſtery of ſalvation contained in the Goſpel, may as well deny him power to pray, or to believe, or the grace of remiſſion of his ſins, expreſſed and declared in thoſe glad tidings.</p>
               <p>For the grace of Chriſt is as truly collective in the ſubſiſtance of it, as diſtributive; whoſoever therefore receives freely, that party hath a like vertue alſo freely to give.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>the world (who by wiſdome know not God)</hi> teach by that wiſdome that a Chriſtian may be poſſeſſed with, and have the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the ſpirit of Chriſt, that holy ſpirit of the Son of God, and yet the humane nature of Chriſt not preſent, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſent and remote in another place; theſe men may aſwel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like ground profeſſe themſelves to be members of Chriſt, but not of his body; for of his Saints he ſaith, <hi>Ye are fleſh, of my fleſh, and bone of my bone,</hi> not of another.</p>
               <p>So that the two natures in Chriſt (according to the myſtery of ſalvation in the Goſpel) are of the ſame extent that his myſticall body is, and are co-apparent to the wiſdome of God in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is.</p>
               <p>For the ſpirit of Chriſt never uttered or manifeſted it ſelfe, but as the ſon of ſorry man utters and manifeſts himſelfe in, and by ſuch principles and abtitudes as are proper and peculiar to the living and eternall God, taking their being and form from the wiſdome and power of God, and not from the policie and power of a creature; for without the <hi>Coagulation</hi> of theſe twayn, there is no ſpirit of Chriſt made manifeſt, nor is it in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Therefore to ſeparate the ſpirit of Chriſt from the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, in any of its operations, is to make a nullity of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118751:14"/>
Chriſt, the faith of ſuch perſons is vaine, their holy garments of the Miniſtry are moth-eaten, their righteouſneſſe is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which enter not into the kingdome, and their proper holineſſe <hi>is the purification of the fleſh,</hi> purging themſelves of all the operations of the ſpirit of life, that no ray or beame thereof be found upon them, which a wicked man is as careful of, as the Saints of God are of being ſtained and ſpotted with the fleſh.</p>
               <p>For if we gather not up, and take in true man into all the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations proper to the ſpirit of God, wee diſ-unite and ſeparate that which the wiſdome of God hath ſo curiouſly embroydered and wrought up together; for the ſpirit of Chriſt and of God quickneth only to that bleſſed eſtate and condition of the Son of God, and not to any other; even as a rationall ſpirit filled with artificiall principles to find out the nature and cauſe of things, quickneth only unto that ſtate and condition of man-kind, and not unto the condition of any other creature upon the earth.</p>

               <p>For the juſt and unjuſt are made of like, yea of the very ſame matter, for God and man are really to be conſidered both in the one and in the other, and otherwiſe the true ſtate of life and death canot be rightly compoſed, neither is the goſpel and faith of the Son of God preached.</p>
               <p>For in what tone, ſence, or reſpect man may be ſaid to be in that worke of ſalvation wrought by Chriſt, and participate in

the power and glory thereof; In like ſence may the Sonne of God be ſaid to be, and is in that work of deſtruction, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates in the defect and ſhame thereof.</p>
               <p>For as the wiſdome of God in that way of Chriſt, purifies and cleanſeth that earthly and corruptible nature of man (in its ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it into unity) from all ſin and uncleaneſſe unto a ſtate and condition becoming the Sonne of the holy and eternal God; even ſo doth the wiſdome of man, or of the fleſh (in taking hold of, and ſearching into the things of God) corrupt and defile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or in it ſelfe, that holineſſe and puritie which is in the word, or Sonne of God, unto a ſtate and condition proper and peculiar to that man of ſinne, and ſon of perdition; for <hi>the world by widome knows not God;</hi> that is, through its proper wiſdome and Serpentine policie, is blinded and become ignorant of him: So that there is a true and reall proportion between the miſtery of God in Chriſt, and the miſtery of iniquity in Antichriſt, elſe the ſtate of the wicked could not have in it an Almighty power of wrath and diſpleaſure, as the ſtate of the Saints hath in it an allſufficiency of mercy and love, for the proper Original and fountaine of each is in themſelves, and not in another, that is to ſay, the proper fountaine of love and mercy is in Chriſt, and not elſe-where to be found; and the proper fountaine of wrath and diſpleaſure is in Antichriſt, and not founded elſe-where: So that righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of the word of God, or Sonne of God; <hi>for it is not the word, but in its creating virtue, as it frames it ſelfe in Chriſt,</hi> and this word is canckered in the world; for God and man (in a miſtery) are become a corrupt eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in that way of Antichriſt, directly contrary unto that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riental Gold, and ſeven times purified ſilver that is in Jeſus Chriſt: and that party who is ignorant of the miſtery of iniquity in the corrupting and adultrating of the word of God, may talk of the unity that is in Chriſt Jeſus, purifying &amp; making chaſt mans nature in that word of God; but it is onely as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it by tradition, from Libraries, Councels, and Accademi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal courſes; but the revelation of the ſpirit he knows not, the onely means of the conveyance of the knowledge thereof.</p>

Ruſt we know is the putrifaction and filthineſſe of mettals contracting it ſelfe, and ariſing from the not uſing thereof; even ſo the not exerciſing and putting into uſe the righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of the word of God, that royal law of the ſpirit, is the contraction &amp; raiſing up of the viſion and corrupt deſires of the fleſh, which is the very cancker, ſpot, and ſtaine of the ſoule, that it becoms <hi>reprobate Silver</hi> thereby, not to paſſe for currant to any in the kingdome of God.</p>

               <p>For as the uſe and exerciſe of the law of the ſpirit in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the virtue of Chriſt Jeſus, the contraction and <hi>Emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> whereof, is the ſplendant brightneſſe of Chriſtianity, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all men, that therein conſiſts the crucification of the fleſh in all the affections and luſts of it.</p>
               <p>Even ſo the exerciſe of the law of the fleſh in the contraction and ſending forth of the deſires and affections thereof, teſtifies unto all men that therein conſiſts the crucification and death of Chriſt Jeſus according to the ſpirit, teſtifying an eternal guilt upon an act of ſuch nature as that is, which is of no leſſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then the kiſſing of the Son of the eternal God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It eates their fleſh as fire;</hi> now we know that as ruſt eateth and conſumeth the mettals in which it breeds, ſo doth fire conſume and deſtroy the fuel in which it faſtneth it ſelfe, and taketh hold, <hi>and without fuell the fire ceaſeth; for take away fuel, and the fire goeth out.</hi> Now the proper fuel wherein the wrath of God kindleth it ſelfe, is the wiſdome of the fleſh: ſo that take away that, and the fire thereof goeth out; it is not without that, no more then fire is without fuel, and therefore no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the world is capable of the eternal wrath of God, but onely mankinde, no more then any can be in a capacity of the conſolation of God, but ſuch as are indued with his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>For as the conſolations of God kindle themſelves, and become extant, through that wiſdome of God, which hath given it ſelfe ſo glorious and an eternal forme in all the virtue, relations, and reſpects that are between God and man in Chriſt, without which the conſolations could not be, no more then the eye can ſee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118751:16"/>
without light, or a houſe ſtand without the pillars and joynts of it; even ſo the jealouſie and wrath of Almighty God kindles it ſelfe, becomes extant, and in exerciſe, through the wiſdome of the fleſh, ſetting ſuch a forme on the operations, relations, and reſpects, as are converſant in the ſtate of Antichriſt between God and man.</p>
               <p>For the wiſdome of the creature, or carnal law, is wrath unto execution againſt ſuch as uſe cruelty to the innocent, eſpecially in the higheſt degree; and when the proper operations of the word according to the carnal law are made manifeſt, it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they have exerciſed cruelty againſt the innocent Son of God, &amp; that then in the higheſt degree, in putting him to death in all that livelyhood and operation of his holy ſpirit which is not permitted to exerciſe it ſelfe, or breath in them, whereupon they muſt of neceſſity by that their wiſdome judge, condemn, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute wrath upon themſelves, which could not hold proportion with this their fact; but as the power of God kindles it ſelfe therein, yet ſo as the proper power and ſpirit of God is not any cauſe or original thereof, that is, of their torment, but man himſelfe is the proper cauſe and fountaine thereof, out of which it for ever floweth.</p>
               <p>For as the ſoule of man is kindled and inflamed through the wiſdome of God with the love and conſolations of God, yet the ſoule of the creature is no proper original or fountaine thereof, for they are the love, and comforts of the Creator, and not of a creature, yet is the creature converſant and active in them, even ſo the power and ſpirit of God kindles it ſelfe, through the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh (the literall voice of the Scriptures written in all mens hearts) in wrath and diſpleaſure, and is converſant and infinitely active therein; yet is the ſpirit and power of God no proper original or fountaine of wrath, but the wiſedome and ſpirit of the creature is the proper cauſe and fountaine of it, therefore it is ſayd of the Lord, <hi>fury is not in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt remember then, that when the Scriptures aſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, love, joy, peace, grace, mercy, glory, power, and virtue proper unto the Saints, they are ſuch as God is the fountaine and cauſe of, and not the creature, yet are they the excellency of the Sonne of God, who is not without the creature, though he be <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi>

So likewiſe when we ſee the Scriptures aſcribe unto God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wrath, fury, diſpleaſure, and vengence, which are proper unto the wicked; they are ſuch as the creature is the proper fountaine and original of, and not God; yet are they not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, but are the proper exerciſe of that man of ſinne, and ſonne of perdition, yea of that <hi>Shadad,</hi> or <hi>Shedim,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of man kinde, who is the God of this world; the Prince that ruleth in darkneſſe, which is accurſed for ever.</p>
               <p>And as for ſuch devils, as are compoſed through that conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of academicall Nations, from literall expreſſions of the Scriptures, as connexions of the dictates of their own hearts; we skill not, but give glory to God, both in mercy, and ſeverity, in the exerciſes of them, and ſo the reſt is an infallible teſtimony and witneſſe of the nature and practice of Satan himſelfe the God of this wicked world, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We know that we are of God, and the world is of that wicked one</hi> (as the word is) that is, of the Devill, the off-ſpring and ſeed of the Serpent accurſed from the beginning.</p>
               <p>3.

               <p>For as Chriſt being true, man naturally mortall, is filled with eternal life in the excellency and purity of the Son of God; ſo Antichriſt being true God (in the unity of his creation) immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, becomes filled with eternal death, through the luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of man, for it is whole Chriſt that dyes, and not a part of him, he dyes in the Saints unto ſinne, Satan, and all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118751:17"/>
things: So that when the Prince of this world cometh, he findes not in him to joyne himſelfe with, or lay claym unto, and he dyes in the unbeleife unto all things of the ſpirit, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God; and in this doth that ranſome conſiſt, wherein the Sonne of God hath given himſelfe unto an eternal death to deliver his choſen ones, into that eternal life proper and peculiar to the lord alone.</p>
               <p>His dying unto the fleſh in his Saints, is the life and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in the men of the world; and his dying unto the ſpirit in the wicked, is the life and reſurrection of it in the Saints of God, for neither of them muſt be annihilated; but as man at the firſt was made in the Image of God, and the word was made duſt, that is, in that work of God both the wiſdome proper to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to be found, and that wiſdome alſo proper to the Creator, theſe twain muſt remaine extant for ever; that is, the wiſedome of God extended to the uttermoſt in that curious workmanſhip of the myſticall and glorious body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And alſo the wiſdome of the creature muſt be extended to the uttermoſt in that compoſure of the body of ſin and death, which is only the curioſity of that confuſion in the building of <hi>Babell,</hi> there is a heaping up then, and an abſolute fulneſſe of corruptable treaſures and riches in the wealth of the world. But</p>
               <p>For what is it heaped together? that is, for the laſt dayes: by dayes here is to be underſtood times and ſeaſons, and the word <hi>(laſt)</hi> ſignifies, the leaſt or baſeſt dayes and times, as often it doth in the Scriptures, ſo that this treaſure rightly reckoned, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſummed and caſt up, amounts to the worſt and baſeſt of days, a time wherein the Sonne of God exiſts not, nor is he therein found, a day not of ſalvation but of deſtruction, a ſeaſon of death and not of life; days of ſorrow, and not of joy; baſe times of famine, &amp; not of plenty; of peſtilence, &amp; not of health; of war, and not of peace; times of murther and cruelty, and not of love and freindſhip; days of enmity, pride, and diabolicall policy, and not dayes of that meekneſſe of wiſedome that is in the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>In a word, the heaping together of the fruits of the fleſh as our only treaſure, is to the bringing forth of ſuch times and ſeaſons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118751:17"/>
wherein the policy and power of Satan ruleth, and not the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that is in the wiſdome and virtue of the Sonne of God, unto which ſeaſon the oath of the Angel hath reſpect, <hi>that ſtands with one foot on the ſea and the other upon the earth, and ſwears by him that lives for ever that time ſhall be no more;</hi> that is, with reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that foot that ſtands upon the troubleſome and tumultuous eſtate and condition of that ſea of evils of the world, he ſwares that no jot, nor tittle, time, nor moment of the life or day of Chriſt ſhall ever be found, there he ceaſeth in them for ever, and a baſer time can never be then to be voyd of him, even as that time is moſt precious and glorious, and thoſe onely are halcyon dayes wherein he appears, and Satan, or ought of him is not found in them no not for a moment.</p>
               <p>He ſhews in one particular wherein the baſeneſſe of theſe dayes conſiſts, and that is in the fraudulent detaining and keeping back the hire of the labourer.</p>

               <p>ANd firſt of the note of aſpect, <hi>Behold,</hi> which ſignifies to look up in the obſervation of a ſigne or wonder which is now to appear, and it is of like nature of that of the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> given unto the <hi>Jews</hi> that crucified Chriſt, which was a ſigne of their deſtruction, <hi>in that the Sonne of man was to lye buried three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth;</hi> that is, to be perfectly and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118751:18"/>
perpetually dead and buried in their earthly and carnal hearts, never to exerciſe his life and ſpirit in them, which is a ſigne and wonder that the Son of the living God ſhould be mortallized in them, it is a like ſigne and wonder here, that the Sonne of God ſhould become a hireling defrauded of his hire.</p>
               <p>For it is a like miraculous thing, that the Son of ſorry man, who is ſayd to be a worm, an object, a vapour, a vanity, to be made Lord of Heaven and Earth, Judge of quick and dead, as that he that is Lord, ruler, and poſſeſſor of all things, to become a hireling: So that the myſtery of iniquity is not without ſigne and wonder, no more then the miſtery of God is, and both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; though the one be a lying wonder, and the other a true wonder, the one confirms the faith of God, the other the faith of Devils.</p>
               <p>The one promiſeth ſalvation for the confirmation of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the hardning of his heart unto deſtruction, which is a thing contrary, and therefore a lying wonder, as it appears in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt drowned in the ſea; the other promiſeth ſalvation and deliverance unto Iſrael in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> which brings forth the thing promiſed, and therefore a true and not a lying wonder, as appeared in Iſraels marching triumphantly out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there muſt be in a miracle, or wonder, that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beyond the power of any nature, elſe it is not a wonder, and that is both in the one and the other of theſe miraculous ſignes; for in point of ſalvation by Chriſt, no ſimple nature can bring forth ſalvation, for there muſt be in ſalvation both a Saviour, and a ſaved, elſe it is not full and compleat, which neither the nature of man, no nor the nature of God ſimply and disjunctive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, can be or bring forth: Behold then a wonder in that, which tranſcends and ſurpaſſeth any nature to be or to bring forth, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>that we have a Mediator is made higher then the heavens;</hi> that is, the office of his mediatorſhip is of that ſuper-eminent dignity that no ſimple nature can be, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto, therefore <hi>of twain he makes one new man in himſelfe and ſo creates peace,</hi> which otherwiſe could not be.</p>
               <p>2. Againe there is a wonder in deſtruction, which goes beyond any ſimple and ſingle nature alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:118751:18"/>
For the nature of God ſimply conſidered cannot be involved with the confines of deſtruction, who is almighty and ſupream Lord over all, neither can mans nature ſimply and disjunctively conſidered be in a capacity of an eternal deſtruction, being a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubject to the limits and precincts of time, therefore God &amp; man are to be joyntly conſidered in that wonder and miſtery of iniquity alſo; which properly makes and gives being unto the God of this world, which is no leſſe then Satan himſelfe, who attempts through his arrogating &amp; inſatiable ſpirit to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto Chriſt all the kingdoms of the Earth, and the glory of them: the one of theſe is a wonder, but a lying one, becauſe it brings not forth what it promiſeth, as the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſes is a righteouſneſſe, but not that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the kingdome, and the other is a wonder, and a true miracle, becauſe it brings to paſſe the things it promiſeth, even as the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt enters into the kingdom, and ſitteth in ſafety and honour at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>And they that preach not the Goſpel as accompanied with theſe ſignes in the miniſtry of it, according to the variety of the work propoſed; <hi>the ſpeaking and creating word of his ſignes is not ſent unto that people</hi> for their releaſe and deliverance out of the houſe of bondage, and yet it is true, that tongues are for a ſign not to them that beleive, but to them that beleive not, that is, an unbeleiver, ever expects that a ſigne ſhould ſpeak in the ſame form which formerly it hath done, or elſe he takes it not for a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrought by God, but then there ſhould need no interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church at all, without which tongues are not of uſe, unto edefying.</p>
               <p>The worlds expectation of ſignes to accompany the preaching of the Goſpel for the confirmation of it in the ſame forme as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, is the expectation of Infidels, ſuch as follow Chriſt to be fed with carnal things, bread that periſheth in the uſe, like them that after they had been fed miraculouſly with the loaves and the fiſhes they perſue and follow him to have a ſigne that he is a man of God, and conclude that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man of God, that could give bread from heaven, but this not coming in like for me, but from the Earth, though in that wonderfull multiplication and increaſe, is as nothing unto them.</p>
               <p>But the ſigns, wonders, and mighty works accompanying the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118751:19"/>
grace of the Goſpel never appear twice in the ſame forme, ſo that a man may as well expect the water that now bubleth up in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſwift running fountaine, to tarry and abide for him, till his return to it againe, as to fit down by a wonder wrought by God till it appear in the very ſame forme againe; it coming out of that inexhauſtible fountaine, and ſwift running current of that infinite variety of his wiſdome and power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> miraculouſly faſted forty dayes and forty nights, and is in the mount with God, and hath in that faſt the law the perfect pattern of all truth and holineſs preſented and ſhewed unto him, and againe Chriſt faſted forty dayes and forty nights, but was in the wilderneſſe among wilde beaſts, and therein had the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, the proper platforme of the power of darkneſſe repreſented unto him, which differs much from the pattern of ſalvation and kingdome of light. <hi>Eliah</hi> alſo faſted forty dayes and forty nights, but was miraculouſly fed before; in the ſtrength of which food he went into a cave by the mount of God, and there had apparitions &amp; voices manifeſted unto him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God made himſelfe manifeſt, and alſo ſuch wherein God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not at all; one forty dayes faſt, not but in variety of wonder; one death of Chriſt, but a diverſe ſigne in it, he is ſlaine at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and our Lord is alſo crucified in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> true in both, with reſpect to fleſh and ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the word <hi>Behold,</hi> implying a wonder, wherein obſerve the deceitfull ſleights and cunning devices of the Magiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the <hi>Jannes and Jambres of our dayes,</hi> who have erected (for the confirmation of Princes great ſignes of honour and Godlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity) Kings Chappels, and pulpits of State, State-prayers, and ſtate-like officers in the Church for forming of them, that they may carry their virtue by whomſoever uttered, ſtate-religion and ſtate-like pompe in the exerciſe of it, as though the Kings of the earth ſhould be thereby declared to be, not onely the off-ſpring of the almighty, but the deputed Gods.</p>
               <p>In what doth the ſucceſſe and iſſue of theſe Doctors indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors end in, differing from thoſe Magiſſians in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the confirmation and incouragement of their King, firſt born and his alies.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond point is, who the <hi>Labourers</hi> are, or the <hi>Labourer,</hi> for the word may be read either ſingular or plurally, as it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118751:19"/>
in Scripture to uſe words of active and paſſive ſignification, as alſo ſuch as may be read either in the maſculine or feminine gender, without wrong to the Text: ſo alſo ſuch as will beare either the ſingular or plurall number, and ſo it is in this place.</p>
               <p>To take the word therefore in the ſingular acceptation, it is Chriſt collectively conſidered, in that one intire and myſticall body of his, comprehending all the Saints in all ages of the world.</p>
               <p>Againe, take it plurally <hi>(Labourers)</hi> and it is Chriſt diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed, and given out in all the parts and members of that body; for he is that Labourer or Husband-man that ſowes good ſeed in his field, though the evill one ſow tares in the time of his ſleep, or when, and where he is dead to all things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is in that evill one only upon whom they grow.</p>
               <p>He ſowes with his owne hand, as he is that one fountaine and giver out of the ſeed in all ages, <hi>yeſterday, and to day, and for ever the ſame.</hi> And his ſeedſ-men ſow alſo, as he is a participator and the receiver thereof; for he receiveth the ſpirit though not by meaſure, for it is <hi>immence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third point is, what the labour is in reaping down the fields: By reaping here, is not meant cutting downe, but in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering alſo, as the word-imports. Chriſts reaping therefore is the cutting downe of all thoſe riches, and ripened fruits of the fleſh, thoſe ſuperfluous branches from the true Vine, that they be not found in the field; or upon that hand of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which elſe-where is ſaid to be <hi>the crueifying of the fleſh in the affections and luſts, and the ſlaying of the enmity in himſelfe,</hi> which are the proper in gatherings of the worke; and that whereof their harveſt and Vintage doth conſiſt, whereby <hi>their regions become white unto the harveſt;</hi> that is, it ſets them in a capacity to be cut downe by an eternall deſtruction, and in theſe the labourer is defrauded, <hi>who hath ſpent his ſtrength (in them) in vaine, or unto emptineſſe, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for nought,</hi> as he complains by his Prophet (or in the Prophet) <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> In them he hath loſt his time, as a labourer hath who is deprived of his hire, for his time and age is not extant in them; the time of grace is expended, the day of ſalvation is not found in them, his generation is ceaſed in them, and is no more: even as a labourer hath loſt his time, ſo ſpent as no fruit nor profit ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; <hi>For he is cut off from the land of the living,</hi> (in the world) <hi>and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118751:20"/>
hath made his grave in the wicked, and in the rich of this world is his death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Son of God hath expended his life in Antichriſt, unto no fruit or profit of the Spirit, but unto corruption; as the Son of man hath expended his life in Chriſt, unto no utility or fruit of the fleſh, but unto purity and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>4. Therefore in the fourth place, they are ſaid to keep back his hyre; the hyre of a labourer is to return unto him a reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his worke. The word <hi>(hire)</hi> ſignifies to gather together, as a Maſter gathers to himſelfe a ſervant to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one to another by contract, which the world in that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the harlot denyes unto Chriſt; for he that is holineſſe gives and unites himſelfe unto them, but they return no ſuch thing unto him but only corruption: He who is love in himſelfe is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited unto them, but they return nothing but enmity: He who is truth gives himſelfe to them, but they return a lye unto him: He who is eternall life gives himſelfe to them, but they return eternall death unto him, and ſo hold no proportion with him unto whom they are contracted, nor bring they forth any thing for his ſupply ſutable (in the leaſt) to his nature and quality: Whereas the Saints make return to God with things which are of God, holding proportion with him, with whom they are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: For <hi>they are increaſed with the increaſings of God;</hi> for <hi>of his fulneſſe we all receive, and grace for grace.</hi> It is the love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts, which is the love by which they make over themſelves in contract unto him, and become Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals together with him, and can ſay with <hi>David</hi> (that beloved one) <hi>All things are thine, and of thine own we have given thee.</hi> Which the world falls infinitely ſhort of, yea is in direct <hi>Antitheſis</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame, therefore they are ſaid to keep back by fraud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or guile, becauſe they give that unto themſelves and things of the creature, which belongs unto the Lord, and things that are of him; they give unto themſelves wiſdome, power, and glory, which is the prerogative Royall of the Son of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding him of his right; for they give their ſons unto <hi>Moloch,</hi> or unto the King; that is, unto the Kingdome and glory of the world, wherein there is as abſolute a change of the word of God from its proper nature and operation to become ſinfull and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall in them, in that way of Antichriſt, as there is of ſinfull
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118751:20"/>
man from his naturall properties, to become that holy Son of God in the way of Chriſt; therefore they that gave their ſonnes unto <hi>Moloch,</hi> that is, to the reign, dominion, and counſell of the fleſh, they are ſaid <hi>to ſacrifice unto Devils, and not unto God;</hi> no greater fraud then to give that to the Devill, which is pretended to be given unto God: and it is the proper work of Sathan to bow the heart to the glory of the creature, whereby hee keeps back, and retains to himſelfe that honour which is proper to the Creature.</p>
               <p>Theſe perſons defraud the Son of God of his livelihood, who only lives by his labour; for where there is no operation and work of Chriſt, there is no life of Chriſt, no work of faith, no labour of love, no patience of hope, no breathings of Chriſt, he is dead in that heart; for the Religion of God is not notionall, but efficatious: The Lord Jeſus lives by his labour, the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauds him of it, detaining it in their own ſinfull and ſelfiſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, whereby <hi>they with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> the titles given unto Chriſt, as of a perſon, King, Lord, Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As of an office, as Mediator, Advocate, Interceſſor: Or of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Father, Husband, friend, or the like, are carefully to be taken up and aſſumed by the Creature as they do concern the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, office, and relation of this life, yet they may be aſſumed in that reſpect, as we <hi>may eate and drinke, marry and give in marriage,</hi> which all periſh in the uſe, provided that they be aſſumed, as we are (to buy) or as we are to marry; that is, <hi>as though we poſſeſt them not,</hi> and as though we aſſumed them not, <hi>for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away;</hi> that is, that which men may form unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be excellent and praiſe-worthy, may at another time, or in another place become odious and abominable, as we have ſeen in the name King, Biſhop, Prieſt, having many wives, and keeping only to one, have been: But to aſſume them, or teach men ſo to do, as things appertaining to the dignity, office, or relation of a creature, not conſidered in Chriſt, but as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns creature and creature, to be the ultimate end, ſcope, and drift of the Scripture in any Title, Office, or Relation whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is ſatanicall and wicked, for the end of the law is Chriſt; therefore the ſcope of them all, and every particular, is God and man in Jeſus Chriſt, and thither it is to be brought, and there centred, or elſe we defraud the labourer, by detayning his due
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118751:21"/>
unto our ſelves, or rather giving it unto Satan himſelfe. In which the cry of the defrauded one doth conſiſt, which is the fifth point propounded in order.</p>
               <p>5. And this cry is the cry of the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> for the exerciſe of wrath in wrong done unto the innocent, whoſe life as it is taken away by force and cruelty of <hi>Cain</hi> that man-ſlayer from the beginning, ſo is it taken away by guile and ſubtilty, defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (by the Serpent) him of the proper meanes of his living, which is his owne operations, the fruits of that tree of life, by giving the glory and vertue to make wiſe, unto the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of good and evill, which is a preferring the law of the fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the law of the ſpirit, the wiſdome of man above the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>
               <p>For as the wiſdome of God in that law of the ſpirit through its curious device of the joynting of God and man to be one eſtate and condition, carries in it a ſufficient and prevalent argument to move the tender compaſſions and bowels of mercy therein, as in an only beloved ſon; even ſo the wiſdome of man in that law of the fleſh, craftily inſinuating the glory and power of the arm of fleſh, to be the glory and power of God, giving unto it what is only proper to God, hath in it a ſufficient acclamation and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to move the exerciſe of Gods wrath in the ſoule, as in one that is guilty of an infinite deceipt of Serpents ſubtilty.</p>
               <p>Yea, as that life-blood of ſprinkling, of the Lamb ſlain accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, in that houſe of the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> ſtruck upon the door-poſts and Lintels thereof (that is, upon all the wayes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and regreſs into, and out of the ſame) hath in it a ſufficient teſtimony and cry of reſtraint in the deſtroying Angel, to cauſe him to paſſe over, as not having any employment there.</p>
               <p>Even ſo the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> ſhed by the cruelty of <hi>Cain,</hi> as a Lamb ſlain from the beginning according to the ſpirit; or by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of <hi>Judas</hi> betraying him with a kiſſe, hath in it a ſufficient cry in the deſtroying Angel, to move the exerciſe of wrath upon the firſt born of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the beginning &amp; top of all that ſtrength wherein they truſt, who cruelly and fraudulently keep back <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> from his advance unto the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The one hath in it the voyce and language of peace, reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and agreement with God as his firſt-born, and onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:118751:21"/>
The other hath in it breach of brother-hood, and fellowſhip, the voyce of a vagabond flying from Gods preſence, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power, as in <hi>Caine;</hi> and wrath unto ſelf-murther and deſtruction, as in <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> that Confeſſor, or Preacher for hire, as his name ſignifies, in whom the word of God (in it ſelfe Lord over all) is changed and transformed into an hireling.</p>

This cry enters into the eares of the Lord; for as there is a certaine propencity in the eare of a man to take in any ſound, that moves the ayre; and to give it a true and proper form, his heart ecchoing the ſame thing, whether it be matter of joy, or matter of terrour. Even ſo there is nothing that moves either in the proper ſphere of Gods diſpleaſure, or of his acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and love: but there is a proper and immediate aptitude in his wiſdome and power to receive and give a true form thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to according to the nature thereof, ecchoing the ſame thing, in returning an anſwerable and proportionable meaſure of wrath or mercy into that heart in which it moves, where he hath place of a boad, either in way of mercy, as man by unity is become the Son of God in Chriſt, or elſe in wrath, as God is by unity alſo become <hi>the ſonne of perdition</hi> in that way of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>

               <p>For God reſts, and there is an abſolute ceſſation of all works and operations proper to the Son of God, in that way of the fall, eating of the forbidden fruit, or exerciſe of the carnall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, in which no vertue, motion, or operation of the ſpirit is found, but an utter and abſolute ceſſation from them all; and ſo the earth is ſayd to enjoy its Sabboths, by Gods laying of it waſt from its inhabitants, and in this condition the operations of the fleſh and power of Satan are found, and frequently in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, God reſteth and ceaſeth from labour; for we never underſtand the name God in a good and proper ſence, but with reſpect unto God in Chriſt, <hi>by whom the worlds were made:</hi> and in

him God reſts, and there is an utter and totall ceſſation from all the works of ſin and death, fruits of the fleſh, and operations of Satan, which mans nature is ſubject unto; there is a perpetuall reſt, ceſſation, and ſabbatizing in the Son of God from them all: but there is a moſt glorious operation of the ſpirit, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work of the Son of God in that eſtate and condition of Jeſus Chriſt, who is that reſt that yet remayns in the people of God, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>hitherto the father worketh, and I worke;</hi> and therefore the word <hi>Saba,</hi> in the Hebrew tongue, ſignifies either <hi>Sabboth,</hi> a <hi>Reſt,</hi> or an <hi>Hoſt</hi> or <hi>Armie;</hi> and ſometimes the Apoſtles in <hi>Greeke</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>Lord God Almighty,</hi> to declare that there is an Almighty power of conqueſt in whomſoever the reſt is found, for there is an Almighty power of the whole hoſt of Satans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in conquering and ſubduing the ſpirit and vertues of Chriſt in themſelves, reſting from them all.</p>
               <p>And there is an Almighty power of the ſpirit of grace in that Army of Heaven, and order of the Son of God, in vanquiſhing and ſubduing of all the power of ſin and Satan, unto that perfect reſt which ever remayns in that only and beloved Son of God.</p>
               <p>And truly, the world may as well preach the temporall ſword to be the Reſcue, Reformer, and Conſervation of the Church, as the beſt and greateſt Councell, Synods, Synodrians, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies that ever were, or can be gathered together only in the ſtrength and power of humane learning, wiſdome, experience, and policy; for in ſuch the Lord is in array, as an hoſt, and in reſt and ceſſation; but it is to do that work, that ſtrong worke of wrath not proper to the Son of the bleſſed, whereby he reſts from all his owne operations as the enſuing words do declare.</p>

If ſo, then are they earthly, becauſe they fade and vaniſh as the flower of graſſe.</p>
               <p>Nay the order of your Churches and Elderſhips, the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inſtitutions of your Oracles and Orators, will theſe ſtand with the Aſſembly and Church of the <hi>firſt-born of God, whoſe names are enrolled in heaven,</hi> where every one hath a like ſhare, and equall right to all the offices, orders, and priviledges of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? if not, they are earthly, compoſed by the miniſtery of the letter that kills, and not by the law of the ſpirit of life.</p>

Can you tell what uſe to put them unto in your profeſſed world to come? I tro not; for, for any thing that ever I could learn from the common Prieſthood of theſe dayes, they have no uſe of the imputed righteouſneſſe of the Son of God, when once their ſanctification is compleated; nor of their faith, when they have attayned the end of it, which they ſay is at their coming to heaven; nor of prayer, when they ſhall need no more to converſe with, or have ſupply of the things of this preſent life: and are not theſe carnall and vaniſhing then, as held and practiſed by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of our dayes, together with their followers and Pupils; where then ſhall we find the men that take not their delight, and place their pleaſure in earthly and vaniſhing things, whoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not vaporous.</p>

Whereas the truth is, there is nothing of Chriſt which hath not the nature divine in it, or elſe it is not an ordinance, act, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, or vertue becoming the Son of God who in all things is holy and pure, and there is no holineſſe without the ſpirit of God; therefore they may as well hold and teach that the ſpirit of God vaniſheth, and comes to an end in the Saints, as that any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Office, Act, Exerciſe, or Vertue of Chriſt vaniſheth and comes to an end in any of his myſticall body.</p>
               <p>For if the unity of the Spirit ceaſe in them in any reſpect, then the wiſdome and power of the Spirit ceaſeth, and then that new Commandement, or law of the Spirit is abrogated, and made voyd, which the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>is true in him, and in us, becauſe the darkneſſe is paſt, and the true light ſhineth,</hi> which is the ſubſtance of the Law in every point and particular of it: And where the light of God once ſhineth to expell darkeneſſe in us, it ever abideth, yea in that imputed righteouſnsſſe, or righteouſneſſe reckoned together with us in faith, prayer, or whatſoever, it abides firme and ſtable, as the Son of God is firm and ſtable.</p>
               <p>And as for eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, with all things of like nature tranſient, having an end, they are no proper parts of the Kingdom of God, nor any thing whereof it doth conſiſt, but are uſeful in their time and ſeaſon to the Saints of God, and may be exerciſed with a holy reſpect unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for the promoting of it; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatſoever yee doe, let all be done to the glory of God.</hi>

               <p>Therefore when they asked Chriſt that queſtion, <hi>whoſe wife ſhe ſhould be in the reſurrection, who had had ſeven husbands;</hi> his anſwer is, <hi>that they erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the reſurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the Angells of God in heaven;</hi> Therefore it follows,</p>

                  <p>And howſoever there is in the godly man, that which is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made within the bounds and precincts of time, yet that unity is eternal, becauſe in whatſoever the unity doth conſiſt is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God who is eternity, and not of the creature which is in time; if it be love, it is the love of God, and not of a creature; if wiſdome, it is of God and not of man; if it conſiſt in power, it is infinite and not finite, ſo that that ſtate and condition of God and man in one is eternall and not temporary, it lives the life of God, it walks and works by the wiſdome of God, and not of the creature.</p>
                  <p>We know the body of man hath life and wiſdome as well as the ſoul, while it is in conjunction with it, not another, but the ſame that is in the ſoule, much more hath the ſoule of a chriſtian life and wiſdome, in and of God, and not another, ſo long as it is in conjunction with God, which is for ever, or elſe his Sonne, his proper off-ſpring ſhould not inherit and be poſeſſed with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the father.</p>
                  <p>If the mortalliſts of our dayes knew the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, they could never conclude like beaſts, that the ſoule of man dyes with the body like a beaſt, for God is not onely in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the ſoule as a worker and Creator, but hee is alſo one in the workmanſhip which is made, for the Son of God is as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be <hi>made of woman,</hi> and <hi>made under the law,</hi> as he is ſaid to be the Lord and maker of all things.</p>
                  <p>And it is the Image or wiſdome of God that gives being and forme unto that glorious workmanſhip of God in man; ſo that if the ſoule dye, there is not a nullity of the work, but alſo of the Creator the maker of it, who gives the proper being and form to the work by that which is of himſelfe and not of a creature, for it is his Image or wiſdome which is the being and form of it, as the reaſon and underſtanding of a man gives being and forme to a man, and unto no other creature.</p>
                  <p>Without which wiſdome and Image of God the workmanſhip of Chriſt never was, nor can be, for it never was but in that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,

life and wiſdome of God, and without unity with God nothing can be eternall.</p>
                  <p>And however theſe men are ignorant of the ſtate of the Son of God, yet they ſhall know that their ſoules are eternized alſo, and that onely by unity with the Almighty and eternall God, but in the way of the harlot, in adulterating and falſifying the word of God, and that in the way of the myſtery of iniquity as truly as Chriſt is in the miſtery of God, or is that miſtery of God, for the myſtery of the Goſpell conſiſt wholly in him.</p>

                  <p>And as it is the greateſt ſhame and abomination for man not to bury his dead (his own kind) out of ſight, when his nakedneſſe doth appeare, being diſroabed of all humane abilities, even ſo it is the abhomination and ſhame that the world glories in, to keep that great body politick of humane wiſdome unburied in the Churches, which it that which gives form and being to all their temporary Inſtitutions and Ordinances, which is as voyd of life proper to the wiſdome and ſpirit of God, as a dead body is when the ſoule is departed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore cannot move nor breath out the reality of the being of that eſtate both of the juſt and unjuſt, to be as truly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning as without end; for the world doth not eternize the Son of God by that common of trinity in unity, and unity in trinity in the divine eſſence, for he is not Chriſt that annointed ſon of God, but as he is conſidered in both natures; nor is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wiſdome, or work of God (beſeeming himſelfe, who is infinite and eternal) extant, but in that workmanſhip of Chriſt; for it is true, that as the ſeed of man propagates not his kind, but as conſidered in male and female, even ſo the immortall ſeed of God produceth not his off-ſpring, but as conſidered in God and man in Chriſt, therefore they have killed the faithfull and true witneſſe, the head and top of the creation of God, by not giving him the reality of being from eternity; therefore he is ſayd to be one <hi>that was dead and is alive;</hi> or as the word is, he <hi>is</hi> dead in the preſent tence, as in the wicked, and <hi>(is)</hi> alive, that is, in the Saints; for the word tranſlated <hi>(was)</hi> is the ſame where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle faith, I <hi>(am)</hi> an Apoſtle in the preſent tence.</p>
                  <p>And here let us adventure to inſert a word of the nature of the unity between God and man, which eternizeth the eſtate both of juſt and unjuſt, ſeing there is in both mans nature which is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary made and brought forth in time, being a reall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per creature,</p>
                  <p>For the unity that is in Chriſt which is a being joyned unto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118751:27"/>
the Lord and becoming one ſpirit, or one myſtical and ſpiritual eſtate and condition together with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Conſider with me, that there is in the eternall an aptneſſe to do, or to be, and a proper principle or fountaine from which he doth, or is ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>For doing, and being the thing done, are conjunctive, never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, but where the one is, there is the other; to do the law of God, is to be the law of God, and ſo the Saints are a law unto themſelves, as well as the profane Gentiles, the one not having or doing the law of the fleſh, no more then the other hath or is the law of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>God therefore is apt, and prompt to know, to be wiſe, prudent, to debate, determine, and conclude, to love, to pity, to have compaſſion, to be at peace, to be kinde, joyous, and ſalvation; but he doth, or is theſe from that principle or fountain of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and bounty wherein hee communicates himſelfe unto another in the being and exerciſe of them all, wherein is ſuch infinite fulneſſe; that that which is proper unto the principles and practice of a creature, is ſuperfluous in every one of them.</p>
                  <p>So that in whatſoever a chriſtian is united unto, or comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with God in, it is properly and originally of God and not of the creature, as his Sonſhip is of God, and not of the proper off-ſpring of man, being begotten not of mortall, but of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſeed, ſo are all the lineaments of God and man in Chriſt, if wiſdome joyne; <hi>the Tabernacle that God builds, and not man,</hi> it is the wiſdome of God; if love make the contract, it is the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart, and not the love of man which is enmity with God; if faith eſtabliſh the heart that it wavour not, it is the faith of God, which <hi>is the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> wherein conſiſts the great work of God which is in beleiving; as Chriſt tels him that asked, <hi>what ſhall I do to work the work of God? beleiue</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for therein it conſiſts;</hi> for it was <hi>by the work of faith that Abraham was juſtified,</hi> and not by that vaine or empty faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works; that is, without the preſent power and operation of God, for ſuch faith the Devil may attaine unto, <hi>who beleives there is one God, and trembles,</hi> but doth not conſiſt in his power as made one of twaine in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:118751:27"/>
So that whatſoever is in this unity, is properly and originally of God, and that from a principle or law of his bounty and goodneſſe whereby he communicates himſelfe unto another in all things, which that law or goodneſſe of his nature is apt and prompt to be, and to do, whereby he forms himſelfe in his Son, without whom, or out of whom, he never had being, took form in any will or law, nor put forth himſelfe in any operation, therefore it is ſaid (ſpeaking of Chriſt, God and man) <hi>all things were made by him, and without him was nothing made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if ever God had had being, or motion, ſo much as of minde, and will out of man, it had ever been ſo, and then ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not been, the Saviour had never appeared; for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on canot be compleat, but in him that ſaves, and is alſo ſaved; and the Almighty never was, but as he is <hi>a God of ſalvation,</hi> yea in the plurality thereof as the expreſſion of the Pſalmiſt is, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſt therefore canot be fathomed, nor ſpanned out no more then the beginning of the Almighty and eternall can, though there be that in Chriſt which is in time, yet he takes not his proper being from that, no more then man, takes his proper being from his body, but from his rational ſoul and ſpirit, which inliveneth, acteth, and moveth the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And in the one and the other doth the glory of the Sonne of God exiſt; for God working in and by the faculties, or aptitudes to do in the ſoule, or ſpirit of the creature, thereby his vertues and operations come to be diſtinct, and ſo full of variety of glory, being the ſpirit and life of the creature, conſiſts in change of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or operation, alſo here the works of God have their proper times, ſeaſons, and opportunities, which in the proper and ſimple eternal could never be.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, as man works not by the principles and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the creature, but by thoſe that are proper to God, denying himſelfe, being reſigned over unto God, and ſo all his operations become of an eternal race and virtue, and are in the true and reall account and reckoning of eternity, of ſuch nature is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sonne of God, therefore the Prophet ſaith, <hi>who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his age;</hi> he is the firſt and the laſt, if he never end in being laſt, he never had beginning as he is the firſt, but is from eternity to eternity, though that be in him which is temporary in it ſelfe, even as mans body lives and underſtands, though of it ſelfe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118751:28"/>
it hath, nor doth either, as appears when the ſoule is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, concerning the unity of Harlots, <hi>for he that is joyned unto an harlot is one fleſh;</hi> that is, one carnall and corrupt eſtate, in which all the ligaments thereof are ſuch as properly the creature is the originall and fountaine of, and not the Creator; how then can this unity be eternall, when the proper bond is of that which is mortall and temporary.</p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer, that there are certain faculties or aptitudes to do, or to be in the ſoule of a man; as alſo a law or principle by which it is, or doth ſuch things, and for the aptitudes to do or to be: We may ſafely ſay, that whatſoever the Almighty is prompt unto; that through the ſublimity and excellency that God hath made the ſpirit of a man to be of, he is prompt unto the variety of operations and excellencies that are in the Son of God, yea even to compaſſe the earth, and comprehend all things, and find out the cauſes, relations, and operations of them; yea, even to eternize himſelfe on the earth, by calling his lands by his name, by living in his poſterity; by ſome great work wrought, or monument ſet up to memorize him unto poſterity and ages to come; yea doubtleſſe ſome Stateſ-men and Politicians of the world are apt to lay plots and platforms how to bring about, accompliſh, and achieve things, which they know can never be done in their dayes, that their wiſdome and policy may live and be in uſe when they are gone: and of ſuch uſe, and from ſuch aptitudes come humane Chronicles, writing of bookes, or the like, to reach to eternity, which God only wiſe is. So that man works in, and by the aptitudes of God, but not from that law and principle proper to the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>For whereas God out of that law of bounty and goodneſſe of his nature communicates himſelfe in whatſoever he is apt to do, and be, whereby he doth it, and is it in the creature.</p>
                  <p>The creature exerciſing it ſelfe in the way of mans wiſdome in things which God himſelfe is prompt to be and to do, not by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelfe up unto God to be his, and not his owne, but by that principle of ſelf-love, and law of exalting the arm of fleſh, he arrogates unto himſelfe, and monopolizeth the things proper to God unto himſelfe, aſcribing them unto the things of man to beautifie and to ſet up the things of the creature thereby, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118751:28"/>
and giving unto the fleſh that which is proper only unto the Son of God, which <hi>is a turning of the truth of God into a lye; a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the glory of God into the image of a corruptible man; and a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſerving of the creature inſtead of the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We conclude then, that as God by that <hi>law</hi> of grace exerciſeth himſelfe in all his excellencies in the aptitudes of mans ſoul, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with himſelfe ſo, as the things of eternity come to be diſtinct, to have their proper ſeaſon, time, place, yea and perſon, ſo as the Saints are truly diſtinct, and the operation of their faith, as the Apoſtle amply declares in that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 11.</p>
                  <p>So alſo that man of ſinn, through that carnall law exerciſeth himſelfe in the aptitudes of God, filling them with the things of the creature, ſo as they become unmeaſurable, not bounded by any time or ſeaſon, but take in the vaſt ſpace of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo the ſtate of the wicked is alſo evelaſting in that ſon of perdition, as well as in that Son of God, and yet <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit;</hi> but both perpetuated, of like race, in reſpect of time in the ſight of God, and all that judg and diſcern according to the ſpirit of God; for as it is affirmed of that eternall word, that it was in the beginning. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it is affirmed of the wicked one, <hi>that he is a man-ſlayer from the beginning, and not to abide in the truth, but is a lyar, and the father of it.</hi> There is therefore a change, and a reall change in Satan, for the truth of God is turned into a lye in him, but it is <hi>in the number and act of his being:</hi> ſo that it is as true and reall, that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver otherwiſe, and therefore he is ſaid alſo to be <hi>the fountaine and father of it,</hi> as he that is ſo originally, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> that high Father, and ancient of dayes, is ſayd <hi>to be the father of the faithfull,</hi> as the originall and propagator of them all.</p>
                  <p>And without this unity of the harlot, proſtrating and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the word of God unto the luſts of men, Satan is not known, but works in and by, and is converſant with man, and man knows it not.</p>
                  <p>It is true alſo, that there is a change, and a reall change in Chriſt the ſon of the bleſſed, for mans nature is changed from
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118751:29"/>
its viſioſity and vanity proper to the wiſdome of a creaeure, to become the undefiled of God in the bleſſing and reality of ſon-ſhip: but this change <hi>is from the manner, inſtant, and eternall act of his being:</hi> ſo that it is as true that he was never other but that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled and reall ſon of God bleſſed for ever, with reſpect to time paſt, and that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>So that the Son of God is never alive in the ſpirit, but Satan is dead in and to him; nor is Satan alive in the fleſh; but Chriſt is dead in, and to him, and by his ſlaughter the world nouriſheth its heart, and feaſts it ſelfe; ſo that the mortification of the ſpirit of the Scripture, or word of life, is the revivall of the letter, which becomes the proper nouriſhment of the carnall minde, which is that ſtate of death, <hi>for to be carnally minded is death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So alſo it is true in Chriſt, that the mortification of the fleſh in the abrogating of that carnall law of ſin and death, is the ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Leviathan Sea-Dragon, or man of Sin, <hi>who is given to be meate for Gods people in the wilderneſſe;</hi> that is, it is the revivall of the ſpirit which becomes the proper nouriſhment of the ſons of God, and is <hi>that bread from heaven that periſheth not, and food of eternall life which abides for ever:</hi> And as food becomes one with that body that feeds upon it, in the nouriſhing of it, ſo doth the ſpirit and life of the living and eternall God, become one ſtate and condition in that man of God, and myſticall body of Chriſt Jeſus our alone Lordſhip and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>And ſo alſo doth that ſpirit of death and deſtruction, in that the truth of God is turned into a lye, become one ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in that man of ſin, that vile body and myſtery of iniquity, wherein that eternall death only conſiſteth, and remayneth for ever. In the next verſe he declares who it is they have killed, and the manner of it.</p>

               <p>To condemn implies the giving of ſentence, as by law, for there muſt be a diſcerning wch is by a rule, or elſe ſentence cannot paſſe; and every thing hath its proper and peculiar law, whereby it ſeeks to effect, the conſervation and ſafety of of it ſelfe in its proper condition: and where the wiſdom of the fleſh and carnall mind gives the proper being unto the condition, it hath a certain law, bond, or engagement upon it, in way of argumentall and legall reaſoning for the ſafety and conſervation of it ſelfe in its own principles and achievements, and to condemn and ſentence whatſoever makes for the bane and overthrow of them, and unto that ſtands bound and engaged in it ſelfe, as to its ruler or god.</p>

Now the Croſſe of Chriſt in the crucification of the fleſh, and order of that law of the ſpirit, doth confound humane wiſdome in the way of its being, and all its enterprizes, making it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per folly of the world, for it is written; <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdome of the wiſe, and will caſt away the underſtanding of the prudent: Where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world? hath not God made the wiſdome of this world fooliſhneſs?</hi> Therefore the wiſdome of the fleſh or carnall law, doth bind over, under penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of deſtruction of it ſelfe, to convent, arraign, convict, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and paſſe a finall ſentence upon the Son of God, that law of the ſpirit of life, otherwiſe it cannot reteyn and conſerve it ſelfe: So that we may as ſoon (and with better acceptation) perſwade a rationall and ingenuous ſpirit, to lye downe and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſake the nature and activity of his wiſdome, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a beaſt of the dulleſt capacity, as to perſwade a carnall mind where the ſon of peace is not, upon the true and proper conditions of the Goſpel, to become a ſon of God.</p>
               <p>It is no marvell therefore <hi>though the world love their owne,</hi> and hate ſuch as are taught of God, condemning ſuch as juſtifie the words of wiſdome, which only ſets forth the folly of the world, or elſe it appears not: <hi>And they only love the works of darkneſſe, and dare not come to the light, leaſt their deeds ſhould be diſcovered.</hi>

2.

               <p>For how can a King appeare, but by vertue of his inaugurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or a Prophet, but by or in the ſpirit of a Prophet: Or what is a Prieſt, if he have not ſomewhat to offer? for he cannot be a Prieſt without. Chriſt appears not, but by vertue of inſtitution and commiſſion to execute, perform, and do the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; therefore he ſaith, <hi>I come not to do my owne will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to inſtitute temporary Ordinances, and offices vaniſhing and fading, not holding correſpondency with the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, it is to deſtroy and thruſt out the proper ſpirit and authority of Chriſt, as it not having a being in the world.</p>
               <p>For to frame an Office or Ordinance of Chriſt, and not to have the ſpirit of Chriſt, is to deſtroy and aboliſh unto themſelves that myſticall body of Chriſt, even as a naturall body deprived of the ſoule that gives it life, is thereby aboliſhed and turned to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider then how to form Ordinances, and eſtabliſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Officers of Chriſt; for if they have not in them the ſpirit of Chriſt, they will prove no better then thoſe legall and Jewiſh ſervices taken up from <hi>Moſes,</hi> as repreſenting the letter of the Scripture, and accordingly practiced in the dayes of Chriſt, by <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, Scribes, Phariſees, Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and the whole body of the people, who cryed out, <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him, away with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When water in the River or Pond hath the ſpirit of life from God in it, then we ſhall count it as an Ordinance of Chriſt; when bread and wine on the Table have the ſpirit of mortification of the fleſh, and quickning power of the reſurrection of Chriſt in them, then will they prove ſpirituall Ordinances of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the ſon of the living God.</p>
               <p>For there is no office, exerciſe, or ordinance proper to the kingdome of God, that is voyd and deſtitute of the holy ſpirit of the Son of God, who is that great ordinance of God in whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular is wrapped up and infolded, and not one of them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118751:31"/>
barren, or deſtitute of the ſame ſpirit of life from God; otherwiſe all Ordinances and offices taken up from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, are of the ſame nature of thoſe taken up from <hi>Moſes</hi> in Chriſts days, and ſhall prove of the ſame effect when ever Chriſt appears, for the one ſtands upon the proper letter of the Scripture as well as the other; and Satan can alledg the Scripture to back his temptation, as well as Chriſt doth, for the confounding of him. Now if the ſpirit and life of ſuch Ordinances depend upon the Prieſts and Elders, the Inſtituters and Conſervators of them; why ſhould they then contend with thoſe which they call Papiſts, but joyne hand in hand as being one with them.</p>
               <p>Let us remember therefore, that If we bereave the body of the proper ſoule and ſpirit of Chriſt, we aboliſh and deſtroy the Juſt one, and turn him to corruption unto our ſelves.</p>

The next poynt is the demeanor of the juſt: <hi>And he reſiſteth you not;</hi> that is, he doth not ſtay or hinder your project &amp; violence from execution, he doth not detain nor keep back himſelf from you, but patiently ſuffers himſelf to be diſpoiled of all his vertues and excellencies in you, which are the native and proper opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Son of God, ceaſing from his own work in you, that you may take your full ſwinge in that which is proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall unto you, as to exerciſe your pride and policy; <hi>your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities &amp; powers of darkneſſe, your ſpirituall wickedneſſes in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to the Prince of the power of the ayre.</hi> That whereſoever any heart is empty and deſtitute of she ſpirit of God, hee inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates himſelfe to be the fulneſſe of it; that according to that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wickedneſſe, the wrath of God may finde fuell to kindle it ſelfe upon, and ſo he freely without reſiſtance layes downe his life in the wicked as a ranſome, that he may take it againe in his Saints, and in them live for ever: And ſo much for the death of Chriſt according to the ſpirit in the men of the world, <hi>who cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie afreſh unto themſelves the ſonne of God, and make a mocke of him.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="2">2.

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:118751:32"/>
The word tranſlated <hi>patience,</hi> is the ſame, where the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I John even your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdome and patience of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or in the Kingdome and <hi>under-abiding</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, as the word is truly rendered; that is, a ſuffering of the loſſe of all things carnall and tranſitory, through that Princely power of the ſpirit that reigns in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that ſo Chriſt his ſuffering in the fleſh may be as full and compleat as that in the ſpirit, that ſo the form of the Cherubims on each end of the Mercy-ſeate may anſwer one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, from between which the Oracle of. God ever utteteth it ſelfe, and elſe-where expreſſeth not it ſelfe in the Sanctuary; and hence is Chriſt ſaid to come, or ſpring up in this place, and that is the third point unto what this ſuffering tends, and whereunto it ſerves, and that is, <hi>to the coming of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The word tranſlated <hi>coming,</hi> ſignifies to ſpring, grow up, or aſcend, teaching us hereby, that this is the way of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, and his aſcention into all ſpirituall and heavenly glory; for he gives himſelfe unto death, in reſpect of any life of the ſpirit, being, or exiſting in the world, or any glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his preſence in point of his divine grace, ever to appeare there, that is, in the wicked: and this is as a compleat and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable ranſome, whereby he purchaſeth unto himſelfe miſerable and fraile fleſh in that way of his Saints, to be poſſeſſed for ever in the power of his ſpirit in all the fruits of righteouſneſſe, being cloathed thereupon with the glory of the ſons of God, and heyrs of his Kingdom; this patience therefore is to the coming of the Lord into unity and brother-hood with fraile man.</p>
               <p>The argument then ſtands thus: If Chriſt ſuffer death in the ſpirit in the men of the world, freely giving up himſelfe thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to without reſiſtance to an eternall ſeparation of his ſpirit, and glory of his power, from that which he himſelfe is (namely man.)</p>
               <p>Do you in like manner ſuffer your ſelves to be deprived of all the excellency &amp; glory of this world, and freely lay down your life in reſpect of any living thereunto, without reſiſtance; for it is not unto ſeparation or departure, but to the ſpringing up and coming of the Lord, that you may aſcend into that which he is in himſelfe, namely into the ſtate and condition of an only ſon.</p>

Let the world take notice, that if the Son of God give it its full ſcope without reſiſtance, to ſet up and exalt it ſelfe in riches, power, policy, and all wantonneſſe and laſciviouſneſſe, what a ſhame is it to the world to deny him liberty and freedome in his Saints, to exerciſe himſelfe in all his vertues, offices, and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſpirit in his houſe and kingdome, but they muſt be judging him to be factious, ſeditious, pernicious, erroneous, and blaſphemous, and that by ſuch as are moſt properly ſealed up unto carnall and humane principles in Schools of humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo as they dare not give an Expoſition upon the word of God, but ſo as it may be conſonant to the rules of humane Art, unleſſe they receive it at ſecond hand by ſome approved Author, that paſſeth for currant in the ſtate where they live. While the world walks, and works in this ſphear, we ſhall ſee nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſons of the mighty, but meerly <hi>Babels</hi> confuſion. For the moſt curious Artiſt deſtitute of the ſpirit of God, exerciſing in the word of God, brings forth the greateſt confuſion; for he is bound to preſerve and maintayn the fleſh, which in all poynts luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and is contrary thereunto: So that it is the diviſion of language, for his tongue is divided from God in all expreſſions, if hee be underſtood according to his true intent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The amplification follows by an elegant alluſion to a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, with reſpect to his ſeed-time and harveſt.</p>

               <p>Now the Husband-man is the Son of God, who ſowes good ſeed in his field: But the enemy in this his ſleep of death, unto the ſpirit in the men of the world (or man of ſin) ſowes tares, for it is the word of God that is ſown in the world; but being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and formed by the would, compoſed of the principle and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of humane wiſdome, which hath in it the very characters of the letter of the Scriptures, which is the compleat form of the law of ſin and death (even as the wiſdome of the ſpirit hath in is the compleat form of the law of the ſpirit of life) and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

In the former, Chriſt is brought in as an hireling in his death in the ſpirit here, as the Husbandman, or Lord of the harveſt, in his dying unto the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Whence we obſerve;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a like wonder and miraculous act and deed, for the ſonne of God to be made an hireling in the world, or kingdome of men, as it is for the ſonne of man</hi> (Enoch, <hi>ſorry and baſe man, made of the earth) to be made Lord of the harveſt, ruler of heaven and earth.</hi> Let this be the only uſe of it, to carry newes to all men, that he that knows not the myſtery of the one, cannot unfold the <hi>Chidah,</hi> that hidden matter or riddle of the other; for the ſpirit of <hi>Joſeph</hi> can interpret the dream of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Baker, as well as that of his Butlers.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The husbandman waites;</hi> The word implyes a wayting, as an over-ſeer, to give things their due, and to keep from harm; hee tarries and abides by his field to ſee that nothing be wanting, nor that any tare be pluckt up to the hurt or diſadvantage of the corne, but will have them grow together till harveſt.</p>
               <p>Whence we obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there can be no true and acceptable diviſion made betwixt wheat
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118751:33"/>
and tares, juſt and unjuſt, but by the perfect growth and ripeneſſe of them both; the man of God muſt be brought forth unto perfection, ſo alſo muſt the man of ſinne.</hi> Yea, the ſeed of God ſown in that great field of the world, not in one age, but in all ages thereof; as alſo the ſeed of the Serpent, or tares ſown by that evill one, muſt be opened unto the full meaſure of ſin, and righteouſneſſe in the one, and in the other, <hi>or elſe no man can rightly divide between the precious and the vile.</hi> He cannot pluck up a tare otherwiſe, but he hurts the wheat; for no man can ſcant a wicked man of the fulneſſe of ſin, but he beſmears the Juſt one, that holy one of God, with what hee keepes back from the wicked; for if it be not brought unto the wicked, as to its proper ſeate in its perfection, it is left unto the Son of God, as he yet abiding under it. This Lord of the Harveſt therefore waits as a carefull and diligent over-ſeer, that no ſuch great inconvenience and evill befall his field, or hinder the right and joyfull in gathering of his harveſt.</p>
               <p>They therefore that go about to gather in the wheat, or binde up the tares, before they be waiters and over-ſeers unto fulneſſe and perfection of both, that they can truly ſay, the harveſt is come, <hi>which is the end of the world</hi> (namely of all worldly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Saints) theſe are thoſe unskilfull ſervants which know not the mind of the Lord, nor is their enterprize accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>He waits for the precious fruits of the earth,</hi> and tarries and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides to preſerve all things in order and place, to the appearing of them, which are the abundant and fruitfull exerciſes of mercy and juſtice, which ſpring up in the juſt and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe are they which the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes of, when he ſaith; <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, juſtice and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> For theſe are both alike innocent and guiltleſſe, precious, and of like difficulty to be found out, as they are gathered together, and exerciſed by the wiſdome and power of God, who thruſts in the ſickle of his wrath and diſpleaſure, as well as of his love and good will, when the regions are white unto the harveſt in the one reſpect and in the other.</p>
               <p>For it is alike precious thing in God to redeem and deliver the elect by man; and yet to free man in point of his own proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ability from being any cauſe or furtherance in the work
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118751:34"/>
thereof, as it is to condemn and deſtroy the wicked by the Son of God, and yet to free God in point of his own native properties and operations from being any furtherance of the work thereof, and without both the one and the other of theſe brought to light, the words of wiſdome are not juſtified.</p>
               <p>In the one, he that glorieth (or as the word is) praiſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it muſt be in the Lord, for the boaſting of all fleſh is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p>In the other, he that is ſhamefully diſhonoured and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is only in man, for the Son of God is moſt glorious and excellent for ever, and moſt precious fruits of juſtice and mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from each of them.</p>
               <p>In the one, the Lord alone is our ſalvation and our ſtrength; and in the other, <hi>Oh Iſrael, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The fourth point is, the time of waiting, and that is with long patience.</head>
                  <p>The length of this <hi>patience</hi> is anſwerable to <hi>the long ſuffering of God in the dayes of Noah,</hi> who ſuffered himſelfe to be mortified, in reſpect of all ſpirituall and holy things in <hi>Cain,</hi> even as <hi>Abel</hi> was by him ſlaine, and put to death; for in <hi>Cain</hi> the life of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe never appeared, for he was deſtroyed in his ſeed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, in that reſpect never to live; onely none is to put him to death, nor diminiſh him in his living unto the fleſh, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he lives to this day, <hi>in thoſe that wander in the way of Cain,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth, and ſo <hi>Abels</hi> blood ſpeaks wrath in him untill now.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Abel</hi> is never to live after the fleſh, nor bring forth an off-ſpring in that way, and yet ſpeaks in that voyce of faith and life of Chriſt in <hi>Seth, that ſet one in his ſtead,</hi> of whom Chriſt came as an offering acceptable, and of ſweet ſmelling ſavour before God for ever.</p>
                  <p>This patience then hath the length of eternity in it; for he that cannot expect the reception, and riſing up of theſe fruits at an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diſtance, as freſh and new in exerciſe and execution, as though they had never taken being before, both in mercy to the godly, and in terrour to the wicked; he can never perceive, nor rightfully enjoy the preſent being of the one nor the other.</p>
                  <p>For if we look upon them according to the dimentions which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118751:34"/>
God gives unto them, then are they to come unto eternity, both the deſtruction of the wicked <hi>in our ranſome,</hi> as the ſalvation of the juſt in their purchaſed poſſeſſion, and they are both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent in that act of expectation, even as the Son of God is one that is, and is to come: So that in patient waiting, we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, and in preſent poſſeſſion we patiently waite, elſe things are not looked upon, as having God in unity, but only as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in relation to Creature: but the Apoſtle teſtifies, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in wayting for the Promiſe, had the preſent enjoyment of it, and that as the father of all the faithful, who only inherit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and in no other way, and thence he brings in the next point</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Which is the fifth in order, and that is the meanes of receiving of them, and that is the early and the latter raine.</head>
                  <p>This early and late raine, the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> calls it <hi>the firſt rain in the ſecond,</hi> implying that the reality of them both is in one act, as the Son of God is ſayd to be <hi>the firſt and the laſt,</hi> and yet but one Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now we know, that in point of husbandry the firſt raine gives properly the ſeed to put forth root downward; and the ſecond, or letter raine cauſeth <hi>to put forth into blade, eare, and full or ripe corne in the eare:</hi> Therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, that the eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the houſe of <hi>Judah ſhall take root down-ward, and bring forth fruit upward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the rooting which the Saints give both unto juſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt is from eternity, otherwiſe we give them not the proper meanes of their growth; for the Pſalmiſt affirms that <hi>the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew of Chriſt is from the womb of the early morning;</hi> and the ground hereof is (as hath been ſaid) becauſe the eternall is in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore he is ſayd to be <hi>a dew unto Iſrael, that he may caſt forth his roots and branches, and grow as a lilly:</hi> and as the root goes down into eternity in point of time paſt, elſe no proper meanes of growth, ſo the branch in the height of it, and full corn in the eare, to the ripeneſſe of it, is unto eternity for time to come, elſe hath it not the perfection of its growth.</p>
                  <p>And it is an act of like nature in faith, and of like neceſſity to ſalvation, to give it ſelfe a being from eternity, as to give it ſelfe a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118751:35"/>
being to eternity; and hee that miſſeth in the one, and ſinneth in the other for his eternity to come, is but from tradition. For without the fetching up of himſelfe from the one, and ſtretching out himſelfe unto the other, he hath not the proper and eſſentiall being of a Chriſtian, therefore Chriſt is deſcribed in whomſoever he appears, to be he <hi>which was, and which is, and which is to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note here, that the miſtake of this point is the ground of all that deceitfull doctrine at this day ſo acceptable in the world, namely that ſuch excellent times, and alſo miſerable dayes and places have been, which are not now to be found in the world, as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> conſidered both in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in <hi>Aegypt</hi> alſo; and ſuch excellent times are to come, as were never yet attained unto, as in that new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> calling of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> or Chriſt coming to reign a certaine ſpace on the earth, as the ſole Monarch of the world, taking the letter of the word in which death conſiſts, to be their proper guide and directory, whereas the proper ſcope and intent is, by an hiſtoricall narration of things which have been, to fetch up things of an eternall nature, to give them a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and reall being both in juſt &amp; unjuſt, from a time ſo early, as none can ever deſcend beneath, to preſent it otherwiſe: And alſo when the Scriptures ſpeake in way of Propheticall prediction of things that are to come, men take occaſion thereby to carry us up in a phanaticall conceipt; to look after that which never yet was, whereas the ſcope is to fetch down things that reach unto eternity to give us the preſent enjoyment of them, which never any can get beyond, or climbe higher; this deceitfull ſpirit of, was, or will be, but is not in preſent exiſtence, could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the preſent appearance of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But if he be truly made manifeſt, it is a torment unto them, and they ſay in heart, <hi>he comes to torment them before their time.</hi> But to conclude this point, we affirm that preſent precious fruit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with patient waiting for, is the proper inheritance of the promiſe, containing both ſowing and in gathering in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; and to ſeparate them, is to divide Chriſt, who is ever in unity, and never without the ſayd reſpects, whereupon he brings in the next words as an inference.</p>

               <p>The earth brings forth ſufficient for its inhabitants in one year, but it hath not ſpent its virtue, but hath a new glory and ſtore brought forth the next alſo, continuing its virtue and ability therein from the beginning; and ſhall we think that ever the Sonne of God ſhall be ſo comprehended and graſped up together in his glory and virtue, that he hath it not to bring forth a freſh, both in mercy and juſtice, as though it had never before appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; not ſo, for <hi>in his preſence is ſociety, and fulneſſe of joy;</hi> that is, perfection thereof at preſent; <hi>and at his right hand are pleaſures for evermore;</hi> that is, a delightfull and pleaſant renewing of them for ever.</p>
               <p>Note here, that thoſe perſons, that preach a defect and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Chriſtianity, they ever hold a time to come when there ſhall never be more attained, though not at death, yet at the day of their carnallized judgement, which is all one, as to hold that the Sonne of God may be exhauſted and drawn dry in reſpect of his virtues, as though he were not that living fountaine that runs afreſh for ever, or as though the eternall were wrapt up in the

bounds of time, and that infinite were now become fioite, this is the glory and top of ſuch mens religion, that teach or hold an imperfection in the ſtate of Chriſtianity; and it is only tradition that keeps them from preaching it in Chriſt alſo, for otherwiſe they know not his perfection.</p>

               <p>And it is <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> that is, it is a plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of that which yet appears not; for he never appears but he hath a new manifeſtation of himſelfe yet to come, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Sonne of God would waxe old; and <hi>that which waxeth old, is ready to vaniſh and paſſe away:</hi> but he abides for ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decay, like <hi>that old commandement that is from the beginning, and that new commandement</hi> that is ſtill to come, and ſpring up afreſh in all that are intreſt therein.</p>
               <p>Againe, we are to be eſtabliſhed in this in like manner, that there is the preſens being of wrath in the wicked, and likewiſe to come, as though it had never yet been; for <hi>he that believes not, wrath abides upon him already;</hi> yea and it is the wrath to come alſo, and therefore <hi>there is a fearfull expectation of wrath in the wicked,</hi> for <hi>there is a hoarding up of wrath,</hi> as having ſtored up the perfection of it, and <hi>it is againſt a day of wrath and revelation of the juſt judgement of God,</hi> which is likewiſe to come.</p>

                  <p>By Lord here, is meant the Lord Jeſus, and by coming is meant his grouth or ſpringing up in his perfection: The word <hi>draw,</hi> ſignifies the continuation and extention of a thing to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as in the Pſalms, <hi>draw out thy loving kindneſſe to them that know thee,</hi> or extend and continue thy loving kindneſſe to them that know or acknowledge thee, to be what indeed thou art.</p>

                  <p>The argument then ſtande thus; that if the Son of God, who is before all time, yea from eternity, and is that <hi>Lamb ſlaine from the beginning,</hi> hath (notwithſtanding) extended and drawn out himſelfe to be kindred unto you, and become one with you in the neareſt affiance and unity that can be, raiſing up himſelfe in you <hi>as Lord and King,</hi> yea <hi>as Prince of peace, being your preſent exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lordſhip, and authory in your immediate condition,</hi> if no time hath intervened, no ſtate ſwallowed him up, no Saint ſo ingroſſed him to himſelfe alone, no perſecution prevented, <hi>nor Princes of this world crucified the Lord of glory ſo;</hi> but that he hath drawn out himſelfe from eternity in reſpect of time paſt, to become one with you in the neareſt bond, as to be but one condition together with you; one faith, one love, one wiſdome, one joy, one ſtrrength, and authority, one rule and lordſhip, yea one exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>THe word brother in this place, comprehends not onely the brotherhood of the Saints of God as in the next verſe where he adds, <hi>my brethren;</hi> but alſo a certaine relation in brother-hood which is between the ſaints and men of the world, ſet forth unto us in that between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> which the Scripture ſo often expreſſeth, and alludeth unto, <hi>Was not Eſau Jacobs brother, ſaith the Lord, yet I have loved Jacob, and hated Eſau, and have laid his mountaine waſt, and his heritage for the Dragons of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Chriſt ariſeth and is brought forth, out of as near a kinn with the men of the world, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was unto <hi>Eſau</hi> his brother, who had <hi>both one father, even Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>one mother,</hi> being both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118751:38"/>
                  <hi>at one going in of Iſaac to Rebecca,</hi> as the Apoſtle reports un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even ſo Chriſt and Belial, God and the Devill, ſpring out of one act of union, and conjunction of God and man, which muſt of neceſſity have in its divine wiſdome and humane, elſe God and man are not exiſting therein.</p>
               <p>For the wiſdome of God tranſcends all creatures, and it is the excellency of man-kinde, that his wiſdome tranſcends all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the earth beſides himſelfe: So that without the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the wiſdome of a creature, the creation of man is not, for he is made in the Image of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the propagation of the Sonne of God, there is the wiſdome of God, ſubjecting and proſtrating mans wiſdome unto it ſelfe, which is the bringing forth of Chriſt the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Alſo the wiſdome humane ſubjecting and proſtrating the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God unto it ſelfe, as the Serpent did the wiſdome of the woman, who was made in the Image of God, is the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Antichriſt the ſeed of the Serpent the ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>So that it is God and man conceived and brought forth by the wiſdome of God, which is Chriſt the Sonne of God, the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of man-kinde.</p>
               <p>And it is man and God conceived and brought forth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principles of humane wiſdome; that is, Antichriſt the ſonne of perdition and that deſtroyer of man-kinde.</p>
               <p>So that they are one in conjunction, and unity of God and man in the root, as near as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were in that one act of generation, but in the ſpringing up, and perfecting of them, they are as different and at as great a diſtance as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were, in thoſe two nations of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Edom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here note with me (my good freinds) that man cannot be known (no not that man of God) nor yet that man of ſin, in a ſimple act of creation, without reſpect unto generation, nor in one ſimple act of generation, without reſpect to that act of creation.</p>
               <p>For as it is in nature, that all the wiſdome in the world, in the act of mans creation, cannot expreſſe or ſet forth his multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and continuation, on the earth, but with reſpect unto
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118751:38"/>
the act and virtue of generation; nor can it in the act of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſet forth and declare mans beginning and originall but with reſpect unto that act of creation; even ſo no man can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach Chriſt in that work of creation as <hi>we are Gods work-manſhip created in Chriſt unto good works,</hi> but with reſpect unto the act of generation, as <hi>he is the ſeed of the woman begotten and borne of a virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can he be truly known in the act of generation, but with reſpect unto that act of creation, as the ſpirit of God carries up his geneology, <hi>which was the ſonne of Seth, the ſonne of Adam, the ſonne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the wiſdome of God, and the wiſdome of a creature, are both in the unity; which is as that unformed <hi>Chaos,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but Chriſt is onely propagated according to the wiſdome of God, and Antichriſt is generated by the wiſdome of a creature, which is the giving of every thing a forme and virtue out of that confuſed and deformed <hi>Chaos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that without generation, creation hath no off-ſpring, and without creation, generation hath no beginning or origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Son of God is voyd, without the one, and the other, and ſo is that Son of perdition.</p>
               <p>Note therefore, that in that unity or act of creation of God and man to be one workmanſhip, there is a kindred between Chriſt and Antichriſt, as near in all reſpects, as that of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> conſidered in that lawfull contract and act of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in that act of conception and ſpringing up, according to the wiſdome of God, and the wiſdome proper to a creature, there is that infinite diſtance and diſproportion, as is between <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> Chriſt and Antichriſt, the ſon of God, and the ſon of perdition: Our Apoſtle therefore doth with good advice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Saints of God not to grudg againſt the men of the world, and that in the relation of brethren, ſaying</p>
               <div type="part">

in that way of ſin and death, Gods wonderfull device for the in-let of wrath and execution of juſtice in the world, and know that without that way of deſtruction, ſalvation had never been.</p>
                  <p>For if the Son of God had not beene made ſin in our nature, and yet ſo <hi>as not to know ſin,</hi> that is, never to approve thereof, or be ſtained therewith in the leaſt, for never was guile found in his mouth, being that <hi>Immaculate</hi> and ſpotleſs Lamb of God, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pure, without ſuperfluity or defect: So that his nature in whatſoever is proper unto him, is free from all guilt and ſtaine, although he be found in a true ſence in that condition which is ſinfull.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe our nature had never been made <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God in him;</hi> for whatſoever is proper and naturall unto man, knows no ſuch righteouſneſſe, nor can it approve of, or be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therewith; therefore can wee never receive and accept thereof, but with the loſſe and denyall of all things proper to the nature of man, as conſidered in that off-ſpring of the earth, which he is changed and renewed from by the wiſdome and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, being <hi>turned from darkneſſe into light, fram Satan unto God,</hi> a change which all the Saints participate of; therefore <hi>can no fleſh boaſt,</hi> for by this meanes <hi>boaſting is excluded,</hi> our owne works are utterly renounced.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo, the Son of God is become darkneſſe in the men of the world, as abſolutely as man is made <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> therefore it is ſaid, <hi>that if the light which is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe:</hi> For if that which makes light be become darknes, there is nothing left to cure that darkneſſe: ſo alſo if mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is in it ſelfe is darkneſſe, <hi>be made light it ſelfe in the Son of God,</hi> as he affirms of the Diſciples, <hi>that they are the light of the world</hi> (the ſame that is ſayd of himſelfe) what is it that can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire or diminiſh that light.</p>
                  <p>So that as wicked men <hi>have changed the truth of God into a lye,</hi> and have <hi>changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man,</hi> ſo they have <hi>changed the light of God into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And herein Chriſt hath given himſelf as <hi>a ranſome compleat,</hi> and every way proportionable for ever, unto that condition which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118751:39"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Grudge not therefore brethren</hi> (by unity and contract in creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) one againſt another, though in act of conception, and ſpringing up from that one <hi>Embryon,</hi> or formleſſe ſubſtance, you become thus un naturalized and divided into two Nations in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect antitheſis one to another, quarrell not againſt the work of God herein, but admire his wiſdome, who hath hereby brought to paſſe our ſalvation, by the ſtopping of the mouth of all fleſh, that glory may for ever redound to him, and not to the creature.</p>
                  <p>For it is as voluntary an act in the wiſdome of man to chooſe the way of death, in the preferring of the things proper to a creature, before the things that are of God; as it is in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in Chriſt, to prefer and make choiſe of things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the eternall, before thoſe which are momentany and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, <hi>ſo that the worke ſhall never ſay to the work-man, why haſt thou made me on this faſhion?</hi> For nature would not give in exchange its own nature &amp; diſpoſition for another, becauſe its life and being cleaves thereunto, which the nature of another muſt of neceſſity be death unto it, which is declined by all things.

                  <p>And this is written according to the letter (as all other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is) in every mans heart, and utters it ſelfe (if not ſtifled through deſire of gaine in all merchandizes of the world.</p>
                  <p>Such therefore as have critically brooded upon the Scriptures to hatch a temporary and humane death only, to be the death of Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, telling us of an ayry vertue or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy thereof meerly imaginary; for they know not how any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof ſhould reach unto us through ages paſt; for ſay they, his death was ſo long ago, and but of part of three days and three nights continuation, for whole ones they cannot make them all: and it was only the humane nature that dyed, which is only a ſeparation of ſoule and body, and neither ſeparated from God. By which doctrine it follows, that mans reſurrection and life is only a rejoycing of ſoule and body, without any unity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with God, which is the overthrow and deſtruction of the doctrine of Chriſt, and ſo of the ſtate of the Sonne of God, and of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>For there is as reall a departure from God in the day of the wicked, whoſe ſtate and condition conſiſts of God and man (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118751:40"/>
no eternall wrath) as there is a coming to God in the way of the Saint of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe ſtate and condition conſiſts of God and man, otherwiſe there were no eternall mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; the doctrine of the world therefore teaching a monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Chriſt, and a kingdome bounded by time (at leaſt in point of time paſt) it is of proper uſe to whet and ſharpen the ſpirits of men, to hunt and ſeek after a State and Kingdome of that nature and conſtitution which man exerciſeth, and not the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe men have tyed all ſin originally to one man in the fall (as they by tradition call it) but yet know not how, nor by whom the entrance of ſin came: But carry us to imaginary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſutable to the reſt of their doctrine, neither know they the way of the derivation of it, which is of ſo great concernment.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo they having tyed all righteouſneſs unto one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and individuall man in his reſurrection, compaſſed and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by time, but are ignorant of the way and manner of the derivation of it; for it is whole Chriſt derived, or elſe ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is imperfect and maymed: But the ſpirit of Chriſt (or as ſome mince it) the influence of the ſpirit, without the body compleat, is but a part of Chriſt, the Son of God divided (as by this way of derivation he is) is as ſound a doctrine, as to ſay <hi>Paul</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for you.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point therefore, the work of God in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtate of the wicked truly known and rightly judged of, is of no more diſquiet, grief, or vexation unto the Saints of God, then the work of God in our ſalvation is; no, though our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord Chriſt be ſo given up unto death in them, as never to live in them any more, for <hi>it is our ranſome, the juſtice and equity of the purchaſe payd for the eternall releaſe of our ſoules;</hi> for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God holds firm in all reſpects, wherein the heart of man, or ſubtilty of Satan can put forth it ſelfe; that as there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſalvation free without money, or money-worth, as alſo in conqueſt by force and ſtrength, ſo alſo in point of ſtrictneſſe of juſtice, in giving a valuable and conſiderable price in way of purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit then of grief, vexation and anguiſh, cleaves unto, as it is the proper portion of the brother-hood conſidered in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:118751:41"/>
and not in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> found in Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> or as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, the mount of the Devill, and not in <hi>Horeb,</hi> the mount of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the argument againſt grief and vexation at this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood is added, <hi>viz. Leſt ye be condemned;</hi> that is, fretting, grieving, and vexation at the wonderfull work of God, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and properly is the practice of that Fornicator, and prophane perſon <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he hath ſo luſtfully and prophanely parted with the birth-right, to ſatisfie his corrupt and carnall deſires, bred and begotten in hunting after the things of this life, which is to purſue that <hi>hinde of the morning</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt calls Chriſt) to put him to death, for the glory of the fleſh and of God cannot ſubſiſt and ſtand together.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>(Leſt)</hi> in this phraſe is not uſed as a ſuppoſition, but as a certain affirmation, as where one Prophet ſaith, <hi>leſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah deceive you:</hi> Another expounds it, <hi>Hezekiah doth deceive you.</hi> So alſo where one Evangeliſt reports the words of Chriſt, <hi>Leſt the people faint in the way:</hi> Another repeating it, ſaith, <hi>The people will faint in the way.</hi> So in this place, <hi>leſt ye be condemned,</hi> is, yee are under condemnation whoſoever ſo doth; for that is the condemning ſpirit that frets and grieves at the works of God, which is ever found in the world, who can never endure that way and manner of the tranſlation of the right of inheritance from him which is born after the fleſh, unto him which is born after the ſpirit: but vowes the death of the Son, which ever puts an end unto mourning for the death of the father alſo: now to be condemned, is to be pronounced and held guilty, as to juſtifie is to acquit and make righteous, as the Apoſtle oppoſeth them, <hi>It is God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that juſtifies, who then ſhall condemn?</hi> that is, it is God that acquits and makes righteous, who then can make guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſinfull?</p>
                  <p>To be grieved and vexed then at the wickedneſs of the world, is to be under guilt and condemnation; that is, when men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie and give excellency unto that work of Gods juſtice in his execution of wrath on the world, and rejoyce therein through that ranſome given to reſcue out of that condition, as well as he can be glad of that exerciſe of mercy in that inheritance and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which he is put into, for the glory of God in our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118751:41"/>
ſalvation conſiſts in the one as well as in the other, and is alike glorious, and to be approved of in them both, according to the nature and manner of Gods operations found, and converſant in the one and in the other, and in them both compleat ſalvation is made manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it the proper ſtate and condition of the wicked, ſimply conſidered in it ſelfe, that makes wretched, but as it hath reſpect to the ſtate of the juſt, for with reſpect to both is condemnation compleated.</p>
                  <p>Note here then, that he that cannot be freely willing that the ſpirit of grace and of God ſhould ſuffer loſſe in the men of the world, of all its proper life, vertue, and operation, as it is that whereby the men of God live, move, and act in all things.</p>
                  <p>That man can never give conſent, that that wicked ſpirit of the world which by nature is proper to all fleſh, ſhould ever be made in the excellencies of the Son of God, or furniſhed with the ſtrength and operations of God.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that men have carved out unto themſelves a better thing then <hi>Iſh,</hi> the man of ſtrength, vigour, and courage; and a worſe then <hi>Enoſh,</hi> the man of baſeneſſe and ſorrows; that is, they teach a better eſtate and condition then that of man, which is only in God himſelfe; and ſo they make Chriſt not to be very God, which is to deſtroy Chriſt unto themſelves; and they ſet up a worſe thing then Antichriſt, which is the Devill, and in the one and the other the form, the faith of Devils in themſelves, which is to believe tremblingly, that there is one God: but to believe, that of twaine he is made one new man in Chriſt, that wiſdome and confidence they attaine not.</p>
                  <p>So they conclude a God-head out of Chriſtianity, and then it is out of Chriſt the wiſdome of God, and ſo he is properly the tormentor of the world; and they conclude a Devill out of man, and then he hath not the wiſdome and corrupt will of the fleſh, and that is none but the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, whom they account not only <hi>as one having a Devill,</hi> but as <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub the prince of Devils,</hi> which is no more then to preach Chriſt for Antichriſt, and Antichriſt for Chriſt, and theſe are taken as men fit to make Preachers, and able to correct all errours in the world; for as it hath been in Councels and Synods, even ſo it is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:118751:42"/>
now; but herein lies a great point of the deceipt and ſnare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the world catcheth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the men that groane, grumble, and grieve at the works of God, both in juſt and unjuſt, for they can neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the work of God according to the excellency and top of perfection, as it is in Chriſt; nor yet the work of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is in that man of ſin, Antichriſt, <hi>who goeth about as a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon ſeeking whom he may devoure:</hi> but they cannot abide to heare that he that is men <hi>is that man ſlayer from the beginning,</hi> and ſo grieve that <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould have his proper due.</p>
                  <p>And when ever the Goſpel appears in the truth and reality of it, <hi>they hold it comes to torment them before its time.</hi> For either it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies that which they exalt, or elſe it exalts that which they ſo vilifie, and the time is never ſeaſonable to them neither for the one nor the other.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch as hold a ſtate and condition between the ſonne of God, and the ſon of perdition (which is a reall condition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſons of men) they have it from the ſame principles from which the place of Purgatory doth ſpring, which the ſame men ſeem ſo zealouſly to condemn and approve, as Doctors of that kingdom which cannot ſtand, being divided in it ſelf, but is in the way of the ſall, and not of the reſurrection; and ſo much for the argument drawn from the danger, <hi>Leſt ye be condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond follows, which is the readineſſe for execution, and that in way of wonder, <hi>Behold the Judge ſtandeth before the doore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold, that is, admire and wonder at the appearing of this ſigne alſo, namely that the righteous Judge of all the earth, that renders to every one according to his work, hath no other door to come in at, no other way of entrance, whereby to paſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of abſolution or condemnation; no way to quit the juſt, or condemn the wicked; no way to exerciſe mercy or ſeverity, but only through this two-fold eſtate and condition of man-kind, namely the crucifiers of Chriſt according to the fleſh, and the crucifiers of Chriſt according to the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he that finds a condition, way or act, wherein God is only as a bare ſpectator or elſe exerciſeth ſome-what beſides, or out of the way, either of mercy or wrath, among the ſonnes of men, let ſuch conclude of another eſtate in man-kind beſides theſe twayn.</p>

                  <p>Let ſuch look to this point who makes a good and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable way of adminiſtration in meer civill affayrs, wherein the grace and favour of God is not properly exerciſed in that way of Chriſt, neither is the wrath of God in exerciſe as in that way of Antichriſt: But ſuch will find that he who is not of the faith and works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee is of the law of the fleſh and ſpirit of the world; and he that hath the ſpirit of the world, hath not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt; <hi>And whoſoever hath noth the ſpirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his: and they that do not the works of Abraham, they are not the children of Abraham, but of their father the Devill, whoſe workes they do, and will do.</hi> For this two-fold door is the only way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in all the wayes of adminiſtration belonging to him who is that righteous Judge of all the earth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he is ſayd <hi>to ſtand before the doore,</hi> or as the word may be read, <hi>with the doore;</hi> that is, hath ſetled and confirmed himſelf to be Judg of all, with this way of entrance, for adminiſtration; for the word <hi>ſtand,</hi> in this place ſignifies to miniſter, as in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Prieſts and Levites in the houſe of the Lord; It is ſaid, <hi>that Judah rejoyced that they ſtood before the Lord:</hi> So the Prophets are ſayd <hi>to ſtand before the Lord,</hi> when they Miniſter with power and authority from him.</p>
                  <p>And the word tranſlated <hi>(Before)</hi> may be read <hi>with,</hi> by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the ſpirit of God; for where one Prophet ſaith, <hi>I am a ſtranger (before) thee as my fathers were:</hi> Another reports the ſame thus, <hi>I am a ſtranger (with) thee as all my fathers were.</hi>

               <p>So that if ever we receive <hi>that fiery law of the ſpirit,</hi> we muſt <hi>aſcend into the mount of God,</hi> namely into the height of the condition of him <hi>who ſits at the right hand of God,</hi> being that whereby he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his wiſdome and skill, power and glory (even as a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts his art and skill by his right hand) which no art, power, nor policy of man can ever reach or attaine unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:118751:45"/>
This pattern is ſet before us in the Prophets onely, or in that one <hi>great Prophet</hi> in the interpretation and unfolding of the word of God, or in the tranſlation of the originall language; that is, in declaring how the things of God are transformed through the carnall conceptions of men, into the principles and rudiments of the creature, and ſo is in them become a profane <hi>Grecian,</hi> which makes the Son of God ſo complaine, that <hi>his viſſage is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more then any man, and his forme more then the ſons of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is a language will ſpeak in <hi>Cain</hi> and all his poſterity, when inke and paper ſhall vaniſh as ſmoke.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a skil to tranſlate the ſpirit of man into the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and excellencies of the Sonne of God, as being thereby become that holy Hebrew, of <hi>Heber,</hi> yea the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Sonne of God, to ſpeak according to that voyce of the blood of ſprinkling which hath in it power to paſſe over the deſtroying Angell for ever; if theſe were as truly tranſlated or interpretted in the world as the letters and ſillables of the Bible are into our native tongue, wee ſhould ſee more eminent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Schollars appeare then now we do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And here the Prophets are deſcribed to be ſuch <hi>as ſpeak in the name of the Lord;</hi> that is, in the power and authority of the Sonne of God; for to ſpeak in the name of God, is to ſpeak in the authority and power of God, which comprehends not onely ſpeech, but action alſo; that is, thoſe ſignes and wonders, and mighty works which accompany the preaching of the Goſpel in the confirmation of it, teſtifying the preſence of God, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the word, making it good by act and deed, according to the expreſſions thereof.</p>
               <p>For the word of God is never truly uttered without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a ſigne and wonder, and a great work no leſſe then ſuch as holds proportion with God for the confirmation of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now we know a wonder is a monſter in nature, ſuch as no nature in its proper inſtinct brings forth, it goes beyond the bounds, abilities, and precincts of any naturall confines whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and without ſuch works, ſignes, or wonders, the Goſpel is never truly preached; for if it ſhould, Chriſts promiſe would faile, but <hi>heaven and earth ſhall faile, before that one jot or tittle of the word of God come to corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:118751:45"/>
So that there is no ſpeech or doctrine of the Goſpel, but in its expreſſion it frames, conſtitutes, and brings forth, a work of ſuch nature as no ſimple nature whatſoever can bring forth, therefore a wonder and a ſigne, to be admired, yea truly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, for no nature can reach thereunto, in the utmoſt extent thereof.</p>
               <p>For as it is true, that there is no operation of the ſpirit of God, in the way of Chriſt, but it is above and goes beyond the nature of the creature, having the power and glory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in it, nor is it attainable by any, or by all creatures.</p>
               <p>So it is true alſo that there is not any work, or operation of the Goſpel, which the divine nature ſimply and abſtractively conſidered can be ſayd to be in any capacity or poſſibility to attaine thereunto, but the poſſibility of God to do all things ſtands in his making himſelf to be ſuch a one, otherwiſe it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attaniable in the nature divine ſimply and ſingly conſidered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no work of the Goſpel without man conſidered in it, no more then there is a Chriſt without mans nature who is the ſubject matter of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And as Chriſt is not without mans nature, no more is any work of the Goſpel; for as the divine nature cannot of it ſelfe ſimply and ſolely conſidered, dye, nor aſcend, neither deſcend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>No more can the humane nature conſidered ſimply in it ſelfe, have in it eternal life, comprehend all things, or be omnipotent but in that unity of the Goſpel, the Sonne of God, they are all brought to paſſe, and all in act, and being in that one Chriſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him therefore whatſoever; but being ſet forth and brought to light, there appear a wonder, a miracle is wrought, a ſigne ſet up for the confirmation of the Goſpel, ſuch as no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſimply conſidered can attaine unto, or bring forth; ſo that if the true word of the Prophet, or of interpretation be ſpoken, this true and miraculous work muſt enevitably appear, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all nature in the utmoſt capacity thereof.</p>
               <p>And therefore that ſaying holds firme, that <hi>we have a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor made higher then the heavens,</hi> a work and wonder above all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſimply and ſolely conſidered, and therefore <hi>Chriſt is that new creature, yea the beginning or head of the creation of God, for God is one in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118751:46"/>
the work, not onely in making, but as one made in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the Prophets are inveſted with power and authority to ſpeak in the name of the Lord, not onely in word, but in work alſo, a ſigne and wonder accompanying the word at all times, which makes them moſt noble, and God-like, <hi>to the cutting off of the ſpirit of Princes, becoming terrible to the Kings of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whence he brings in the ſecond deſcription of a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as the means whereby this power and authority is attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and that is, through ſuffering <hi>affliction, and long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſuffering affliction in this place, we are to underſtand a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off from being ſupported by any earthly power, carnall policy, or any temporall glory whatſoever, with reſpect to friends or alies, or any earthly relations which fade and vaniſh away, which human ſpirits ſeek unto, and rely upon, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of themſelves.</p>
               <p>For onely in the loſſe and laying aſide all theſe things, a true Prophet comes to be inveſted into the power, wiſdome, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Son of God, in whom is found all friendſhip, all offices, and all relations whatſoever not onely compleated, but alſo eternized to abide for ever, in whoſe power and authority by this means they go forth.</p>
               <p>By this means it was that <hi>Moſes</hi> became ſo great a deliverer; for <hi>he refuſing to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter, chooſing rather to ſuffer adverſity with the people of God,</hi> in the loſſe of all ſuch kinde of glory as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court afforded, became an effectuall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to manifeſt that power and glory, throughout all the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the deliverance of Gods choſen, and overthrow of his enemies.</p>
               <p>Again, take <hi>Eliah</hi> for an inſtance in this point, comprehending all the Prophets, as he did in his appearance with Chriſt in the transfiguration, and you ſhall finde him complaining <hi>that he is left alone,</hi> as cut off from all relations from carnall apoſtatized Iſrael, <hi>and his life ſought after to be taken away alſo,</hi> by the policy and power of the whole kingdome of Iſrael under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that wicked <hi>Ahab.</hi>
               </p>

Miniſtery, ſet forth by ſeven Angels, ſeven Trumpets, and ſeven Vialls, inriched with all thoſe excellencies, declared throughout that whole booke, and the perfection of this one only Church is ſignified unto us, in the vertue of thoſe ſeven, as the excellency of one ſpirit of God is ſet forth unto us in that report <hi>of ſeven ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God being about the throne,</hi> and this one Church is ſignified and ſet forth in that of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which hath nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable things found in her, and no reproof, uncomelineſſe, or imperfection at all.</p>

But a true Prophet is under the loſſe, and in the departure from all theſe things, and thereby is inveſted with the power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Son of God, ſpeaking in his name, words of wonder, and admiration, and not as the Scribes.</p>
               <p>And they do not onely ſuffer themſelves to be diſpoſſeſt of theſe things, but they have long <hi>patience,</hi> or <hi>under-abiding</hi> in this condition, it alters not, what change ſoever comes upon them in this world, for they are not leſſe jealous of that which the world counts proſperity, then they are of that it calls adverſity, and are as watchfull under good reports as bad, knowing a like ſnare in both.</p>
               <p>Not as ſuch as ſeem to ſuffer for a time, and are zealous againſt the common practices of the world, till they have gotten ſome high place amongſt men, and then they come to comply with the greateſt worldling, and converſant with worldly affaires, that can put forth it ſelfe to be a conſociate, or ſuffragator unto them.</p>
               <p>Note for concluſion of this point, that a true Prophet knows his liberty, how <hi>that all things are lawfull, but all things are not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; all things are lawfull, but he is not brought under the power and dominion of any thing;</hi> he may marry, but ſo as though he had no wife, he may uſe the world, but as though it were of no uſe unto him at all; and he may buy, but ſo as one that never intends to poſſeſſe, for he makes no ſtore or treaſure of any thing that is of a periſhing nature, no not of the worlds ordinances of Chriſt, as they call them, being of ſuch nature as are onely comprized within the narrow confines of this mortall life, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend nor draw them out beyond, and therefore things that periſh as bodily exerciſes which profit not.</p>
               <p>So that whatſoever a true Prophet makes uſe of in the world, he abides under ſuffering of the loſſe of it, and is disjointed from it, in the enjoyment of it, in point of that ſpirit, wherewith the men of the world purſue and make uſe of the ſame thing, beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a pilgrim and ſtranger, to whatſoever the common ſpirit of the ſons of men account themſelves at home in, and is no more contracted, or affianced unto the things of this life, then he ſhall be when in reſpect of this mortall life, he is no more to converſe with theſe tranſitory things, and affaires.</p>

fathers they would not have perſecuted the Prophets as they did,</hi> but in the mean time do nothing elſe but build the Sepulchres of the Prophets, by their erecting of temporary ordinances, carnal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, humane inſtitutions, and appointments formed and framed from the pattern of the bare letter of the Scripture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they keep buried, the very ſpirit and life of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt him ſelf, ſtifling thereby the very virtue and power of thoſe ſpirituall and heavenly appointments of the of God among the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>In thoſe eternall extentions and operations thereof, then the which, a greater cruelty cannot be attempted or maintained; for as the blood ſhed in all generations from <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> comes juſtly upon that preſent age &amp; people who thus deal with the Prophets; even ſo that compleat power, glory, and preſence of the Prince of peace, and innocent Lamb of God, which hath appeared in any, or all ages of the world, ought (according to the law of truth, juſtice, and equity) to be ſet forth, made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and acknowledged in the preſent generation and age of the world, who is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> though the world know him not, nor will acknowledg him ſo to be.</p>
               <p>Note for concluſion of this point, that onely the ſufferings of the Saints of God is an innocent ſuffering; for they do not wrong unto, uſe cruelty againſt, or contradict any of the proper creatures, or workmanſhip of God, who is the Creator of all things.</p>
               <p>For how ſoever it be true, that the wiſdome and ſubtilty of man, be the proper inſtigator and ſtirrer up of all perſcution and cruelty againſt Chriſt in all ages, yet it is not that wiſdome ſimply conſidered, as a work of God, but as it hath through its own voluntary propenſity, ſockt in, and drunk up into it ſelfe the wiſdome and word of God to the corrupting and falſifying thereof in it ſelfe, and thereby doth truly become Satanical, which condition is no proper work of God.</p>
               <p>Even as fraile man in that way of Chriſt, is become the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and eternal ſon of God, and not the proper ſeed, and off-ſpring of man.</p>
               <p>So that it is the ſpirit and power of Satan, that the Saints kill
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118751:50"/>
and crucified in themſelves, and oppoſe in others, where, or in whomſoever it appears, and not any proper creature of God, and therefore the Saints onely are innocent ſufferers, that being all they ſuffer for.</p>
               <p>Even as it is in the wicked, it is not the ſpirit of a ſimple crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they oppoſe and perſecute in the godly, and kill and crucifie in themſelves.</p>
               <p>But it is the ſpirit and wiſedome of God which hath drunk in the ſoule of the creature into it ſelfe, through the nullifying of all humane excellencies and glory in which the wiſdome and glory of God doth conſiſt, ſo that it is the wiſdome of God in this act, which the world oppoſeth and perſecutes; the ſufferings of the Saints therefore are onely innocent, and miraculous, for they go beyond the power of any nature conſidered onely in it ſelfe, which ſuffering of the Saints he works up into one, as a pattern of all the reſt, and that is the ſecond point.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Ye have heard of the patience of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>2. The ſufferings of all the Prophets are here gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, and compoſed in one, namely in <hi>Job,</hi> wherein we ſee the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Scriptures in propounding it ſelfe unto us either in the ſingular or plurall form, and that in the grace of ſuffering, wherein the Saints are made exemplary, for the ſufferings of all the Prophets are here gathered up and centred in one particular, namely in <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if the ſufferings of all the Saints have unity in one Son of God, and be all of like nature, virtue and power in him, then hath that one act of ſuffering of the Son of God (once and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) alike reſpect unto every particular Saint of God, and hath its plurality in them, being of like nature, virtue and efficacy wherever it appears; for whatſoever is in that great Prophet of the Church, is of one ſimple and eternall act, and is as unpoſſible to carry a differing nature or virtue, as for God to change in any of his exellencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For it becomes the Captaine of our ſalvation in bringing many ſons to glory to be made perfect through ſuffering:</hi> ſo that there are many ſons we ſee, and yet there is but one onely ſon-ſhip, which onely ſon-ſhip
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118751:50"/>
every one hath who is not <hi>a baſtard, and no ſon,</hi> and is a ſon only by the virtue and dignity of that one ſon-ſhip and not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, in any reſpect whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And yet there is but one ſon, becauſe <hi>all have acceſſe unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by one ſpirit:</hi> and therefore it is that God is ſaid <hi>to call his ſon out of Aegypt,</hi> when ſo many thouſands of Iſrael marched out from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> being but one body of Iſral, which is ſaid to be done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, when Jeſus, alone, after the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> returned, being tranſported by <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> as one of no ſtrength without ſupport, a great difference in humane reaſon between that Infant and that Army that none of the Nations can ſtand before; but in both conſiſts that harmony which is in the natures of Chriſt, therefore it is a faithfull ſaying, <hi>that if we be dead with him,</hi> or in him, <hi>we ſhall alſo live in him, if we ſuffer together</hi> (or in unity) <hi>we ſhall alſo reigne in unity,</hi> ſo that the ſufferings of Chriſt are as truly multiplyed in the Saints as the glory of his reigne and ſon-ſhip is.</p>
                  <p>And yet it is true, that as there is but one ſon, ſo there is but one ſufferer, for <hi>he him ſelfe bears our ſins in his own body upon the tree;</hi> that is, in his body myſticall, and not in an hiſtoricall body, and of ſuch nature is the tree whereon they are born. <hi>He bore our ſinne;</hi> that is, all that which is their ſin in the worlds account, namely the contradicting and abrogating of that law of the carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, ſtanding in ordinances, which is done, not on a wodden croſſe, or gibbet, but in or upon that tree of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where onely it is found to be aboliſhed, <hi>that we being dead to ſinne might live to righteouſneſſe,</hi> in which the ſtripes do conſiſt, whereby we are healed.</p>
                  <p>So that the ſufferer is but one compleat and compacted body; the place whereon this ſuffering is onely found, is but that one tree of righteouſneſſe, namely of the righteouſneſſe of God through the faith of Chriſt, where the fleſh is onely crucified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eternall ſtrength, and yet there are many ſufferers: and therefore it is the voyce of all the Saints of God that ever were, are, or ſhall be, as one joynt acclamation or out-cry, written in their hearts for ever, <hi>For thy ſake are we killed all the day long</hi> (that is, once and for ever) <hi>and are counted as ſheep for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:118751:51"/>
We conclude then, that the ſufferings of all the Prophets, Seers, or interpreters of the minde of God, are comprized in our myſticall and ſpirituall <hi>Job,</hi> and the patient ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> are extended unto, and of an examplary nature in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; that is, of a teaching and leading virtue in every Saint of God, fit to be imitated, and worthy to be followed of all the reſt, otherwiſe due honour is not given unto Chriſt according to the nature and glory of thoſe ineſtimable ſufferings comprehended in his myſticall and royall body innocent.</p>
                  <p>But he is carnallized in the doctrine of the Croſſe, as in all other points, the world deals with him in the matter of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>3. It is taken for granted therefore, in the next place, that the Saints of God <hi>have heard of the patience of Job,</hi> or the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of <hi>the hated one,</hi> as his name ſignifies, or one <hi>that endures enmity againſt himſelfe,</hi> as it is ſaid of him whom the world hates even untill now <hi>Conſider him that endureth ſuch contradiction of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners againſt himſelfe, leaſt you be weary and faint in your mindes,</hi> as knowing it is the portion of him always, in whomſoever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appears.</p>
                  <p>The word tranſlated <hi>heard</hi> in this place, ſignifies to <hi>know,</hi> and that upon ſuch termes of certainty, as to become one with the thing <hi>known,</hi> as it is ſaid that <hi>Adam knew Eve his wife,</hi> not onely to be made one in Contract and Eſpouſall, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were, who yet notwithſtanding <hi>know</hi> not one the other; but to be made one individuall ſubſiſtance <hi>in their ſeed,</hi> having one form, and one ſpirit and life in it, and ſo the patience of <hi>Job:</hi> or the ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> yea of Jeſus, are <hi>known in the Saints of God;</hi> that is, they are one entire, ſimple, and undivided act <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>in them alſo,</hi> bearing the ſame forme, containing the ſame virtue, ſubject to the ſame reproach by the men of the world, as alſo, of like joy, and acceptation as of old unto the godly, by whom it is ſaid, <hi>Rejoyce greatly O daughter of Zion, ſhout O daughter of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, behold thy King cometh unto thee, he is juſt ſaving himſelfe, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a colt, the foal of an Aſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider, the word of God brought not forth in the begining the ſun moon, and ſtars, or any creature upon the face of the earth, to be of one nature and virtue in one age of the world, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:118751:51"/>
of another nature and virtue in another time or age thereof, no more doth the word of God bring forth the ſufferings of the Son of God, to be of one kinde and virtue in one man of God, and of another kinde, power or virtue in another man of God, or in one age to be really preſent with the Diſciples, and in another age to be far remote, for they are all one individuall act in that one multiplyed Saint or holy one of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>And ſo are the ſufferings of Chriſt according to the ſpirit, in the man of ſin, and ſons of Beliall, <hi>which crucifie the Son of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh unto, or in themſelves, putting him to an open ſhame:</hi> it is not one in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and another in <hi>Herod;</hi> it is not of one nature or kinde in <hi>Cain,</hi> and of another in <hi>Judas;</hi> it is not one in the Scribes and Pharaſees, and another in the wicked Lawyers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; it is not of one nature and kinde io that Antichriſt and ſon of perdition, and of another nature and kinde in the Devil and Satan.</p>
                  <p>But it is one ſimple and eternall act of that one man of ſin, multiplied into many Antichriſts, <hi>which are now working already in the world, according to the power of the Prince of the ayre, the ſpirit which now worketh in the children of unbelief,</hi> unto which Chriſt ſpeaks as unto one, ſaying, <hi>what is thy name?</hi> the anſwer implies both the ſingular and plurall number, <hi>my name is Legion, for we are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For we muſt remember <hi>that what ſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith unto them,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>in them who are under the law;</hi> that is, whatſoever the law of the ſpirit ſpeaks; now the law of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life is in Chriſt Jeſus, according to which he ſubmits to the will of his Father <hi>(that ancient of days)</hi> in all things, as alſo rules over all temporary and carnall power; for there is nothing in Chriſt as wherein he ſubmits, but it hath the virtue of authority therein alſo, and whatſoever this law ſaith, it ſaith it in all that are ſubjects unto the ſame, and gives being to what it utters, as the word did to all things in the beginning; ſo that if it ſpeak of faith in any, it ſpeaks without reſpect of perſons according to that impartiality which is in it ſelf: ſo that where it utters faith, it is in the powerfull work of faith, as a work wherein the Son of the eternall is involved, in whom it hath its virtue and power: if it utter alone, it ſheds it abroad in the heart in the labour of it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118751:52"/>
as that wherein God dwels, who is compoſed of it: if it ſpeaks of hope, it is not deferred, but ſprings up in the ſoule as <hi>that tree of life in the Paradiſe of God:</hi> and if it ſpeak of ſuffering, it creates the Croſſe, not in any other form and virtue, but in that wherein it takes its being from the beginning, even as it was at the firſt, with the creation in the operation of the word in bringing forth all creatures to exiſt and have a being.</p>
                  <p>When it made the Sun, it formed it in that virtue that abides the ſame in all ages; and ſo it is with all creatures receiving their being and virtue by that word; even ſo whatſoever the law of the ſpirit ſaith, it gives the ſame being and virtue thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all that are under that law, whether it concerne humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or exaltation, death or reſurrection, the being of the Lord the Saviour, or the ſaved of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>For what or in whom-ſoever it ſpeaks, it ſaith it to the realli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of it ſelfe in the thing ſpoken, and that without excluſion of any one particular, or including any one more then the reſt, which are found under the ſame law.</p>
                  <p>For as unto us there is but one God, ſo there is but one Image of that God, which is his wiſdome made manifeſt in Chriſt, which is the proper and perpetuated form of Chriſt, wherein ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is manifeſt, and of all true Chriſtianity in all ages of the world.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore either take Chriſt, or a chriſtian forme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the law of the ſpirit (and then there is no other ſeat to ſet him in, but under the dominion of the fleſh, that law of ſin and death) or elſe the Croſſe expreſſed and maintained according to that law of the ſpirit is the ſame in Chriſt, and in every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in all reſpects.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>it is that circumciſſion made without hands;</hi> that is, without any wiſdome or ability proper unto, or atainable by man, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cutting off of that ſuperfluous foreſkin of the fleſh; which is ſuperfluous to the fulneſſe of Gods wiſdome and power, which is the proper hinderer and obſtructor of the propagation of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this circumciſſion is to be exerciſed upon every male in the family of God (and that by divine inſtitution) that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one who have that maſculine ſpirit of the Son of God,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118751:52"/>
                     <hi>to acquit themſelves like men of God,</hi> by faith, conquering and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the world, for this circumciſion onely brings the ſoule of man into a capacity of having the power of God to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therein, in which is that fulneſſe and perfection, that all things natural or proper to a creature, are altogether ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore it is ſaid to be <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or cutting round, ſo as no beginning or end of this virtue can ever be found out, for it is eternall.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is alſo the law of the carnal commandement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the carnall law, and whatſoever that ſpeaks, it ſaith it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them, and in all them (reſpectively) that are under that law.</p>
                  <p>And this conſiſts in carnall and temporary ordinances and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, ſuch appointments as fade and periſh in the uſe, ſuch as abide not with man, or he not with them for ever; and what this law ſaith, it ſaith it in all and every particular that are under the ſame; that is, it reallizeth it ſelfe in every heart wherein it ſpeaks, forming and framing a work therein according to the word gone out; for she word of God ſpeaks that language in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which mans heart naturally ſpeaks, taking that (by viewing it by his own light) to be the ſubſtance and reality of the minde of God, in his intent; but is but a ſhadow, a figure or ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, thereby carnallizing the word by transforming it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſimilitude of a creature, and not into the glory of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, ſo that the imaginations and dictates of his own heart give a temporary forme unto an eternall word, which is that carnall law of ſin and death in himſelfe, ſubjecting himſelfe thereunto, ſo that whatſoever the letter ſaith which kils, it ſaith it in him who is litterall, and hath the power of engagement, and binding that party over to the onely acknowledgement, and practice thereof; and ſo the word of God becomes a tormentor unto man; for it being held, or impriſoned in this unrighteouſneſſe, or narrow and ſtrait confines of humane principles and capacity, and yet in it ſelfe infinite and eternal, cannot poſſible move there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but muſt have reſpect unto its own nature, which is infinite incomprehenſible, and eternall, whereby the ſoule of the creature is ſet upon the rack, hanged on the gibbet, laid under an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preſſe, caſt into the flames, overwhelmed with the flouds,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118751:53"/>
being extended and intangled with that which is infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, as alſo below and beneath, and in all reſpects beyond the reach of all humane abilities, and ſo continually deviſeth and frameth out more ways of torture and torment unto it ſelfe, then ever mans heart in any tyrant could invent for the ſhame and horrour of the body.</p>
                  <p>In which reſpect that compleat condition ceaſeth to be the ſtate and condition, or to be led by the proper principles of a meer creature, or workmanſhip of God, and becomes <hi>Shedim,</hi> as the <hi>Caldean</hi> phraſe is, that is the deſtroyer of mankinde, in humane and ſatanicall.</p>
                  <p>So that the dictates of ſuch a heart are the proper ſuggeſtions of Satan, and its operations, the proper works of darkneſſe, and the onely path wherein the wrath of the Almighty treads for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that there is in them who are under the law of the ſpirit, a direct Antitheſis unto this expreſſed of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
                  <p>For the ſpirit of man being taken into unity with the word, and ſo gathered up into the wiſdome and power of God, works nor moves not but by principles proper unto God, which are of an eternall and incomprehenſible nature; and yet the ſpirit of the creature cannot move, but with reſpect to the precincts of time, in which it is, but it goeth forth in and by eternall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſo that there is in the Son of God diſtinct operations, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of an eternal nature and race.</p>
                  <p>The one giving delight to the work through variety &amp; change of action; and the other gives liberty, eaſe, and freedome unto the ſoule therein, having ſo large roome and ſo ſpacious a ſphear to walke and exerciſe it in, the bounds whereof can never be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den out, like the Sun in the firmament whoſe progreſſe none can hinder, nor ſtop, or prevent the health under its wings from the exerciſe of it ſelf; nor can any take out of order thoſe <hi>fixed ſtars of the morning, that fight from ſuch an eminent and noble diſtance in their courſes for the deſtruction of this wicked Siſera,</hi> even thoſe <hi>bright mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtars that ſing together, &amp; ſons of God ſhouting for joy in thoſe Nobles of Iſrael, in laying of the firſt foundation of the earth ſo as it ſhall never be removed;</hi> who are as far above the power and dominion of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118751:53"/>
Satan, as the heavens are above the earth, out of the gun-ſhot of being inſiſted with any corrupt doctrine, or of being hurt by any of the tyrannical practices of this preſent world.</p>
                  <p>Such is the ſtate and condition of that myſticall body of our Lord Jeſus, the dictates of whoſe heart are the motions of that ſpirit of holineſſe and power, and his operations works of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>And of ſuch nature is the law of the ſpirit which is in Chriſt Jeſus, and of all ſuch as are under command, and in the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Saints then, or brethren of our Apoſtle, know the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Job,</hi> not at a diſtance, but in the neareſt conjunction; ſo as being made one with it, it being an entire and undivided croſſe and ſuffering, and is brought in the next ſentence, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Yea, Gods end herein is to receive and embrace us as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ones; <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every ſonne whom he receiveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that through which we participate in his holineſs, and are poſſeſſors of that integrity which is in none but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>For hee correcteth in cutting off all ſuperfluous branches, to this end <hi>that we may be made partakers of his holineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, the end of the Croſſe is to inveſt us in our filiall portion, for <hi>if you endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as ſonnes,</hi> for <hi>what ſonne is he whom the father correcteth not;</hi> and that for this very end,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:118751:54"/>
namely to fit him thereby to exerciſe and bear up his own ſpirit, nature, office and authority.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Lords end and intent in our undergoing of the Croſſe, to beſtow a double portion on us as he did to <hi>Job,</hi> which is the proper right of the firſt borne of God, appointed by the Law in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> For where it is ſaid, the Lord gave <hi>Job</hi> twice as much, the word is, <hi>Added double:</hi> The ſame phraſe is uſed by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> where he deſires to receive a double portion of the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah,</hi> or that ſpirit of <hi>partition,</hi> whereby to divide <hi>Jordan</hi> aright, as his Maſter had done before him; the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifies <hi>the mouth exerciſing the part of two,</hi> which is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Propheſie conſidered in a double or two-fold reſpect; that is, as it contayns the ſpirit of interceſſion, in laying open and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretting the ſtate and condition of man-kind before God from which the Saints are freed and delivered; as alſo the laying open before the ſons of men the ſtate and condition of the Son of God, opening and interpretting that to which we are delivered, both theſe were in <hi>Job;</hi> the one ſignified in his praying for his friends, that they might be delivered from unrighteouſneſſe; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the names given to his daughters, declaring his preſent joyous, and delightfull condition. Likewiſe the ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is ſignified unto us, in that he ſeeth his ſeed unto the fourth generation; which number foure hath in it the myſtery of the extenſion of things, as in the gathering of the elect from the four winds, or foure corners of the earth: ſo alſo in that four times ten, or forty dayes faſt of Chriſt, his continued act of obſtinance from the wayes of ſin and death is ſignified, as in that four times ten, or forty yeares travell of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, declares the Saints ſight and acknowledgment of the works and wayes of the Nations, in all their performances, to be unto them as a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, dry, wild and way leſſe wilderneſſe for ever. Likewiſe Gods viſiting of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him, is for ever; for whom he hates once, he hates for ever; which viſitation the holy man <hi>Job</hi> ſeeth his ſeed freed from by the ſpirit of Propheſie in this eſtate and condition of his reſtauration, and eternall enriching by God in way of this double portion.</p>
                  <p>For as the office of Kingdome and Prieſt-hood are the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118751:55"/>
of the firſt-born in the family; ſo alſo is this double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Propheſie, or <hi>mouth performing the part of twaine;</hi> that is, he hath the mouth to perform the part of the ſonne of (Man) namely in exerciſe of the ſpirit of God in interpretting and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the ſtate and condition of all fleſh, and by the vertue and authority of the high Prieſt of God, which is done not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to terrour, griefe, or controverſie, but unto peace, joy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, as one that is entered within the vale.</p>
                  <p>And thus the mouth and breath of prayer is opened and drawn out with boldneſſe before the Lord at the throne of grace, as coming in that name and authority of Jeſus Chriſt, who is a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, in this double portion is the mouth of the Sonne of of God exerciſed as from heaven, opening and interpreting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world the mind of the Father in that ſtate and condition of Jeſus Chriſt, freely offering and making tender of the love, bounty, good will, and mercy of God unto the Saints; and this is done in that Princely ſpirit, and bounteous riches and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity conſiſting in the power and authority of a King, which things are comprehended in the right of the firſt born, and are the portion of <hi>Job</hi> in this his reſtauration, wherein we ſee the end of the Lord, and in whom the ſtate of all the Saints is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate and involved, and no other end is aymed at, or effected by God in all the ſufferings of the Saints, but to give in exchange for tranſitory and vaine things, <hi>an inheritance mortall and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which fadeth not, reſerved for us in heaven,</hi> or in the height of of that eſtate and condition of the Son of God. For the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof, he brings in that argument propounded in the next place, which is the fourth point.</p>

but his own proper propenſity, to caſt himſelfe down unto death for ever; nor any other ſubtilty but his own to intrap and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare him unto the will of Satan for ever, then only do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions and pitty of a father move upon that heart, ſo as to adde no ſorrow thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Againe, to pitty or commiſerate, is to redeem, releaſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from whatſoever might annoy or diſquiet the party which is ſubject to diſtreſſe; therefore it is ſayd, <hi>that in his love and pitty he redeemed them, and bare them</hi> (as out of the reach of any harm) <hi>all the dayes of old.</hi>

Such is the tenderneſſe and pitty of the ſpirit of our good Shepheard, <hi>gathering the Lambs into his arms, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them in his boſome, and gently leads ſuch as are with young, yea layes downe his life for his flocke:</hi> And this is the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all ſuch as find themſelves fatherleſſe in reſpect of any love, pitty, or compaſſion exerciſed towards them by the ſpirit of the world, of whom it is ſayd, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the works of our hands, yee are our gods, for in thee the fathers find mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For he is not only pittifull, but of tender mercy, <hi>whereby the day that ſprings from on high hath viſited us:</hi> Or that morning Sunne which is the light and glory of the world is riſen up upon us, to give light to ſuch as otherwiſe fit in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, even that light of proſperity, joy and gladneſſe, peace and plenty, which ariſeth out of the light and inheritance of the firſt-born, unto whom the full inheritance belongs, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Father was, is, or ſhall be, in all his enterprizes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.</p>

ſo the vertue of the Croſſe in its courage, conſtancy, and Princely reſolutions, might appear and make it ſelf evident.</p>
               <p>Or were the Judges and Law givers in <hi>Iſrael</hi> tyed to dayes, times, ſeates, and circuits, as men making merchandizes of mens eſtates, credits and lives, that in caſe an Oath be bidden and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in exchange, delivery muſt be made without controverſie; and many times the cauſe is as currant, as when the ſtrongeſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away the purſe on the high way, though a poſſibilty may be to finde out the falſhood of the oath afterwards, when there is left no hope of redemption: And as for that mercinary and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-god-like bond, to be engaged to places and people under the names of Paſtor and Teacher, to evade the troubles and travels of Prophets and Apoſtles. Let that ſuffice which hath already been ſayd, only let ſuch look themſelves as in a glaſſe, in that young man of the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and yet a Levite, joyned unto their congregations, as he to the family of <hi>Mica.</hi> Read <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. and let them read the effect of their Miniſtry in that ſtrange kind of Levite, who is of mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> joyned unto his Concubine of <hi>Bethlehem Juda,</hi> according to what it brings forth between <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamine</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſet forth unto us, <hi>Judges</hi> the 19. and 20. Chap.</p>
               <p>Againe, in point of family, as in kindred and relations, the words of Chriſt holds firm, and are to be valued at the ſame rate we ſet upon him: and he ſaith, <hi>He that for ſakes not father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wife and children for my ſake and the Goſpell, is not worthy of mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, <hi>He that hates not father and mother, wife and children, brethren and ſiſters, yea and his owne life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> The reaſon hereof is, becauſe all naturall relations brought unto the higheſt pitch which they tend unto, is to idolize the thing, by ſetting it in the place of God, requiring a due reſpect and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof in the neglect or contempt of what ever might hinder the promoting thereof, which cannot ſtand with a due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and reſpect of that relation, as it is ordered and eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in Chriſt, but muſt make a nullity of it; for the coming of Chriſt in all things <hi>is glory to God in the higheſt,</hi> and not to the things of the creature.</p>
               <p>When the man called by Chriſt, deſired firſt <hi>to go and bury his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that the earthly relation may have chiefty, and come in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:118751:57"/>
firſt place, Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Let the dead bury their dead, follow thou me;</hi> intimating that theſe relations are dead, and are to be buryed unto us in the call and relation of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt is about his Fathers buſineſſe; not when he attends on <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> but when he is diſputing and convincing the Doctors of the carnall Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But earthly relations in their proper intent (without which the life of it is let out) ever ſet themſelves in the firſt place; for what is a Husband or a Wife, unleſſe they make each other the higheſt pitch of their love, which is the pointed up pinacle, which the Devill ſets Chriſt upon according to the fleſh, wherein the ſtrength of his temptations conſiſts; and where it takes, it is the preſumptuous ſinne, which our ſpirituali <hi>David</hi> is freed from; for who dares not to love wife and children to the higheſt poynt thereof, without feare of ſinning, being the proper ſinew to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ye them together, and the life-blood in the veynes, to give motion and agility in all conjugall reſpects, making each other the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of deſires, hopes, obſervation, diligence, care and motion, that nothing, no not life it ſelfe ſhall hinder, or be thought too deare to maintaine the credite, comfort, and well-being of one another.</p>
               <p>And here it is to be noted, that when the Scriptures take up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Creatures in their nature, relation, operation, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect, it is not done but with reſpect unto the wiſdome and ſpirit of man, for whoſe uſe all things were made and are, and that to declare thereby either the myſtery of God, or the myſtery of iniquity, or both.</p>
               <p>And that alluſion cannot be of a capacity to ſignifie unto us the mind of God wrapt up therein (whether a thing terrible to nature or lovely) unleſſe wee extend it unto the fartheſt poynt which it intends or inclines after, and that is Satanicall; as for example, when it takes up a Lyon to expreſſe it ſelf by, a Dragon, Tyger, Wolfe, Leopard, Beare, Fox, or Serpent, we muſt look unto the proper purſuit of the creature to the utmoſt extent of his diſpoſition and practice; which being centred in man as the ſcope and intent of all Gods works, it muſt be found there in the greateſt cruelty, ſubtilty, and tyranny, which is no leſſe then the Devill, that <hi>roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devoure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:118751:58"/>
Againe, when it takes up lovely relations, as Husband to wife, and wife to Husband, Father to ſon, and ſon to Father, we muſt carry them unto that point which nature depraved purſues in this world <hi>(For in the Kingdome of God there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage)</hi> and then it idolizeth the party beloved, ſets it in the place of God, and ſo becomes an idolatrous affection, yea it is that love of the world <hi>which is enmity with God,</hi> having the ſpirit of the Serpent in it, and therefore to be hated.</p>
               <p>For it ſwears and engageth unto the things of this world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the charge of our Apoſtle given in this place; and ſo is a true metaphor, and in way of diſſimilitude, or antitheſis, holds direct proportion with the things of God, and ſo fitly ſets out the nature of the love of God in the Saints.</p>
               <p>Whoſe temporary relations, or lives are not deare unto them for the cauſe of Chriſt, in mayntaining thoſe that are reall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in him: and in this true ſence of the height and intent of them, are all hated for Chriſt, and no bond at all to hinder them in their courſe in the promulgation of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>For where find we any of the Prophets or Apoſtles of Chriſt entangled with wife or children, friends or famlies, as a tye to hinder them in the purſuit of the things of God. Indeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Have not we power to eate and to drinke, to lead about a ſiſter, a wife, and power not to worke as other Apoſtles, brethren of the Lord,</hi> or in brother hood of that Lordſhip over all things: Yet did they practice or deſiſt in doing, or not in doing theſe things, only as the progreſs and propagation of the Goſpel might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and promoted thereby.</p>
               <p>But it is the policy and practice of the world to adjure &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure things ſo together by humane tyes and bonds, knowing that all carnall relations flye for refuge unto a Diabolicall engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even as every ſpiritual relation flyes to that bond and oath of God.</p>
               <p>For thereby the ſpirit of the world ſets perſons and places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to claym mutuall intereſt to the neglect and vilifying of that bond of the ſpirit which is in Chriſt, proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſervice and uſe meerly of each other.</p>
               <p>But the doctrine of Chriſt ſaith on this wiſe; <hi>Yee have heard that it hath been ſaid of old, thou ſhalt not for ſweare thy ſelfe; but I ſay unto
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118751:58"/>
you, ſweare not at all;</hi> that is, take not an engagement upon thee, ſo as to ſubmit unto, or be at the ſervice and command of any thing whatſoever; that is, not the proper ſtate, place, office, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, operation, or condition, as it is founded in Chriſt, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereunto.</p>
               <p>By which, and in whom we are made Lord of all things, and ſo ſubject to none beſides him alone: <hi>For of him, and through him, and for him are all things, and to him the glory of all appertains and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is, <hi>That the ſabboth is made for man, and not man for the ſabboth, for the ſonne of man is Lord of the ſabboth.</hi> And hence it is that it is ſayd, <hi>that the woman was made for the man, and not the man for the woman;</hi> that is, all things more weake and effeminate, whatſoever they be, are made to be ſubject, and of the ſervice of that maſculine ſpirit of the man of God, and not the man of God to be ſubject to any thing which hath not the ſtrength and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Son of God in it.</p>
               <p>Now in that Chriſt was not made an high Prieſt but by an oath, and yet gives ſtrict charge not to ſweare at all; we are to conſider wherein an oath doth conſiſt, which the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> deſcribes in a two-fold reſpect, that is, the oath of <hi>God,</hi> and the oath of <hi>men.</hi> The oath of men is never taken in the way of Chriſt, but without the oath of God he exiſts not; the oath of God is never taken in the way of Antichriſt, but without the oath of man he never was.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the oath of God, we are to conſider the ſpeech of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith; <hi>That when God made or built the promiſe in Abraham, becauſe there was not a greater to ſweare by, hee ſwore by himſelfe;</hi> where he transforms the promiſe into the oath, making them as one thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God, the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, and the <hi>Oath</hi> of God, are but one intire act or ſtate of the Son of God, only differ in variety and reall diſtinction of glory. The promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods voluntary and free tender of himſelfe in Chriſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with mans acceptation in a voluntary and free return of thankfulneſſe: It is in God voluntary without compulſion, free without any reſtraint in himſelfe, or deſert in man; It is the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of himſelfe, elſe could not have in it the bounty and benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:118751:59"/>
And it is accepted by man in a thankfull acknowledgment thereof in Chriſt, which is voluntary, without compulſion; for the Son of God is not compelled to acknowledg the bounteous liberality of the Father, and it is free without reſtraint of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for he makes a compleat ſurrender of himſelfe unto God, and without any deſert in God; as conſidered in the vilification of the ſpirit in the men of the world, wherein is no deſert, or thanks worthy at all but in himſelfe, and exaltation of the ſame ſpirit in Chriſt, moſt worthy of all renown and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the author and giver of all things.</p>
               <p>Even as the unworthineſſe of man conſiſts in that ſtate of the exaltation of the fleſh in the man of ſin, or men of the world, but as it is ſubmitted unto God in Chriſt: ſo the man Chriſt is he, to whom of due deſert every knee ſhall bow, and tongue confeſſe the worth and dignity of that Lord Jeſus the man of God, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, for the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God, it is a mutuall and conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall engagement of God and man in the faith of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become mutually and reciprocally at the ſervice and uſe of each other, for therein is that ſpeech made good and fulfilled; <hi>The man hath not power of his own body, but the woman, neither hath the woman power of her own body but the man,</hi> God vouchſafing unto the Son of man all that help and glorious ſupply that is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and man bringing forth, and making manifeſt in himſelfe all thoſe glorious excellencies and vertues which are in the Son of God, and ſo is due benevolence given with reſpect unto all conjugall duties appertaining and belonging unto that holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Contract in that Eſpouſall of Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The oath of God is the immutability and unchangeable condition of this eſtate of our ſpirituall <hi>Abraham,</hi> taken into the promiſe and hopefull expectation of God; taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Covenant and preſent enjoyment of God; taken into the oath of confirmation, and unchangeable eſtate and condition of the Son of God, wherein it is impoſſible that ever God ſhould faile or forget himſelfe, as not to abide and remayn the ſame, ſo that he ſweares by himſelfe, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> is a party, elſe it cannot be an engagement, and ſo is involved in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118751:59"/>
with God; for where it is ſaid <hi>(God ſware by himſelfe)</hi> it is word for word, <hi>If I bleſſe thee not;</hi> that is, if thou be not bleſſed, I am not bleſſedneſſe my ſelfe: Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Surely in bleſſing I will bleſſe thee, and multiplying, I will multiply thee;</hi> that is, if I be bleſſed, then thou art the ſame; if I be multiplyed in my vertues and excellencies, then thou alſo art and doſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>Note from hence, that a Chriſtian and God-like oath, never ſwears by a thing greater then he that ſwears; for if he do, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides himſelfe from Chriſt, divorcing himſelfe from God in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying the Covenant, in adulterating that holy and perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bond.</p>
               <p>And therefore he adds the oath of man to be ſuch as ſwears by a greater then himſelfe, which is to make God and man to be two eſtates and conditions, which is that which hath ever made a nullity of Chriſt (who is one) and holds the ſoule in a ſtate of unbeliefe, and is properly that oath which God ſwears in the way of his wrath, which excludes men from ever entring into his reſt; in the one man is in the oath, but no cauſe originall of the unity and contract between God and man; and in the other, God is a party in the oath, but no cauſe or originall of that breach or ſeparation from God, excluſion out of the land of the living, or undergoing of wrath: The one is the ſhutting of the gate of heaven unto the world by that cloſe and undivided eſtate of God and man, being the ſame condition; the other opens the grave for the Rebels in the wilderneſſe, that <hi>Hades,</hi> and ſtate of death, by ſeparating God and man from being the ſame exiſtence, and ſo ever look after a greater then themſelves; for the obtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whom, <hi>they return back in their hearts into Aegypt,</hi> ſeeking ſhelter and protection in the power and authority of the arm of fleſh, exerciſing it ſelfe in the men of the world.</p>
               <p>It ſtands the world upon therefore to maintayn engagements between creature and creature, as the intent of the word of God, and ſo in all things to have a reſpect to one greater then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which muſt be another, and not their condition, which is the only ſtrengthning of the arm of fleſh, and buckling of the joynts of the kingdome of darkneſs together, to become their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuge.</p>
               <p>Even as it doth the Saints of God, to maintayn God and man
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118751:60"/>
to be one and the ſame condition in Chriſt, in the knitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that myſticall body of Chriſt, <hi>in the perfect ſupply of every part unto a perfect man,</hi> and ſo make that undefiled and all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Son of God the only place of their refuge.</p>
               <p>The oath of man is framed by the wiſdome of man, and is the very top and pinacle of his prefermens and perfection.</p>
               <p>And the oath of God is framed by the wiſdome of God, being the maſter-piece of his work, the beginning or head of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The wiſdome of God is his counſell held, or advice taken with fraile man, arguing from cauſe to effect, and from effect to cauſe, concluding both in one individual act and being; the reſult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpringing out of divine nature which comprehends all times, concluding man together with it ſelfe in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that upon ſuch undenyable principles, as cary in them the bond of an oath of the moſt higheſt and moſt eminent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Apoſtle calls the oath of <hi>interpoſition,</hi> becauſe that in this ſtate of Chriſt he comes between the bleſſing and the curſe, in ſuch ſort that nothing of true happineſſe can poſſibly paſſe by, or transfuſe it ſelfe into the curſed condition; for the vertue and excellencies ſpringing out of divine nature, being the glory of the engagement, all things tending to happineſſe repayr thither, and gather themſelves into one there, even as all light is gathered into the body of the Sun, and is all the ſeale and ſignet of God to confirm all true happineſſe to take its beginning and make its abode there for ever, being an immutable thing or word abundantly declared in all the heyrs of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Again, the wiſdome of man is that counſell held, and advice taken with the excellency of God, arguing from cauſe to effect, and from effect unto cauſe, ever concluding a diſtance in the one from the other, the reſult properly ſpringing out out of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and aptitude, which mouldeth things in the precincts of time, and concluding God to be concerned in the thing, as being the cauſe of all cauſe, and ſo argues a diſtance between the cauſe and the effect, God being before as the cauſe, and his word after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as an effect; the divine nature in Chriſt, before from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the humane after in time: but the Goſpel is a myſtery, and ſuch argument is naturall and humane, to make God eternall,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118751:60"/>
and man in time: but the Goſpel eternizeth man in God, and makes God in time, in the ſon of man.</p>
               <p>2. This wiſdome argues a diſtance in place, of cauſe and effect, as the vertue of our ſalvation is in Chriſt as a cauſe, being only ſuch a perſon as lived in ſuch an age of the world only, but the effect is in a Chriſtian, being another, which is a meer humane ſpeculation, and no myſtery of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>3. Again, it argues a diſtance in point of eminency, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, as the cauſe being more principall, and the effect leſſe principall, as though the birth and bringing forth of the Son of God in the royalty of his operations, were not a thing of like worth and dignity that the conception and framing of him is, according to that pattern of the law of the ſpirit, ſeen only in the Mount.</p>
               <p>So that this wiſdome ariſeth from, and carryeth in it princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples undenyable to keep a diſtance and loof between God and man, and therein the point of unbelief conſiſts, which is the ſtate of death, in which the ſon of God is made a curſe in the men of the world, as man is made a bleſſing in the Son of God in Chriſt: and this alſo is an oath of interpoſition; for hereby the Son of God being made a curſe for us, interpoſeth himſelfe between the curſe and the bleſſed ſtate: So as nothing bearing the nature of a curſe, ſin, death, or any unhappineſſe can paſſe by, or defuſe it ſelf into that happy ſtate and condition of Chriſt; but all attracts it ſelfe unto that which hath ſo vilified and made a nullity of the Son of God: and this is an immutable word or thing, even the word and ſtate of the curſe which abides for ever, which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains and makes manifeſtly to appear unto the heyrs of Promiſe, which ſtand upon this ground of the impoſſibility of God, to lye or faile to remayn and be for ever, that which once he is without alteration or change; therefore in theſe two immutable words of bleſſing and curſing, or immutable things of the ſtate of death and the ſtate of life, God hath founded our ſalvation, that wee might have ſtrong conſolation, as the Apoſtle teſtifies.</p>
               <p>And this wiſdome or reaſon of man is as a ſeale to confirm the ſoule in its ſeparation and deverſe from Chriſt, being that ſignet the high Prieſts and Phariſees ſet upon the ſtone which covers the Sepulchre of Chriſt, and keeps him in the ſtate of death in the men
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118751:61"/>
of unbelief, that his glorious reſurrection is not found in the men of the world from the beginning thereof unto this day, and is a principall product of the Schools of humane Learning; for the more refined reaſon is voyd of the ſpirit of God, and the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer tyed to Grammar-rule, in conſtructing the word of God, the more are ſuch ſealed up in the word of the Curſe, ſo that you ſhall ſeldome ſee a great Artiſt embrace the ſimplicity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in that Croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And with reſpect to the oath of man, Chriſt ſaith in a word for ever to be obſerved, <hi>Sweare not at all;</hi> which our Apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with in this place, ſaying, <hi>Above all things my brethren ſweare not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note from hence, that he which holds himſelfe under a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bond to utter truth, having taken the oath of men, then he is without the ſame, who never knew what the power and vertue of the oath of God is.</p>
               <p>And if the weightineſſe of a cauſe require an oath, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a thing of leſſe moment then men hold the preaching of the word of God, either to be but a triviall thing; or elſe why do they not tender an oath to the Miniſter when he goeth about to ſpeak thereof.</p>
               <p>Note again, that as men hold themſelves under a greater bond have taken the oath of man, then they are without it; even ſo when they are inveſted into offices and places thereby, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and reckon of themſelves as being better, and of greater account and eſteem then others of their brethren, the ſonnes of men.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, wide is the difference between the oath of God and the oath of man; the one forms and ſets in place and office the Son of God, the other forms and officiates the ſon of perdition.</p>
               <p>The one ſwears the Lord liveth in him, in truth, in judgement, and in righteouſneſſe, and onely glories therein, and the other ſwears the Lord to be another thing, ſtate, and condition beſides himſelfe; the one ſwears with <hi>Jacob,</hi> by the feare of his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> reverencing the ſtate of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be one with God as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, and the other ſwears by the God of his Father <hi>Nahor</hi> the idolater, who ever worſhips that which is acknowledged to bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and not himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:118751:61"/>
The Saints are ever to ſwear in the name &amp; authority of God, but never to ſwear by the oath of men; the world ever ſwears in the name and authority of men, but never in that name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>2. The weight of the charge therefore is to be conſidered in the next place in theſe words, <hi>above all things ſwear not;</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, that it is a thing of greateſt worth and weight in Heaven or in earth, never to ſwear by the oath of men, but to receive our authority and confirmation in all things by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and not by the wiſdome of the world, for the one inveſts as a ſonne into the Preiſthood, and way of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of, God and man; and the other as a ſlave and vaſſal of Satan ſets in the ſtate of death, cruelty and wrath, in the ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God; therefore of greater weight and concernment then all things beſides.</p>
               <p>3. Conſider the terme he gives them, <hi>my brethren;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay in more words, except yee be of my fraternity; that is, of the proper off ſpring and brotherhood of the Son of God <hi>(fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone)</hi> ye will never yeeld over your ſelves unto this inhibition, nor obſerve this charge given by God, for none but the off-ſpring of God wil diſingage themſelves from the language of this world framed and contrived according to the reaſonings thereof in the wiſdome of man, no more then there is any to be found but the ſeed of the Serpent that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage, disjoynt, and diſlocate themſelves from the language and oracle of God, contrived and uttered by that wiſdome of God in Chriſt; prove your ſelves therefore by this, whether you be the brethren of Chriſt, belonging to one and the ſame Father, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the ſame inheritance, for otherwiſe no heirſhip of heaven, no ſhare in the tender compaſſions of a father, no virtue nor grace of the ſpirit, no crown of life laid up, onely for them that waite for, and love the reality of Chriſts appearing, in the vaniſhing and not appearing of all corruptible things at the brightneſſe of his glory alone, in what thing, relation, or act ſoever they may ſeem to ſtand in, unto us, ſo as not to be engaged unto any of them; for explanation whereof he gives an inſtance what we are not to ſweare by; firſt particularly, and then univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</p>

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:118751:62"/>
1. And firſt, we are not to ſwear by heaven: By Heaven, or height, as the word imports in this place, is meant Principalities, powers, dominions, the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, which the Apoſtle ſtiles ſpirituall wickedneſſe, or wicked ſpirits in high, or in heavenly places, ſuch as are eminent and glorious in the eyes of men, according to the judgement of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: now the Saines of God are not to ſwear by any of theſe; for however the oath of man ſwears by the greater, yet the oath of God which is onely upon the Saints of Iſrael cannot be by a greater then himſelfe, ſo that he is not engaged to any of theſe, but all are ſubſervant unto him, and he is above them all, for <hi>he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> as it is written upon his veſture, and upon his thigh or joines, as in his ſtrength and ornaments of his power and authority it doth appear, therefore Chriſt gives the reaſon why we are not to ſwear by Heaven, becauſe ſaith he, it is the throne of God: Now the throne is at the ſervice of him who fits thereon, and not he to be engaged to the throne: ſo that the Principallities and powers of worldly Governments, are the very thrones or chariots, wherein the Son of God ſits for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cecution of his wrath on the world, and they all ſtand ingaged to be at his ſervice, as that proper matter, and inſtrument, wherein the wrath of the Son is kindled, and executed.</p>
               <p>For there is a throne whereon Chriſt ſits to rule with a rod or ſcepter of Iron, wherewith he breaks to peeces as the ſheards of a potters veſſel, as well as there is a great white throne, that from the preſence of him that ſits thereon, this heaven and earth which are not to be ſworne by, do fly away, and no place for them (in that dominion) is to be found.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Aſhur is the rod or ſcepter of his anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is his indignation;</hi> unto theſe high places the Saint of Iſrael is not to be ingaged, for they are all ſubſervant unto him; and thence it is that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that great King performed that peece of ſervice to <hi>Daniels</hi> friends, for the deſtruction of ſuch as were his immediate actors therein, for the manifeſtation of a miraculous deliverance through the appearance of the Son of God in his powerfull preſence with his people, when as they would not ſwear, or be ingaged to the authority and power of that high place, or great King; the like was in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe wrath <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:118751:62"/>
feared, not becauſe he ſaw him who is unſeeable; and in <hi>Hero<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
                  </hi> whom Chriſt looked upon as a Fox fitter to betake himſelfe to the holes of the earth in his carnall power and policy, then to hinder him in that worke the wiſedome of the father of lights had preſcribed him; in the doing of which work he denies his mother to have any intereſt in him, in that way of the earth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Women, what have I to do with thee, my houre is not yet come;</hi> that is, my time is not to come under any carnall command, or authority whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Note in this point how contrary the practice of the common miniſtry of the world is, in ſeeking to be ingaged unto earthly power, as to ſit under that ſhadow and protection, as their onely defence, having confidence therein, as though there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſafety; ſo that if they can but ſtand (with acceptation) by the elbow of a great man, and watch for a nod, or a beck, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a permiſſion to give thankes, pray, or to preach, they count it their chief honour and hapineſſe, and take it for a proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the ſpirit unto them, and ſo it is of that ſpirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are led.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond particular by which we are not to ſwear, is the earth; <hi>Neither by the earth:</hi> The word tranſlated (earth) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a baſe degenerate ſtock, ſuch as in the judgement of man are as perſons illegitimate, not being borne or brought forth unto the excellency, and deſired priviledge of the Sons of men in, and of the world.</p>
               <p>Theſe we are not to be ingaged unto, or to ſwear by, whether in reſpect of the ſtate and condition of perſons, or of any thing baſe in the worlds account; the Saint of Iſrael is not to be taken as bound over, or ingaged unto theſe things, as for their defence, government, ſupply, reliefe, releaſe, or redemption and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in any reſpect, ſo as to be required, and laid claime unto by the world, as their right due, or as a debt from his hands, no more then Satan can lay claym unto any thing that is in Chriſt; for the Son is free from paying tribute unto the world in all the children of the kingdome, onely as time, place, neceſſity, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conveniency, and expediency gives and frames a fitneſſe and opportunity thereunto; ſo do the Saints act, or refraine from acting in all things which the ſpirit of the world ingageth it ſelf
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118751:63"/>
unto, as being bound and yet moſt free; that is, they are all firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound over in themſelves for the liberty and propagating of the Goſpel of God, and they are free likewiſe from whatſoever is out of that ſtate and condition of the Sonne of God, from yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any tribute, or being any way ſo ingaged, as that it ſhould make any true challenge, or lay any claym or title unto them, no more then that rich man could lay claym to the ſervice of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſo much as to bring him one drop of water to cool his tounge.</p>
               <p>Chriſt renders a reaſon why we are not to ſwear by the earth, namely, becauſe it is Gods footſtool; ſo the enemies of Chriſt are ſaid to be made his footſtool, by the Pſalmiſt; for as the powers of the world are as the throne for the exerciſe of Gods diſpleaſure, ſo in the exerciſe and execution thereof, they are troden down under his feete, as ſuch as are of baſe condition and off-ſpring whereon his feet are ſet, as being victour and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of them for ever, therefore the promiſe is, <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lyon, and the adder, the young Lyon and the Dragon ſhalt thou tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under feet.</hi>

                  <p>2. This exhortation is laid down in way of negation, <hi>let your nay be nay;</hi> that is, if ever you finde a time wherein you deny your ſelfe to be ingaged to Satan, either in your creation, or in Gods determination, or if ever you expect a time, or way, and means wherein and whereby you ſhall be diſingaged unto him, and that fully and perfectly, then let your nay be nay; that is, let it be reſolved upon that you were never ingaged unto him, neither are, nor ever ſhall be at no time, nor in any reſpect, elſe it is not that diſingagement of the Sonne of God; for Satan never came to finde any thing in him, bearing the leaſt tincture of his nature, or that held any correſpondency with that evill one in any reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot but wonder many times, when I think of that profeſſion of Chriſt which is made in the world, which for the moſt part is of ſuch things as themſelves cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

                  <p>And ſo ſin is confeſſed upon the head of the Scape-goat to be carryed into the wilderneſſe which is deſolate and way leſſe unto the people of God; neither is he nor it that is the goate, nor the ſin in that true reſpect found in <hi>Iſrael</hi> any more, and ſo ſin it ſet on its probaſe and place of its perpetuall aboad not only in time to come, but paſt alſo; that is, in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the land of <hi>Shyner,</hi> the place of confuſion; wherein note, that the ſtricteſt order com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the wiſdome of man (which is in truth and ſubſtance conſonant to the letter of the Scripture) men being tyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as a rule to walk by, is that proper confuſion of <hi>Babell</hi> unto a Chriſtian unity, becauſe it makes man the fore-runner, and not the Lord Chriſt, who only enters within the vale, where the true oracle is uttered even as it is true, that when the will of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of the ſpirit, is the moſt diſtinctly made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, it appears to be the only confuſion in a carnall mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it layes waſt thoſe proper principles whereby it adorns it ſelf with all its ornaments.</p>
                  <p>Note here, how neceſſary it is for mans wiſdome to moderate it ſelfe in the making of Lawes, and binding men under penalties to take them as rules for all to walk by.</p>
                  <p>And here we propound a queſtion, whether one Law of God be not of like weight as another? for that diſtinction of the firſt Table being more eminent then the ſecond, is meerly humane; for doth not Chriſt center both in two commands, and affirms them to be of like weight: and the Apoſtles bring all into one, ſaying, <hi>love</hi> fulfils the whole law: So that the two Tables do teach unto us the unity of God and man, and that both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118751:65"/>
to the letter of the Law, and alſo of the ſpirit, and therefore the Law is broken by <hi>Moſes</hi> at the foot of the Mount, as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Leviticall Prieſt-hood, exerciſed in the Rebels in the wilderneſſe, and the Law is preſerved and kept by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Arke unto this day as the Scripture affirms, as it is exerciſed in that way of the Spirit, in <hi>Joſhuah</hi> or Jeſus, who leads into the land as that Captain of our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>But however the queſtion ſtands concerning ſtrictneſſe of Law in two commands of the ſecond Table, which are of the ſame weight and importance to every Chriſtian, the one as the other, and that is the not killing, but preſervation of life, and the not committing of adultery in the preſervation of chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>Is there not then a like care to be had, and proviſion made for the preſervation of life, in reſpect of its exiſtance and being, as there is to preſerve chaſtity, that ſo man may appear in honour and temperancy.</p>
                  <p>If there be a like care to be had in both, then I demand how it comes to paſſe, that men make a law to execute death upon that fact of adultery, which reacheth unto the very <hi>Embryon,</hi> and unformed ſubſtance of man in the womb, that ſo they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Baſtard-like brood, and that impure and incontinent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of men in the world.</p>
                  <p>Why are they not alike carefull to ordaine and execute a law upon men, in caſe man and wife know each other, when there is no poſſibility of conception, whereby the life of man ſeems to be deſtroyed and cut off, as conſidered in the very ſame capacity and principles, and ſo upon the like ground murder committed.</p>
                  <p>This caſe may ſeem to be the very point of Chriſts argument brought forth by his practice againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, who ſtood ſo ſtrictly upon the letter of <hi>Moſes</hi> writing, when they brought that woman taken in adultery unto him; who in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the fulfilment of the Law, out of a malicious ſpirit ſeeke to enſnare the Son of God, to kill him, and put him to death, which murthering litterall ſpirit of theirs he convicts them of, and acquits the woman, in that double act of his, in writing on the earth, having reſpect unto the writing of the two Tables of ſtone, ſignifying unto them that killing <hi>letter</hi> bearing ſway in themſelves, whereby they ſought to take away his life, rather
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118751:65"/>
then the womans, by putting the force and dignity of the Law to ſtand in carnall and fleſhly obſervance, and ſo convicted them in his firſt writing upon the earth, as having broken the Law, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the firſt Table; and therein their conſciences accuſe them as guilty of murder, and ſo they abſent themſelves from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And in his ſecond writing on the earth, hee ſignifies that law of the ſpirit, which is for ever kept and preſerved in himſelfe, wherein is found no condemnation, but an acquittance from all ſin and unrighteouſneſſe, and therefore the woman eſcapes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condemnation, when none but Chriſt, according to that law appears with her.</p>
                  <p>A Commentary might be writ of this point, but thus much only as cloſely as may be in way of caution, to prevent men in their ſo confident proſecutions, formed from the <hi>letter of the Scripture,</hi> as they piece-meale it out of the wiſdome of man, left it prove no better in concluſion then the wiſdome of the Serpent; that whilſt they entice to the eating of the fruit of one tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fairneſſe and benefit of it, they do not corrupt and deſtroy another in themſelves in ſo doing, before they be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it.</p>
                  <p>For if ſuch mens wiſdome and wills had taken place in the dayes of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> they would have made a breach in the Geneology of Chriſt: And if they ſay they would have ſtopped execution till the children had been born, then they would not have ſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Wee are then to attend the mind of the ſpirit of God in this; namely <hi>that our yea be yea, and our nay, nay,</hi> wherein the ſcope of the Scriptures do conſiſt, being the ſtate of man-kind with reſpect unto God, which is in one act and for ever, and not in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one Creature or Creatures, with reſpect unto others; that is, to any meer creature or creatures, which may now be <hi>yea, it is,</hi> and immediately <hi>nay, it is not:</hi> but in Chriſt it is not ſo, who is the end of all law, the ſcope of all relations, and the very end which all operations drive at, &amp; preſſe unto, as he is crucified according to the fleſh, or elſe according to the ſpirit; in which reſpect, <hi>yea</hi> remayns <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> remayns <hi>nay,</hi> both in the way of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118751:66"/>
Chriſt, and in the way of Antichriſt: So that he that teacheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing to be the intent and meaning of the word of God, what ever it is that may one time be, and another time not be in the ſame ſtate &amp; condition of man-kind conſidered, that is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine under the ſtate of condemnation: Therfore he backs it with this argument, <hi>Leſt you fall into condemnation.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>Leſt,</hi> is not ſpoken as a ſuppoſition, but as an abſolute affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>You are fallen into condemnation:</hi> As in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the words of <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> are, <hi>Leſt Hezekiah deceive you:</hi> For which in the book of <hi>Kings</hi> is written, <hi>Hezekiah deceiveth you.</hi> So alſo where one Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>Leſt the people faint in the way.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rehearſing the ſame ſtory, ſaith, <hi>The people will faint in the way,</hi> as a certain concluſion thereof; and ſo it is here, <hi>If your yea be not yea, and your nay, nay, you are not fallen into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> therefore Chriſt affirms, <hi>that whatſoever is more</hi> (of the very ſame point) <hi>is of that evill one,</hi> that is, <hi>of the Devill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are to know then, that ſuch Doctrine as teacheth, that it was yea, that certain Angels, and alſo man were made in happy eſtate and condition, but afterwards it was <hi>nay,</hi> for the ſame ſtate and condition became evill. It was <hi>yea,</hi> that Chriſt dyed, and afterwarde it was <hi>nay,</hi> he lived again in the ſame reſpect that hee is ſayd to be dead, according to the ſcope of the Scriptures: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that it is <hi>yea,</hi> the Saints of God are ſinners; but hereafter it ſhall be <hi>nay,</hi> for they ſhall have <hi>nay</hi> ſin; in the ſame reſpect conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered further, it is or was <hi>yea;</hi> that the worſhip of God is or was tyed to ſuch a form, according to the intent of Scripture, but it is or ſhall be <hi>nay;</hi> it either is not now, or hereafter ſhall not be tyed to ſuch a form as it hath been, or now is, according to the intent of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Doctrine of this nature is more then to let <hi>yea</hi> be <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> be <hi>nay,</hi> for it makes the ſame thing to be both <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> which the Apoſtle affirms to be the word of God, not <hi>but it is yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> the ſame for ever in the word of Bleſſing, as alſo in the word of the Curſe.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine then is that way of the fall, and defection from God brings men under the ſtate of death and condemnation, as here our Apoſtle affirms, and hath not ſalvation and life by Chriſt contained in it.</p>

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:118751:66"/>
We are not ignorant of the manifold objections which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in mens hearts, backed by carnall Miniſtry in way of mans wiſdome, drawn from the letter of the Scripture, which we have not ceaſed to ſpeake unto as the Scriptures have given us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
                  <p>Wee ſhall here propound two, and ſpeak a word to each of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the fall of man, which as it is carnallized ſeems to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſin between God and the elect for a time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the confeſſions of the Saints of God of a miſerable condition for preſent.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt we anſwer, that there is a miſerable defection from God, and alſo a happy gathering up into unity with God, both with reſpect unto man-kind, and no other creature whatſoever in heaven or in earth: And as for that Doctrine of Angels in that acceptation the world takes them, it is a meer fiction brought forth by humane wiſdome, brooding upon the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for there is no elect Angell which conſiſts not of the ſame nature which the Angell of the Covenant doth, which is Chriſt Jeſus, God and man, in one ſubſiſtance and being.</p>
                  <p>And again, if there was a ſin in the fall of Angels before the ſin and fall of man, how could the Apoſtle confeſſe himſelfe in that faithfull ſaying, worthy of all acceptation (or to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all the Saints ſo as to acknowledg the ſame) <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe;</hi> or as the word is, <hi>I am the firſt:</hi> So that if there be a ſin before the ſin of man, how can man be ſayd to be the firſt ſinner; this doctrine therfore makes voyd the truth of the Scriptures in every founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>
                  <p>We grant then that there is an abſolute and reall change both in the Son of God, and the ſon of perdition, but what change is from that firſt act of the manner of the being of each of them once and for ever, without other mutation or change otherwiſe: That is to ſay, in the Son of God; the wiſdome proper unto a creature is in the firſt act and manner of his being changed and transformed into the wiſdome and principles peculiar to God himſelfe; and this eſtate is, and abides the ſame for ever which is Chriſt the ſeed of the woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:118751:67"/>
Again, in the ſon of perdition, the wiſdome of God is changed and transformed into the wiſdome and principles peculiar to a creature, and that in the very firſt act and manner of his being; and this eſtate is, and abides for ever the ſame, and is Antichriſt that ſeed of the Serpent, yea that very Serpent the Devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Even as Chriſt is not only that ſeed of the woman, but alſo that ſpirit which over-ſhadoweth her, even God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the word of God never expreſſed it ſelfe, but as a word of wiſdome; therefore it is ſaid by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy workes, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all.</hi> So ſayth <hi>Solomon, The Lord by wiſdome layd the foundation of the earth.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Chriſt is the wiſdome of God, and the power of God.</hi> Therefore out of him there is no wiſdome, ſo that there is no expreſſion of the word of God, or any exiſtance of the work of God, but with reſpect unto Chriſt therefore the firſt words and workes manifeſted by God in the Scriptures is the preaching of Chriſt, which is the glad tydings of ſalvation, the Goſpel of God, which was never known, nor ever ſhall be, but in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and that <hi>through the tender of him in whom the day ſprings from on high to viſue us.</hi> So that in the framing of neaven and earth in the beginning, this mercy-ſeate is erected, whereon thoſe two Cherubims do ſtand, the death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Son of God, and from this mercy-ſeate, and from between theſe two Cherubims the word of God is ever uttered, and did never in any other way expreſſe it ſelfe in the world.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the life and reſurrection of the Son of God in his Saints, and his death and deſcention in men of the world, do face each other, as holding proportion, and being of like capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, even thoſe two Cherubs of mercy and Juiſtice diſtributed in Kingly authority, where ever the mercy-ſeate is ſer up in the publication of the Goſpel; and this life and death holds propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in poynt of time ſo as never life nor death were ever before, or ſhall be after them.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine therefore of Angels and man in a ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and yet out of Chriſt, being changed from that which they were from the beginning, is no doctrine ſavouring of Chriſt in the Goſpel, nor word of life and ſalvation. But only as thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118751:67"/>
ſayings of old of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees, which our Lord Chriſt ſo carefully correcteth, as ſuch as were corrupters of the Law, walking according to the oldneſſe of the letter, and not in the newneſſe of the ſpirit, for arguments of that nature are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with the doctrine of the Goſpel, and faith of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>For to affirm that man is ſometimes in Chriſt, and ſometimes out of Chriſt in the ſame individuall, is all one to affirm, that the Sonne of God is ſometimes in favour with the Father, and ſometimes out of favour with him; which is no leſſe then to ſay, that ſometimes Chriſt the Saviour of the World is true God, and ſometimes he is no God, and then no Saviour at that time at all.</p>
                  <p>And note here for the concluſion of this point, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel is not <hi>yea and nay,</hi> but <hi>yea and Amen, once and for ever.</hi> That the Son of God never was, nor is conſiderable, knowable, or ſpeakable, but in the compleatneſſe of his myſtcall body; in the contriving and device whereof, the wiſdome of God doth properly, yea ſolely conſiſt, for all other things point as with the finger thereunto: So that to deprive Chriſt of that work-manſhip at any time, firſt or laſt, is to deprive God, only and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe, of that his wiſdome, then the which greater <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> cannot be. What change therefore may be concluded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain and belong unto the Son of God, the ſame alſo belongs unto the Saints of God, and that is once for ever.</p>
                  <p>For as there is but one death of Chriſt, ſo there is but one change as one eternall act: and as death is conſiderable in a two-fold reſpect, ſo is the change, and are of the ſame riſe in point of time paſt, and of the ſame race or duration for time to come.</p>
                  <p>No marvaile therefore though men cannot calculate the time when Angels (according to their Doctrine) were created, or when the Devill (as they form him) took his beginning and riſe.</p>
                  <p>But a word of the next point objected againſt this <hi>eternall Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which that Angell that flyes through the midſt of heaven preacheth,</hi> being at a like diſtance from every part of it, all things being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond comprehenſion, and he is a like neare unto all, for the midſt of heaveen is the center of the world, where all points of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens meet and unite themſelves in one.</p>
                  <p>And this ſecond <hi>Objection</hi> conſiſts in the Confeſſions of the

Saints of God, and is a confirmation of the poynt, for which we will inſtance in one for all, and that is the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who is ſaid to be firſt a <hi>Saul,</hi> and afterwards a <hi>Paul;</hi> who firſt <hi>breathed out ſlaughters againſt the Saints,</hi> and afterwards payers, <hi>Behold he prays;</hi> once ſayd <hi>to be the chiefe of ſinners,</hi> and againe <hi>not inferiour to the chiefeſt Apoſtle of Chriſt:</hi> once <hi>a perſecuter of the Church,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>a Preacher of righteouſneſſe in the conſtitution of the Church:</hi> once <hi>a blaſphemer,</hi> and afterwards <hi>utters the high prayſes of God:</hi> once engaged to the high Prieſt of that carnall and degenerate Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of the Jewes, by letters received to execute their enmity <hi>on all that call on the name of Jeſus;</hi> and af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>To which we anſwer; <hi>That whatſoever is ſaid of this holy Apoſtle in point of evill with reſpect unto that vitious and depraved nature of man, it is ſpoken of him only as perſonated in that corrupt courſe and condition of the carnall Jew, ſo as to declare and ſet out unto all the world that ſtock and race of which by nature he comes, even as all men ſpring out of the duſt, which is the proper meate of the Serpent wherewith he is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and kept alive according to the fleſh, and according to the proper bent and propencity thereof brings forth nothing but enmity, corruption, and ſubtilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is duſt and Gods image which are the materials of mans being in his Creation; for there is the ſeed of mans wiſdome as a creature, as well as the ſeed of Gods wiſdome as a Creator, which twayn are mayntained for ever, or elſe Gods workman-ſhip ſhould faile and come to nought; but it is to abide in both reſpects, and that in the height and eminency of each of them, which could never be in one and the ſame ſubject undivided, for they are inconſiſtant; therefore man-kind cannot be known but with reſpect unto ſeed and generation: and ſo theſe are both found in their height in <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Seath,</hi> who is ſet in <hi>Abels</hi> ſtead, and in them the whole work is brought to light, which before lay but as in the <hi>Chaos</hi> or <hi>Embryon</hi> in the man and the woman, ſo that neither is to be annihilated: <hi>No man ſhall kill Caine,</hi> a mark is ſet on him by God, as a ſeale to confirm his life to the fleſh, the very prints and characters of humane wiſdome turning it ſelfe (as ſeale to the wax) to the word or wiſdome of God: So that

as the Sun which hath dominion of the day, and the Moon having dominion of the night, ſhall never faile, but are thoſe faithfull witneſſes of heaven: ſo the ſight of Gods wiſdome hearing rule in the day of ſalvation: and the wiſdome of man as that other great light ruling in darkneſſe over all thoſe Lucubrations of the men of the world, are thoſe faithfull witneſſes of Gods mercy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> therefore ſets forth himſelfe; that is, what he and all men are with reſpect unto that wiſdome exerciſed in that legall, and literall worſhip of ſuch as put Chriſt to death, namely the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jew; thereby declaring unto all men from whence, and from what the word of life hath reſcued and delivered him, in whom the ſtate of all the Saints is perſonated and involved, for the word of God is not of that narrow ſcantling and capacity as to center it ſelfe only in one particular man, but it takes in all men that belongs unto that proper inheritance which it intends in its expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the Scripture then in <hi>Paul</hi> as in all other of the Saints, is to preach Chriſt, and centers not in any particular man otherwiſe, and ſo declares from what he is changed, as he is man to be made the holy one of God for ever: Not that <hi>Paul</hi> was in any time of his life of that corrupt and carnal ſpirit of the wicked Jew; for blaſphemy againſt the ſpirit of God ſhall never be forgiven: Alſo he ſaith of himſelfe, that he was called and ſanctified from the womb, and that hee ſaw Chriſt as one borne out of due time, or as an <hi>abortive;</hi> that is, he reckons himſelfe in the wiſdome of God (which gives him his being, and makes him to be that which he is) as one born out of time; that is, before all time, for no time can comprehend that; and as one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the Sun, that is, the glory of the Creature, to place an excellency therein, but only in that light which ſhined round about him in the way to <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that we may not give theſe execrable things any being, or time, or abode in the Apoſtle of Chriſt, no more then we can give unto him to be a ſervant of ſin at that time when he ſaith, <hi>So then in my mind I my ſelfe ſerve the law of God, but in my fleſh the law of ſinne,</hi> which things are inconſiſtant in one individuall ſubject.</p>
                  <p>For the word of God is an eternall word, and expreſſeth not
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118751:69"/>
it ſelfe but with reſpect unto an eternall act; it is not a tranſient and momentany thing, when it ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>I am a worm and no man, an object, a ſcorn, a bubble, a vapour, a vanity, a nothing; to be in the belly of hell, and in the heart of the earth, to be ſhut up, and cannot get out;</hi> Theſe things are not momentany expreſſions, and tranſient acts, for the word and work of God is no ſuch thing according to the true and reall intent and operation thereof: But they are reall manifeſtations and declarations of what the world hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made of the word and wiſdome of God in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And ſo are theſe expreſſions of <hi>Paul</hi> true manifeſtations, what the condition of a carnall Jew is, and how they deal with Chriſt the wiſdome of God, and ever will do in whomſoever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; from which ſpirit that glorious change wrought once and for ever in Chriſt, hath freed all the Saints, and ſet them in the liberty of the Son of God, which otherwiſe are no better, but by nature the ſame with others.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not creation of man in being made one with God, wherein bleſſedneſſe doth properly conſiſt; but it is that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue of the immortall ſeed, bringing forth unto God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that act of conjunction, whereunto true bleſſedneſſe is annexed; therefore Chriſt is truly ſayd to be made, and alſo to be begotten.</p>
                  <p>For out of that act of Creation in the unity of God and man, not only the wiſdome of God makes it ſelfe manifeſt in giving form unto Chriſt the ſeed of the woman, but alſo that wiſdome of the creature, namely of man, which gives form to the Serpent, who was <hi>more wiſe then any beaſt of the field which the Lord God had made:</hi> And that is the ſeed of the Serpent ſo brought forth, that is, in conſulting with the wiſdome of God from humane prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>This is a faithfull ſaying then of <hi>Paul,</hi> and worthy to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced of all men, ſo as to utter the ſame language, <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chiefe:</hi> For he that cannot acknowledge himſelfe to be the firſt or chiefe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that is to ſay, in his grand Anceſtor being made one in that act of Creation, as he comes of the earth, and ſo in that way of the unbeliever is the firſt perverter of the word of God to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though in himſelfe in his proper ſubſiſtance in the way of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118751:69"/>
the generation of the Son of God, hee is once and for ever freed therefrom, in that deliverance made by Chriſt: ſo that it is none of his inheritance or portion, otherwiſe no man can ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg himſelfe to be bleſt and poſſeſſed with the firſt and chief righteouſneſſe that ever was, namely that righteouſneſſe of God in Jeſus Chriſt, nor know himſelfe to be a firſt-born of God, an heyr of the promiſe, and an inheritance of life that laſts for ever. And ſo we come to the fourth part of the Chapter, contayning that fruitfull and wholſome benefit, which ſpring from the death of Chriſt in all true Chriſtians, the firſt whereof is layd downe in the next verſe.</p>

of the Son of God, conſider, 1. The ſignification of the word. 2. How it is to be taken in this place as an anſwer to the interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or effectuall and forcible ſentence. To pray, is to make an appeale, it is an <hi>appellation,</hi> or <hi>interceſſion;</hi> for the originall word in the Hebrew tongue, which the Prophets uſe for prayer, is <hi>Hithpallel,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>appeale,</hi> or preſent a mans ſelfe, or cauſe to the Judg, and it comes of <hi>pillel,</hi> which ſignifies to judg or determine cauſes, for which appeals are made.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To pray therefore, is to make our appeale from one Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeate unto another; that is, from the judgment and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of mans wiſdome, opinion, and ſentence, to that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and device of the Son of God, <hi>who judgeth not as man judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: For as farre as the heavens are higher then the arth,</hi> ſo is the way of the judgment of God higher than all the Thrones and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeats of the ſons of men; therefore the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> that were carnall, <hi>That it ſeemes a ſmall thing to him to be judged of them,</hi> or of <hi>mans judgment,</hi> or of <hi>mans day,</hi> as the word is; that is, by the light underſtanding or wiſdome humane, only he ſtands to the judgment and wiſdome of God, ſo as he <hi>judgeth not himſelfe;</hi> that is, by his own wiſdome as a man, but by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and light of the ſpirit of God: Therefore the Pſalmiſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playns, ſaying, <hi>Many there be that ſay of my ſoule, there is no hope for him in God, Selah:</hi> but he appeals unto God as to his ſhield, <hi>and the lifter up of his head, but thou O Lord art a ſhield about me;</hi> that is, a defence from all adverſe power ſet forth and ſignified in <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi> conſpiracy; <hi>and the lifter up of my head,</hi> or head-ſhip, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me to be head of the people, and not <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and that only through thy wiſdome, where the wiſdome, counſell and craft of <hi>Achitophel</hi> cannot take place; prayer therefore is an appeal from one judgment-ſeate to another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prayer is to ſpeake, or plead a cauſe: ſo ſaith the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Whilſt I was ſpeaking in prayer, preſenting my ſupplication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord my God, for the holy mountaine of my God, even while I was yet ſpeaking, the man Gabriel,</hi> or the <hi>ſtrength of God came flying vehemently and touched me.</hi> It is a word or ſpeech by which the ſtrength of God haſts it ſelfe, and makes ſpeed to lay hold upon the ſoule: So <hi>David</hi> cals it a ſpeech, ſaying, <hi>My heart was hot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, whilſt I was muſing the fire burned, and I ſpake with my tongue, Lrrd make me to know mine end,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:118751:71"/>
3. Prayer is to ſupplicate and intreat; ſo ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Return we beſeech thee O God of hoſts:</hi> And again, <hi>I beſeech thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my ſoule:</hi> And again, <hi>Save now I beſeech thee O Lord, O Lord I beſeech thee ſend now proſperity.</hi> So ſayth <hi>Moſes, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory.</hi> Prayer is the office and property of a ſupplicant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Prayer is to judg and determine a cauſe (as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heare me when I call O God of my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> (or juſtice) that is, of my juſt and righteous cauſe: and agayn, <hi>Judge me O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity, I have truſted in the Lord, I ſhall not ſtagger:</hi> And againe, <hi>Heare me when I call, and anſwer my prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for God to judg the cauſe of his Saints, to heare prayer, and to anſwer when they cry unto him, is to give right ſentence, and to determine the matter: which thing is not done in another ſtate and condition, but in that individuall being and ſtate of a Chriſtian in that Saint of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or holy one, the judgment is not paſſed, and ſentence given of the cauſe and matter, by or from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſubſiſtence or being: but in that ſubſiſtance and conſiſtance of the Son of God, the hearing, anſwering, judging, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and paſſing ſentence of, or upon any cauſe or matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by prayer, is no further off, nor at any other diſtance from the ſtate and being of a Chriſtian, then the cauſe or matter is which is preſented, for they both flow from, and are acts of the ſame ſpirit, as <hi>man aſcending</hi> in the word of God for ſupply, and the word of God <hi>diſcending in man,</hi> to declare its fulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>So that there is in prayer a juſt appeale from the wiſdome and practice of the world unto God; and there is in it alſo an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſute and reall act of a ſupplicant and intreater for favour, yea and the pleading and laying open of a righteous cauſe before the Judge of all the earth, together with the hearing, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, judging, determining, and paſſing Sentence thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>And every one of theſe are as really intrinſicall, and of the ſame nearneſſe to a Chriſtian, making all for his proper being and ſubſiſtance as well one of them as another; neither ſhall he for ever be without any one of them, but they ſhall be as an harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mellody in the ſoule or life of a Chriſtian for ever, which if we deny, we hold not the unity of faith according to that <hi>compleat
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118751:71"/>
and myſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but make a fraction therein to the deviding of that holy one of God, which is that ſtate of unbeleif, on which wrath abides.</p>
                  <p>So that when a Chriſtian ceaſeth to judge between ſinne and righteouſneſſe, between Chriſt and Belial, when he ceaſeth to diſcerne the difference between light and darkneſſe, between God and the Devill, then prayer ſhall have an end and ceaſe in the ſpirit of a Chriſtian, and not till then; for it is the very <hi>breath of the Sonne of God,</hi> whereby he lives the life of God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
                  <p>Note from this point, as it hath been often declared unto us how the prayers of the world, not onely in ſet forms, but in the more refined Preiſthood fall ſhort of the nature of the interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>who ever lives to make interceſſion,</hi> not onely <hi>for,</hi> but <hi>in us,</hi> without ſtraining of the word, ſo that they deny the nature of the prayer and interceſſion of Chriſt, in this great point of its continuation.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in like manner their doctrine muſt needs fall ſhort of that meſſage of life and ſalvation, and ſo much for the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word <hi>prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond point is in what acceptation it is to be taken here, and that is for an <hi>appeal,</hi> implying hereby thus much, as if in more words he ſhould ſay, have you loſt all your own humane and fading excellencies, in the proper life and ſpirit of all your earthly and momentany relations, for the moſt honourable loſſe of them is, <hi>when we are cut off from them in our hearts, in the preſent injoyment of them,</hi> as in covenants, contracts, and combinations with the creature, that carnall and topped up height of all your places of worldly dignities: have you picked out that common ſtamp, in all your relations and operations, which the ſpirit of <hi>the ſerpent ſets upon them,</hi> making them appear beautifull and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and are you diminiſhed and corrected, as having all ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous branches lopt away from you, as yeilding no ſhelter, nor glory or ſafeguard unto you. Take it for granted that it is ſo, yet here is a ſufficient ſupply and remedy, make your addreſſes and appeal unto God in Chriſt, in whom they are all full, and that in an eternall compleat and perfect ſupply, as things that are onely proper and peculiar to the glory and duration of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118751:72"/>
Son of God, and not to that mortall, fading, and ſhamefull race and pedegree of the ſons of earthly men, whoſe breath as a vapour is in their noſtrils; for in Chriſt you ſhall have and be both king and ſubject, and ſo ſhall never fail nor betray himſelfe, which no earthly man can attaine, for he is that <hi>ruler in ſubmiſſion</hi> as the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> calls him; for there is the truth of rule and ſubmiſſion in Chriſt as one, and both in the utmoſt excellency thereof, though men tranſlate the word, as a charge to obey ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. To that effect the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>I John who am alſo your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdome, and patience of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> or as the word is rightly rendred, <hi>in the kingdome and under-abiding of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So that he is a companion in <hi>kingdom,</hi> that is, in power and authority, and alſo in <hi>under-abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> or in a perpetuated ſubmiſſion to the will of the father: ſo that in the ſtate of Chriſtianity there is all the relations, acts, and waits of adminiſtration of the kingdome, all relations and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſpects are there in act, and are fulfilled as in a kingdome of eternall glory and power, and that onely in the loſſe and villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of nothing elſe but an earthly fading and corruptible Crown, which <hi>Paul</hi> counts <hi>as dung, and loſſe,</hi> as the ſhame and undoing of man, that he may win the Diadem and glory of the other.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in it you ſhall have that mutuall relation of husband and wife in that glorious and happy eſpouſall of Chriſt, for <hi>he that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit with him,</hi> or one ſpirituall eſtate and condition, in which is compleated, and fulfilled all thoſe mutuall and conjugal relations, acts, and operations of the married eſtate, in the reality thereof, in which the nuptiall day and joyful feaſtivity never ceaſeth; nor can time be found where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may not be ſaid; <hi>Behold this is the day of ſalvation, behold now the accepted time,</hi> yea this <hi>is the day which the Lore hath made, let us be glad and rejoyce therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover in the ſtate of a Chriſtian you ſhall finde the relation of father and ſon, for <hi>the Father and I are one,</hi> there is the language of the ſon of God, and that in all the wayes and adminiſtrations, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And further, in it you have the ſtate and relation of high Preiſt and people, and that in all thoſe ſeverall reſpects of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſervices, and oblations, together with their reſpective virtues and operations in point of that reconciliation and agreement made between God and man in the multiplyed comfort thereof, exerciſed in that houſe and temple not made with hands, but is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall in that heaven, or height of happineſſe in Chriſt, who is that dwelling place of the moſt high.</p>
                  <p>But time would faile to ſpeak of theſe things, becauſe they are infinitely uncountable, and unmeaſurable in all their relations, offices, reſpects, and operations, which are through that device of God in chriſt to be attained in this appeal: becauſe God himſelf who is <hi>infinite, emence,</hi> and <hi>eternall,</hi> gives being unto, and is the reallity of them all, and yet man is really in the uſe, comfort, exiſtance, and exerciſe of them all, even as it is true that the ſoul is properly the fountaine, and cauſe of all the motions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the body, and yet the body is really in the exerciſe, and hath the participation of them all.</p>
                  <p>For in this appeal is fulfilled that law of the ſpirit, which <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaith <hi>is fulfilled in us;</hi> ſo alſo ſpeaks the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>the new Commandement is fulfilled in him and in us, becauſe the darkneſſe is paſt;</hi> that is, that which is proper and incident unto the creature, <hi>and the true light ſhineth;</hi> that is, that which is proper unto God is broke forth and appeareth in us, for a law cannot conſiſt of one but muſt have reſpect unto twaine, otherwiſe there is no bond, therefore the law of the ſpirit is not contrived, takes form, or holds in any point thereof, but as it conſiſts of God and man in that faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in which or in whom ſtands all our Lordſhip and ſalvation: for howſoever in the world <hi>there be Gods many, and Lords many, yet unto us there is but one Godhead</hi> who is Lord over all, and <hi>one Lordſhip</hi> which abides and remains the ſame for ever.</p>
                  <p>Are we then at a loſſe in the world, enjoying nothing that can abide by us, as <hi>Abraham ſojourned in Canaan,</hi> as the land is carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, <hi>not injoying the bredth of a foot thereof:</hi> as <hi>Stephen,</hi>

that faithful Martyr, or witneſſe, makes report.</p>
                  <p>Let us make our appeal, for in this off-ſpring and ſeed of God, the whole inheritance in all its excellencies is perfected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in us, as the wole land was given to <hi>Abraham</hi> in his ſeed, after the enduring of ſo great affliction.</p>
                  <p>So that in this appeal is contained a ſupply of every want, a comfort againſt every affliction, a reſtauration of every loſſe, as being that year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> or <hi>Jubel, the time of carrying or leading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,</hi> as the word imports, into that ancient liberty, reſt, and riches that are in the Son of God; wherein wee finde an infinite augmentation and increaſe of all things (wherein) with reſpect to the world, we are diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p>And hence the ſecond Query is added of purpoſe, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flows from this, with the anſwer or direction annexed.</p>

                  <p>By being merry, pleaſant, or joyfull, in this place, is meant the joy of harveſt or firſt fruits, or that triumphant mirth, and joyful feaſtivity and ſplendant liberty exerciſed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> when the land brought forth ſo plenteouſly of it ſelfe, without the labour and toyle of the people, or any means uſed by humane hands or adminiſtrations, no not ſo much as to gather it in, but feed upon the fruits where they were found naturally growing in the land, which is here alluded unto, to ſet forth that abundant ſupply and furniture to be found in this our appeale, which yeeldeth unto us through Gods appointment without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane help, all thoſe liberties, priviledges, riches, and reſt, which anciently have appertained unto the Sonne of the eternall God.</p>

Which is the ſong of old <hi>Simeon, Mary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Deborah,</hi> and <hi>Barack,</hi> and of all the Saints of God from the beginning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now; For there is none that can appeal unto God in prayer, removing the cauſe from carnall reaſon into his wiſdome, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a holy plea, in opening the neceſſities of mankinde unto God, carrying up, and giving true intelligence of the ſame unto him; but that man whatever he be, can alſo bring down, and diſtribute unto the world, the true ſtate and condition of the Son of God, who is the ſubject matter of the Goſpel, and give undoubted intelligence of that peace and plenty which is in the kingdome of God, uttering and declaring <hi>how good the Lord is</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Note then from this point as a concluſion thereof; That the true ſpirit of prayer and ſupplication, and the ſpirit of Propheſie and interpretation, are never ſeperated, never were, nor never ſhall be, but are of an eternall unity and conjunction in the faith of Chriſt; and hence it is, that the <hi>Elders and inſtructors of the Church</hi> are brought in as having the ſpirit of prayer, to pray for the Church in the next Verſe following.</p>

certainty, and as taken for granted: and by ſickneſſe we are not to underſtand onely a diſtemper of the body, no nor yet ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſorrow, greif, or diſquiet of the minde, which the word may ſeem to import; but we are to take it as large as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did; <hi>when he heard that his father was ſick,</hi> he preſently takes his two ſons unto him (as giving him up for dead) to be bleſſed in his death and departure; for it is in this caſe as it was with <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> when he was ſick unto death, which if he had not been, his life had never been renewed as it was: and as his life was reſtored through the ſpirit of propheſie in <hi>Iſajah,</hi> ſo here the life of the ſick is reſtored by the ſpirit of prayer in the Elders, and as the ſpirit of prayer was in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> elſe had not the propheſie taken place, <hi>For he turned his face to the wall and prayed:</hi> Even ſo is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of propheſie converſant in this ſick party, or elſe the prayer of the Elders cannot be effectuall, which ſpirit of propheſie appears <hi>in his calling for the Elders,</hi> as foreſeeing health to ariſe out of that ſpeciall appointment and ordination of the wiſdome of God.</p>
               <p>And as a miraculous ſigne was given at the recovery of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> namely the <hi>Sun going back ten degrees in the dyall of Ahaz,</hi> that wicked King, to declare that the light and wiſdome of the world by which the men thereof rule and reigne over their brethren goeth directly backward, and contrary <hi>to that ſun of righteouſneſſe,</hi> light and wiſdome proper unto the Saints: and that it is for ever ſo to be conſidered, is ſignified by <hi>thoſe ten degrees,</hi> which number hath the myſtery of eternity taught in it, for ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, ſaying, <hi>a baſtard ſhall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord unto the tenth generation,</hi> which in the next verſe he concludes to be for ever: Even ſo here is the ſigne of the holy unction given to this ſick party, to ſignifie his reception from the dead, even as <hi>Abraham received his Sonne as from the dead</hi> in his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Preiſts office in ſacrificing and offering him up unto God.</p>
               <p>This ſickneſſe therefore is as that of <hi>Lazarus whom Jeſus loved;</hi> for when his ſiſter told Jeſus that he was ſick, it is plaine by the record in computation of the time, that he was then dead; which Chriſt affirmes is not death, but that way of the operation, and manifeſtation of the glory of God, which onely and for ever ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

and ſetteth forth it ſelfe, through the death of the fleſh; that is, the death of all humane and carnal reaſonings, reſolutions, and concluſions, in point of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt; which ſickneſſe or death to all the legall and litteral ſervices, according to the carnall law is truly ſaid to be not unto death, becauſe it is unto that eternall life of the Son of God, and a ſickneſſe of this nature we are to underſtand in this place, or elſe we carnallize the ſickneſſe, as ſurely as <hi>Rome</hi> doth at this day the <hi>Elderſhip,</hi> as alſo <hi>New-England,</hi> more zealouſly then they, and the reaſon is, becauſe the one is <hi>Hehetated</hi> with worldly pomp, and the other is <hi>Perſequentiſſimus,</hi> but hath not yet attained thereunto.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118751:75"/>
hath the ſpirit of Propheſie in it, whereby he diſcerns wherein true health doth conſiſt, and knows what the Elderſhip is, and where to finde <hi>the true Church,</hi> which is ſo controverted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the earth, in all ages of this preſent world: ſo that if this ſick party had not perfect viſion, he might <hi>wander from mountaine to hill, and from the flood to the worlds end,</hi> before he could attaine the true knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>For ſome ſay, <hi>lo here is Chriſt,</hi> and ſome ſay <hi>lo there,</hi> which we are not to beleive neither the one nor the other; ſome ſay, <hi>he is in the deſert;</hi> and ſome ſay; <hi>he is in the mountain;</hi> and ſome, in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Chamber: but as the lightning ſhineth from one end of heaven unto the other, ſo is the coming of the Sonne of man;</hi> that is to ſay, all things that ever were or ſhall be, proclaime his preſent abode in man-kinde either in point of his life, or death, in mercy, or elſe in his ſeverity, and ſuch are the confines of the Church, it is not bounded within the circuit of time, place, or perſon, no more then the Son of God is; for his Spouſe holds proportion with himſelfe in all points, therefore is ſhe admired as one that <hi>looks forth as the morning, faire as the moon, clear as the Sun, terrible as an Army with banners:</hi> nay it is ſaid to be his body, <hi>the fulneſſe of him that filleth all in all:</hi> So that to form and faſhion a Church of leſſe comprehenſion then Chriſt, will prove rather a Sinagogue of Satan, or cage of unclean birds, then the ſpouſe of Chriſt: ſo that our Chronologers deceive the world, in framing a Chriſt onely by genealogie, not knowing what the Prophet meaneth when he ſaith, <hi>he was taken from priſon, &amp; from judgment, and who ſhall declare his generation, he was war cut off from the land of the living, and made his grave with</hi> (or in) <hi>the wicked, and in the rich in his death;</hi> it ſeems <hi>Philip (that man of war)</hi> is not joyned to their Chariot (as his name ſignifies.)</p>
               <p>And ſo they frame a Church not onely by ſeperation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from others by ſome carnall and temporary ceremonies, that they may ſay, <hi>Stand by thy ſelfe, I am holier then thou.</hi> If theſe be their defences from the wicked, they had need carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them through death, or elſe the fence being down, they will go near to come over and feed with them in the ſame paſture.</p>
               <p>But this is not all the ſeperation they make, for they divide the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:118751:76"/>
word of God, &amp; ſeperate it, to form their Church, ſaying, that ſuch portions of the word of God were for the form of the <hi>Church</hi> in ſuch an age of the world, &amp; for ſuch people; but now another portion of it gives the forme in our dayes, as though the word of God were dead, or falne aſleep unto the world in ſome injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and promiſes, but alive and awake in others, whereas they may as wel change and alter the form and manner of the being of the Son of God, as to change and alter the form, and manner of being of the Church of God; for the word of God in whatſoever it hath expreſſed, is the <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>law</hi> of God, and the will of God cannot change, and Chriſt is the end of the law: ſo that if we fall ſhort of him in any portion of the word of God, as though he had been in it, but now is paſſed over it, or as though it intended him, but yet hath not brought him forth, we make it the word of man, and not the word of God; for mans reaſon is the proper word of man, even as the wiſdome of God in that wonderfull contriving of his Son, is the word of God; and therefore man is ſaid to be made a living, or a ſpeaking ſoule, or life of ſpeech, or reaſon, whereby he tranſcends all other creatures excepting none; for no Angel, that is, meſſenger, or meſſage was ever ſent from God unto the world out of man-kinde.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, that the word of God hath expreſſed it ſelfe, as in divers Nations, <hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> in differing generations, or genealogies, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Nahor, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the like, as teaching higher and more tranſcendant things thereby; Therefore to reſt in theſe as being the intent and ſcope of the Scriptures, without ſeeing and acknowledging the life and death of Chriſt in them, both according to the fleſh, and alſo according to the ſpirit; we may by as good skill of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation center and terminate the minde of God in making any or all thoſe viſible creatures in heaven and in earth, in that proper work, without having any reſpect at all unto man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and make them the utmoſt and extreameſt point of Gods thoughts and intent, which were no better then to diſinherit the Son of God, making a baſtard and no Son of him, being they were all made to do ſervice unto him, and to ſtand up, and joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and skilfully point as with the finger to direct either to his perpetuall, life, or death, as being the reality, and ſubſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118751:76"/>
of them all; the forme of a Church therefore as conſtituted into particulers now in the world, is of no more weight or worth in a Chriſtian minde then any other order wherein men are converſant in wayes of civillity, <hi>ſo called;</hi> for if once we finde the ſubſtance <hi>by the light of that day that ſprings from on high,</hi> the darkneſſe of night, and ſhadow flye away.</p>
               <p>So as nothing looks amiable upon us, but onely <hi>glory in the higheſt, and peace in the earth, to that man of good will who dwels in the buſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the ſpirit of Propheſie therefore, or of true interpretation that cals in the Elderſhip, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſees this ſicknes or death, to be that renovation of the health &amp; life of man-kinde in Chriſt, from that carnall life which the world lives, from living unto earthly and tranſitory things, to live unto heavenly and everlaſting things, ſuch as abide for ever; therefore it is ſaid, that fifteen years are added unto the life of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> which number conſiſts of ten, and five; ten hath in it the myſtery of eternity, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; and five hath in it the myſtery of multiplication, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that variety and uncountable wayes of health and life which in all reſpects and ways of relation are multiplied and exerciſed in that myſticall body and ſtate of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore no ſpeech of the multiplication of any of Gods works till the fifth day, to ſhew the myſtery of this number; therefore it is that <hi>Joſeph</hi> brings five of his brethren before <hi>Pharoah</hi> to ſignifie the multiplication of bleſſings upon the land by all the family, ſeeing ſo manny had come upon it by his being there as one; the like is in <hi>Benjamins</hi> meſſe, ſent in by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> five times ſo much as any of the reſt, to ſhew the multiplication of his love to that his brother, who only came of the beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> together with himſelfe.</p>
               <p>In the recovery out of this ſickneſſe, or renewing of life from the dead, we are to conſider what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>viz. Except the wheat corne dye, it multiplies not;</hi> that is, except Chriſt the ſeed of God dye, he multiplies not; in which we are to know, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature ſimply conſidered in it ſelfe, is not the ſeed of God, no more then the ſeed of mankinde is ſimply in the male, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively in male and female, elſe it produceth not, to multiply its kinde, and <hi>every tree hath ſeed in it ſelfe,</hi> therefore <hi>the man is not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:118751:77"/>
without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord.</hi> They are but one tree; that is, one eſtate and condition: even ſo the ſeed of God is whole Chriſt, God and man made one, and this wheat corne or ſeed muſt dye, or elſe it brings not forth the true kinde and off-ſpring of the Son of God; that is, it muſt be ſick and dye to all carnall and corruptible things, or elſe it never brings forth that multiplyed fruit of the ſpirit which is in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, to call (in this place) for the Elders is not meant, the <hi>mendicimonium</hi> of a man, without magnanimity and courage, as one crouching unto a courſe and carnall Elder made with hands; that is, ſet up and created by men, who can come unto the aſſembly, and a private perſon; but before it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, is a pulick perſon, a reverend Elder.</p>
               <p>But this call is an anthetique and princely ſummons of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Prophet; for this ſickneſſe hath in it the virtue and voyce of a ſummons to convent <hi>the true phyſitian multiplyed into an holy and honourable Elderſhip,</hi> the conſultation and practice of whom is the cure of the ſoule, even as the life and frolick preſumption of the arme of fleſh hath in it a ſufficient ſummons to bring in the works of unrighteouſneſſe to that appearance of Antichriſt, who is that poyſonfull dragon and deſtroyer of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Yea this call is the voyce of the ſpouſe, <hi>being dead to her firſt hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> and having <hi>forgotten her fathers houſe</hi> in the forſaking of all her <hi>kindred,</hi> through which <hi>her ſpeech becomes ſweet, and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance comely for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond point is, who theſe Elders are; They are not the Elders of particular Congregations, compoſed and ordered by man, under that deceivable terme of reformed Churches, as in theſe days, which are but like to the ſheards of a potters veſſell, which cannot be ſet together or ſodred, no more then they can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring themſelves into unity; for the ſpirit of that kingdome is divided in it ſelfe, and therefore can never ſtand in the way of that reſurrection by Chriſt, but are in the way of that apoſtacy and fall of man from his Creator, endeavouring ſtill to become as Gods by the wiſdome of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve then, for the clearing of this point, who they are which our Apoſtle writes unto in this Epiſtle, and that is to

which is the truth and ſubſtance of all community; <hi>whether we be preſent or abſent in body, we are one in that ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> The word of Propheſie therfore, which is ever accompanied with prayer, as in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or that word of true interpretation of the word of God, knows how to give ſummons unto, and call in the life and ſpirit of kingdome and Preiſthood into fellowſhip with it ſelfe, which is that healthfull ſpirit, or unction that is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Add further, this ſickneſſe is the very foot of the throne, upon which that great Elder, even the ancient of dayes ſits; for when <hi>Daniel beholds through this ſpirit of interpretation, he ſees thrones ſet up;</hi> or as the word will bear, <hi>thrones caſt down,</hi> at you may ſee how the tranſlators give it in both phraſes, ſignifying thereby that the power and glory of the world is caſt down whereſoever this great Elderſhip is ſet up, which is of no leſſe antiquity <hi>then is the eternall, that gives Judgement into the hands of the Saints of the moſt high,</hi> and poſſeſſeth them with the kingdome, for none but the eternall can give an eternall inheritance, and he gives it not but as he ſits on this throne, namely the glory of man caſt down, and the gravity of this <hi>ancient of days</hi> ſet up, <hi>whoſe garments are white as ſnow, and the haire of his head like pure wooll;</hi> and ſuch is the royalty and authority of the Elderſhip here intended, who are not brought in by any other call but by the Propheſie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the minde of God; therefore it is, that the viſion ſpeaks ſo punctually and particularly, where and with whom <hi>Peter</hi> is to be found.</p>
               <p>Note here, that even as the life of the fleſh, through the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſpirit, admits none into unity, nor inveſts any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper condition, but onely ſuch as are of its own kinde; ſo the life of the ſpirit which is in Chriſt Jeſus, through the crucification of the fleſh, admits none into fellowſhip, nor inveſts any into its proper ſtate and condition but its owne kinde.</p>

                  <hi>For what is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and what is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit;</hi> and therefore none but the firſt-born of God are of this Elderſhip, or callers of them into the exerciſe of their proper vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and authority, even as it was with the Apoſtles <hi>when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce peace;</hi> if the ſon of peace be not there, their peace returns

upon themſelves, and their abode is not in that houſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By theſe Elders then in the third place, we ſee what we are to underſtand by the Church they are of; that is, that unity and fellowſhip which the ſelected and choſen people of God are of, and have in that fellowſhip and faith of Jeſus Chriſt, as they are conſidered, not in one age, much leſſe in one Pariſh or company of people gathered together, but as they are univerſally conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all ages and times of the world.</p>
               <p>For ſuch as is the extent of the ſpirit, by which every Saint lives, and of thoſe offices of Chriſt; by vertue whereof, the exerciſe of ſuch extent is the true Church ever to be held and taken, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the Church is carnallized, and caſt into the mould of the letter that kills, and not into the mould of the ſpirit that gives life. So that to thruſt up Chriſt as into a corner, as in one age of the world, or to monopolize him amongſt a handfull of people is all one as to put him in the grave, though with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> a Ruler among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that rich man <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi> both night Diſciples for fear of the <hi>Jews;</hi> they may ſeem to differ from <hi>Herod,</hi> in that they perfume the dead body and wrap it in clean linnen, being affected therewith, but it is but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of the Jewiſh Sinagogue, for they put it in the grave, and roll a great ſtone thereupon, as men without hope or deſire of the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> having that common ſpirit that now lives in the world to beg leave of the <hi>Pilates,</hi> and great men thereof, before they dare adventure to trim up the dead body of Jeſus, and fit it for the Sepulchre: But this univerſall Church of which theſe Elders are, is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>mount Zion, the City of the living God, the new Jeruſalem, the generall aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born, which are enrolled in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch as conſtitute and ſet up a Church not of this nature and comprehenſion, they build it up upon mount Sinai, under the terrors of the law, and ſprinckle the inſtruments and officers there of as with the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> ſpeaking from the ground, or earthly heart of <hi>Cain:</hi> and not on mount Zion, in that blood of ſprinkling, which ſpeaks better things, in that peaceable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reconcilement of God and man in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Note here, <hi>that where two or three are gathered together in any part
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118751:79"/>
of the world,</hi> or at any time, we deny it not to be the true Church of Chriſt; but what is it which gives it its capacity to be that Church of Chriſt? is it not he who is in the <hi>midſt,</hi> or in the <hi>heart</hi> of them, as the word is, who is no leſſe then that <hi>everlaſting father, or that ancient of dayes;</hi> what bounds then can be ſet unto it leſſe then that which gives it its capacity, to be ſuch a thing who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends himſelfe to the <hi>whole family of heaven, for unto him all faces looke,</hi> and <hi>every knee bowes:</hi> and if once it be ſo in our ſelves, we ſee it in the whole family and flock of God in all the elect.</p>
               <p>So that the true ſum &amp; volume of all their doctrine and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is of no leſſe extent, then the whole myſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt, otherwiſe it is not the word or Goſpel of the kingdome, nor the ſpirit of interceſſion which is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be ſayd, <hi>that theſe things crncern the inviſible Church, and not the viſible, for the true viſible Church is otherwiſe to be conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which we anſwer; that it is a work of as great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to frame a viſible Church of Chriſt, as to frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a viſible body of Chriſt; therefore the Apoſtle comparing the true Church to a body, ſayth, <hi>For as the body being one hath many members, and all the members of that body being many, are but one body, ſo alſo Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And agayn, hear what the ſpirit ſayth by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> viz. <hi>As he is, ſo are we, even in this world,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>So that to frame and compoſe a viſible Church, and to frame and compoſe a viſible Chriſt, are of the ſame nature, and of like eaſe and difficulty, and are alike ſtrange unto the world, and of the ſame acceptation to bring into manifeſtation and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Yet we know that Chriſt in both reſpects (for otherwiſe we know him not) is truly apparent and viſible, as alſo ſecret and unſeen. For <hi>Moſes</hi> by faith <hi>ſaw him</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>who is inviſible)</hi> that is, he ſaw him who is unſeeable, and both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true in a diverſe reſpect.</p>
               <p>And they who frame a Chriſt viſible in one age of the world, and not in another, they do by the ſame argument conclude the viſible Church to appear, and to be manifeſt only within the ſame confines and precincts of time wherein Chriſt appeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:118751:79"/>
For the Church was never known to appeare but in the reall form of Gods righteouſneſſe and wiſdome, which is Chriſt, for <hi>he is the wiſdome of God, and the righteouſneſſe of God by ſaith,</hi> which is the reality of the Church: and as for all imaginary Churches, we skill not, for they will vaniſh and come to nought, together with the profeſſors of them, as they have done in all ages.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuch as form a Chriſt unto themſelves to appear viſibly unto a carnall eye, ſo as to accept and approve of that his way of appearance, at the carnall and perfunctory worſhippers of the Jewes did. Know this, that whenſoever the true Chriſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, he will receive at the hands of ſuch the ſame meaſure which was meaſured out unto Jeſus born of the Virgin, by <hi>Herod, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate, Scribes, Phariſees,</hi> with the cry of all the people, ſaying, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him, away with him, crucifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even ſo, they that frame unto themſelves a viſible Church, ſo as to appeare unto a carnall eye or underſtanding, as being in a capacity to approve and like well of it, at the leaſt for a certaine ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Whenſoever the true Church makes it ſelfe viſible, it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive like meaſure at the hands of ſuch perſons, to the utmoſt of their power and ability, as Chriſt did when he appeared unto the Jewes: For in ſuch perſons, and in that ſpirit is the zeale of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution properly founded in the viſible and apparant exerciſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreover they that form a viſible Church, as not having the inviſible vertue alike efficatious in every part and member thereof, they alſo form unto themſelves a viſible Chriſt to appear, without aving the compleat vertue of the wiſdome and power of God in all reſpects in him, either in point of his being, or in the order and manner of his being; and this is that great Image of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> which hath beeen ſo long erected and ſet up in the world, where the Scriptures are traditionally acknowledged and read, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> all muſt bow down unto at the noiſe of their inſtruments and inſtitutions, or elſe the fiery tryall muſt paſſe upon them that obey not: Only this is our comfort, that the Son of God will ſo appear with them, or in them, that ſo much as a ſmell of that zeal or fiery fume and wrath of the world ſhall not appeare upon them, but ſerve only to the deſtruction of ſuch as are zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in ſuch matters of the worlds melody.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:118751:80"/>
The next point is the exerciſe of the Elders, and the firſt is, <hi>they pray over him,</hi> or for him, or without any wrong to the Text <hi>with him;</hi> that is, in communion and fellowſhip with him; for there was never prayer of faith made unto God, out of which any elect or choſen veſſel was excluded; the reaſon is, becauſe every accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table prayer hath in it the vertue of the interceſſion of Chriſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is not in his name and authority, and the ſpirit of Chriſt neglects not any one that appertayns to his myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for if it ſhould, that ſoule could never be inſpired with the ſpirit of prayer, without which there is no participation in the mediation of the Son of God, and then no acceptation with the Father; therefore prayer is communicative to all the Saints, if it be as the prayer of faith, it is as the life-blood running into all the veyns of the whole body; for none can enter into the holy place but he that carries all the Tribes upon his heart; it is not our temporary and private wants, which can bring forth a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayer to God; for <hi>as propheſie is not of any private ſpirit or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, but holy men ſpeake as they are moved by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> of like publique ſpirit is true prayer.</p>
               <p>So that this ſick party is in unity with the prayer here ſpoken of; for the elderſhip of this Church, or that eternized fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the ancient of dayes, never appears unto any in that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous vertue of healing, but in way of unity with the party healed. Therefore it is, that <hi>Chriſt will have the ſtone rouled away from the Sepulchre,</hi> that nothing interpoſe betwixt <hi>Lazarus</hi> and himſelfe, when he reſtores him from death to life.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Eliſha will be ſhut up in the ſame roome with the widows ſonne,</hi> when hee rayſeth him up from the dead; and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>falls upon Eutichus and embraceth him,</hi> when he brings his ſpirit into him agayn.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, where this true Elderſhip appears, it ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates a like vertue to every individuall of the body, for <hi>the ſpirit is not received by meaſure;</hi> for that which in it ſelfe is emence, cannot be received by meaſure; they that go about to perſwade men that ſome have a greater portion of the ſpirit, and ſome have a leſſe meaſure thereof, they may upon as good grounds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that ſome ſhall be ſaved, and be happy and bleſſed a long time, and ſome a ſhorter time; for if the ſpirit of God in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118751:80"/>
any poynt of our ſalvation be ſubject to meaſure in latitude, it is as truly ſubject to be meaſured and bounded in longitude, and then ſalvation is voyd, which is the doctrine of the moſt of our Elders in theſe dayes: but <hi>the ſpirit of glory and of God,</hi> that reſts upon the Saints through this ſickneſſe and ſuffering, is neither given out nor received by meaſure, but is unmeaſurable in all its operations, whether in prayer or in propheſie; for they are ſo neare in allyance, that that which is the ſpirit of Propheſie in <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> (in the hiſtory) in his ſhutting up of the heavens, and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them from raine; and alſo in the opening of them, to give rayn in abundance, is ſayd here by our Apoſtle in this Chapter to be prayer: Prayer therefore and Propheſie are of like nature, and of like fame in the the houſe of God; ſo that to prefer one before the other, or to contayne the one, harder to be attayned then the other; or that one is of more uſe in the Church then the other, is not according to the judgment of God, but only in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, and the Serpents ſubtilty and policy, that things are ſo carryed in the world to lead men along in blindneſſe, by ſpeaking of the word of God in ſuch unknown languages, which are not to be heard in the houſe of God; for there is no office of Chriſt whatſoever, or exerciſe of his ſpirit, that one ought to be preferred before another, only the call of God makes every one chief and principall in its time and ſeaſon. If men would well conſider this, they might as well lay out money upon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Schools to learn them to pray, as to teach them to preach, in caſe the Spirit of God might be bought for money.</p>
               <p>But the poynt is, that true Prayer and Propheſie do give and proclaym a like honour, vertue and power to Chriſt in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he appears: and they are ſo near a kin, that the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynts one and the ſame law in the exerciſe of them both; that is, <hi>in prayer and propheſie the man is to be uncovered, and in prayer and propheſie the woman is to be covered.</hi> And it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſuall in Scripture to uſe one phraſe that ſignifies both, as in the Pſalms; <hi>Let God ariſe</hi> prayer-wiſe; or as the word may be as truly read, <hi>God will ariſe,</hi> or <hi>God ſhall ariſe, and his enemies ſhall be ſcattered</hi> (prophetically.)</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe none but a Seer can be a ſupplicant, if he behold not the thing by the ſpirit of interpretation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, to give a true form unto it; he can never ſue for it, becauſe he knows not what it is.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:118751:81"/>
To conclude this point, this act of the Elders may either be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pray with him, or propheſie with him; for we ſee the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God uſeth them indifferently, the one for the other, as in that inſtance of <hi>Eliah</hi> which he brings in, in teaching this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for the one is as healthfull and neceſſary for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and well-being of the ſoule, as the other, and of as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and miraculous effect for remiſſion and confirmation, and cannot be in exerciſe by any, either the one or the other, but as it is accompanyed with the holy oyle, even that <hi>annoynting which teacheth all things, and hath no need to be taught of man;</hi> that is, it hath no need of humane skill, which fals infinitely ſhort of that which it brings the ſoule unto, and inſtructs and teacheth it in, and that leads us to the ſecond poynt in the exerciſe of the Elders, <hi>They annoynt him with oyle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This ſick party therefore, or all ſuch as are dead to the law of the letter, or carnall command; that is, to the word of God, as it is formed and faſhioned, through the wiſdome, art, and skill of humane principles, which the Schools of Learning among the ſons of men in the world are only exerciſed in, and converſant about, or elſe they ſhould undermine their owne foundations, and ſo let fall their building; for Gods wiſdome once layd in the deſcention of the Son of God, overthrows it all, as it comes of the Serpent, and ſo is Satanicall folly.</p>
               <p>But we muſt know, that the Elderſhip of <hi>Iſrael</hi> conſiſts of the firſt-born of God, and no other, unto whom the Scriptures look in the firſt-born of every Tribe or family of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to inſtruct us in that family which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, that the whole &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part thereof is named, or hath its renown and authority only of, and from the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> affirms to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as being of no other but of his true and proper off-ſpring, ſo as to make a difference of the ſons of God (none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) as one being of greater eminency, birth, breeding, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, then another, is to caſt reproach upon that one only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whom every one is named that appertayns to that family, as though he were not of like power and glory, with reſpect unto them all; or as though he changed his act in producing of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon, which tends to nothing elſe, but to <hi>make the ſeed of the bond-wman heire with the ſeed of the promiſe,</hi> and guil efully to give
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:118751:81"/>
the wicked intereſt in the promiſe, whereas the word of the curſe is only their inheritance.</p>
               <p>But the children of this off-ſpring having the name of this one Father called upon them, or they called by his name holy and bleſſed for ever, every one as a firſt-born of God, bearing his name and authority, is King, Prieſt, and Prophet (by vertue thereof) in the family, and there cannot be any inferiour among ſuch, as to whom God communicates himſelfe in the whole off-ſpring; nor can one be in account and reckoning before another, <hi>For of his owne will begate he us by the word of truth, that we ſhould be the firſt fruits of him,</hi> who is no leſſe then the eternall father.</p>
               <p>So that it is impoſſible that this Elderſhip ſhould appear, and not be annoynted with the holy oyle, for it is their proper pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony and birth-right, and therefore they ever appeare inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted therewith, which ever carries in it the ſame vertue of healing this ſick party in all ages and times of the world; and a like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous recovery and reſtauration, where-ever they are called for by the ſpirit of true interpretation or propheſie; for they cannot with-hold, but muſt impart to every one in the family that which themſelves are bleſſed withall: For none can know what is the right of the firſt-born of God, and be poſſeſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but he muſt freely impart it to every one in the family.</p>
               <p>For the Spirit of Chriſt is ever like it ſelfe in all ages, only men deceive themſelves by miſtake of the variety of figures, wherein God in one Chriſt, or holy annoynting commends himſelfe unto us, doting upon the ſhadow wherein the ſubſtance is wrapped up as under <hi>Moſes</hi> vale, and they ſee it not, nor can endure the glory and ſhine thereof</p>
               <p>But to whomſoever Chriſt unveyles himſelfe, hee imparts whole and compleat ſalvation to every one, elſe it cannot be the ſalvation of God; for he, or it, cannot be divided, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy unction is alike ſhed forth to every one in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and they that have it, muſt of neceſſity annoynt every one into whoſe fellowſhip they are called, according to the nature of the call of this ſick party, if they be Elders, having it by right of inheritance, of whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> For the day wherein Chriſt is begotten, or the day of ſalvation, or of the Saviour, as the word will beare,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:118751:82"/>
is like the ſeventh day in the Creation, whereunto neither eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor morning are annexed, as to the reſt of the dayes, for it is ever the ſame where in the Son is begotten, even an <hi>eternall light or day:</hi> Therefore this Elderſhip knowing it to be the birth-day of the Son of God, in that reſurrection of the dead, they cannot with-hold the whole Kingdome, nor any priviledg, prerogative, or royalty thereof, from any one that appertayns or belongs thereunto.</p>
               <p>The uſe and benefit of the holy unction therefore is not yet ceaſed, for then the kingdome of God ſhould ceaſe; for all things in it that ever were, are, or ſhall be in it taken and underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mind of God, are of the ſame duration that the kingdome it ſelfe is, which muſt be as ancient as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But the carnallizing of the word of God in that and all things is ceaſed unto us, according to the Leviticall ſervices, the Kingdom &amp; Prieſt-hood thereof holding no proportion with the Kingdom &amp; Prieſt-hood of our <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> For men may as well go about to divide the Red Sea, with a materiall rod or wand, as to poure oyle upon a ſick body, to give him health and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins: Let us know therefore, that ſuch as trade in materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all oyle, water, bread, wine, geſtures and veſtments, they are ſuch as ſerve in the oldneſſe of the letter that kills its ſubjects, and not in the newneſſe of the ſpirit which gives life to them that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed therein: And to make a difference between the hiſtories of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as being more cleer, and to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the letter, then the hiſtories of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, it is a meer trick and device to deceive the world; for the one hath as great a vaile upon it as the other, and needs the ſame ſpirit of interpretation to open it; <hi>For Chriſt himſelfe uttered his minde in parables, and without a parable</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ſpake be nothing.</hi> We conclude then, that every Saint of God having received that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of antiquity which only makes an Elder or Governour in the kingdom of God; without which, no true Saintſhip or holineſſe, being a ſpirit of Princely rule, dominion, undaunted courage and fortitude in the things of God, whatſoever he may appeare to be in the eyes of the world, and judgment of men, yet he is one that ſheds forth the holy oyle, having the materials of which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, and skill to compoſe the ingredients, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

               <p>Now the wiſdome of the ſpirit of God <hi>brooding</hi> upon this deep, as in the beginning, brings forth all the ornaments of Chriſt in his unity, offices, vertues, relations, and operations whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who indeed is that <hi>Microcoſmus,</hi> furniſhed and adorned with all thoſe ſuper-eminent excellencies and glory of the ſon of God, being that world whereof his kingdome doth conſiſt, which is the <hi>world to come,</hi> or elſe it could <hi>not be happineſſe unto the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof,</hi> if it were not <hi>to come as really as now it is:</hi> For as he was before the earlieſt time that can be reckoned, or retreated, and fallen back unto, even ſo he <hi>will be,</hi> or <hi>is to come,</hi> beyond the lateſt houre that ever can be marched unto hereafter.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118751:83"/>
of the wiſdome and ſpirit of God, are as a formleſſe <hi>Chaos,</hi> and moſt dangerous gulfe: and this wiſdome or device of man hath arguments according to its proper ſphear it works in, as punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and proper for the conſervation and binding over of it ſelfe unto deſtruction, as the wiſdome of God hath in that way of Chriſt, for the laying down of his life unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>We thwart not then the order and inſtinct of any creature, but give it its proper due for which it was made, which is either to give intelligence, by breathing out its proper life in the ſouls of the Saints, in directing unto another in whom the order of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, which abides for ever is eſtabliſhed, or elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn its own proper life, which is earthly, in the expiration of the life of the ſpirit of God, whereby it becomes <hi>a builder of the tower of Babylon,</hi> the one receives inſtruction from the world, in the expiration of the life of it in himſelfe, it becoming as a <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and dead carkaſſe unto him, whereby he is made alive unto God; and the other receives inſtruction from the kingdome of God, in the expiration of the life of all the things thereof in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo as it is made by his wiſdome, as a <hi>crucified</hi> and dead thing unto him, whereby he is made alive unto the world, and the things thereof, adorning and ſupplying of himſelfe with the arm of fleſh, and ſo becomes as truly Satanicall, as the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy and godly. It is no more wrong therefore to look upon the glory and goodlineſſe of man, as the flower of graſſe, or thing of nought; when Chriſt was made manifeſt, then it was wrong to the reſt of the creatures, when man was made <hi>as Lord of them all;</hi> which before that, the bruit beaſte of the field might ſeem to have dominion of the earth.</p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore that would have the ſhadows of the night to retayn ſome excellency in their place, and not to flye away when that <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſeth,</hi> and ſheweth forth himſelfe.

               <p>3. The third poynt is the practice of the Elders, and that is the manner how they annoynt the ſick party, and that is <hi>in the name
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118751:84"/>
of the Lord,</hi> or into the power and authority of the Lord Chriſt; for by this unction we are <hi>gathered up,</hi> and are <hi>all drunke into one ſpirit of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So that men may as fittingly preach the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of man to be no better then the underſtanding of a bruit beaſt, as to teach that the ſpirit of a Chriſtian is inferiour to the wiſdome of God in Chriſt, for they are one, as the wiſdome of man is one.</p>
               <p>Therefore the actions of a Chriſtian ſpring from the proper E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and Inſtitutions of God according to the law of faith, with reſpect unto thoſe relations and operations eſtabliſhed between God and man in Chriſt, or in the unction, and not from thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and reſpects which naturall inſtincts and humane wiſdom hath founded and ſet up between creature and creature, which the beaſts of the field, and fowles of the ayre are for the moſt part inclinable unto, as well as man-kind: So that there is ſomething that is proper unto God only, that is a relative in all the actions of a Chriſtian, or elſe it is not done by the law of faith, which ſtands in all terms of relation between God and man, and not between creature and creature: and thereby is every Chriſtian made Lord of all, which otherwiſe they could not be; for by this means no creature can lay claym unto them, but they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lords, the obligatious ſtanding only between God and man, in that law of faith or ſubſiſtance of God and man in one, by the unction, which is Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the actions and demeanors of a Chriſtian, have in them the effect of Gods power and authority, as well as ſpring from ſuch a root; ſo that they prove fruitful, either <hi>to be a ſavour of life unto life,</hi> or <hi>of death unto death.</hi> The doctrine, wayes, and counſell of a Chriſtian have a certain vertue of God in them to produce life unto life unto them that are ſaved, or to work life in life (as the word may be read) in others; for they bring forth in the choſen of God a life which hath all manner of livelineſſe infolded and wrapped up therein; for as the wiſdome of God is ſayd to be <hi>a manifold wiſdome,</hi> ſo is the life of God <hi>a manifold life,</hi> which can never be unfolded and made manifeſt unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, for then it were not infinite and eternall: So that if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel bring forth and produce the life of Faith, it hath the life of hope in it, and in all things that can be hoped for; which as they
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:118751:84"/>
are <hi>obtained, every one is as a tree of life:</hi> If it produce love, there is wrapped up therein the life of the love of all lovely relations, as Father, Son, Husband, Wife, love of all kinds of friendſhip, and the like; If it bring forth the life of joy, there is wrapt up therein the life of all joyfull things; in the life of proſperity there is the life of all proſperous ways: ſo that whatſoever the Goſpel works in the ſoul, there is involved therein all of that kind that ever can come into uſe and exerciſe; ſo that it is a bundle of life which none but <hi>the wiſdome of God and the power of God</hi> can ever bind up together, or bring forth.</p>
               <p>Againe, if a Chriſtian or the Goſpel (for they are co-apparent, and were never one without another) produce and bring forth death in any, it is <hi>death unto death,</hi> or <hi>(death in death)</hi> there is one death involved and wrapped up in another unto eternity, which can never be found out to the uttermoſt, and yet no particular way of death doth ever aſſwage from the height and extreameſt terrour of it, nor ſtand aſide, as to permit an intermiſſion, but only ſo, as to give way or being in another, to exerciſe its vertue in the full force and terrour thereof: So, as the King of fear chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his countenance in point of wrath, may give the greater on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and breed a freſh and unexpected trouble and terrour in the ſoule, that it ſhall never be inured or acquainted with any particular terrour, ſo as to abate the preſent ſence of a heavy and infinite diſpleaſure, which nothing but Gods power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in that way of the Curſe can poſſibly bring to paſſe; therefore this unction inveſts into the effect of Gods power and authority, in that way of his Sonne Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and therefore he brings in the royall effect and power of prayer in the next place.</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118751:85"/>
                  <hi>Before Abraham was, I am,</hi> and yet <hi>am to come:</hi> So that prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not of a requeſt made by <hi>a meere creature</hi> unto the inviſible God: But it is an appeale made by the Son of God, who conſiſts of humane nature and divine (as the common phraſe is) God and man as one ſimple act, undiſſolvable, and eternall creation.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſayd, that <hi>we know not how to pray as we ought, but the ſpirit it ſelfe maketh interceſſion for us.</hi> Now there is no ſpirit of God conſiderable, disjoyned from the ſpirit of man, no more then there can be a Chriſt deſtitute of humane nature; therefore it is ſayd, <hi>That he that is joyned unto the Lord is one ſpirit:</hi> For God and man in Chriſt are never ſeparated, no more then the Father and the Son can be divided, for they are but one eſtate and condition in which the wiſdome of God, together with all his proper and native excellencies do conſiſt: So that there is no Chriſt or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted conſiderable, but as conſiſting of divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or <hi>aptitudes to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the ſpirit of God maketh requeſt, but it is with <hi>groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> or <hi>ſighes which are proper unto man:</hi> and they are ſayd to be <hi>ſighes not utterable,</hi> becauſe there is in prayer a ſighing or breathing out of life, as the laſt breath, never to be reſumed or taken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in regard of that ſpirit living to any carnall or corruptible thing, and this is a thing can never be uttered by any unbeliever, for they never ſigh, as ſending out their laſt breath, in regard of ever living agayn to the law of the fleſh, therefore not utterable by any that is deſtitute of the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>Again, there is a ſigh in prayer as being the laſt breath, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ceſſation of life in the men of the world, which is never reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or taken in again, and that is the breathing out of the life of the ſpirit in the wicked, never to live unto God, in any ſpirituall or heavenly vertue proper to the Sonne of God, of which there is an utter diſſolution and ceſſation in the men of the world, and this is unutterable alſo, for it can never be uttered or expreſſed in the ſtate of Chriſtianity, where the ſpirit of Chriſt reſides and dwels; and the prayer of faith cannot be expreſſed but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto theſe twayn; the one is <hi>life loſt in the Saints;</hi> that is, the life of the fleſh, but it is extant in the men of the world, which is no leſſe then that ſpirit of Sathan, or that dying life of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and this gives demention unto that from which we are ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118751:86"/>
and delivered: and the other is <hi>life loſt in the men of the world,</hi> but extant in the Saints of God, which is no leſſe then the life of the Son of God, that holy one or (Saint of <hi>Iſrael)</hi> and this gives demention unto that whereunto we are delivered, and whereunto we are brought.</p>
               <p>It is not a part therefore, but whole Chriſt that makes an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale in prayer, namely from that which the Son of perdition is, unto that which the Son of God is: and of ſuch extention and comprehenſion is true prayer, or elſe it is not that prayer of faith which is effectuall; nor can it be ſaid otherwiſe to be that ſpirit of interceſſion which interpoſeth it ſelfe, and comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that depth of death, and that height of life, as in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of them both, as being freed from the one, and ſet in the other, that is, Death, as God is conſidered, what he is, through that wiſdome of the creature in that man of ſin, and life, as man is conſidered in the wiſdome of God, in that man of God the Lord our Righteouſneſſe, the Saints therefore can truly ſay, <hi>Out of the deeps have I cryed unto thee O Lord:</hi> and in that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment <hi>confeſſe themſelves to be ſet upon the mountaine of Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> though it be paradoxicall unto the world.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But if whole Chriſt be the ſupplicant, God and man, to whom then doth he appeal, to himſelfe or to another.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to another, <hi>as in point of reallity of ſubſiſtance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> for it is one that pleads, and alſo gives Judgement, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins the cauſe; But he prayeth unto another, with reſpect unto the reallity of the diſtinction of glory, for ſupplication and anſwer are truly twaine in the ſame hypoſtaſis, for the glory of the ſupplicant is one, and the glory of the <hi>ſuppleo</hi> is another, and theſe give being each to other, elſe they are not nor can ſubſiſt, for either of them ceaſe to be without its relative, ſo that prayer muſt conſiſt of them both, elſe it ceaſeth to be prayer, for the <hi>ſupplicant</hi> humbly proſtrates the cauſe in the neceſſity of, and with reſpect unto ſupply, which is the glory of its office ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>ſuppleo</hi> yeelds relief, and ſupplies the neceſſity, and it is the glory of its office ſo to do: and if either of theſe be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Chriſtian ſpirit, it ſubſiſts not, becauſe it is not the ſpirit of the Son of God, in whom is power to forgive ſins, as well as to make ſupplication for pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:118751:86"/>
So that the glory of the ſpeaker in prayer, or pleader of the cauſe before the Judge of all the earth, is one reall glory, and the glory of the ſentence paſſed thereupon, is another real glory, but both but one act of the law, the glory of the ſpeaker in prayer as <hi>Daniel</hi> calls it) is to open the cauſe, holding plea upon true principles unto the point of iſſue, now Chriſt is the end and iſſue of the law in all points of relation and cauſes depending between God and man whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Againe, the glory of the Judge is to paſſe ſentence, according to the law in the point of iſſue, ſo that the cauſe pleaded, and Judgement given, is but one act of the law, which is Chriſt; and in caſe either of theſe be wanting in a Chriſtian, he ceaſeth to be that law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus our <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and is become that law of ſin and death.</p>
               <p>So that the party praying, and the party prayed unto, are one in point of hypoſtacis and being, and the party or office of prayer, and the party or office of hearing, or anſwering, are twain, in point of the variety in reallity of glory, for God and man are compleatly in unity in them both, elſe Chriſt is divided.</p>
               <p>Even as it is ſaid, that it is a more bleſſed thing to give then to receive, which the Apoſtle affirms to be the ſaying of Chriſt, though we finde no ſuch place in Scripture, in ſo many words; ſo that it may ſeem that the whole Goſpel or ſpeech of Chriſt is ſummed up therein, namely in giving and receiving, as he ſaith to his Diſciples, in ſending them out to preach, freely you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and freely do you give; ſo that it is a more bleſſed thing to give then to receive; that is, it is another thing, a further glory, a various vertue in the Sonne of God, as if he ſhould ſay, it is a bleſſed thing to receive; moreover, or furthermore, it is a bleſſed thing to give, for the one is the bleſſing of giving, and hath its reall and peculiar bleſſedneſſe really conſiſting therein, and the other is the bleſſing of receiving and hath its reall and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar bleſſedneſſe really conſiſting therein, and one of theſe cannot be without the other, for no giver without a receiver, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver without a giver, and each of them hath whole Chriſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed therein, that only bleſſed one; &amp; therefore as <hi>the hearingeare, and the ſeing eye are both alike of the Lord,</hi> ſo it is true of giving and receiving, and the difference ſtands onely in the variety of glory, even as in the three witneſſes that bear record in heaven, no other diſproportion can be found.</p>

                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:118751:87"/>
For <hi>a naturall man can neither perceive</hi> ſo as to give, nor effect ſo as to receive <hi>the things that are of God,</hi> for <hi>they are ſpiritually to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi> and apprehended, and ſaid hold of, for <hi>none knows the things of God but the ſpirit of God,</hi> no more then any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can know the ſpirit of a man but onely he that is of his own kinde.</p>
               <p>And it is the Son of God onely that knows the father, and it is the Son only that reveals him, for <hi>no man knowes the father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveales him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We conclude then, that prayer conſiſts of whole Chriſt, and that both in point of petition, as alſo in the anſwer, otherwiſe it is not this prayer of faith: and therefore it is, that prayer is of that validity and force as to do ſuch mighty things as are here attributed unto it. As</p>
               <p>Firſt ſaves the ſick, it hath the vertue and power of ſalvation annexed unto it, which can be aſcribed unto nothing but unto Chriſt alone, who never was nor can be known but in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of an office, for it is the vertue and power of the ſpirit of God that makes manifeſt the Son of God, and it is he alone that ſaves, <hi>for he hath ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>deliver my ſoul from the ſword, my darling,</hi> or as the word ſignifies, my <hi>alonely ſoule</hi> (as having no copartner) <hi>from the power of the dog,</hi> and it is he that <hi>comes meek and lowly,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſaving himſelf,</hi> and not another; for as the father and the Son are one, <hi>ſo is the Lord and the Diſciple one;</hi> the Saviour and the ſaved are one, elſe Chriſt ſhould not be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>Salvation then is in prayer, as the Scriptures teſtifie, <hi>and the time is come that every one, or whoſoever call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> many teach that ſalvation is only by faith, that neither know what faith nor ſalvation is, for faith hath ſalvation in it onely as it is, that hypoſtacis and ſubſiſtance of the Son of God; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>faith without works;</hi> that is, without the works of the law, which he calls dead works, becauſe the life and ſpirit of the Son of God is not in them: but our Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> aſcribes ſalvation unto works, and declines faith, as being the beliefe of devils; that is, ſuch faith as hath not the powerful operations of God working in and together with it, ſo that there
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118751:87"/>
is compleat ſalvation in any proper work or operation of the Son of God, as well as in faith; therefore Chriſt concludes, that the great work and operation of God to be in faith, for faith is not without the works of God, nor the works of God without faith.</p>
               <p>We are alſo ſaid to be ſaved by <hi>hope,</hi> as well as by either faith or work, there is ſalvation alſo in love, for <hi>it is the fulfilling of the law:</hi> and where the law is compleat and full, there can be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but perfect acquittance and ſalvation; yea <hi>God is love, and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him,</hi> which canot be without ſalvation; yea ſalvation is in patience, <hi>for he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſo that we are ſaved by it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore we are ſaved by wiſdome; for <hi>the poor man by his wiſdome ſaves the whole City of God, though his wiſdome be deſpiſed, and his words not heard</hi> by the wiſe of the world.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this point, ſalvation is in prayer, it ſaves the ſick, becauſe it is the ſubſiſtance of the mediator-ſhip of the Son of God, which is ever one and the ſame, where, when, or in whom-ſoever it appears, although it be ſo little in uſe, and ſo lightly accounted of in theſe days wherein we live.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it hath in it the vertue and power of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, as it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord ſhall raiſe him up:</hi> there is in prayer a Lord-like authority, to riſe out of that grave of ſin and ſorrow, of death and deſtruction, ſo as none ſhall have dominion over it to keep it under, for it cannot be held of death, but it will remove the ſtone from the Sepulchre, and deface and break open the ſeal of <hi>Herod</hi> himſelfe, though ſet upon it by the cheif Preiſts and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> making it as ſure as they can; it will make the houſe of the carnall <hi>Jews</hi> to ſhake, when the Apoſtles of Chriſt are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, or brought into unity and harmony by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling ſpirit of interpretation.</p>
               <p>It will make the foundations of the Priſon to ſhake, where the ſpirit of our great Apoſtle is infringed, caſting open the doors, and laying waſt ſuch power to the aſtoniſhment of the Jaylors themſelves, whoever they may be; yea it will raiſe <hi>Peter</hi> up out of the dungeon, and cauſe his chains to fall off from his hands to his own admiration and wonder.</p>
               <p>In a word, prayer hath in it the power and vertue of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118751:88"/>
becauſe it is the breathing of the Son of God returned from death to life; this word <hi>behold he prayeth,</hi> was an argument ſufficient to prove <hi>Paul</hi> change from a <hi>Saul,</hi> and to be riſen up out of that grave and puddle of the Jewiſh, litteral, and carnall worſhips, and from that deadly ſpirit of perſecution which ever accompanies ſuch maner of ſervices.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, prayer hath in it the power of pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins; for if he have committed ſins they ſhall be forgiven him, or in the preſent tence as the word will bear, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him; that is, to every one that partakes in this prayer of faith.</p>
               <p>To commit ſin here is to be underſtood in a two-fold reſpect, that is negatively, and affirmatively, of which the breach of law <hi>being ſin,</hi> doth conſiſt; now to ſin, and prove a delinquent in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, and not doing that which is required, is to neglect and leave undone that which the carnal commandement according to the ſtrict ſpirit of a <hi>Phariſee</hi> calls for; ſuch ſin, or miſſing of the rule of the carnall commandement ſtanding in outward ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is here to be underſtood, which is the onely ſin condemned by a carnall <hi>Jew,</hi> and this law the prayer of faith doth rout, ravell, undo, and abrogate, with reſpect unto the obligation thereof in the true intent of a Pharaſaical <hi>Jew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againſt this law doth true prayer ſin, in all its ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, interceſſions, and requeſts; for the prayer of faith obſerves not in the leaſt in any point, that law of the ſpirit of bondage, which onely obligeth to the law of the fleſh, nor can it keep and perform that ſpirit of enmity which Chriſt Jeſus nailes to his Croſſe and ſlays in himſelfe, and therefore a ſinne in a Saint, in way of negation, againſt the affirmative part of the law of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Againe, there is a ſin committed affirmatively, and that is by reall acting and doing, according to the law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, which the wiſdome of man in that carnall law forbids, and that under the penalty of errour, ſchiſm, hereſie, pride, blaſphemy, and death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>For every point of the law of the ſpirit rightly compoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prin ciples and grounds of faith, is moſt heinous, wicked, deteſtable, ſinfull, and abominable in the eyes of a carnal man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:118751:88"/>
Now the breach, diſannulling, and abrogating of the carnall command (for which the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſo hated Chriſt) is the truth of the matter, the reality, and ever carries in it the remiſſion, pardon and forgivenes of ſins in the Saints, as ſurely as the breach of the law of the ſpirit, and that everlaſting Covenant of God carries in it, guilt, crime, and is the condemnation of the world.</p>
               <p>For every ſin and blaſphemy againſt the Son of man (that is, againſt the wiſdome, will, power, and authority of the arme of fleſh) ſhall be forgiven, or it is forgiven, for it hath the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, general diſcharge, and releaſe in it ſelf: but he that ſpeaks aagainſt the holy ſpirit, that is, againſt that law of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or ſpirituall eſtate of that holy one of God, it ſhall never be forgiven; that is, he that breaks the law of the ſpirit, in any word, or thing, as the phraſe imports, it hath in it that guilt which can never be wiped out, neither in this world, that is, in time preſent, nor in the world, or time, that is to come; or not in this world, that is, in the conſcience of the party ſo made guilty; nor in the world to come, that is, in that ſentence of the righteous Judge which doth for ever adjudg and condemn it, ſo that as the breach of the ſpiritual law hath in it an eternall guilt unſeperably and enevitably faſtned unto it and accompaning the ſame, even ſo hath the breach or abrogation of the carnall law, an everlaſting pardon, and acquittance before God faſtned unto and ever accompaning the ſame.</p>
               <p>Note in this point that the Levitical law which the Apoſtle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to the <hi>law of an endleſſe life,</hi> doth not condemn, becauſe men fall ſhort in ſome particulars of the fulfilment of the ſame, but it condemns, and is death unto him that walks according to the ſame, or lives thereafter.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye;</hi> that is, if yee live according to the law of the carnall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for by it no fleſh can be juſtified; or if yee <hi>minde</hi> the things of the fleſh; that is (as the word ſignifies) if ye frame, form, or faſhon things unto your ſelfe according to the carnall command, art, or reaſon of man, concerning the affairs of God, it is death; but to live after the ſpirit; that is, the law of the ſpirit, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall law is life and peace; or to <hi>minde</hi> the things of the ſpirit, that is, to form, frame, and faſhion things ſpiritually, that is life
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118751:89"/>
and peace; and as the one of theſe is ſin according to mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and his accounts, even ſo is the other ſin according to Gods wiſdome, and his reckoning and account, judgement, and doom paſſed upon it by an eternall and unchangeable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>There is pardon then, and power of forgiveneſſe in prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is God that ſitteth upon that throne of grace judging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to juſtification, who then ſhall condemn? for it the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, whereof prayer doth conſiſt, yea it is the Son of God who is juſtified? who then ſhal lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen, that holy one of God?</p>
               <p>For wherever the ſpirit and vertue of Chriſt is, there is power to forgive ſins; therefore he ſaith (to ſtop the mouth of thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <hi>Phariſees) whether is it eaſier to ſay, thy ſins are forgiven, or to ſay take up thy bed and walke, but that you may know that the Son of man hath power to forgive ſins on earth; therefore I ſaid unto thee, ariſe, take up thy bed and go thy way into thine houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that to preach the Goſpel to the reſtauration of the ſoule from the <hi>policy;</hi> that is, from the fear, terrors, and tremblings of the law, as at Mount Sinai, to bring it unto Zion, giving ſtrength to take up that and carry it unto its proper place, as that man carried his bed into the proper place, which is his houſe, which before had carried him extravagantly, and diſeaſedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; whereſoever the Goſpel exerciſeth its power to raiſe up any to walk in the way of God, before others, in prayer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, or any appointment of God according to the nature and ſeaſon of it, as that man is ſaid to walk before them all to their admiration; whereſoever the Goſplel is miniſtred to that effect, there is alſo in that miniſtration power to forgive ſin, for the one is of like caſe, and of like difficulty as the other is, yea they are both in one act; for he that can preach the Goſpel to carry ſin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper place (which muſt be done or elſe the Goſpel is not truly preached) he muſt of neceſſity remove it from the choſen of God, which is the true remitting and paſſing of it over unto another.</p>
               <p>He that hath power therefore to preach the Goſpel to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Conſcience of the <hi>palſie,</hi> ſickneſſe, or tremblings of the law in the dead works thereof, or works of death, that man
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118751:89"/>
hath power to forgive ſins on earth, for they are inſeperable, and Chriſt in that place alluded unto, makes them one; for firſt he ſaith, <hi>ſon thy ſins be forgiven thee:</hi> and in the rehearſall of it he ſaith, his ſpeech was, <hi>ariſe take up thy bed and walk, go thy way into thy houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we know that Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>whoſe ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they are remitted, and whoſe ſins ye retaine they are retained:</hi> And again, <hi>what ye binde on earth is bound in heaven, and what ye looſe on earth, is looſed in heaven:</hi> to walk and work therefore in the things of God according to the power intended by the word of God, are of greater concernment then they would think; for to preach the Goſpel, in the revelation of the minde and will of God as to <hi>an onely Son,</hi> or to preſent our ſupplications to God <hi>as a father from the minde and diſpoſition of an onely ſon,</hi> are of no leſſe authority and power then to to give ſins; for <hi>to pray with the ſpirit, and to pray with the underſtanding alſo;</hi> that is, to pray according to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts meditation, and yet with that wiſdome and skill of expreſſion, as to unfold and explaine it in the minds of others, that they may aſcend up unto God together therewith, as <hi>Mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's Angel in the flame of the ſacrifices;</hi> this, and to pardon ſin, are of like power skill, and, authority, and a like weight lies upon both to whomſoever communicates in them.</p>
               <p>For to pardon ſin is not to change or alter the minde of God toward that party, but to explaine and interpret the minde of God concerning that party, which minde and will of God is the ſame in that one faith of the Son of God to all the choſen of God, and whereſoever it is rightly unfolded and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the proclamation of peace and reconciliation of God and man in one; <hi>if the Son of peace be there,</hi> he accepteth and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet the ſame as the right of his inheritance.</p>
               <p>If the Elders pray or prophecy unto health therefore, they pray or propheſie to the remiſſion of ſins, in whomſoeve, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in the ſame, <hi>his ſins are forgiven him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this point, it concerns us, then to know what ſin is, that we may rightly conceive of it, as it is pardonable, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as it not pardonable, for there is a ſin (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John) which is not unto death,</hi> or which is not in death, that is, it is not in that way of death; <hi>and there is a ſin that is in death, I do not ſay
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118751:90"/>
that you ſhall pray for it;</hi> that is, you ſhall not pray for the pardon of it, becauſe it is not to be pardoned; for where Chriſt is once crucified in the ſpirit, he never is to live in that heart according to the ſpirit, no more then where he is once crucified in the fleſh, he never lives in that heart according to the fleſh.</p>

               <p>And there is the law of the ſpirit, or of that holy Ghoſt, which if a man <hi>ſpeake a word againſt</hi> intentionally, or blaſpheme and pierce through; that is, abrogate or make a nullity of it, <hi>It ſhall never be forgiven neither in this world nor in the world to come;</hi> that is, neither in the preſent mind and conſcience of him that ſo doth, nor in that holy mind and judgment of Chriſt, from paſſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt it, being ſo remote, and at ſuch a diſtance from it, and contrary unto it; for the abrogation of the law of the ſpirit is no leſſe then to diſannull that wiſdome of God in Chriſt; by which device only the ſin and guilt of the ſons of men is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and no other way, for elſe-where the redemption of the ſoule ceaſeth for ever.</p>

               <p>Object. <hi>But a Chriſtian by faith profeſſing the fruits of righteouſneſs, and fountaine out of which they flow, is endewed with the life and ſpirit of them, according to their native property in that bleſſed ſubject of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, elſe his confeſſion of them is but as a fire paynted upon a wall, or

                  <hi>Will it not then alſo follow, that if he deale faithfully and ſenſibly in the confeſſion of ſin, as that</hi> he hath not the underſtanding of a man, <hi>that he</hi> perſecuted the Church of God; <hi>that he is the</hi> chiefe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <hi>that</hi> the terrours of the Almighty are upon him; <hi>that</hi> out of the belly of Hell he cries unto God, that he is ſhut up, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come out. <hi>If he deale playnly in that, and be reall, will it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he hath in him the vicious deſire of the fleſh, the ſtate of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill (if he be the chiefe of ſinners) and partaker of the terrors of Sathan ſenſibly, if he cry out of the womb of hell; that if the creature, man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of joyes celeſtiall and eternall in confeſſion and acknowledgment of them: So the creature or man muſt partake of all abominations of ſinne, and ſtate and condition of the Devill, if he be reall alſo therein, in his acknowledgments.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer in the name of God, that no ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence follows upon a reall confeſſion of ſin: But through the wiſdome and device of God, it proves an eternall ſeparation of the ſpirit of a Chriſtian from all ſuch ſins and ſorrows; juſtly and really acknowledged in and upon man-kind, or that matter whereof a Saint doth conſiſt; and this is proved by a true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſtribution of man, or of the creature, according to the word of the Lord gone out in the diſpoſing of it, as a reall ſubject of mercy and ſeverity, of love and wrath.</p>
               <p>We are to take a man in a two fold reſpect according to the intention and expreſſion of the word of God, which rightly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and determineth all things.</p>

               <p>We anſwer then, that, when a Chriſtian confeſſeth, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, or praiſeth the excellencies of God in Chriſt, giving them their proper and full vertue and extent, as love, joy, mercy, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, kindeneſſe, bounty, power, and eternall goodneſſe, <hi>man</hi> participates thereof; the creature really and ſenſibly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth and enjoys them in the unfeigned and juſt confeſſion of them; that is, the <hi>man of God, the new creature,</hi> which is that work-manſhip of God in Chriſt Jeſus, and <hi>man-like</hi> Son of God, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <p>Even ſo there are the terrors of death, vexations of ſpirit, guilt of ſin, condemnatory ſentence of conſcience, that ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the ſins confeſſed by a Saint really beyond any ſhadow, or ſemblance, and that not bounded by time, but are eternall; and yet the <hi>man</hi> or the <hi>creature,</hi> that is, the <hi>man of God,</hi> or the <hi>new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> participates not in the leaſt in any of their diſtreſſe, guilt, or fear, no more then the wicked partake in the joys of ſalvation in Chriſt; he hath no taint or tincture of the enmity of the Serpent, nor ſence unto pangs and vexation of the guilt of corrupt and defiled conſcience, and yet ſaith truly and unfeignedly, this is my ſin, this is my death, and this abomination is in me; that is, <hi>in my fleſh,</hi> or in that carnall eſtate out of which I am taken, where <hi>dwels no good thing,</hi> but is a cage of all unclean and abominable fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and wickedneſſe; So that in a true confeſſion of ſin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to faith; not onely it, but all its appurtenances are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth and ſet upon their proper baſe; that is, in that <hi>land of Shiner, which is Babylon,</hi> that confuſion gone over all the earth, which is that ſtrict compoſure of things by mans wiſdome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to times, places, perſons, and temporary reſpects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which makes a nullity of Gods order, who is a God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thereof, and all things therein are illimitted, not any thing tyed to time, place, perſon, or any temporary or fading bond whatſoever, otherwiſe it is not the order of the Son of God, but a device and inventions of man unto confuſion, whether the Epha of wickedneſſe is carried, and is the houſe built for it where for

ever it ſhall remaine and abide.</p>
               <p>Thither all ſin and ſorrow in true confeſſion is carried, as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as all righteouſneſſe and peace is carried onely into that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſtate and incomprehenſible order, that is, of God by Jeſus Chriſt; the carnall <hi>minde,</hi> or man therefore, is onely ſenſible of ſin, in the way oſ Gods diſpleaſure, but not of that vertue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and the ſpirituall <hi>minde,</hi> or man, is onely ſenfible of all righteouſneſſe in way of the peace of God, but not of that horror which comes through that breach of the everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>And yet is neither the one nor the other voyd of ſence, with reſpect unto the others condition.</p>
               <p>For the wicked from the ſight of the Saints being lifted up in that holy unction, and taken into an everlaſting reigne and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by unity with an omnipotent and all-ſufficient power, are filled with fear, and terror at the fight and apprehenſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as having the glory of a righteous Judge; alſo the Saints of God beholding themſelves lifted up, and taken out of that fearful and abominable ſtate and condition of the wicked, rejoice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>with joy unſpeakable and full of glory;</hi> even as <hi>Noah,</hi> when he ſaw the waters over-whelm and deſtroy the world, was by the ſame waters lifted up to heaven, as ſaſe from all rocks, mountaines, or hills that might annoy him; ſo the Saints ſeeing how the Son of God hath given himſelfe unto death in the world (never to live the life of the Son of God in them) as a ranſome, whereby he is lifted up unto the throne of Gods glory in the Saints everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which carries with it a holy ſhout, harmonious and melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinging and rejoycing for ever, to ſee the terrors of death captivated under eternall darkneſſe, which can never ſeize nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon that Sun of righteouſneſſe which ſhineth in the ſaved of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the exhortation is, <hi>to pray one for another,</hi> or appeal one to another; the word <hi>for,</hi> and <hi>to,</hi> are indifferently taken, as you may ſee by the difference of tranſlations. One ſaith, a Pſalm for the ſons of <hi>Corah;</hi> and another ſaith, a Pſalme to the ſons of <hi>Corah,</hi> ſo that here it is taken for <hi>one to another;</hi> that is, in your confeſſions of the nullity and breach of the law of the ſpirit by that wicked one; do you appeal to the law of the carnall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118751:93"/>
command which is of ſin and death, which is thereby eſtabliſhed and confirmed in the world, whereby the men thereof are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bound over (under that ſpirit of bondage) to walk and work according to the letter that kills, and to emulate, decline, and reject (in all things) the ſpirit that giveth life.</p>
               <p>And at that Judgment-ſeat, behold the ſummoning in, and the aſſembling of all ſin in the fight of God, by the cruciſication of Chriſt, together with the manner of Gods execution of wrath for your acquittance and eſcape: For in that throne is all ſin ſummed up, as in that King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> for corrupting the wiſdome and prophaning the holy things of God, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>Againe in the acknowledgement of the breach and nullity of the law of the fleſh, appeal to the law of the ſpirit, for it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fulfilment thereof; for the disjunction from all carnal and diabolicall things, is the conjunction of God and man in Chriſt, the crucification of Chriſt by the miniſtry of the letter in the world, is the raiſing of him up from that death in the miniſtry of the ſpirit, in the Saints, for it is impoſſible that the Sonne of God ſhould be held of death, ſo as not to live his proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life.</p>
               <p>If we expect unity with all the excellencies and virtues of God, we muſt be looſned and diſunited from all carnall relations and bonds, and we muſt either have unity with all the things proper unto God, or none, for he cannot be devided, therefore we muſt admit of a totall ſeperation from all carnal things; that is, ſuch as fade &amp; have an end; however we know that all things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with due reſpect unto Gods call in the uſe of them, yet are we not to be brought under the power of any thing as by a bond ſubjected unto it, but to uſe the world as though we uſed it not, to marry as though we married not, and to buy as though we poſſeſſed not, for the Son of God never acknowledged conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or copulation, by any carnall tie, or bond; therefore when his mother told him at the feaſt, <hi>that they had no wine,</hi> he ſaith unto her, <hi>woman what have I to do with thee, mine houre is not yet come,</hi> as to have my works and times ſet and appointed unto me by vertue of any earthly or temporary relation, therefore ſhee bids the ſervants look unto his time and his command, ſaying, <hi>what ſoever he commands you, that doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:118751:94"/>
Where the force of earthly relations takes place of the ſpirit of Chriſt, that ſtate or place of honour ſhall never ſucceed well.</p>
               <p>Againe, when one told Jeſus that his mother and his brethren ſtood without to ſpeak with him, he anſwered and ſaid to him that told him, <hi>Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? and he ſtreched forth his hand towards his Diſciples and ſaid, behold my mother and my brethren; for whoſoever ſhall do the will of my father which is in heaven, the ſame is my brother, and ſiſter, and mother,</hi> all relations centred in one; alſo when his mother found him in the Temple Queſtioning the Doctors, ſaying, <hi>why haſt thou thus dealt with us? behold thy father and I have ſought thee, ſorrowing:</hi> but he anſwers, <hi>how is it that yee ſought me, wiſt you not that I muſt be about my fathers buſineſſe?</hi> as acknowledging none but that one father of eternity, and in ſuch relations ſtands the band of a Chriſtian, and therein is the acknowledgement of his ingagements.</p>
               <p>But from this point it will be gathered by carnall ſpirits as of old, <hi>then let us do evill that good may come thereby, whoſe damnation is juſt;</hi> if this be true, then let us endeavour to undermine, extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, root out, and bring to nought all naturall relations and conſociations amongſt the ſons of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To which we anſwer, that no ſuch conſequence followes upon the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, for the abrogation of the law of the fleſh is to repeal and aboliſh it compleatly, and it confiſts of an affirmative and negative part; the affirmative is to ſet up, adorne, and maintain all things honourable in the fight of man, according to the nature, manner, and conſtitution of the place where it is exerciſed, and to avoyd and abandon the contrary ſhame, and this is but one adminiſtration or law, for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperably joyned together, even as the honourable ſentence of the Judge of a Size unto death, and the ſhameſull office of the hang-man are but one adminiſtration; So that from the office of the Judge, you bring in the office of the Hang-man; and from the act of the hang-man, you include the office of the Judge, or elſe the law is not compleated in that point; right ſo in the aboliſhing and diſannulling of the law of the fleſh, that it takes not hold as being any yoak or bond upon the Saints, it is compleatly repealed and made voyd, both in reſpect of all things
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118751:94"/>
that the world makes and accounts honourable, and likewiſe of all things that are diſhonourable and ſhamefull in the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſo that it becomes nothing elſe but a provocation unto them, to guard and fortifie themſelves againſt the one and the other, for they are one intire and undivided law or adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Saints therefore cannot go about to eſtabliſh that which they aboliſh (for the ſhamefull acts of the world are nulled unto them as well as the honourable) no more then the wicked in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king voyd unto themſelves the law of the ſpirit, can poſſibly go about to ſet up or advance the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus in the true vertue and power of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We anſwer, that to ſuch a concluſion from our freedome from the carnall command, or way of the letter of the Scripture, is to lay a hard thought and deep cenſure upon the ſpirit and power of God; for ſhall the wiſdome and inſtitutions of man that ſhall vaniſh and come to naught, have power in them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke to dilligence? to preſerve in peace? to keep in temporance, chaſtity, gravity, and moderation in all things? and ſhall not the ſpirit of God, or law of that ſpirit be ſufficiently wiſe and able to preſerve men in modeſtety, chaſtity, gravity, and moderation in all things? with wiſdome, care, and deligence to uſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of what kinde ſoever, according to time, place, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as becomes the nature end and uſe thereof, without liſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and laſcivious liberty? ſurely thoſe that ſo judge never found nor felt the virtue, life, liberty, and power of the ſpirit of our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lordſhip, and ſalvation, Jeſus: Therefore the reaſon of our thus appealing follows.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Namely that yee may be healed.</head>
                  <p>The ſpirit of God makes this manner of appeal the poſſeſſion to purge out all ſuperfluous humors, the ſoveraign ſalve to cure all deſeaſes, the cordiall medicine againſt all crudities of ſoule, and peccant humours of ſpirit; this <hi>is health to thy navell, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unto thy bones:</hi> If when we ſee the breach oſ the law of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, we carry it unto the law of the fleſh, and obſerve how that is onely eſtabliſhed thereby: and when we obſerve the repeal of the law of the fleſh as made of none effect, we carry it up into the law of the ſpirit, and know that it is eſtabliſhed and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118751:95"/>
confirmed for ever thereby. This is the <hi>Medicamentoſus,</hi> without which no prayer can be made acceptable unto God; for if prayer confirme not the law of the ſpirit, it bindes not over the Lord to be our ſupply, if it comprize not his mercy within the bounds of its proper place, which is Chriſt our boundleſſe and common ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>This appeal or prayer muſt alſo confirme the law of the fleſh, or elſe it carrieth not all ſin and ſorrow into its proper place of aboad, which is Antichriſt, or Satan that <hi>ſlayer of the Sonne of man from the beginning,</hi> even as <hi>Caine</hi> ſlew his brother, becauſe his own works are evill, and the works of the Sonne of man good; and in theſe twain ſtands the health of our ſouls, and is by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> a place of the reception of all wickedneſſe, where it abides exerciſed in the curſe for the acquitting of the Saints for ever.</p>
                  <p>And a place of reception into righteouſneſſe, and reſidence of that bleſſed eſtate of the Sonne of God in the love and delight of the father for ever, in the juſt condemnation of all enmity.</p>
                  <p>The third point is the ground of this ſound and healthfull condition by this appeal, or prayer; and firſt it is effectuall, or forceable, without let or hinderance; the appeal is made upon ſuch grounds, as nothing can ſtop the bringing of the cauſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either for the ſtating of ſin, or of righteouſneſſe; of the curſe in the confirmation of the law of the fleſh, or of the bleſſing in the law of the ſpirit of Chriſt in the one, and Antichriſt in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>No Superſedias can be ſued out, no counter-command can be given, no obſtruction can be made, to ſtop or recall the ſtating of all abominations in the exerciſe and practice of the carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and all the vertues, excellencies, and dignities of God in Chriſt in that law of the ſpirit; for Satan the God of this world, which is the wiſdome of the world, the ſubtilty of the ſerpent, as he is a murther our from the beginning, in ſlaying and putting to death the Lord of life and glory; ſo is he a lyar, and abode not in the truth; ſo is he ſacrelegious, robing God of his glory, making himſelfe to be God, adulterating the word of God, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the glory of God into ſhame, and is the ſole and proper oppoſer of God in all his excellencies; therefore nothing can
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118751:95"/>
hinder, no law or evidence gain-ſay, but that ſtate is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſinck and center of all wickedneſſe, and ſo of all wrath. Alſo in its appeal to the law of the ſpirit, which is the proper order and compoſure of the Son of God, what can obſtruct but that in him are all thoſe dementions of height, depth, length, and breadth, of the goodneſſe, mercy, truth, life, power, ſpirit, and love of God for ever; therefore this prayer or appeal is moſt forceable and effectuall, it paſſeth through without let or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for the performance of its work, in rendring to each his right, in the perfecting of the cauſe of its appeal.</p>
                  <p>2. It is fervent, <hi>hot,</hi> without any intermixture of cold, the word ſignifies to <hi>boyle,</hi> which admits of no cooling thing to come there; ſuch is the nature of true prayer, it admits no chilly or cold thing to be caſt into the love and zeal of God in Chriſt, but findes <hi>the coles thereof to be fiery coles, yea to have a vehement flame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can the ſpirit of prayer admit of any cooling mixtures in the fume and heat of Gods wrath, in the wealthy of the world named above; for <hi>a fire is kindled in mine anger which ſhall burn down to the nethermoſt hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Academiſts of our age, they know how to moderate the love of Chriſt in thoſe whom they call Saints, by ſome cold and decaying humor of the ſpirit of the world; yet tradition is of that ſtrength in them that they dare not impute ſuch to him that was borne of the Virgin: but for any ſound knowledg they have of him, they might as ſoon do it to him as any of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, and would for advantage, if they had been brought up in Schools of ſuch principles, for they have nothing but what they receive from man.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe they can cool Gods infinite diſpleaſure againſt ſin, with graduall diſtinctions of it as good part in nature, ſome good works wraught, ſome remainders of Gods image in the wicked, ſuch ſleights of Satan we skill not but are confident; the path of fervent prayer never lay in that way, nor ſhall ever be beaten out or found in it, by all thoſe carnall and ſuperſtitious cuttings, and fleſhly launſings of the Prieſts of <hi>Baall,</hi> to uphold <hi>Ahabs</hi> Throne in all the Statues of his Anceſtor <hi>Omry.</hi>

The fourth point is the qualification of the perſon praying, and that is <hi>a righteous man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now a righteous or juſt man is he, who gives every thing its proper right and due, which appertains and belongs unto it; if we ſpeak of any thing of God, give unto it ariſe, arraign, and ſcope appertaining to God; if we ſpeak of any of the ordinances of God, give them the vertue, property, duration, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Son of God, who abides for ever, elſe we give not the Son of God that great ordinance and fountaine of all holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances his right and due, who is holy, ſpirituall, juſt and good, otherwiſe they are human and periſhing things, and we are found unjuſt in not giving Chriſt his due, the ſpirit of prayer and this effectuall appeal reſides not there.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if we ſpeak of any thing as not having the Sonne of God in it, then give it the ſpirit and power of the Prince of the aire, <hi>the ſpirit that now works in the children of unbeleif,</hi> or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for the ſcope and end of all things is Chriſt, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of mercy in the faith of the Goſpel, or in the exerciſe of wrath in that way of Antichriſt, for <hi>we know that we are of God, and the world is of that wicked one,</hi> namely the Devil; therefore if we ſpeak of ſin, give it its due, the guilt of making a nullity and falcificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him that made all things in truth.</p>
                  <p>If we ſpeak of ſinners, give them the ſtate and condition of <hi>their father the Devill, whoſe works they do and will doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Either clear the innocent whom God in Chriſt juſtifies once and for ever, and ſo give them their due belonging unto them, and condemn the guilty, who reject the manner and way of his acquitting of his Saints, or elſe no perſon quallified for prayer; if you ſpeak of death, bring it unto the ſcope, either death unto all tranſitory and carnall things in Chriſt, or elſe death unto all ſpirituall and durable things in Antichriſt, or elſe we give not right unto it, and ſo are not that righteous man whoſe prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, and is the event and iſſue of this prayer, which is the fifth point, that is, <hi>it availeth much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for prayer to avail much, is as much as if he ſaid in more words, it effecteth, accompliſheth, and brings to paſſe all things, even as not to avayl is of none effect, worth, nor excellency: So it is ſayd, <hi>Circumciſion or uncircumciſion avayls nothing, but a new

creature,</hi> that is all in all; for it hath the whole workman-ſhip of the Son of God in it. Obſerve the ſpeech of <hi>Haman,</hi> when he is nvited to the feaſt the Queen makes for the King, who calling his wife and his friends, tells them <hi>of the glory of his riches, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him; and how he had advanced him above the Princes and ſervants of the King.</hi> Haman <hi>ſaid moreover; yea</hi> Heſter <hi>the Queen did let no man come in with the King unto the banquet ſhee had prepared, but my ſelfe, and to morrow am I invited unto her alſo with the King; yet all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee Mordecai the Iew ſitting at the Kings gate.</hi> A wicked Stateſ-man cannot endure <hi>Mordecai,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the etymology of the word is pure myrrhe, or myrrhe of freedome, ſignifying the ſweet liberty of the Goſpel, for it is the firſt of the chiefe ſpices in the annoynting oyle, to ſhew the Princely dignity that is in the grace of the Goſpel, that bowes, nor is ſubject to any carnall thing whatſoever; for there is but one <hi>primatus</hi> or <hi>ſummus</hi> which moves <hi>Haman</hi> try Maſtery with <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai,</hi> which ſhall be lifted up the higheſt. There is not the moſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized man in the world, deſtitute of the ſpirit of God, put in place of dignity, that can admit of the Croſſe of Chriſt, to have ſupremacy; for it is as a moth to carnall pomp, declaring it to be enmity, therefore carnall Kingdome muſt ever have carnall Prieſt-hood to uphold it, by deifying of it, and it rewards them with tythes and protection.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Mordecai</hi> (the Jew inward in heart) will not be endured by <hi>Haman;</hi> for the King repreſents a ſtranger wonne to the faith, as that <hi>Aegyptian</hi> King which acknowledged <hi>Joſeph.</hi> So that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing avayls, if <hi>Mordecai</hi> live, who is a worme unto all <hi>Hamans</hi> honour, that nothing is had nor done unto him, till <hi>Mordecai</hi> be taken out of the way: but to avail much, is to bring all things to paſſe, to be, and to have the fulneſſe of the ſoules deſired, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd with vertue and ſtrength to perform and effect what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth can yeeld or deny to any, and therefore an inſtance is brought of <hi>Eliah</hi> for the proof hereof.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FRom the firſt, the party inſtanced in is <hi>Eliah;</hi> obſerve thus much, <hi>That it pleaſeth God to memorize the names of his Saints, by acts of honour which he leads them through in the world.</hi> This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident throughout the holy letters written from heaven unto us, ſee an epitomy hereof in that 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of it is, becauſe the acts of the Saints are the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Chriſt: <hi>Now I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me;</hi> which life is the root of all their motion, and the memorizing of him is Gods ayme and end in all his wayes and operations; hee it is whom he will make <hi>higher then Agag,</hi> greater in power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority then all the Kings of the earth; His acts therefore muſt be as <hi>monuments</hi> in the world, who <hi>ever is made marvellous in mercy, only in them that believe:</hi> Therefore God makes them as monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, ſetting them as <hi>Cities upon a hill,</hi> to whom all ſhall repayr for the richeſt merchandize; and as beakens upon a high mountayn, who only can give warning of the approach of the adverſary: <hi>And as the lights of the world,</hi> without which no man can worke; however the Prophets and Apoſtles were under perſecution, ignominy, and diſgrace in the time of their ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

here; yet now <hi>where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world,</hi> but ſeeks to uphold and honour himſelfe by them? Yea, that very ſpirit that ſlew them, now builds their Sepulchres, and ſaith, <hi>If they had lived in their fathers dayes, they would not have done as they did.</hi> Nay, God will regiſter the names of his Saints in that book of life, in whomſoever the life of Chriſt is, there they ſhall be memorized, and ſet up by God as Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearers in their generations; before whom, if the enemy come in as a flood, the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a Standard againſt him, and chaſe him away.</p>
               <p>Wonderfull is it to conſider of this point, when we ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have gone down to the duſt by plague, famine, ſword, and not a name of them left upon record in the world: but hee that once comes within the volume of that ſpirit of interceſſion, ſhall remayn engraven as in a precious ſtone upon the breaſt-plate, or heart-ornament of Chriſt Jeſus, as a record or inſcription of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed memory for ever.</p>
               <p>Therefore the next words are brought in, <hi>viz.

Whence obſerve;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Saints of God are ſubject to like ſufferings:</hi> they all alike endure affliction, they all alike inherit the Croſſe; it is not ſayd of any particular man, or particular Church (limmed out by the ſpirit of man from ſome few particular expreſſions or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces manifected in the Scriptures) but of all the Sains of God that ever lived, or ſhall, <hi>viz. For thy ſake are we killed all the day long, and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is none of thoſe ſeverall afflictions which the Saints of God have undergone, but rightly underſtood, one of them is as extenſive as another, and it muſt needs be ſo; for the ſufferings of the Saints is the Croſſe of Chriſt, and not the croſſe of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular creature, but of the ſon of God; therefore he ſaith, <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted:</hi> and therefore he ſaith alſo in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the believers and prayers in <hi>Damaſcus, Saul; Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou mee:</hi> Therefore it is, when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſeemed to cleave one to one man, and another unto another, though all ſound men and good; one is of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apollo,</hi> another of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and another of Chriſt; that he calls them carnall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they take not every way or manner of the adminiſtration of the grace of the Goſpel, to be the ſame univerſally through the whole body; what ſaith he, <hi>Is Chriſt divided? was Paul crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for you? or were you baptized into the name of Paul? I thanke God</hi> that I performed no ſuch particular act, but to ſuch as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the myſtery of it, for that is the effect of his ſpeech, and cauſe of thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>The ground of theſe particular and nominall Religions (as Independent, Presbyterian, Anabaptiſt, Papiſt, Generalliſt, for they all ſtand on one root) is, becauſe they limit and infringe the grace of the Goſpel, both in way of the ſentence of abſolution and condemnation, mincing and faſhioning things according to the judgment or diſcerning of man, and not according to the light and revelation of the Son of God: Hence they are affected with manlike expreſſions, and ſo cleave unto man, and not unto the Son of God: and if the mind of God be expreſſed unto them, they hammer it into their own ſhape, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, and ſo make rents and ſchiſmes.</p>
                  <p>Now the grace of the Goſpel in whatſoever it expreſſed it ſelf,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118751:98"/>
as King or Prieſt, Prophet or Victor, father or ſon, Maſter or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Lord or Diſciple, Apoſtle or follower) is as that leaven which the woman hid in three pecks of meal, whereby the whole lump was leavened: or like that unction poured on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, which run down unto the coller or hem of his garment; for the oyle contayned in that honourable veſſell of the Goſpel filleth compleatly all veſſels that are brought into unity or love with it. Of ſuch nature and extent are all things appertaining unto the Goſpel, and ſo the afflictions of the Saints, the Croſſe of Chriſt takes not its latitude nor longitude from the dimentions of a creature, but holds correſpondency with the ſon of God; for the croſſe of Chriſt is of the ſame extent and continuation that his Crown and kingdome is.</p>
                  <p>By this we may take notice of what nature the Croſſe of Chriſt is that it ſtands not in, or conſiſts of any temporary relation or operation of the creature active or paſſive, but is the proper ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the ſon of God in the wicked, as deprived of all liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and proper operations of the ſpirit in all wayes of motion and relation; and in the Saints, in being deprived of all liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and proper operations of the fleſh in all the wayes of its motion and relation.</p>
                  <p>It would ſeem a great croſs to a man, if the world were vacant of a rationall ſpirit, and none but beaſts to converſe with: of no leſſe, but infinitely greater is the diſproportion of the wiſdome of God in a Chriſtian, and the wiſdome of this world in the wicked; yea if they be as crafty as <hi>Achitophel,</hi> or as ſubtill as the Serpent, the wiſeſt beaſt of the field. Yea, in the world we have loſt our proper life, ſpirit, and power, and all vertue proper to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in poynt of heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>Further, it would ſeem a great affliction and ſuffering unto us to ſee the world take all our ſtrength, our wiſdome, honour, riches, peace, friendſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and leave us nothing, but that wee ſhould depart from, and forſake father, mother, wife, children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus it is with a Chriſtian; The world ingroſſeth power, authority, wiſdome, riches, <hi>&amp;c. and leaves us as the ſcum and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweepings of all things.</hi> Nay we forſake our neareſt relations in all reſpects, as the law of the fleſh in its true ſenſe calls for, and go to a place we know not whether, by any wiſdome or underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118751:99"/>
of the creature, which can never be done but by the inſtinct and operation of the ſpirit of God, opening unto us the power, wiſdome, riches, and all relations that are reall, ſubſtantiall, and eternall: And if the ſpirit of God be there, it never appears but in the faith and unity of Chriſt, therefore they are the proper ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt, and not of any particular creature: And when we know and judge of the ſufferings of the Saints, wee ſhall not lament if the world take all temporary things from us, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in what it can caſt upon us; for <hi>God forbid that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whereby the world is kill'd and crucified in me, and I in the world.</hi> If once we know how to looſe our lives in the world, in all things of the ſpirit, and how to looſe our lives in our ſelves, and body myſticall in all things pertayning to the fleſh, we ſhall then take is lightly in whatſoever the world can give, or take away from us.</p>

                  <p>But the thing is really and ſubſtantially to be conſidered, though men do wreſt and bend, mince and ſtrayn the word, to ſuit it to humane reaſon.</p>
                  <p>For it is as true that the Son of God in, and by the ſpirit of the world, and principles proper to humane wiſdome, doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and relir quiſh all hope and expectation of being delivered or ſet at liberty from that infinite wrath and diſpleaſure of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; as it is true, that the ſon of ſorry man is in, and by the ſpirit of God, and principles proper to the wiſdome of

                  <p>If men be ignorant hereof, how Chriſt is ſaid to feare or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payr in all things, they may talk of eternall life, but they know not how a creature can live eternally, and be poſſeſſor of all things.</p>

                  <p>For the reſt that have gotten a tract of ſalvation and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by tradition from ſchools, books, naturall phyloſophy and obſervation, not having the knowledg of the nature of this Prieſt-hood, comprized in the ſpirit of interceſſion: They believe ſuch things, but they muſt not be curiouſly ſearcht into; that is, we cannot know them; of theſe we ſay, as the mind without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is not good, ſo theſe mens faith is dead: <hi>For wilt thou know oh emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man that faith without works is dead?</hi> For the ſpirit of God never works in way of life, but in its own light; therefore ignorance in any point muſt be voyd of the work of <hi>faith,</hi> and ſo of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vertue that is in the life of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But prayer comprehending the whole Prieſt-hood of Chriſt, is a work of that honour and power, as to memorize the name of a Saint for ever, and to ſet him up as a monument of the wiſdome and mercy of God.</p>

Prayer is a work that comprehends the Kingly authority of Chriſt; for when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had ſhaken off the traditions and rudiments of the carnall Jew, the power of the high Prieſt, in that proſecuting ſpirit of binding and impriſoning all that were of the way of Jeſus, calling on the name of the Lord: and when the Lord would proclaim him, and make it manifeſt that he was <hi>a choſen veſſell fitted to beare his name, or carry his authority before the Gentiles, Kings, and the children of Iſrael.</hi> Yea, when he would put all that honour upon him which the Pſalmiſt foretells, ſaying,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118751:100"/>
                     <hi>There is little Benjamine their ruler,</hi> the head of the Tribe, a Prince of God, he comprehends and concludes all in this act of prayer, to give ſatisfaction to <hi>Annanias, behold he prayeth:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, it is enough to know that miraculous change from <hi>Saul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Paul;</hi> from the ſervice of the Synagogue of the Jewes, to be a ruler over Kings, the Gentiles, and children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (for the name of God is by his word advanced over all, which he was to beare) this is ſufficient to give ſatisfation to all, <hi>Behold he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> So that none can deny a Princely ſpirit of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, where the ſpirit of prayer bears ſway, and a princely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is of honour ſufficient to eternize the record of a Chriſtians name.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is in prayer the power of victor, or a victorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, conſiſting of the nobleſt conqueſt that ever was; <hi>Jacob</hi> by prayer overcame the man that wreſtled or combated with him, which man is ſaid to be an Angell, but it is the Angell that bleſt him in the way, and therefore is declared to be God; for <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have ſeen God face to face;</hi> in which act of prayer his name is changed from <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to declare a prince-like promiſe in prevailing with God, as the Prophet explayns his name and act, ſaying, <hi>And by his ſtrength he had power with God, yea he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Angell, and prevailed; he wept and made ſupplication, hee found him in Bethel, and there ſpake with us</hi> (or in us) for if the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God had not ſpoke in our father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſo in all of his race, he had never prevailed.</p>
                  <p>Was ever the like Conqueſt made, as to overcome omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? which could never be, but through the requeſts of his owne ſpirit, which he cannot deny, but muſt yeeld himſelf over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>Prayer therefore conſiſts of a combate which ever hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, therefore of ſufficient honour and renown to memorize a Saint, who-ever he be that exerciſeth the deſign and skill there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Prayer hath ſalvation contained in it, nay it is ſalvation: <hi>For whoſoever calls on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved:</hi> or in the preſent tenſe (as the word will admit) <hi>is ſaved;</hi> for he that thinks he knows Chriſt any otherwiſe then in the vertue of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice exerciſed in ſuch a ſubſiſtance, or by ſuch a manner or ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:118751:101"/>
exerciſed in ſuch an office, that man may come to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the Jewes of old were, and Jewiſh Gentiles are at this day, and ſo perſecute Chriſt in ſtead of receiving him, when or in whomſoever he appeareth. Let thoſe of that carnall opinion, that Chriſt ſhall come and reign upon the earth as a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch for a thouſand yeares, look into this point; for Chriſt was never known but in an office as aforeſayd, and every office of the ſpirit in its proper way and manner of working, comprehends whole Chriſt: Now the office of interceſſion is a work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>for we know not how to pray as we ought, but the ſpirit maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us,</hi> or in us; therefore it comprehends whole Chriſt, for he cannot be divided; and it being the ſpirit of the Saviour, muſt have, yea be ſalvation; for where Chriſt the Son of God is, there is ſalvation: In what grace, vertue, or office ſoever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in or by, that tradition of tying ſalvation to believing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is ridiculous; for can there be more in faith then in love, which is the fulfilling of the whole law, yea of that law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt? and are not we ſaved by hope? Doth not <hi>Timothy</hi> ſave himſelfe and them that hear him by preaching ſound doctrine? Now to take faith according to that diſmition the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gives, ſaying, <hi>It is the ſubſiſtance of things hoped for:</hi> So faith is in every vertue, office and exerciſe of Chriſt; for the ſubſiſtance is the being of God and man in one, and that is to be held and had of Chriſtians in all things that can be ſayd of Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we acknowledg nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified;</hi> There is both the unction and crucification in every thing a Chriſtian knows: but there is no unction but in the nature divine, nor ſlaying in a Chriſtan, but of the fleſh; which twayn are never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, neither in love nor hope, gentleneſſe, mercy, kindneſſe, wiſdome, truth, patience, and whatſoever can be named of Chriſt, it is the ſubſiſtance <hi>of twayn made one new man,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats it: and therefore ſalvation is in all Chriſts excellencies, and they are all as things hoped for, becauſe they are ever to come; that is, not only in preſent being and exerciſe, but ſhall for ever ſpring up unto a Chriſtian out of that living and everlaſting fountain.</p>
                  <p>All things of ſalvation therefore are in prayer; for prayer conſiſts of neceſſity and ſupply, but all neceſſities and all ſupplies
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118751:101"/>
are in prayer, therefore prayer contayns whole Chriſt, which is compleat ſalvation; therefore a work of honour to eternize the memory of a Saint.</p>
                  <p>This point may fence a Chriſtian from diſcouraging &amp; droo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thoughts, apt to ſieze upon all all fleſh, thinking himſelfe of no uſe in his age, nor of any performance befitting ſuch a name, or calling, as to be entitled a Son of God, being deſtitute of any power or authority, wiſdome or policy, device or invention, art or ſcience, ſuch as the ſons of men have gathered and encroached unto themſelves in all ages: By ſword &amp; ſtratagems; by Schools and Seminaries, by money and friendſhip, by travell and humane experiments and obſervations.</p>
                  <p>Poor heart that thou art (with reſpect unto the world) canſt thou pray? be of good comfort, it countervayls all, it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nownedſt act that ever was wrought in the world; Get thee to thy Cloſet, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhut up thy ſelfe from the common courſes and cuſtoms of this world, <hi>and pray unto thy father in ſecret;</hi> or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto, or in that ſecret and hidden myſtery of Chriſt, which is as ſecret and hidden from the world, as thy ſelfe is hid from the wayes of the world in this thy cloſet or chamber of preſence: <hi>And thy father which ſeeth in ſeecret;</hi> that is, which beholds and approves of this myſtery of God in thee, <hi>will reward thee openly;</hi> that is, will make it manifeſt that the reward or end of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and practice is to be made manifeſt to the Son of God; and that the Heyr-ſhip and inheritance of the Kingdome of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayns and belongs unto thee.</p>
                  <p>2. Again, let ſuch weigh this point that hold themſelves free from believing any doctrine in the world till they ſee it accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with miraculous works, <hi>viz.</hi> works in like manner and form as they have beene done formerly, as to heale the ſicke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the lame, open the eyes of the blind, and raiſe up the dead, all theſe are taken in a bodily and corporeall reſpect. Theſe men do not conſider that the famous and miraculous works that <hi>Elia</hi> did, all of them are included in his prayer, and that is as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as any of them; the miracles that Chriſt did, they are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>in his prayers, ſupplications, and teares, with ſtrong cryes,</hi> which is no leſſe miraculous then any of the reſt: The wonders of <hi>Paul</hi> in doing and ſuffering are all comprized in this, <hi>Behold he prayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:118751:102"/>
Now the miraculous vertue and power of prayer conſiſts not in words, or any outward expreſſion or bodily exerciſe in a form of words: but in humble petition, a lawfull ſuing out of right, a juſt and legall appeale and judgement given, according to the nature of the caſe propounded, in which all accord and agree together to compleat the myſtery and miracle of prayer, having all theſe things in it, whereby according to the law of the ſpirit, our right of inheritance is faithfully ſued out. Note further, that it is no more the form viſible of any miracle that ever was wrought, that is the proper ſeal to confirm the Goſpel; no more then the Miniſtry of the Letter that kills, is the proper path of the ſpirit that gives life.</p>
                  <p>But it is the ſcope, drift, ayme and end of the miracle in what it poynts unto, in that great and miraculous workmanſhip of Chriſt the ſon of the living God, which is the true and proper ſeale of the Goſpel: and whereſoever that is effectually wrought, there it is felt and approved, and there only the Goſpel or glad tidings of ſalvation is really and miraculouſly confirmed by a ſigne and wonder, paſſing infinitely all momentany and corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſpects.</p>
                  <p>But theſe men think they honour the Goſpel, and lift it up to its proper height, and ancient dignity. In thus concluding, their opinion is no leſſe honourable then that of thoſe that have reſolved and decreed, that the pattering (over the words of that prayer which Chriſt taught his Diſciples) as a ſpell, is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ordinance in the houſe of God, never looking at the life, ſpirit, and proper power of prayer, only the form of words. So theſe look at the form of the miracle wrought, as it appears to a naturall eye, as the other appears to the ear, and never look at the true wonder and ſigne, only ſound in the ſon of man, and elſe-where centred, is no better then the magick of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for they may as well gape after the outward forms of words to be the prayer of the Goſpel, as the outward form of the work, to be the ſeale of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and any particular, or all outward forms, which Religion is repreſented unto us in, to be the Religion of God, as well as any or all of thoſe former mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought, to be the ſeale of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Furthermore, to conclude the hiſtoricall act of wonders
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:118751:102"/>
wrought, to be the ſign of confirmation, is to darken, yea to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate the vertue and power of the Goſpel; for in this wonder of <hi>Eliah,</hi> to make the heavens as braſſe, and the earth as iron, is here a fit alluſion in the judgement of the ſpirit <hi>(and we are to heare what the ſpirit ſaith unto the Churches)</hi> in the teaching of the death of Chriſt, and the operations thereof conſidered in the world; and alſo in the houſe of God, <hi>whoſe houſe we are, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end:</hi> And thus the alluſion is unto a three yeares and ſixe moneths forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of raine, and afterwards to raynein great plenty.</p>
                  <p>This alluſion is alſo uſed not in the terme of yeares, but of two and forty moneths, which is the ſame length of time, but in a farre differing reſpect, and differing doctrine, in regard of the ſeverall beames and luſtre of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>For there he teacheth, that in meaſuring of the Temple, the Court-yard is to be left out, and not to be meaſured, becauſe it is given unto the Gentiles: <hi>And the holy Citie ſhall they tread under foot two and forty moneths,</hi> which is this three years and ſix moneths.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo alluded unto in poynt of dayes, and ſo the ſame my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is called <hi>a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes,</hi> which are not properly yeares of famine, but rather of fruit, for it is the time of the propheſie of the two witneſſes of the Goſpel; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded unto likewiſe, as conſiſting of <hi>three dayes and a halfe,</hi> which is the time of the witneſſes <hi>dead bodies lying in the ſtreets of the great Citie, which is ſpiritually called Sodome and Aegypt, where alſo our Lord was crucified, not ſuffered to be put in graves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This wonder wrought by <hi>Eliah,</hi> is alluded unto alſo, as points or monuments of time, in which the time of the womans being in the wilderneſſe is taught, a doctrine farre differing from any of the former, and that is <hi>for a time, times, and halfe a time,</hi> on the diviſion of time. Now if the three yeares and ſixe moneths drought, and afterwards rayne, were the ſubſtance and intent of the miracle, and in that the wonder to lye for the confirmation of the Goſpel; how fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly could the ſpirit of God bring it in, as an elegant alluſion in all theſe ſeverall reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore that would have the Goſpel confirmed by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of like outward form as have been done in ages paſt; they annihilate the Goſpel, by denying the truth, ſubſtance, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118751:103"/>
of the ſigne to be extant only in Chriſt. Like friends to the Goſpel are they, who look to ſee Chriſt coming from heaven, confined in one individuall man (as the Diſciples ſaw him go up) to reign on the earth as an only Monarch for the ſpace of a thouſand yeares; and then, and not till then we ſhall ſee good dayes, as thoſe Doctors affirm.</p>

                  <p>Even ſo, here is three years voyd of rayn, or dew, or any fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the earth, wherein both heaven and earth are in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and are comprehended.

                  <p>Concerning the ſixe moneths added, it is a rendring or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to each eſtate of eternity ſuch a time; for the Prophet in the hiſtory is illimited in his expreſſion, ſaying, <hi>that it ſhall be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raine nor dew for theſe yeares;</hi> which may be applyed to time paſt, preſent, or to come; for it is <hi>according to my word,</hi> which is the word of the Lord, <hi>the word of eternity:</hi> ſo that we can give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bounds to the time, but ſuch as hold correſpondency with the word of eternity: Our Apoſtle therefore brings it in by theſe expreſſions, to declaring and diſtinguiſh his meaning, namely the Prophets meaning.</p>
                  <p>This term of ſixe moneths then, is to be taken according to that diſtinction, when he ſaith, <hi>that ſommer and winter, cold and heate, ſeed-time and harveſt, night and day ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> This ſixe moneths properly ſets forth unto us the time of ſeed-time and harveſt; which take it throughout the earth, with reſpect to all grayn, and it conſiſts ſo long time: Beſides, the number ſixe hath in it the myſtery of meanes of increaſe; for increaſe, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and fruitfulneſſe is not brought in in the creation, but with the bleſſing, which is the meanes of it: So that ſix moneths in this place is the time and means of multiplication and increaſe, which is here fruſtrate and hindered by the drought unto barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and famine.</p>
                  <p>In the myſtery of Chriſt, the Saints of God ſow unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

but the ſeed of immortality is loſt in the wicked, they reap nothing unto eternall life. Alſo the wicked, they ſow unto the fleſh, but their ſeed is loſt in the Saints, and comes to nought, for they reap nothing of corruption: So that in theſe three years of eternity there is a fruſtration of ſeed-time and harveſt; an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fruitleſneſſe, barrenneſſe, and famine throughout the earth; the one unto bleſſing, in bringing forth nothing unto the fleſh; the other unto a curſe, in bringing forth nothing unto the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Yet men beare men in hand, and vainly perſwade themſelves they can convert men, and turn them by their preaching, and make them other things then they are, whereas the Goſpel only declares and diſcovers men to appear to be that which they are, no alteration of a work done once and for ever. They may as well ſay they can make the righteous and juſt one a ſinner, as to ſay the wicked may become holy, otherwiſe then as they are once and for ever; for Gods work in man-kind is an eternall act, not knowable, but as himſelfe conſidered one with it.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>It follows, which is the renewing of his prayer, and the effect thereof;</hi> And he prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
                  <p>We are not here to take prayer as one being of a later produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then the former, for they are but one continued and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall act, as the doctrine of the Goſpel is, which is herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto us; for the things of God are comprehended and involved one in another: and it is the skill of a Scribe taught un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of God, to bring them out of the treaſury, as things of old from eternity; and new, as in preſent uſe, fitting and beſeeming the preſent oration and opportunity. This phraſe therefore is like that, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>My little children, of whom I travell in birth againe, till Chriſt be formed in you;</hi> not as though they had now defaced Chriſt, who before was formed in them: but he declares hereby the effect of his doctrine, from which ſome were turned aſide unto the rudiments of the Law, as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:118751:105"/>
unto another Goſpel, which he ſaith is not another, but the ſame Goſpel perverted by falſe Teachers, telling them that ſome are entangled with the yoke of bondage thereby; for he that is bound to any particular of the carnall commandement, as to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, or any outward form of bodily action; <hi>He is bound to keepe the whole law,</hi> and ſhews that <hi>ſuch have aboliſhed Chriſt,</hi> and are faln from grace; ſuch effect he ſhews his Doctrine had of ſome, <hi>as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death unto death:</hi> but there were others unto whom hee there ſpeaks, on whom his doctrine had a more noble effect, as being a ſavour of life; Therefore he ſaith, <hi>My little children, of whom I travell in birth againe;</hi> or I have brought you forth, not in a ſecond act, but in another manner and way, namely to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt in you, or framing you into the ſimilitude of the Son of God once and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo it is here, <hi>He prayed againe;</hi> that is, the ſpirit of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion hath a ſecondary, or other manner of effect then that which is before ſpecified, not another prayer, but another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wonder accompliſhed by the ſame prayer, for <hi>now the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens gave raine, and the earth brings forth her fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are to know then, that as the Goſpel opens the treaſuries of the Kingdome of God unto an abundant freedome, liberty, and plenty of the going forth and exerciſe of the ſpirit of grace in the Saints, even as <hi>water poured upon the thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground,</hi> through that office of interceſſion peculiar unto our <hi>Eliah,</hi> without any hinderance or engagement of any bond of the fleſh; when through the ſpirit of prayer, that cloud of witneſſe or rayn of liberality ariſeth, as a hand or adminiſtration thereof, even as the word of the Lord is ſayd to come by the hand of <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> and by the hand of <hi>Malachie,</hi> and by the hand of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which ſo covereth the heavens, as no parching ſun of the beams of mans wiſdome and device taketh place, no more then they doe in thoſe over-ſhadowings of the Virgin, by that holy ſpirit of God in the production of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo doth Prayer ſet at liberty the works of the fleſh in the men of the world, by opening the ſluces and flood-gates thereof unto condemnation and deſtruction; for the waters of the great deep, myſtery, or bottomleſſe pit, are opened for the deſtruction of the world, as well as the flood-gates of heaven for the ſafety of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118751:106"/>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> and his houſhold, in bearing up the Ark fifteen cubits above the great mountayns of the States of this earth, or of the world. And this prayer doth not ſimply, accidentally, but miniſterially and effectually in the ſame ſence, <hi>That the Goſpell is a ſavour of death unto death.</hi> Not only by gleaning of all the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe out of the wiſdome of the Serpent, or men of the world, which centred in the Saints, are the proper cauſe of the tranſcendencies of their eſtate above all humane excellencies, ſo doth it alſo gleane all the vicious deſires of the fleſh out of that ſtate and condition of Chriſt, centring them in that ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, whereby man deſcends infinitely beneath a ſtate of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, humane, or properties of a meer creature, and by faſhioning and corrupting the holy things of God, becomes ſatanicall, and diabolicall, and ſuch as ſeek to finde an excellent or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble betwixt theſe twayn, it cannot be better deſcribed or diciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (for the ſolidity of it) then by that partition that divides Purgatory and Hell, in thoſe of that mercinary conceipt.</p>
                  <p>The abundance of ſpirit therefore in the Saints, and that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſpirit <hi>of the Prince of the power of the ayre which now works in the children of diſobedience,</hi> hold proportion in way of <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> otherwiſe an infinite and an eternall wrath could not take place in the wicked, as an infinite and eternall glory doth in the Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For he made but one;</hi> ſpeaking of that ſtate of Chriſt (with an elegant alluſion unto the high Prieſt) <hi>and wherefore but one?</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had abundance of ſpirit, namely that there might be a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed; that whatſoever the fruits are, that are by one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of the ſame nature and dignity are all the fruits of happineſſe produced and brought forth by that one myſtical and ſpirituall body, and ſo in a diameter reſpect are all the fruits of ſin in the wicked.</p>
                  <p>This plenty in this two-fold reſpect is ſignified by warning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Ahab,</hi> to betake himſelfe to his Chariot, <hi>for I heare a noyſe of much raine,</hi> which <hi>Ahab</hi> flyes from as a terrible thing, as it contayns the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah,</hi> betaking himſelfe to Chariot and horſe in the furnitures of this world: and <hi>Eliah</hi> flyes from it, as it hath the ſpirit of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> as that which brings deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon them, only hee betakes himſelfe to the ſtrength of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:118751:106"/>
Gods ſpirit to take the gates of <hi>Ieſreel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The plenty of <hi>Eliah's</hi> ſpirit is ſeen and taught in that duration and plenty in the cruſe of oyle, and barrell of meale; raiſing up the womans ſonne from death to life, and annoynting <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> for the ruine of <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe; <hi>Eliſha</hi> to be a Prophet in his ſtead, and in the deſtruction of all thoſe falſe Prophets of <hi>Baal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the plenty of the rayn of that ſpirit of wickedneſſe appears in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> their cruelty towards the Prophet of God, their miſerable and horrible overthrow, and in their deſire and endeavour to nouriſh and maintayn ſuch plenty of a falſe ſpirit of propheſie upon the face of the earth, and in this plenty of rain, ſeed-time, and harveſt are continued; for the world ſow unto the fleſh, and the fleſh they reap and inherit corruption; and the Saints ſow unto the ſpirit, and inherit everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>And from this power of prayer he aſſumes the power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of doctrine, in which he concludes the Epiſtle, to ſhew that where the power and vertue of the one reſides, there is the power and vertue of the other. The prayer of Faith is never without the ſpirit of Propheſie: and propheſie according to the ſpirit, is never without the life and power of prayer; and where one of theſe is wanting, they are both abſent from that party, in the true exerciſe of them; for a formall prayer is never accompanyed with the life and power of ſound doctrine: but as they have compoſed a prayer by mans invention, gathering up expreſſions ſutable in the underſtanding of a man, ſo do they compoſe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from Libraries, School-diſtinctions, and from a ſerious obſervation of the carriage and demeanour of one creature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, only bringing God into the account, by <hi>turning the glory of the incorruptible God into the ſimilitude of a corruptible man, and of birds, four-footed beaſts, and of creeping things.</hi> It is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, books, and Libraries, that can transfer the ſpirit of the Scriptures; no nor the skill in thoſe Languages wherein they were originally written, without the ſame ſpirit comment upon them in our hearts, by which they were firſt indited: It is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that indited them, that gives the meaning of them, and not the hand that writes or tranſlates, no more then paper and inke can doe it. Without which ſpirit, let us uſe all meanes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:118751:107"/>
and induſtry that poſſible we can, &amp; it is but to pick at the bark, and rinde of truths, and cracking of a ſhell, voyd and deſtitute of any kernell, better then a gale of bitterneſs to be found in it; and ſuch as compoſe their Sermons of ſuch ſtuffe, their prayers are no better, however they may ſhew the zeale of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of them.</p>
                  <p>But true prayer carries the force of the Doctrine of the Goſpel in it, by judging of the want and ſupply, according unto God, and true doctrine hath the power of prayer going forth in it for the effectuall performance of the things that are taught, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other conſiſt of any form or ſtatue that any book or Library can poſſibly bring and repreſent unto us; for the viſions and operations of God are never found in the ſame form and time as at another, all circumſtances duely weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p>Yet may we not deny, but the ſame words may be uſed often and again in prayer or doctrine, but with a various reſpect, as this wonder of <hi>Eliah</hi> is brought in, with reſpect to years, months, dayes, and poynts of time: ſo Chriſt prayed in the ſame words <hi>thrice,</hi> but with variety and eternity of reſpect, for the cup for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſſeth by him, and toucheth him not, as man is eternally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that bleſſed condition of the Son of God, and it takes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, at the Sonne of God is transformed by the world into the curſed ſtate and condition: For if we make the death of Chriſt according to the true myſtery of it, wherein ſalvation doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, to be of leſſe continuance then eternity; wee ſhall annihilate Chriſt, and make ſalvation it ſelfe of no longer continuance; for if Chriſt once dye unto the fleſh in the godly, he never lives unto it any more: And if he once be dead in the wicked, in reſpect of his proper ſpirit and life, it is never repaired in them agayn, for then there were not eteranll perdition, which the word of God hath commended unto us upon like grounds of certainty, that it hath done everlaſting life: That word tranſlated, <hi>was dead and is alive,</hi> is read <hi>is dead and is alive;</hi> as the ſame word, <hi>I am an Apoſtle,</hi> is uſed in the preſent tence. Doctrine and prayer are inſeparable companions, even as Kingdome and Prieſt hood are, as here in the way of Chriſt, even ſo in the world in the way of Antichriſt, and thus the connexion of the next point is brought in.</p>

                  <hi>Erred from the trueth;</hi> that is, gone aſtray, and wandred from that which is the reality and ſubſtance of all things, which is Chriſt the Son of God: And to erre in this place, is not ſimply for a meer creature to declyne and go away from his Creator; but to pervert, miſ-apply, and wrongfully to interpret the very things of God themſelves, <hi>turning his glory into ſhame, his truth into a lye;</hi> therefore they erre from truth, as having been in it; for that which was, is, and ever ſhall be <hi>righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of truth,</hi> they have perverted unto prophaneſſe and wickedneſſe, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the things of God to be ſuch as the proper ſpirit of a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature naturally brings forth, ſo that it is a diabolicall ſpirit which this errour is formed into.</p>
               <p>The particle <hi>(if)</hi> is not here to be taken as making queſtions, or doubt whether there be ſuch a ſwerving from truth, but as a certaine affirmation, that ſuch there are, as the Apoſtle explayns the Prophets meaning, where it is ſayd, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom I ſware in my wrath</hi> (if) <hi>they ſhall enter into my reſt:</hi> which the Apoſtle expounds, <hi>They ſhall not enter into his reſt,</hi> as an abſolute certainty: And ſo there is of one converting or turning from errour into truth, in that wonderfull change that the Sonne of God makes in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for it is impoſſile that he ſhould be held of death: but as certainly as he layes down his life in the wicked, ſo muſt he take it agayn in the godly, otherwiſe there were an annihilation of him who is the Author and ſtrength of all things, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>And in this change or turning, we are not to take it as the ſimple and ſingle ſpirit of a creature turned, but the compleat ſpirit of him who is the Son of God; for as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of prayer, <hi>We know not how to pray as we ought, but the ſpirit maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us.</hi> It is not the ſpirit of God, without the ſpirit of the creature, for then there could be no want to be ſupplyed: ſo that the whole ſpirit of Chriſtianity prayeth, <hi>viz.</hi> God and man in unity; ſo it is here, the ſpirit that turns, is God and man in unity, and is as true a change from that which is, and ever ſhall be Satanicall, as the wicked erre from that which is, and ever ſhall be holy and righteous, and they are both of one and the ſame time, in the riſe of them: <hi>For in the beginning was the word, and that word is with God, and is God:</hi> And <hi>Satan is a lyar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

and abode not in truth,</hi> no more <hi>then Chriſts ſoule was left in hell, or that holy one ſuffered to ſee corruption,</hi> but was ever taught in the way of life, and in that reall preſence, <hi>at whoſe right hand there is fullneſſe of joy for evermore:</hi> Therefore the Prophet ſaith, that Chriſt comes meek and lowly, ſaving himſelfe, that is, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not apart only: and therein the worth and dignity of ſalvation ſtands, that it hath that weight, ſubſtance of account, and reckoning in it; and upon this ground the Diſciples are comforted againſt all feare whatſoever, where it is ſaid, <hi>Are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthing, and yet one of them falls not to the ground without the good will of your heavenly father? of how much more worth are ye then many ſparrows?</hi> Can you ſet a price and rate of ſo mean a thing, and doth God take care for the preſervation of it? <hi>Of what eſteem, price, and reſpect then is the ſtate of a Chriſtian?</hi> in which not a part, but the compleat ſpirit of the Son of God is involved, and by a ranſome given, and payd in the world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable thereunto purchaſed. This point contains a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the common Prieſt-hood of the world (ſo far as I have heard or ſeen in books) is altogether ignorant of, though life and death, yea the ſpring and originall fountaine of all things is involved in it: So much for the propoſition, the injunction followes.</p>

                  <p>That is, that the party thus turning, or turned; for both are true, and the word implies both, one that turns, and one turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for both are in that ſtate of Chriſt: and he that preacheth any thing but Chriſt and him crucified, he goes beyond our Apoſtle as far as the common apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Let,</hi> then, eſtabliſheth in the heart of him (and no other) that turneth a ſinner from the errour of his way, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:118751:109"/>
power of acknowledgment of ſuch a condition, or royall and noble acts, which here follows: but firſt ſee here the nature of the confeſſion or acknowledgment of ſin, <hi>it is his way</hi> that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>naturally,</hi> but it is confeſſed to the change, or converting it unto the ſtate of the Sonne of God; even as truth may be ſayd to be <hi>their way naturally,</hi> who are in errour, but they have perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame into falſhood, <hi>turning the truth of God into a lye, and his grace into wantonneſſe:</hi> ſo that their way (with reſpect to that which they have perverted) is holineſſe, and is, and ever ſhall be ſo in Chriſt; but there remayns nothing but ſin and wickedneſſe in the perverters thereof.</p>
                  <p>So alſo a Chriſtian may confeſſe that the evill of ſin and errour is his way, with reſpect to that which is converted, and is, and ever ſhall be ſo in the wicked: but in that ſtate of the turned and converted, there is no ſin nor errour to be found at all; there is then a reality of the Saints confeſſion of their ſin, but it is to the removing of it to another, where it abides for ever, as there is a reall confeſſion of a holy one in the wicked, but it is ever in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it unto another, which they are not, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpirit of <hi>Python,</hi> that unperſwaded or unfaithed one; as the Apoſtle gives the wicked the title of <hi>Apeitheis, unperſwaded,</hi> or <hi>diſobedient:</hi> ſo that their acknowledgment of holineſſe in another ſubſiſtance, is the unfaithing or unbetrothing of the ſoule from God, it is its proper and perpetuall divorce.</p>
                  <p>So that he that knows not how to clear the ſtate of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſin, and fill the world with wickedneſſe, he will come to make a bankrupt-like account, when ever his eſtate comes to be diſcovered: Therefore the wealthy eſtate, noble acts, and royall prerogatives following, are only entailed and made over to him that turns the ſinner from the errour of his way; errour colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, as all conſidered in one, otherwiſe Chriſt is not cleered, and made the holy one of God, and then not riſen from the dead. We are yet in our ſins, the ſubſtance of the common doctrine at this day in the world.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point or act of honour given to him that turns, is, <hi>that he ſaves a ſoule from death;</hi> not as the world thinks by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terrours of the Law, and frighting men from ſome groſſe and bruitiſh acts, they have thereby converted and ſaved ſouls; the

But the thing to be acknowledged by ſuch a one, as turns, or is turned, is, <hi>he ſaves;</hi> that is, the power and ſpirit of the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is there: when once we know of what nature the ſpirit of the world is, namely, <hi>that wee are of God, and the world is of that wicked one?</hi> then wee ſhall learn to acknowledg, that ſalvation never appears, but there is the Saviour; wee thinke to honour Chriſt by binding him up in one individuall man; in point of the myſtery of the Goſpel, it is a carnall and humane honour, not beſeeming the Son of God; the common Prieſt-hood hath blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beſotted the world in this point, ſetting up an idoll in mens minds, and not the myſtery of life that is by Chriſt: but it is taken for blaſphemy in theſe dayes, to talk of the Son of God, or a Saviour any where, but as lockt up in a humane body in heaven, that men may ſtand here in his room, till he return from thence, to ſuck up all the glory of the earth.</p>
                  <p>It was not ſo in ages paſt, and men ſpirituall; for <hi>Joſhuah, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Miniſter, was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Saviour, as the Apoſtle interprets his name, and the Lord acknowledgeth in raiſing up Judges in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> that he raiſed up Saviours unto them. And <hi>Paul</hi> was not affraid to tell <hi>Timmothie,</hi> that <hi>in taking heed to himſelfe;</hi> that is, how God hath compoſed ſalvation in his conſiſting in Chriſt, and <hi>unto learning or doctrine;</hi> that is, how it ought to be layd out and diſtributed to others, that in ſo doing, <hi>he ſhould be a Saviour of himſelfe, and them that heare him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond point is, <hi>what he ſaves;</hi> that is, a ſoule, or a life; this is not meant of the life of a meer creature, but it is the life
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:118751:110"/>
of the Son of God, as our Apoſtle affirms; <hi>Now I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me; and the life which I now live, is by, or in the faith of the ſonne of God.</hi> So that a Chriſtians life is the life of Chriſt: and there is no life of man-kind, but either the life of the Saviour, or elſe the life of Sathan, that deſtroyer; for heaven and earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together in the making of man. <hi>Let us</hi> (ſpeaking with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that plurality) <hi>in our image;</hi> that is, in our image earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as heavenly; for there is a heavenly body, and there is an earthly body, and God is as juſt and righteous in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the one, as of the other, and every way as honourable, the one in mercy, and the other in ſeverity: And man cannot be known in a ſimple act of creation, for that multiplies him not; but propagation or generation muſt be brought in alſo, elſe the ſon of God, nor the ſeed of the Serpent can be known, &amp; ſo both are brought forth in that firſt act of generation in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> wherein the ſeed of the Serpent appears in the ſame act as in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> together with Chriſt in <hi>Abel,</hi> dead by <hi>Caine</hi> in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in <hi>Seth, that ſett one</hi> in life for evermore, who is ſet in the room of <hi>Abel,</hi> crucified in the world: So that the life of Chriſt, and of Antichriſt are both from one act, even from as early dayes the one as the other, and without the true knowledg of that, we know neither of them: and for other life in man-kind, we know none worthy the name of life beyond other creatures, but as it ſerves to the ſetting forth of the one or of the other of theſe, and ſo they tranſcend the life of all other creatures, as far as the image of God did the frame of any other creature, or that earthly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage deſcends below them all, even to a bottomleſſe pit, which no other creature is ſubjected unto, but only man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a third point what he ſaves from, that is, <hi>death,</hi> namely a death that holds correſpondency with that infinite and eternall life of the Son of God, in way of Paratheſis in all points, for Chriſt is ſaved from whatſoever Sathan is, hath, or undergoes: and Sathan is deſtroyed from whatſoever Chriſt is, hath, or is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced unto; therefore that conceit that Sathan was an Angell, that is a meere creature at the firſt, and in acceptation with God is a meer humane tradition, and philoſophicall fiction, and is a point of greater concernment then men are aware of; for it is as ſafe to ſay, that the ſon of God was for a time out of the Fathers

                  <p>2. A ſecond royalty, or act of fame that is to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him who turns the ſinner from the errour of his way, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him into truth it ſelfe, that is, the <hi>covering or hiding of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is taken from the ſpeech of <hi>Solomon, Hatred ſtirreth up ſtrife, but love covereth all ſins,</hi> which our Apoſtle calls <hi>a multitude of ſins:</hi> the word ſignifies the deep of the troubled ocean, intimating that huge multitude of torturing and troubling treſpaſſes, proper to that great gulfe of the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
                  <p>Now to turn from the error of a mans way, is to turn to truth; and no man can turn to truth, but by that unity that is in Chriſt; none turns to truth, but hee that becomes truth; for there is no terme or title given in Scripture, but being rightly interpretted and rightly applyed, the truth, ſubſtance, and being of the thing is there; for God uſeth no expreſſion, but he intends under that the truth and ſubſtance of the thing expreſſed: To turn to <hi>truth,</hi> is not only <hi>truth</hi> in word, but <hi>truth</hi> in act alſo, yea to be that very thing as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that unity that is in Chriſt is the fulfilment and complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the law of the Spirit; for if the love of Chriſt be in us, and conſtrayn us to all acknowledgments of him, we know that love is the fulfilling of the Law: and where the Law is fulfilled, there ſin utters not its voyce, nor hath it a face to appear, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hid and covered for ever. Chriſt is the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Againe, how do the wicked hide righteouſneſſe, that none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in them but only the ſpirit of the wicked one, namely by walking according to the law of the fleſh: For he that walks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the law of the fleſh, he cannot pleaſe God, ſo that all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is hid and covered in them, yea even by fulfilling the law of the fleſh; for the more they conform themſelves thereunto, the more their condemnation doth appear: for it is not becauſe men cannot perform all the works of the law (in that reſpect) that they cannot be juſtified thereby, but becauſe they do any of them; for it is againſt the nature of that law of the carnall Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and every part thereof to juſtifie, for it is its proper nature and office to condemn; for we may as well ſay, <hi>that the law of the ſpirit of life which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is a law of ſin and death, as to ſay, <hi>the law of the carnall command can give life or peace, no not in the compleat performance of it.</hi> For every part thereof is a breach of <hi>the law of the ſpirit:</hi> And whatſoever is a breach of <hi>the law of the ſpirit,</hi> is a crucifying of the Son of God afreſh, and putting of him to open ſhame: ſo that every performance of the law of the fleſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intent thereof, is a breach of the ſame law of the ſpirit; and he that breaks one, breaks all, therefore all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is hid and covered in the wicked; even ſo the true keeping of the law of the ſpirit of faith in any part of it, is a nullifying of the whole law of the carnall Command; therefore no law of ſin and death is found in them, all ſins and ſorrows are hid and covered; therefore <hi>the man is bleſſed whoſe treſpaſs is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered: Bleſſed is the man, and he only, unto whom the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth, accounteth, or reckoneth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile,</hi>
