            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. Atturney deſired Counſell to anſwer: It was replyed, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation laid to his charge, being matters not of Law, but of Fact, and againſt the priviledges of the Houſe, he was not to have Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but to anſwer himſelfe <hi>viva voce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a Letter, which the King wrote to the Lord Keeper, and by him communicated to the Lords, the particulars whereof is ſpecified at large in the ſecond page of this Book.</p>
                  <p>Colonell <hi>Francis Edwards</hi> being queſtioned about words that he ſpake laſt Friday againſt the King and Parliament, anſwered, that he remembred not any ſuch words: but would not deny but that he might ſpeake them; but yet ſaid, that if he ſpake them, it was in drink. This anſwer ſatisfied not the Houſe, but he was committed.</p>
                  <p>Souldiers that are in Ireland ſent a complaint to the Parliament, that the Treaſurer that was to pay them their wages, tooke ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in a pound from them: which complaint the Parliament ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to be very juſt, Ordered that the Souldiers ſhould have their full pay, and that the Treaſurer should be otherwiſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his paines about the money.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Arthur Trellare,</hi> Burgeſſe of Plimmoth, was expelled the Houſe for ſaying, upon a queſtion of a Guard being at White-Hall, and a Guard about the Parliament, that the Kings feares did ariſe from the Parliament, and the Parliaments feares aroſe from the King: and that it was Treaſon for the Parliament to have a Guard without the conſent of the King.</p>
                  <p>A Scotch-man informed againſt one Dr. <hi>Browne,</hi> that he ſhould ſay, that our King <hi>Charles</hi> was <hi>Rex Scotiae, non Scotorum,</hi> King of Scotland, not of the Scots. Thereupon a Meſſenger was ſent for him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Atturney this day appearing before the Lords, had Counſell appoynted him by the Lords, who appeared there; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons refuſed to be preſent, and they that ſhould have enforced the Accuſation, refuſed to come. The Counſell appoynted for him by the Lords, was Mr. Recorder of London , and Sir <hi>Thomas

Benesfield</hi> both of them refuſed to plead for the Atturney, and thereupon the Lords committed them to the black Rod.</p>
                  <p>Much time was ſpent in perfecting the booke of Rates for things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the Land and imported into it; and alſo about ſetling the Statute for 400000 I. upon Lands, and likewiſe upon the bill concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the million of money for the Rebels Lands.</p>

                  <p>The Houſe of Commons ſent up to the Lords, that they would bee pleaſed to ſubſcribe to the Million, as they themſelves were willing to doe, and that for example ſake. The Dutch Merchants deſired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwrite two hundred thouſand pounds. Vpon debate it was voted, that they ſhould have liberty to underwrite one hundred thouſand pounds, if thay did it within a time preſcribed, and that the whole Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion were not before ſubſcribed by Engliſh and Scots.</p>
                  <p>According to the Order that was made yeſterday, to ſend for Doctor <hi>Browne</hi> upon that which was informed againſt him, a meſſenger was this day diſpatched away for him.</p>
                  <p>Information was this day given unto the Houſe that ſome of the Kings Printers were ſent for to goe unto <hi>Yorke,</hi> and that they were packing up their Preſſes and preparing themſelves for that journey.</p>
                  <p>Whereas a motion had formerly beene made concerning a Lecturer to be ſetled at <hi>Branford,</hi> the Pariſhioners Petitioned for one Mr. <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> to be their Lecturer, the Houſe referred the conſideration therof, to the choiſe of the Pariſhioners.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> are appointed to preach before the Houſe of Commons at the next faſt. Much time was alſo this day ſpent about the Booke of Rates, yet is it not finiſhed, for they went but to the letter O.</p>
                  <p>The Houſe of Commons ordered that after the publike buſineſſes of this Land and <hi>Ireland</hi> are ended, they ſhall come together again accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ancient cuſtome, at 8. a clock in the morning, and ſit till 12, and that private Committees ſhall ſit in the after-noone for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular buſineſſes, as they were wont formerly to doe.</p>
                  <p>There was a great diſpute in the Houſe of Commons about Generalls for the Navy under the Lord Admirall, in caſe hee ſhould not bee well, or not otherwiſe able to goe in his owne perſon, and the queſtion was, whether there ſhould be three, or only one: reaſons for three were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that there would bee imployment ſundry wayes, as to keepe the Seas at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to keepe them likewiſe about the entring into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and for other Services: but was concluded that one was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, power being given unto him, to chooſe others under him.

               </head>
               <p>I Am confident that you expect not that I ſhould give you a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Anſwer to this ſtrange and unexpected Declaration: and I am ſorry (in the diſtraction of this Kingdome) you ſhould think this way of addreſſe to be more convenient, than that propoſed by my Meſſage the twentieth of Ianuary laſt to both Houſes.</p>
               <p>As concerning the grounds of your fears &amp; jealouſies, I wil take time to anſwer particularly, and doubt not but I ſhall doe it to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the world: God in his good time will, I hope, diſcover the ſecrets and bottoms of all Plots and Treaſons, and then I ſhall ſtand right in the eyes of all my People. In the meane time I muſt tell you, that I rather expected vindication for the imputation laid on me in Mr. <hi>Pym's</hi> Speech, than that any more generall rumours and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould get credit with you.</p>
               <p>For my feares and doubts, I did not think they ſhould have beene thought ſo groundleſſe, or triviall, whilſt ſo many ſeditious Pamphlets, and Sermons are looked upon, and ſo great Tumults are remembred unpuniſhed, uninquired into. I ſtill confeſſe my feares, and call God to witneſſe, that they are greater for the true Proteſtant profeſſion, My People and Lawes, than for My owne Rights and Safety. Though I muſt tell you, I conceive, that none of theſe are free from danger.</p>
               <p>What would you have? Have I violated your Lawes? Have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to paſſe any one Bill for the eaſe and ſecurity of my Subjects? I doe not aske what you have done for me?</p>
               <p>Have any of my People beene tranſported with feares and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions? I have offered as free and generall a pardon as your ſelves could deviſe.</p>
               <p>All this conſidered, there is a judgement from heaven upon this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if theſe diſtractions continue.</p>
               <p>God ſo deale with me and mine, as all my thoughts and intentions are upon right, for the maintenance of the Proteſtant Profeſſion, and for the obſervation and preſervation of the Lawes of this Land, and I hope God will bleſſe and aſsiſt thoſe Lawes for My Preſervation.</p>
