            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44324:3"/>
in all essentials, which therefore, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hath done, according unto <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch then, as the Children are partakers of Flesh and Blood, he also himself took part of the same: and <hi>ver.</hi> 16.

                  <p>These Scriptures prove nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my assertion, for they are only to be understood of his outward coming, when he took Flesh in the Virgins Womb, and came in the likeness of Sinful Flesh; now I do not say, that he took that outward Flesh from the beginning, but only at that time: but he, namely, the Heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> himself, was from the beginning, and was the Word made Flesh, and gave unto the Saints srom the beginning, his Flesh to Eat, and his Blood to Drink, otherwise they could not have had Life in them, according to <hi>John</hi> 6.</p>

                  <head>Ans.</head>
                  <p>Here thou seemest rather to mock, than to argue in good earnest. But what I have affirmed of the Heavenly Flesh and Blood of Christ, which he had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, is no invention, nor fiction of ours, but grounded on the Scriptures Testimony,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44324:4"/>
and also on our own blessed experience: for that Flesh and Blood of Christ, which he had from the beginning, is the Food and Nourishment of our Souls unto Eternal Life, as it was also the Food and Nourishment of the Souls of all that believed in him, from the beginning of the World; for all before, and after his outward coming in that Body of Flesh, did Eat the same Spiritual Meat, and Drink the same Spiritual Drink; for they Drank of the Rock, &amp;c. and that Rock was Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. But when the Apostle is speaking of four kinds of Flesh, he is only speaking of the Flesh of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial, or Earthly Bodies; but not of the Flesh of Christ that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which indeed, is none of these four Sorts, but hath a more excellent Nature: for all these four Sorts are but Natural and Corruptible, but the Flesh of Christ is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Incorruptible: And as touching the words of <hi>Grotius,</hi> cited by thee, Flesh is not understood by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but of the Mortal Body; it is easily answered, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word literally, without any Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor or Figurative Speech; but if we take it Figuratively, it hath other Significations. For how oft is all mankind comprehending both Soul and Body, called Flesh in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet the Soul is not the Mortal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44324:5"/>
Body? But how little hast thou considered, how if thou stand unto the words of <hi>Grotius,</hi> thou hast given a stone to break thy own Head? for if nothing is to be called Flesh, but the Mortal Body; then the Body of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, namely, both Christ, his Body, &amp; also the Resurrection - Body of the Saints, is not properly Flesh, because not a Mortal Body.</p>

               <p>The Apostles fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently speak of things to come, as present; as well might the Author say, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a Soul and Body, and did exist in flesh and blood, an Hundred Years before he was born; for he is called by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Gods A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, before his Birth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45. 1.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Ans.</head>
                  <p>If this be not gross Socinianisme, and Samosatenianisme, I leave unto all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and sound Christians for to Judg: For both the Socinians now, and Samosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenians of old, denyed that Christ was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mary;</hi> and so doth this Author, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the express. Testimony of many Scriptures cited and opened in my Book called, <hi>The Way cast up;</hi> to which again, I Refer the Reader: and what a gross and unchristian, yea, Blasphemous comparison is this of the Author, betwixt <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> as if <hi>Christ</hi> were no more Gods Anointed before his outward Birth in the Flesh, than <hi>Cyrus,</hi> was before his birth; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44324:5"/>
so by this means, all the Saints from the beginning of the World unto the outward birth of Christ, containing near about four Thousand Years, had no Christ, nor no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, no Head, no Mediator; nor indeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Heavenly and Spiritual Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Unction; and so had nothing of the Holy Ghost, which is that Anointing: for how could they have it without Christ, who is Gods Anointed, originally and first of all, and from, and by, and through whom, it cometh down, and is conveyed unto the Saints, even as the Oyl that was poured on <hi>Aarons</hi> Head, ran down from the Beard unto the skirts of his Garment: Now that <hi>David</hi> and all the Saints, before Christ came in the flesh, were in measure anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the holy Unction, or Anointing; even the same wherewith the Saints are now A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: see <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1, 2. And how did they receive this Oyl or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, but from Christ, who is Gods Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted first of all, and by whom it descendeth unto them, of whom <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Priest, was the Figure or Type; &amp; therefore Christ was Gods Anointed from the beginning, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but before all other men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto <hi>Prov,</hi> 8. 23. I was anointed from the beginning, (so the Hebrew word <hi>Nissakti,</hi> doth signifie, as I have already
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44324:6"/>

                  <p>These Scriptures are only to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Christ, his Sufferings in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of flesh; so that he did but once die and suffer for sin, in the outward body, and in his outward person, which doth not hinder, but that he suffered and was slain, inwardly and spiritually, in mens hearts by sin, both before and since he suffer'd in the body of flesh, which was Crucified at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> for the writer to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> did tell of those that fell away, that they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify to themselves the Son of God afresh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6.

                  <head>Ans.</head>
                  <p>That Nature which Christ did take from the beginning, did and doth excel in its very being, the Nature, both of all men, and also of all the most glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and yet, according unto the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is somtimes called Angel, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Man; Angel there, not signifying the common nature of Angels, but only his High Office and Dignity thereof; for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is, as to say, Messenger, or one that is sent: and therefore it doth not follow from this, that Christ took on him the common Nature of Angels, as he did the seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when he was born the son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> according to the Flesh.

               <p>Here he bringeth forth no matter of argument, but onely some queries, which I might altogether wave; yet for the sake of others, I shall say that which may suffice unto any sober enquirer: And to the First, I say, this Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44324:8"/>
of the man-hood of Christ, is one with the Holy Ghost, by an oneness of union, even as the man Christ, is one with God; but as the Holy Ghost doth signify the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, simply considered, the Spirit of Christ, as man, is distinct from the Holy Ghost, as really as the man-hood of Christ, is distinct from the God-head, but not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, or separated there-from. To the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond I answer, that the Spirit of Christ, as he is the Heavenly Man, is not properly a creature, but only as it is taken improperly, &amp; largely, for a Divine Production &amp; Emanation; but properly, it is rather an Emanation or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, than a Creation. To the Third I say, a Spiritual Body, can well enough pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate another that is, either, not Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; or if Spiritual, yet not in that degree, as the other. Now, when I say, according unto the Scripture, that Christ had Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Flesh and Blood from the beginning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he fed the Saints; by that Flesh and Blood, I mean a Spiritual Body, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree: and how one Body more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, can penetrate another, in a less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, we have a Figure, or shaddowy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, in the outward light, that doth easily penetrate, both christal and air. To the Fourth, I say, it is very easiy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how Christ is called the Second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> although, as man, he was before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:44324:9"/>
who is called the first man: namely, in respect of the outward birth in the flesh, and also, in some respect, in the inward birth, of Christ in us, when we are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and made new creatures, in him: for commonly, the first birth, which is of the nature of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the Fall, hath place in men, before Christ the second birth be formed in them; and yet Christ himself and his Spirit, Life and Soul, as he is the Heavenly Man, was and is before <hi>Adam</hi> and all Creatures, the first and the last; of whom <hi>John</hi> said, <hi>there cometh a man after me, which is preferred unto me, for he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me:</hi> And thus, according to <hi>Solomons</hi> advice in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> I have answered the Fool in his folly, lest he should seem wise in his own Eyes.</p>

Christ, Reconciling the world unto himself. Again, whereas thou sayst, by way of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Was the man that appeared frequently to the Patriarches, without the spring of this Soul and life of Christ.

But that Christ the Heavenly man, took part of Flesh and Blood with the Children, see <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. And that this he, who did so partake with men of Flesh and Blood, was not God; separately, and abstractly considered; but God in Union with the Heavenly Man-hood, and Soul of Christ, is clear, from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. Now these words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. <hi>I came</hi>

                  <hi>down from Heaven, not to do mine own will;</hi> most clearly signifie, that the Soul of Christ came down from Heaven, to take Flesh; for God simply considered, could not say, I came down from Heaven, not to do my own will, for God always doth his own will, which being most Holy, is a Law, both unto Christ the Heavenly man, and also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all others: this Scripture with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I did bring, in my book, <hi>The way cast up,</hi> for proof of what I have affirmed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou hast taken no notice, so as to give any reply. <hi>But lastly, whereas thou sayst, in this Twelve Animadversion, In the next quotation, Mark, he saith, As man he was the Son of God;</hi> at which thou art offended: it seemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this is no part of thy Creed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christ as man, was the Son of God, even when born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> But if thou denyest this, I ask thee, who was the Father of Christ, as he was man, but God? For if he had another Father, then he was not born of the Virgin: which, if this be not rampant blasphemy, for any called a Christian to affirm, I leave unto all true Christians for to Judge: Or if thou denyest, that Christ was the Son of God before he was born in the Flesh, thou art Guilty of Gross <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> and contradictest the Scriptures Testimony in many places.</p>

                  <p>That Christ was never man, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deny, to follow by any true Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; from what I have affirmed, and as to his reason, that Christ never had a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul, according unto <hi>Keith,</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words, Humane Soul, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I have used that Term at all in my book, <hi>The way cast up;</hi> for because it is not a Scripture-Term, and of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Equivocous signification, I purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did pass it by; I say, it is of a doubtfull,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44324:11"/>
or Equivocous signification: because first, it may signifie such a Soul; as hath no substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dignity, or perfection in it, above the Souls of other men; and in this sense, the Soul or Spirit of Christ, as he is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly man, is not a Humane Soul, but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and Heavenly; for it is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, even in the nature of it, than the souls of other men: Or Secondly, it may signifie the true soul of man, having all the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Properties of mans soul, and it's whole perfection; and if in this sense, any will say, that Christ hath a Humane Soul, and call the Man-Hood of Christ, his Humanity, there needeth no contention about it; for in the Latine Tongue, we have not a word so proper, as <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas,</hi> to signifie the Man-hood; and if we may say <hi>Humanitas</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> we may say in English Humanity; that is to say, Man-hood: But then, by the Humanity of Christ, we understand, not only the whole Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perfection of the souls of Ordinary men, but also some greater and more Excellent perfection, as aforesaid; and therefore, it may be called his Heavenly and Divine Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, or Man-hood, which took part of Flesh like unto ours, in the womb of the Virgin. And not only the soul of Christ, but also his body of Flesh, in the outward, as it had all the Essential properties, and whole
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44324:11"/>
Essential perfection, of our bodies; so it had somewhat more, as being. conceived of a Heavenly and Divine seed, that came down from Heaven; and for this cause, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly man Christ Jesus is truely Divine, both in soul and body, being divinely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in both. And if this offend any, that Christ should be called a Divine man, I desire them to consider; how oft men are called Divines, only for some profession of Divinity; &amp; surely Christ Jesus, as man, hath incomparably more reason to be called Divine, than any of them; And what if I should call all their Divines, Humanes? Is this too mean and low a Terme, whereby to call them? But why is it too mean and low unto them, and yet they give it unto Christ, and call him Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; his soul, a Humane soul, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a Humane body: Is not this to exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above Christ himself, and to take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Title, which they will scarce allow unto him, and to give him a Title (as namely Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane) which they think too mean for themselves.</p>

body had all the Essential properties, and whole Essential perfection, that the soul or body of any other men hath; but that he had, and still hath greater, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perfections, both of soul and body, than all other men, doth not hinder that he was made like unto us, in those which both he and we also have: for was not <hi>Adam</hi> made in the Similitude or likeness of God? So that by reason of that Similitude, man was like unto God and yet God is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more excellent in nature and being, than Man; but yet according unto the reasoning of this Author, either man hath no likeness unto God, is not like unto him in any thing, or then God hath no Substantial or Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perfection above man; both which are most absurd and contrary unto Scripture. But again, is not man like unto the Beasts in some things, as also unto the Herbs, Plants and Trees of the field? So that as the Herbs, Plants and Trees, have a Vegitable soul or life, and as beasts have a sensitive soul or life; hath not man both the Vegitable and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive soul, and is he not like unto them in those respects? And yet hath he not a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial dignity and excellency of nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them; But yet again, according unto this mans reasoning, either man is not like unto the Beasts and Trees, in any thing, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44324:12"/>
else he hath no Essential dignity or perfection; not so much as in his very soul, above them; and therefore it shall follow, at last, that as God is no more excellent in his nature than man; and as man is no more excellent in his nature, than any beast, yea or Tree, that God is no more excellent than any beast or Tree of the field, which is most gross and blasphemous, and yet the Natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Consequence of this mans Doctrine.

                  <p>Ey Jesus increasing in Wisdome, may be very well understood, the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit of Wisdome, that did more and more shew forth it self in him; and that to increase, is not always taken strictly, is clear from the words of <hi>John; He,</hi> namely Christ, <hi>shall increase, but I shall decrease</hi> Now, <hi>John</hi> was not to decrease, as to any Perfection, Grace, or Vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall God had endued him. But again, I do readily grant, that Christ, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Nephesh</hi> of his soul, might grow in Wisdome, as other men, as also he did grow in stature: and Lastly, even the <hi>Nis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> although <hi>Omnipercipient</hi> of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and <hi>Omniscient</hi> of things, both past and present, may and did grow in Knowledge; for the Soul of Christ, hath this Omniscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of things past and present, by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the objects, or things, as they dayly appear: and therefore his Soul may grow in experimental Wisdome and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as properly as the soul of any other man; although both his Wisdome and growth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44324:13"/>
therein is incomparably beyond that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men or Angels: But whereas thou sayst, Christs soul was subject to some kind of ignorance, this is too grosly and rudly, yea irreverently spoken: He was nescient of some things that was to come; as namely, of the day and hour of the last Judgement, as he declared himself; but to say he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any thing, is gross and improper; for ignorance signifieth always some defect of that Knowledge which one should have, as blindness, deafness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Signifie a defect of the Natural senses of seeing, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>They believe this man-hood of Christ perceives and knows all things, past and present, of it self and by it self; considered, without any Relation to, or union with the Deity, and that it needs not God, as to the knowledge of any present or past things, but only as to the thing to come.</p>

                  <p>This is a most gross and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable perversion and wresting of my words; which any man that, hath the least Sobriety or Candor, must needs acknowledge, by reading my words, even as cited by him:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:44324:16"/>
But if he say, that his gloss doth follow by way of consequence, from my words; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deny it, and in plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what he hath most perversely and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleadged to be my assertion: I say, the Man-hood or Soul of Christ, neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor can know, any thing, past, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, without the need and necessary help of God; as neither indeed, can we, or any Creature: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> I affirm, that Christ hath this Omnipercipiency, or Universal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things past and present, by Virtue of his Divine Union with God; even as the body hath its perception of some things, by Vertue of its Union with the Soul, to which it is United. And because the Soul of Christ, hath the most excellent, most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and most high, and immediate Union with God; so as that Christ himself is God: therefore he hath this universal perception or knowledge of things past and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: and therefore also, he hath the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant knowledge of things to come, by Divine Revelation from the Father, above what the most perfect Angels or men can have; so that what they know by Divine Revelation, they know it by Jesus Christ, who hath it from the Father, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44324:16"/>
unto his servants. Nor can it follow by any just consequence imaginable, that because I say, that Christ hath an Universal sense or Perception of things as they are, that therefore he doth know them without all need of God, or without all Relation unto him, or Union with him; I say, this doth not follow, no more then it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that whereas the Author of this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> hath many Natural Perceptions of Natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Seeth, Heareth, Smelleth, Tasteth &amp; Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; many Objects immediately, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them without immediate Revelation; that therefore he hath no need of God, or of his help, whereby to make them known: Whereas indeed, according to his manner of reasoning, either he himself, Heareth, Seeth, Smelleth, Tasteth, Feeleth all Natural things by immediate Revelation; and all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge of things immediately Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him by God; or then he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all without any need of God, and without all Relation unto God, so much as unto a Creator: both which, how absurd they are, and yet how the Natural Consequence of his own reasoning, I leave unto every understanding man sor to Judge.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot but wonder at his blindness and inconsiderateness that doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, how to make a difference betwixt that knowledge, which is by a real sense or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44324:17"/>
of the Objects in themselves, and that which is by a Divine Revelation, when the Objects themselves are not immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; for that which I know by a real Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the things, I need not a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make them known: As for Example, when I hear a man speak, I need not a Divine Revelation to tell me who speaketh unto me, or what is spoken; and yet I need the help of God, in many respects, both to convey the voice unto me, and also to help me to hear; for it is God who maketh the ear to hear, and the eye to see: And thus, according to the aforesaid Example, if Christ Jesus, even he the Man-Christ Jesus, who was Crucified for us, hear our Prayers, when we pray unto him, and unto God through him, doth he not know our Prayers without a Divine Revelation? and if he know them only by a Divine Revelation, he cannot be faid properly to hear them, as I have sufficiently proved in my book, and to which this Trifler, and perverter, hath made no reply: and if he denyeth, that the Man Christ Jesus heareth our prayers, let him declare so much; and then we shall see, how this shall relish unto the ears of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and who are most denyers or owners of the True Christ, &amp; of his Divine perfections.</p>

                  <p>I have said nothing concerning the Flesh and Blood of Christ, either before, or after his outward coming in the Flesh, but according unto plain Scripture; nor have I medled to give any other names unto the body of Christ, but what the Scripture giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: for Christ said, the bread from heaven is his Flesh, and of this Bread, or Flesh, all true believers did feed, and thereby had life in them, even from the beginning of the world: and seeing Christ himself gave these names of Flesh and Blood, to that inward, Heavenly, Spiritual, and invisible substance, which refreshes the soul and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man of every one that believeth, Who dare call these names into question, or find fault with them? although, I do freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44324:20"/>
they are <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; as when Christ called himself the vine, and those that believed in him, the branches; and I ask, was not Christ the vine, even from the beginning, into which all true believers were grafted? and did they not eat the Grapes of this Heavenly Vine-Tree, and drink the Liquor or Juice, or Wine thereof? and what was that but his Flesh &amp; Blood, even as the Grapes of the Vine may be called it's Flesh; and its Wine or Liquor, its Blood; and as it is so called in Scripture, the Blood of the Grape?</p>
                  <p>But when I say, the body of Christ which was born of the Virgin, and was crucified and rose, and ascended, did not remain a body of Flesh and Blood, I am warranted by the Apostle, who said, <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> and the body at the last resurrection is raised spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, conform unto the glorious body of Christ; and therefore it is not Flesh and Blood, in the Vulgar, or common sense; but if any call it so <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> and spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I shall not contend.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44324:21"/>
emanating light that flows from the body of the Sun, he denieth to be any part of the Suns body, affirming it onely to be an accident or quality: But what reason or prooff giveth he, for his assertion? Surely none at all: But if he thinketh to defend himself by the authority of some called <hi>Philosophers;</hi> who say the same with him: I can tell him of other Philosophers, so called, more famous; &amp; who speak indeed, more according to the truth, that deny it; and affirm, that the Light of the Sun, that emanates unto us, is a real substance, and hath of the real body of the Sun in it, which is the real Substance of Fire, as it can be proved, by the said Light, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or gathered together, by the help of a burning Glass, that it burneth, or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, any ordinary combustible matter, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other fire doth: But seeing such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is more proper for naturalists, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to that called natural Phylosophy; I shall not insist thereon: only, I inform the Reader, who is not acquainted, perhaps, with such things, that the opinion which hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth light and heat, to have no body, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most generally, now rejected, in the Schools, as false; and as a meer old fiction of some old Popish School men, grounded upon some mistaken notions of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and upheld by the <hi>Jesuits</hi> to uphold their absur'd Doctrine of Transubstantiation, when they teach, That
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44324:21"/>
the colour, and tast, and smell of the bread &amp; wine, being but meer accidents, do remain without all Substance of the bread and wine, after the consecration; and as absur'd and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, is their doctrine who say, that light hath no body, that is proper unto it, but is a meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, or quality in the Air: For as well may the <hi>Jesuits</hi> say; that the colour, smell and tast of the Bread and Wine, having no body, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Bread and Wine, are only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents adhering in the Air.

Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 9. <hi>and lighteth every man that cometh into the World,</hi> is not a creature; <hi>Keith</hi> saith, it is a creature.</p>

                  <head>Ans.</head>
                  <p>To this I have answered sufficiently above, upon <hi>Animad.</hi> 8. that the Spirit or Life of Christ, as he is the Heavenly man, is not so properly or strictly a creature. But men have not only the Spirit of Christ in them, as he is Man; but also as he is God, and the Light, Life, and Spirit of Christ, as he is God: or the word simply conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it self, in no sense, can be said to be Created: But the word <hi>made Flesh,</hi> may in that sense be said to be Created, as it is said to be made; for Made, Created, and Formed, are commonly of one Signification: And that the word was made Flesh from the beginning, I have proved in my book, because the Saints in all Ages, did feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word made Flesh, and the Word made Flesh dwelt in them. Now in what sense I understand, that the Heavenly man-hood and Soul of Christ is Created: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in my book, in these words, <hi>p.</hi> 135. <q>Therefore to the end that the word may be ingrafted into us, and we again ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it, the Word must be Incarnate, or made Flesh, as we are; for all men are a sort of Flesh, and so called in Scripture, in comparison of God, that is purely Spirit;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44324:22"/>
and though the Souls of Men are Spirits, yet comparatively, as unto God, they are, as it were, Flesh; and thus the Word is become Flesh; that is to say, hath advanced a Step or degree, neerer unto us, than it was in God before any thing was made; and the Word was first of all made Flesh, to be the root and soundation of all other Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated beings, and for which they are Created; for it is a more noble Creation, than all things else:</q> Here by my words quoted at large in my book, it may be seen, how and in what sense, I understand the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man-hood of Christ to be Created, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the word is made Flesh: also Christ himself designed by Wisdome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 24. doth expresly say of himself; <hi>when there were no Depths, I was Formed;</hi> and again, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>before the Hills, I was Formed:</hi> for so doth the Hebrew word <hi>Cholalti,</hi> most properly signify, and is used elsewhere in Scripture to signify the Creation of other things; so that, <hi>Made, Formed, Created,</hi> do commonly signify one and the same. Nevertheless, I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that Christ the Heavenly Man, is not so properly or strictly to be called a Creature; or Created, Made, or Formed; but rather generated: and he is the Son of God, rather than a Creature of God; even as a Man's Son, is not called his Creature,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44324:23"/>
but his Son; and yet he doth truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly partake with the Creatures; otherwise he could not be a perfect Midle, or Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, betwixt God and Men, who are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But seeing this production or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of Christ from God the Father, is so great a Mystery, it is by no means to be curiously disputed about, but simply to be acknowledged, believed and admired; and not to be expressed in words which mans wisdome teacheth, but what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost Teacheth; such as the Scripture words are, which say, <hi>The Word was made Flesh;</hi> and Christ, the Heavenly man, is the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth, and the first-born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and concerning his wonderful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it is said, <hi>Who can declare it?</hi> and he is called, the New Man, who is <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> after God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so to these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Names, I keep close; where I am safe, and where the malicious accusations of the adversaries of truth cannot reach unto me. And by what is said, the reader may easily understand, that there is no real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, betwixt <hi>John Crook</hi> and me; for whither <hi>J. C.</hi> mean by the true Light, which is the Life of Christ, the Light of the Word simply considered, or the Word made Flesh, I am at no contradiction with him; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44324:23"/>
to the first, That Light, can in no sense be called a Created Light: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the second, namely, As the Word made Flesh, or as the Spirit of Christ as man, it is not properly Created, nor in that strict and narrow sense, is it to be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as the other Creatures are.</p>

                  <p>That Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11. Is not at all corrupted, but truely translated, and the sense of it truely given; nor doth thy weak and frivolous reasoning prove the contrary: for as the Greek word doth not always signify a strict Creation; so no more doth the word Creation, in English; and that the word is sometimes applyed to an Humane work, or constitution; proveth not that it is so to be understood here: For the Writer to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Heaven with the Tabernacle made by mens hands, (as thou alleadgest) in that <hi>verse:</hi> neither doth he call Heaven, that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44324:24"/>
and more perfect Tabernacle; for he saith not so; but thus: Christ being come, an high Priest of good things to come; by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> entered in once, into the holy place: The greater and more perfect Tabernacle: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is Christ himself, who hath gone into Heaven: And this Tabernacle, is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, than that outward figurative Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was; because that Tabernacle, could not remove it self from one place unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but as it was carried by the hands of men: neither could it go into Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was of a meer earthly creation; but Christ Jesus by a greater, and more perfect Tabernacle, namely, by himself, did go into Heaven; for he came down from Heaven, and is Heavenly; and not of such a mean, and Earthly Creation, as that outward Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was: and therefore, he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Christ with the Figurative Tabernacle; not so much as to its structure or building with mens hands; for that were but a mean and low comparison, seeing the beasts Skins that covered the Tabernacle, and the blood that sprinkled it; as also, the substance of the wood, and other materials, were not made with mens hands, but only the artificial struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or form of the Tabernable, was the work of mens hands. But Christ Jesus, this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44324:24"/>
greater and more perfect Tabernacle, doth excel the Typical and figurative Tabernacle, in regard of the very substance of which it is made; as being of an Heavenly Nature, and not of this creation, with the outward Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, as to the very substance; although for our sakes, he did partake with us of the Earthly creation, yet he himself is wholly and altogether Heavenly; if this be not the True and real sense of those words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11.

hands; as if the Mortal body, which is our earthly house, were made with hands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not with the hands of men; which is a figurative expression, as holding forth the meanness and weakness of all that which is earthly and Mortal, which the Learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> on that account, call in <hi>Hebrew, Asiah,</hi> as to say, in English, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or a making with hands: but besides this visible and corruptible world, of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, which they call <hi>Asiah,</hi> or faction; they understand that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more excellent world, or creation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible unto our outward eyes; and this they call <hi>Jezirah,</hi> as to say in English, formation; and besides this, yet a more excellent, which they call <hi>Briah,</hi> in English, creation; namely that which is strictly and properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, (the other two, although commonly named, Creations, yet not so properly or strictly) for which distinction of three Worlds, they Alledge <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 43. 7. where all these three <hi>Hebrew</hi> words are used; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all these, yet one most excellent of all, and which doth in the Nature thereof, approach nearest unto God himself, and this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most Noble production, above all things Created, Visible, or Invisible, they call <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luth,</hi> which is to say, in English, Emanation.

by that same, I did understand some He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors, or Teachers, who call this Heavenly Man <hi>Aziluth,</hi> which is to say, in English, Emanation; as also they do call him, the Heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> the great High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest, the Bridegroom and Husband of the Church: and they say plainly, if this man were not, the world could not confist: and who is this but Christ Jesus, although they do not express these names. And certainly, it might be a great help whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to gain them to believe in Christ Jesus, as he was born and suffered in the Flesh, and Rose and Ascended into Heaven, to make use of those Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which are in their own books, unto Christ, although under other names; some whereof are very proper, and according unto Scripture, in our reasoning with them, in order to their conversion; which way, if used in the Wisdom of God, and direction of his Holy Spirit, I doubt not, but the Lord would bless; for even <hi>Paul,</hi> when he preached unto the Gentiles, at times, made use of some Testimonies out of their writers, whereby to bring them to acknowledge the Truth.

                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>I altogether deny the Consequence; That, because the Essence of <hi>God</hi> is in us, that therefore, the Fulness of the Godhead can be said to dwell in us bodily: for that is only proper unto <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt <hi>God</hi> and Us; in whom that Fulness dwelleth immediately, and to which it is immediately united. And forasmuch, as we cannot contain the Fulness of <hi>Christ,</hi> but only a Measure of him; therefore, the Fulness of the Godhead cannot be said to dwell in us: and yet we must partake of that Fulness which dwelleth in <hi>Christ,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we partake of <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom the Fulness is. And this is no Blasphemy, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44324:28"/>
words of Truth and Soberness, and cannot but savour well and comfortably unto every true Christian; namely, that <hi>God</hi> dwelleth in us in <hi>Christ,</hi> according to <hi>Christ</hi> his own Words, unto the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23. <hi>Thou in Me, and I in Them;</hi> and according unto <hi>John, He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 23. And as for <hi>Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> his Translation of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially, it doth nothing hinder, but rather helpeth to consirm the Truth of what I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm: For, if the Fulness of the Godhead dwell in <hi>Christ</hi> Essentially, or in its true Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; then it is clear, that if any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Christ</hi> dwell in us, that a Measure of that Fulness of <hi>God</hi> himself, dwelleth in us: for no Measure, or Part of <hi>Christ,</hi> is empty of <hi>God.</hi> Which Fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, as also, the Measures of it, are not to be understood Simply, as in <hi>God</hi> himself; who properly hath no Parts, nor Measures, but in respect of his Appearance and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation towards us; which Appearance or Manifestation of <hi>God,</hi> hath its Fulness in <hi>Christ,</hi> and its Measures in us, according to the Measure of the Gift of <hi>Christ,</hi> received by us. For concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> it is said; That <hi>God</hi> gave not the Spirit by Measure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: But to every one of us, the Grace or Gift (namely, of the Holy Spirit) is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44324:28"/>
given, according to the Measure of the Gift of <hi>Christ.</hi> And thus we see, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holdeth forth Measures of the Spirit given unto us, through what we receive of the Measure of <hi>Christ:</hi> But <hi>Christ</hi> hath that Spirit in Fulness, or without Measure: And the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> both in <hi>Christ,</hi> and in Us, s of the same Essence with <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, As to the Words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> cited by thee; they do also confirm the same Truth, and over-turn thy gross Assertion: For, if <hi>God</hi> hath appeared unto us Essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in <hi>Christ,</hi> and that we are Partakers of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, by a real Participation of him as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth else-where acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; then, together with <hi>Christ,</hi> we are also Partakers of <hi>God:</hi> for <hi>God</hi> revealeth himself in <hi>Christ</hi> Essentially, and <hi>Christ</hi> revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himself in us.</p>

               <p>Whosoever then hath <hi>God</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially in him, hath the whole Deity in him; for the Essence is the whole Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>The Essence of the Deity (as I have said) hath not Measures properly in it self; but yet the Scripture alloweth us to speak of the Measures of the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> which is one Essence, or Being with <hi>God:</hi> Which Measures in Us, and Fulness in <hi>Christ,</hi> are to be understood, in respect of Manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44324:29"/>
And according to this Distinction of fulness and measures, that is warranted by the Scriptures, I deny thy Assertion; that who ever hath any measure of the Essence of God, hath the Whole or Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and the plain tendency of all thy work against us, is not only to rob the Saints of Christ, the Heavenly Man, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the Holy Ghost, and consequentially of God; and then finally, of all Goodness, Vertue and Grace: And indeed, this is the real and naked tendency of the Doctrine of all those, who contend so earnestly against the real and proper in-being, or in-dwelling of Christ, in the Saints, as he is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Man, and second <hi>Adam;</hi> to bring us at last, if they could, to deny that we have either God in us, or the Holy Ghost; for if the Essence of God, dwell only in Christ, and that Christ dwell not in us, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it should follow, that we have nothing of God, and so nothing of the Holy Spirit, which is one Essence with him: and the end of this is plain down-right <hi>Atheisme;</hi> for if God himself be not present in men, nor the Holy Ghost, (which is one Essence with him) nor Christ, how can any thing that is truly Good be in us, who can work it; or being wrought, who can preserve it if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> be absent? Surely nothing appeareth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44324:29"/>
unto me, more rampant <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> nor more gross <hi>Atheism,</hi> than to deny, that God is really present in all Men, and in all Things: For, how is God omni-present, if he be not really present, in and with all his Creatures? And if God be present in all his Creatures, then Christ is also present, because the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Godhead dwelleth in Christ. But seeing thou wilt not allow Christ, to have any further reach or extent, than the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soul and body of any ordinary Man; and that the Fulness of the Godhead is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within that bounds of the ordinary stature of a mans body, and that essentially? is not this to limit the infinite God into a narrower place, or room, than the Souls of many brute beasts, which have larger bodies, manifold times, than the greatest body of any earthly man, and to confine him within the humane figure and shape of a man? yea, nothing is more plain, which is gross Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphitisme, and the blasphemous Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Lodowick Muggleton.</hi> But further, I enquire, seeing thou affirmest, That the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God is only in Christ, and that whole Christ is contained within the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dimensions of mans Body; and that Christ had neither Soul nor Body before <hi>Mary;</hi> Where was the Essence of God, from the beginning of the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44324:30"/>
that time? For either it was somewhere, or no where; to say it was no where, no not in the Highest Heavens, is absurd; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is said to dwell in the Heavens; and they are called Gods Throne; and Christ Taught his Disciples to Pray, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> But again, on the other hand, if thou shalt grant, That the Essence of God was in Heaven, then that Heaven is as personally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God, (by thy Doctrine) as ever Christ Jesus; and may as truly, and in the same sense be called God, the Son of God, God-man; the Creator of the World, and is the Object of Divine Worship. This, I say, is the necessary and infallible consequence of thy Doctrine, because thou sayest expresly, who ever hath the Essence of God in him, is as personally united unto God, as Jesus Christ; and may as truly, and in the same sense be called God, &amp;c.</p>

Christ simply considered; for it is a greater perfection to be all center; and that the center be every where, then only in some place. As for Example, if the Light of the outward Sun were all center, and that the center of the Suns Light were every where in the whole Firmament, that Light should be a much greater, and a more glorious and excellent Light, than the Light of the Sun, as it is now at present, is: And although I say, that the center of the Soul and Spirit of Christ, as Man, is not in us; yet the true Essence of the Soul and Spirit of Christ, in measure, is in us; for that emanation, or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and ray of his Life and Light, is truly efsential unto him, and is not any meer quality or accident, or operation, as some have supposed.</p>

the nearer that it is in nature unto God, doth the more resemble him; and that God himself, is a most simple unmixed being, without all composition of parts or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and is one in the highest and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sense, (which yet his being three, only in manner or property of being, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder); and that Christ, the Heavenly man, of all things, is nearest unto God, and his most perfect Image; therefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that he hath least of that which may, or can be called a composition, or mixture of principles: But whatever perfection, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, power, or operation, the creatures have in their various compositions, he hath them all virtually and eminently in himself, after a more perfect, and simple manner: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he took hold on the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and did partake of Flesh and Blood like unto ours, to the end that he might be yet more like unto us, that he might make us like unto him, yet more abundantly, whether it behoved not that he was to partake with us, of all the principles, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that belong to the essential constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any man, is a thing worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; as also, admitting that he did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all these Principles, whether he did assume, or partake of them, at one and the same Moment of time; And what I have

that-the Lord God breathed in <hi>Adam,</hi> the breath of Life, and he became a living Soul; and shall compare it with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 45. The first man <hi>Adam,</hi> was made a living Soul; the second, or last <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickening Spirit; If he have the least sense of that quickening life of Christ Jesus, that made the first <hi>Adam</hi> a living Soul, cannot but acknowledge, that that breath, or inspiration of life, which made <hi>Adam</hi> a living Soul, was something more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and living, then his own Soul, which he received from Christ Jesus the second <hi>Adam,</hi> who is the image of the invisible God, after whom he was made; for it was this breathing in, or inspiration of Life, that made him a living Soul; Namely living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: Whereas he was a Soul afterwards when he Transgressed, but not such a living Soul; for in the day he did eat of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, he dyed, and remained no more a living Soul unto God, in Holiness and Righteousness, after the image of him that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. And indeed, that this breath or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of Life, was not <hi>Adams</hi> own Soul, but a Divine substance; diverse of those cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fathers, of great Note, do earnestly contend. <hi>Hilarius,</hi> saith, on <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. expounding these Words: And he breathed into him, the breath, or Spirit of life, and man
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44324:36"/>
was made a living Soul, <hi>Inspirationi ergo huic Preparatus sive formatus est, per quam Natura Animae &amp; Corporis in vita perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quodam inspirati Spiritus foedere conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neretur.

                  <p>In English thus; Man therefore, being prepared, or formed, unto this inspiration, by which the Nature of the Soul and body should be contained within a crtain Covenant (or bond) of the inspired Spirit. Blessed <hi>Paul</hi> knoweth that there is a Twofold Nature in him, when according to the inward man, he delighteth in the Law of God.

                     <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</hi> and others do Judge, that <hi>Plato,</hi> by his <hi>anima mundi,</hi> did understand that which the Scripture calleth the Holy Ghost; for as the Scripture speaketh of three that bear record in Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: <hi>Plato</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise spoke of three, namely, <hi>the good, the mind, and the Soul:</hi> and the Good he calleth the one, and the Father; the Mind, he calleth the Son, as being generate of the Father: both which answer unto the Father and the Son, which the Scriptures Testifie of, and therefore they conclude, that by that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Soul, he did understand, the Holy Ghost; And that <hi>Plato</hi> had learned this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Three from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who had learned it from <hi>Moses;</hi> But that he had wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood it himself, for he seemeth to call them Three Gods, as being distinct, in a threefold being, or substance: And the first greatest of all, the second less than the first, but greater than the Third; so that <hi>Plato</hi> his Doctrine of this Mystery was unsound, and imperfect, although it seemeth that he aimed at the Truth.

That thou dost insinuate, as if we did not believe, that the Holy Ghost, who is God, did dwell in us, but only Christ; which is a gross perversion, and false calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; yea so false, that thou givest thy sels ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly and openly the lie; in the next ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 3.

                  <p>Thou seest Reader, how openly he giveth the lie unto himself, in this cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by acknowledging that we understand the Holy Ghost is not separated from this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul of Christ; and yet a few lines before, he did alleadge, that according to our principle, the Holy Ghost did not dwell in us: and whereas he saith, why then did they not express themselves so? I answer, first, how couldest thou know our understanding, or mind, if the thing had not been expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? But Secondly, I say, that I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expressed the same in my book, called <hi>The way cast up,</hi> in several places, particularly in <hi>p.</hi> 114. where I say expresly: For, because the Fullness dwelt in him; and that he was immediately, and most intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united with the God-head, so as no Man nor Angels are, but only the Man Jesus, he is only the true Christ. And because he it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who in an immediate way, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, is Gods Anointed, who hath Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with his Holy Spirit; and all other men, even the most Holy, but mediately u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with God through him, receiving the Anointing, or Holy Spirit: Therefore all other men are not Christ, but Christians; not being immediately Anointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by the means of Jesus Christ. Nor are they otherwise partakers of the Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44324:39"/>
or Holy Ghost, but as they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Christ. Thus Reader, thou feest how clearly I have expressed this very thing; and how faulty the Author of this <hi>Pamphlet</hi> is, and how far he hath fallen short of his promise, to give the World a true account of our Faith, concerning the Man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; who is guilty of so many false insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gross perversions, self - belyings and contradiction, as I have sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>

                  <p>Mark Reader, the great ignorance and partiality of this Author, who is so much offended, because I call the Nature of the Man-Hood of Christ, Heavenly and Divine; as if because the name Divine is given to the Man-Hood of Christ, that therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound the Man Hood with the God-Head, and equalize it thereunto; and yet within three or four lines, he calleth these of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who profess to teach of Divine things, Christian Divines; he will therefore have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44324:40"/>
men that Teach, or profess to teach Divine things, to be called Divine; but he will not allow Christ, the Heavenly-man to be called Divine: This is a plain exalting themselves above Christ.

               <p>That there are At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God not communicable to the Creature; and among them are these two, Omnisciency and Omnipresency; these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Communicated to any Creature, but it immediately becomes God.</p>

                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>That Christ Jesus is not to be called a Creature in that strict and narrow sense, as the other Creatures are, I have above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; and yet he doth partake with the Creatures, having taken part of Flesh and Blood with us. And be it so, that Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sency and Omnipercipiency, being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto Christ, that he is God; In what is this contrary to Christian Doctrine? Is not Christ God? Do not all true Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is both God and Man, and yet but one Christ? But according unto thy Doctrine, because Christ is neither Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44324:40"/>
nor Omnipresent, he is not God, but a meer Creature. This is gross <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> and <hi>Arianisme</hi> both, that Christ is not God, but a meer creature. Now, although I say and believe, with other true Christians, that Christ is God; yet I do not say, the Man-hood of Christ is his God-head, nor yet equal thereunto; for the God-head is still greater then the Man-hood, and hath its Attributes, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine properties, that are incommunicable unto the Man-hood, simply considered; for the God-head is absolute and independent, and hath not its being from the Man-hood: But the Man-hood is dependent, and hath its being from the God-head. Again, these Attributes of Omnipresence and Omniscience, as they are in the God-head, and belong unto the same, are indeed, incommunicable unto the Man-hood; for the Omnipresence and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Man-hood of Christ, are of a far inferiour Nature and condition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Omnipresence and Omniscience of the God-head: And first, as to the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence of the God-head, it is centrally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, and is no where circumscribed, as I have already cited out of <hi>Hermes Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus,</hi> in my book; But the Man-hood or <hi>Nishmah</hi> of Christs Soul, is not so Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, for its center is not every where; so that, here is a manifest difference, betwixt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44324:41"/>
the manner of Gods Omnipresence, and the Omnipresence of Christ, as man; Again, as to the Omnisciency of Christ as man, it is not of the same Nature with the Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of God, but inferiour unto the same; for the Omnisciency of Christ as man, or of his Man-hood, is by a certain influence, or impression, or touch, which the Objects, known, make upon him; and therefore, the Objects themselves are in some sort the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental cause, or occasion to excite his knowledge, in respect of the Creatures which he doth know, past, or present; and as for his knowledge of things to come, by Divine Revelation, that also differeth from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods Knowledge, who knoweth all things, past, present, and to come, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in himself, without dependance on any other, or without receiving any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or impression, from the Creatures, which he doth know; nor are the Objects any cause, so much as instrumental in the least, of the knowledge which Christ hath as God, or of his God head: and thus I have very plainly and clearly demonstrated, that the manner and sort of the Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Omniscience of Christ as God, is very differing from his Omnipresence and Omniscience, as man; These two Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, or properties, as they belong to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44324:41"/>
his Man-hood, being of a very inferior Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind; and yet true Omnipresence, and Omniscience, in their kind and sort, and such as are altogether necessary for him that is to be a Mediator betwixt <hi>God</hi> and Man, and our High-Priest with <hi>God;</hi> namely, that he can be touched with the Feeling of our Infirmities; and that he be present both to hear us, and also, to help and succour us, in all Straits and Wants. And here again, thou fallest into a gross Contradiction, to assert, That <hi>God</hi> only is Omni-present, and not <hi>Christ,</hi> as Man; and yet to affirm, That the Essence of <hi>God</hi> is only present in the Manhood of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is a manifest and palpable Contradiction. Again; I ask thee, Is <hi>Omni-presence</hi> Essential unto <hi>God,</hi> or only an Accident? If an Essential Attribute, then it followeth, That <hi>God</hi>'s Essence is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: If it be only an Accident, then thou asserts contrary to Scripture, and to thy own Divines, as thou callest them, That there are Accidents in <hi>God,</hi> and that He is Changeable, which is gross <hi>Cajetanisme,</hi> and <hi>Vorstianisme;</hi> namely, the Heresie of <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> and <hi>Vorstius,</hi> that is greatly Condemned, and that generally by all Christians.</p>

               <p>Let it be considered likewise, there is thought by Judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that there is an Infinite Space beyond

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>They who affirm, That there are such Infinite Imaginary Spaces, may rather be truly called <hi>Unjudicious Humanes,</hi> than <hi>Judicious Divines;</hi> seeing, by thy own Confession, they are meerly Imaginary, and are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Part of the Universe, and are neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Christ;</hi> and yet are Infinite, and have Immensity: Then which, there can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed nothing that is a greater Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely, to say, There is an Infinite I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary Space, having Immensity that is not any real Thing or Being: That is, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Christ,</hi> nor Angel, nor any Spirit, nor Body, nor any Created Thing, but meer Imaginary; and yet it is greater than <hi>Christ,</hi> the Heavenly Man: for it is Infinite, and hath Immensity. But, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover yet more abundantly thy Confusion and Contradiction, I ask thee; Why may not <hi>Christ,</hi> as Man, have the same Infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44324:42"/>
and Immensity, that this Imaginary Space hath? Why then, according to thy own Words, the Manhood of <hi>Christ</hi> should be equal unto <hi>God,</hi> and confounded with <hi>God.</hi> By this then, it clearly followeth from thy own Doctrine, That this Infinite Imaginary Space, having Immensity, is Equal unto <hi>God,</hi> and Confounded with <hi>God;</hi> and so, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better than <hi>Christ,</hi> and that Infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and yet, it is neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Christ,</hi> nor any Creature, or Part of the Universe of Created Beings. Is not this a strange new Deity of thy own devising, and a most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Idol? But, seeing this Space is only Imaginary, and is nothing but a Child of thine, and thy Bretheren's Imagination; and yet, because it hath Immensity, and is Infinite by thy Doctrine, it must be Equal unto <hi>God:</hi> It followeth from thy Doctrine, that the Brat of thine own Imagination, is Equal unto <hi>God:</hi> Which, if it be not the grossest <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that ever any Man was Guilty of, I leave unto all Men of a true Understanding for to judge; yea, if it be not the Height of <hi>Atheisme.</hi> But again, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, (but not at all granting) that there were such Infinite wast Places, having no Creatures in them, I ask thee; If <hi>God</hi> should fill them all with Creatures, (as he could well do, because he is Omnipotent) should
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44324:43"/>
these Creatures, taken in the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, be Equal unto <hi>God,</hi> and have the same Immensity, or Infinitness, with him? Surely, thou must needs say, Not: And therefore, <hi>Christ,</hi> the Heavenly Man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he should also be in all these Places, is still inferiour to the Godhead: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Man, or Creature, can conceive of Places, or Spaces of the greatest Extent Imaginable, <hi>God</hi> is still infinitly Greater; and all the Creatures, Visible and Invisible, are unto Him but as the Drop of the Bucket, and Dust of the Ballance. And here, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should ask me, because I deny all such Imaginary Spaces, as idle Fictions of foolish and Ignorant Men, What is beyond this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible World of Heaven and Earth? I do easily and readily answer; That not only <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> but also real Parts of the Creation, which are true real beings, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>God,</hi> are beyond this Visible World of Heaven and Earth; whose Greatness and Number, no Humane, nor (indeed) any Created Understanding can fathome, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; but <hi>God</hi> alone, the most High; and <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> by whom all Things are created and made, Visible and Invisible: For <hi>Solomon</hi> said truly; <hi>We cannot find out the Works of</hi> God, <hi>from the Beginning unto the End.</hi> And thus we have no need to run
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44324:43"/>
into these Fictions of Imaginary Spaces, to find a Place beyond this Visible World; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Things which <hi>God</hi> hath made, are Greater, and more Numerous, than we can conceive, or imagine: And therefore, are really Infinite and Immense, or Immeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unto our Understanding; although they are well known unto <hi>God,</hi> in Number, Weight, and Measure; and are, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison as Nothing, and as the Prophet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Even less than Nothing.</hi>

               <p>And thus he layes the Ground and Foundation of the Angels Worship, upon the Excellency of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Manhood, barely considered in it self: I query solemnly, If it be not great <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for Men or Angels to worship any Creature; and that Creature, though never so Excellent, be not in Personal Union with <hi>God,</hi> and the Worship terminated upon the Godhead? <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God</hi> and Man; Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans worshipping him, terminate the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship upon the Godhead.

                  <p>That he saith, I lay the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Angels Worship upon the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Nature of the Manhood, barely considered in it self, is a gross Abuse and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and a most palpable Lye and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to my Words: As also, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44324:44"/>
that Men or Angels are to worfhip the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> without a Respect unto that Union he hath with <hi>God;</hi> So that, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the said Union, he is <hi>God:</hi> This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is another gross Lye and Perversion. And 3<hi>dly.</hi> That he alledgeth, that in our worshipping the Man <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> we do not terminate our Worship upon the God-head, but only upon the Manhood, and that also barely considered in it self: All which Three Assertions of the Author, are gross Lies, and most groundless Calumnies: For I no where, in all my Book, use any such Words as he alledgeth. And that <hi>I</hi> have no such Meaning as his Words import; my Words that stand upon Record in my Book, do sufficiently clear me: As namely, where <hi>I</hi> say expresly, <hi>p.</hi> 82. That the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> by reason of that most wonderful U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betwixt the Two Natures: And a little after, <hi>I</hi> say; The Godhead and Manhood of <hi>Christ,</hi> are but one <hi>Christ.—</hi>And the God-head of <hi>Christ</hi> is no Inferiour Divinity, or Deity; but the very same Godhead of the Father. Again, as concerning this most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and singular Union, (whereby the Godhead and Manhood of <hi>Christ,</hi> are one <hi>Christ)</hi> I say, <hi>p.</hi> 83. <hi>Christ</hi> as Man, hath a true and real Soul, distinct from the God-head; yet for ever united with the same,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44324:44"/>
in a most immediate and wonderful manner: Of which Union, no other Soul or Spirit of Men or Angels, ever were, or shall be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Reader,</hi> thou mayest clearly see, that I lay not the Foundation of Men and Angels, their worshipping <hi>Christ,</hi> upon the Excellency of the Nature of the Manhood barely considered; as if he were not <hi>God,</hi> by reason of his most rare and singular Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>God:</hi> But, on the contrary, I do very plainly affirm the said Union, and that because thereof, <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also, I do further say, That the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which Men and Angels give unto the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> doth not terminate, (which is as much as to say, in more plain <hi>English)</hi> doth not rest nor end upon the Manhood; but ascendeth through the Manhood of <hi>Christ,</hi> unto the Godhead, where it doth terminate, or rest: And therefore, the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are said to praise <hi>God</hi> through <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and by Him, to offer up unto <hi>God</hi> continual Sacrifices of Thanksgiving: And so much doth the word <hi>Mediator</hi> import; which signifieth a Middle Man betwixt <hi>God</hi> and Us: So that, although our Prayers, our Thanksgivings, and whole Worship, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto <hi>Christ;</hi> yet not unto Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but also unto <hi>God</hi> htrough Him. Nor
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44324:45"/>
do my Words cited by thee, give thee the least Ground to say, That I lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Angels Worship upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Manhood barely considered in it self; because I say, That the Man <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> is a Great and Mighty, and most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Being, far above All, and excelling all Men and Angels: For doth not the Man <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> excell all Men and Angels, by reason of his Union with the Godhead, such as none else are Partakers of? Is not this Union of his with the Godhead, most Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent? And doth it not cause him to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all other Beings, that have no such Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? By thy Doctrine, indeed, it addeth no Excellency unto him; and consequently, by the same Doctrine of thine, (although in Contradiction to thy self) the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> is to be worshipped, as barely considered in himself, without any respect of his Union with the Godhead: For, according unto thy Doctrine, that Union addeth no Excellency unto him, and maketh him not one whit more Excellent. And thus, now, I desire all Men of Understanding, to see and consider, whether the Author of this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> (and not I) hath not made the Angels <hi>Idolaters.</hi> And here, <hi>Reader,</hi> I desire thee also to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how this Author of this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to lurk in the Dark: and giveth us no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44324:45"/>
express Account, whether he believeth, that the Man <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> is to be worshipped; only telleth, that all true Christians do ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Worship upon the Godhead; which we also do: But this hindreth not, that the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> as Mediator, is also to be worshipped, and <hi>God</hi> through him; which can be no <hi>Idolatry,</hi> because he is <hi>God,</hi> by Vertue of his most wonderful Union with him, which no Men nor Angels, are Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of, or ever shall be. And, if the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> is to be worshipped, my Argument holdeth still good; that therefore he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Present, as Man: To which Argument, although most convincing and demonstrating, he hath made no Shaddow of Answer; and therefore, I return it upon him, or them who take any part with him. As also, I return all the other Arguments in my Book, which are many, that he hath not so much as once named, far less, answered: And particularly, where I argue from what he and they do generally acknowledge, of the <hi>Devil;</hi> his being every where present, in all Evil Men, at least, which are more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than the Good; and yet they will not acknowledg, that <hi>Christ,</hi> the Heavenly Man, is every where Present in all Good Men. And thus they make the <hi>Devil</hi> greater than <hi>He:</hi> And which is more, seeing he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44324:46"/>
That the whole Essence of the God-head is contained within the Body of <hi>Christ;</hi> which, as he saith, is of no greater Extent, than the ordinary Body of one Man; and will not acknowledge, that <hi>God</hi> himself is any where, but in that one only, Human Body: and yet the <hi>Devil</hi> possesseth really, the Souls and Bodies of many Men and Women. He doth make the <hi>Devil</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater, and more largely or universally present in the World, than <hi>Christ;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, (with Fear and Reverence be it spoken) than the very <hi>Godhead</hi> it self; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the greatest Blasphemy and Impiety of Words, that ever I heard formerly, in all my Life; and yet the plain, down-right Language of his Doctrine, and vain Impious Scribling against us.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Reader,</hi> having answered suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently unto every one of his <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi> which I have done some-what more fully and largely, than was either needful unto him, or then (indeed) he was worthy of: yet for the sake of others, who might be desirous to have some Things further o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and cleared, I have found Freedom so to do. And now I shall take some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what he addeth by way of Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;

and reply also, there-unto, so far as is needful.</p>

               <p>He proposeth three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Considerations, which he thinketh will Answer my whole Book. 1. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets spoke of many Things to come, as if they were present.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>To this I have sufficiently answered above; and I have proved, how absurd and contrary to Truth, the Opinion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is, that Christ was no more Christ, before his birth in the Flesh, than <hi>Cyrus</hi> was God's Anointed, of whom <hi>Isaiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed many Years before he was Born.</p>
                  <p>Where-as, although the Prophets prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Coming, and Birth in the Flesh, as a thing to come; yet they did still understand, that <hi>Christ</hi> himself was present, in and with the Church, in all Ages; as I have already proved in my Book, at large. And this was also the Testimony of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle; and particularly, of <hi>Paul,</hi> who said expresly, <hi>That by</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>all Things were Created;</hi> and, <hi>He is the same Yester-day, To-day, and for Ever.</hi> Also, <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>The Fathers did Eat the same Spiritual Meat, and Drink the same Spiritual Drink:</hi> For they drank of the Rock that followed them, and that Rock was <hi>Christ.</hi> And if they did eat the same Spiritual Meat, and drink the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44324:47"/>
same Spiritual Drink, then they did eat the Flesh of <hi>Christ,</hi> and drink his Blood; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as <hi>Christ</hi> taught him self, <hi>They could not have Life.</hi>

               <p>His Second Consideration is, That <hi>Christ</hi> acted, in his Mediatorship, in all Things before his Incarnation, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence still to his Incarnation, which was to be in the Fulness of Time.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>That <hi>Christ</hi> acted in his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in all Things before he was Born in the Flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in reference still to his Birth in the Flesh, which was to be in the Fulness of Time; and also, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Sufferings, Death, Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Ascention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do readily grant. But what saith this against any thing that I have affirmed in my Book? Or, What doth it infer against the Real Being and Existence of <hi>Christ,</hi> in all Ages, from the Beginning? Surely, nothing at all, but on the contrary, if thou stand to thy own words, they do prove ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, that Christ, as he is the Heavenly man, was from the beginning; for how could he Act in his mediatorship, if he was not mediator from the beginning? How can Mediatorship be without a Mediator? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not at all, more than Kingship can be without a King, or Lordship without a Lord; or any other Office, without him that doth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44324:47"/>
bear it. And if <hi>Christ</hi> was Mediator from the Beginning, it followeth most clearly, that he was Man from the Beginning: For it is the Man <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who is the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>God</hi> and Man, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath expressly declared, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. For <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> simply considered without his Manhood, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Mediator; even as Man, simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered without the Godhead, he cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the Nature of a Mediator is such, that he must have the Nature both of God and man, united together, after the most excellent and singuler manner, so as, by reason of that Union, he is true and perfect God, and true and perfect Man; and therefore seeing he was Mediator from the beginning, and acted in his Mediatorship, or mediatory Office, as King, Priest and Prophet, and as Head of his Body the Church, he was Man from the beginning, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not Man cloathed with flesh and blood, in the likeness of our Flesh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the fullness of time was come, that He was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. His third considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that many things in Scripture, are spoken of Christ, by that figurative speech, of the communication of properties, when that which is proper to one nature only, is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44324:48"/>
attributed to the other, or to the whole person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>Although thou dost betake thy self to this, as thy last refuge; namely, that, called by some, the communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, yet doth it nothing help thy Evil cause, more than the former.</p>
                  <p>For albeit I grant, that there is such a figurative speech of the communication of names and properties, whereby the Man Christ is called God, and also God is called Man, and God is said to have Shed his Blood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ, as God, hath not Blood to Shed, but only as Man; yet by reason of that most rare and wonderful union betwixt the Godhead and Manhood; the Blood of the Man Christ, is called, the Blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. But this communication of names and properties, is not a bare Titular, or Verbal communication, but is grounded upon a real communication, of real Divine Attributes and Properties, which the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Christ, doth communicate unto the manhood; so that the manhood of Christ, by reason of this most rare and excellent, and truly Divine union, it hath with the Godhead, doth by vertue of the same, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such Divine attributes and perfections, as are communicable unto none else beside him; and the nature of the Manhood of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44324:48"/>
Christ, must be so excellent, so great, and so perfect, and so substantially excelling all Men and Angels, that is capable of such an Union, or of such Divine attributes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and perfections, that are both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and necessary for such an one as is to be <hi>Mediator</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and our High Priest with God; of which Divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, omnipresence, and omnipercipience aforesaid, are some, which I call Divine, because of their great excellency; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of which, the manhood of Christ is nearest unto the Godhead of all other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct beings, although, as I have already shewed the omnipresence and omni-percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or omniscience of Christ, as man, is not the same, nor equal unto these attributes of omniscience, and omni-presence, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Christ, as God, or unto the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: but of a far inferior sort. Moreover, seeing the foresaid communication of names; is grounded upon that so rare and singular union, betwixt the Godhead, and manhood of Christ, it is very manifest from hence, that the said communication of names, could not be from the beginning of the world, unless also the union betwixt the Godhead and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Christ</hi> (which is the ground of the said communication) had been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and consequently, also the Manhood of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44324:49"/>
Christ was from the beginning; for two natures cannot be united, before the one of them have any being: again, as the said commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of names and properties, require the Man-hood of Christ to exist, or have a being from the beginning of the World, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it could not be said that the Man Christ Jesus, was from the beginning, not so much as by that figurative speech of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of properties; so in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that communication of properties can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allowed; but where, as well as when, the Godhead and Manhood are together u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and existent, and that, for the same reason already given, namely, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the names is grounded upon the union of both existing together, in the same things, places, or persons, as well as in the same times: and therfore, if the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ, were not omnipresent, in all places, as well as all times: The Man Christ, could not be said to be omni-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, not so much as by that figurative speech of communication of properties, which is not barely Verbal, or Titular, and Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but Reall and Substantial, according to the manner above expressed. Again, there are many Scriptures which speak of Christ, that must needs be understood of Christ as Man, and not as God, so much as by that

figurative Speech of communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerties; as when Christ said, <hi>John 6. I came down from Heaven, not to do my own Will:</hi> this must needs be understood of Christ as Man, as I have already proved, seeing Christ as God always doth his own Will.</p>
                  <p>What he adds <hi>page</hi> 14, 15. concerning the sum of the Quakers Doctrine, concerning Christ, it being in great part, a heap of Nonsence and Confusion, and not my words nor meaning, and so far as any part of it is true, being sufficiently answered already, I need not make any new Reply unto it; only, whereas he talketh of two Souls and Bodies of Christ, I would have the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Remember, that I have no where in all my Book spoke of two Souls of Christ: and as concerning the two Bodies of Christ, they are also but one body, in the full and intire Notion of a body, consisting of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts and members, united into one, so that the manhood of Christ is still but one, in its full and intire Nature. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whereas he finds fault with us, for saying, that Christs heavenly body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Saints are partakers, confisteth of flesh, blood and bones, he may find the same fault with Christ, who spoke os his flesh and blood that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the Saints Food: also, he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44324:56"/>
may blame <hi>Paul,</hi> who said, the Saints were of his flesh and of his bones; But flesh, blood, and bones, here understood, are not to be meant literally, and after a vulgar manner, but spiritually, and figuratively; for his flesh and blood from Heaven, are Spirit and Life: And although the Wisdom of God hath expressed them under these distinct Names, yet originally, they may be but one substance, even as flesh and blood, and bones, of an earthly body, are origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly but one substance, which is dust and earth.</p>
                  <p>And I can and do freely appeal unto all Christians, whom God hath spiritually En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and given a Spiritual Understanding unto, of the Mystery of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not the True <hi>Christ</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of whom I have declared? And, Whether that described by the Author of this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> here Answered by me, is not indeed a False <hi>Christ?</hi> And also, his <hi>God,</hi> whom he limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Essentially within the Dimensions of an ordinary Human Body, be not also False? And so, Whether He, and not I, be not guilty of Gross <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and bringing - in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Gospel,</hi> and so is acted by another Spirit; and hath therefore a Curse from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle upon him? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, Whereas he laboureth to fix
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44324:50"/>
upon me the Heresies of no less than Seven several sorts of Heretical Sects; he but sheweth forth the same Lying Spirit, that hath acted him all along: And therefore, to undeceive the <hi>Reader,</hi> whom he seeketh so grosly to abuse, I shall very clearly and briefly pass through these Seven Heads; and sufficiently purge my self of every one of them, to any that are Judicious and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. 1. He chargeth me with the Heresie of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Valentinians,</hi> who said, <hi>Christ</hi> brought an Heavenly Body from Heaven with him. To this I answer, That was no part of their Heresie; but only that they said, <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body in the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, came down from Heaven, and did not in any part, share or partake of the Substance of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passed through the Virgin, as Light pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through the Air, or purest Christal: But this I do not maintain; for I have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared, That <hi>Christ</hi> did really par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Virgins Flesh and Substance; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> was not Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the manner of Human Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore, it was Heavenly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of its Original, and more Excellent than the Body of any other Man. And that this was reputed no Heresie among the Antients, I prove; because <hi>Hilarius,</hi> one of the Fathers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44324:51"/>
of great Antiquity, and in high Esteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these called the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> was of the same Judgment; namely, That both the Body and Soul of <hi>Christ,</hi> had a Nature more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, than that of all other Men; although they had also, what belonged to the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, in all Essentials. 2. He charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me with the Heresie of <hi>Apellis,</hi> that said, <hi>Christ</hi> had an Airy Body, and Starry Flesh, that passed through the Virgin. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; That I have no where affirmed any such thing, nor such Words have I any where used: For the Flesh and Blood, whereof I speak, according to Scripture, that came down from Heaven, is neither of the Air nor Stars; but of a more excellent Substance, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Compare: And also, that the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which he did take of the Virgin, was a real Body of Flesh and Blood; as I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove declared. 3. He chargeth me with the Heresie of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> that said, <hi>Christ</hi> had an Imaginary Body. To this I answer; That I am altogether free of this Charge: For I affirm, That <hi>Christ</hi> hath no Imaginary Body; for his Body is Real and Substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Nor doth it prove, that <hi>Christ</hi> his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Body, is Imagińary, because it cannot be seen, or felt, or heard, by the outward Senses, as he reasoneth: For by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>God</hi> himself should be no Real Being,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44324:51"/>
but only Imaginary; seeing <hi>God,</hi> who is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cannot be seen, or felt, by the outward Senses. And thus wee see, what Spirit of Madness acteth this false Accuser; who seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fix upon me (but falsly) the Error of <hi>Manicheisme,</hi> salleth head-long himself into the Ditch of Gross <hi>Atheisme:</hi> For what gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser <hi>Atheism</hi> than this, to say, That <hi>God</hi> is no real Being, but only Imaginary; which is the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Consequence of his Doctrine. 4. He chargeth me with the Heresie of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> who is said to have affirmed, That <hi>Christ</hi> had no Soul distinct from the Godhead: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of which, I have manifestly affirmed, and do still affirm. And when I say, The <hi>Nis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> is the Word <hi>Incarnate,</hi> or Word <hi>made Flesh,</hi> I do not exclude the Soul of <hi>Christ:</hi> For if these Words (namely, the <hi>Word made Flesh)</hi> exclude the Soul of <hi>Christ,</hi> then by the perverse Reasoning of this Author, he maketh the Apostle <hi>John</hi> equally Guilty with me, of the Heresie of <hi>Apollinarius.</hi> And thus we may see, how commonly this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor falleth into the same Ditch, which he hath prepared for another; and sometimes into a worse. 5. He chargeth me with the Heresie of the <hi>Nestorians,</hi> who said, There were two Persons, as well as two Natures, in Christ. To this I answer; But I have no where said, That there are two Persons in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44324:52"/>
Christ; nor do I say, That there are two Christs, or two Sons of God, as the <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> affirmed. Moreover, whereas he saith, The <hi>Quakers</hi> hold, that there are Three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Christ, if not Four: I answer, 1. But this was no Part of the <hi>Nestorian Heresie,</hi> if I had so affirmed: and therefore, instead of proving me a <hi>Nestorian,</hi> he but proveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a gross Lyar, Perverter, and Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But, 2. I answer, That I hold only, that there are but two Natures in Christ, Nature being taken (as it ought to be) in its full and intire Concept or Notion: For the Nature of Christ his Manhood, is still but one intire Nature of Man, although consisting of various Principles. And this the Author himself, must needs acknowledge, or then be guilty of his own Accusation: For, is not the Soul and Body of Man of distinct Natures, and yet they make up but one intire Nature of Man? And if he say, they are two distinct Natures, then Christ having these two Natures of Soul and Body; and also, being God, he hath, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Author, three Natures; which was the Accusation where-with he chargeth me, and yet is guilty of the same. 6. He chargeth me with the Heresie of the <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who gave the Divine Attributes to the Human Nature. To this I answer; That I have abundantly cleared my self of this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44324:52"/>
where I have shewed, that these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes, of Omni-presence, and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni-science, which belong to the Manhood of Christ, are neither the same, nor yet equal to these of the Godhead; and so, I confound not the Manhood and Godhead of Christ, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them distinct Natures and Beings, forever inseparably united together, after the most Perfect manner: whereas the <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi> are said to have confounded the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Godhead into one Nature.—7. He chargeth me with the Heresie of the <hi>Ubiquitarians,</hi> but whom he meaneth, he doth not express: But for answer, by the <hi>Ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> either he meaneth the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> or them called <hi>Lutherans;</hi> if the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, I have answered already, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 6<hi>th.</hi> If the latter, namely the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> I have at large, in my Book discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how I do not hold the Ubiquity or Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence of Christ, after that absurd and gross manner, as they do, but after another way; that is, both according unto Scripture Testimonies, in many places, and is no wise repugnant unto right reason, but very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto: Although in the general, I do acknowledge, that I do agree with the Judgment of <hi>Luther,</hi> and those that wrote the <hi>Liber Concordiae,</hi> as touching that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and whereas I made use of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44324:53"/>
testimonies, both out of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Liber Concordiae,</hi> for the Ubiquity, and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence of Christ, this Author hath not so much as once named them, far less an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them.</p>
                  <p>And thus Reader, I have particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto all his false accusations, and his beast with the Seven Heads, that he hath conjured out of the Sea of his troubled Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, I have easily slain, with a few easy and simple strokes: and here it were but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Just, instead of his <hi>Counterfeit Creed</hi> of his own making, concerning what the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe of the Man Christ Jesus, to draw up an account of his Atheistical and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Creed, concerning both God and Christ, which is truly his, and which he must needs own; either as his express words, or as the genuine, and most necessary consequences of his Words and Doctrine; and when I have so done, I should be more Just unto him, than he has been unto me, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged upon me many false things, which are neither my express words, nor the true consequences of my words; no, not after the remotest manner: But at present, I shall spare this pains, and refer the Reader to the places in my answer to his <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> where I have proved him manifestly guilty of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianisme,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44324:53"/>
Arianisme, Anthropomorphitisme, Muggletonisme, Judaisme, Anti - Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme; and lastly of gross Atheisme and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; to which also, I could add Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheisme, Ebionitisme, and Cerinthianisme, withal whom the author of the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> falsely called, the <hi>Quakers Creed,</hi> hath taken part, and for which he is justly reprovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In English thus. <q>Again, he said, that he was bread; that by this, that he is bread, coming down from Heaven, the Original of his Body may not be esteemed to be of Humane Conception, while it is shown to be a Heavenly Body—And the Hereticks use to accuse us, because we say, that Christ was born a man, having a Soul and Body not of our kind: but as by himself, he took
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44324:54"/>
to himself a Body of the Virgin; so of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he took to himself, a Soul which is never to be acknowledged to have the same Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of them begotten of Man: for if the Virgin had the Conception of the flesh, not of any other but God, it is much more needfull, that the Soul was not of any but of God.—But indeed, if that be the onely Nature of the Lords body, that by its own vertue, by its Soul it is carried upon the waters, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon the Floods, and being struck at, can pass through; why is the Flesh conceived of the Holy Ghost, judged by the Nature of an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body?</hi>
                  </q> And concerning the Soul of Christ, he further saith. <q>The power of this Nature, now I say, not only fear, but the region of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal seat doth not contain; which descending into the Hells, is not absent from Paradice; so that being the Son of Man speaking in the earth, he doth remain in the Heavens.

                  <hi>SInce I wrote the Answer, aforesaid, to the</hi> Pamphlet, <hi>set out by a Nameless Author, called the</hi> Quakers Creed, <hi>&amp;c. I have seen a sheet in print subscribed by</hi> William Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, <hi>a sort of Independent Teacher at</hi> Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>which he calls a</hi> Winding-sheet <hi>for the five</hi> Hartford Quakers; <hi>and in the said sheet, he refers the Reader to the aforesaid</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, <hi>called the</hi> Quakers Creed, <hi>for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to my Book,</hi> The way cast up. <hi>This gives me just ground to hold the said</hi> William Haworth, <hi>either to be the Author of the said</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, <hi>or at least an approver of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Lies and Calumnies, and whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gross abuses, weaknesses, and impertinencies, and all the absurd, and blasphemous Assertions, which I have discovered in the said</hi> Pamphlet, <hi>are Chargeable upon him, and lye at his door. And whereas</hi> William Haworth <hi>saith, at the end of that fheet aforesaid, that</hi> G. Keith <hi>saith, Christ never was a man; this I charge upon him, as a most gross, and Notorious lye, and slander: I never spoke, wrote, nor thought, any such thing. It is strange, that the man has so far lost all sense of shame, to publish such a manifest lye in the sight of the world. Now, how truely, and uprightly I own</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:44324:55"/>
                  <hi>and believe, that Christ is both God and Man, my book called,</hi> The way cast up, <hi>is a sufficient witness; and this other Treatise, writ by me in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the lying</hi> Pamphlet, <hi>owned by him, is another. But it seemeth, he doth suppose, that such a Conclusion will follow by way of Consequence from my words, because I have affirmed in my book, that Christ the Heavenly Man, was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, even before</hi> Adam, <hi>the first Man, which was of the Earth, earthly. But this consequence I altogether deny, as false and unreasonable; for his being before he came in that body, doth no more infer, that he was not man in that body, than it doth infer, that a man ceaseth to be a man, or that the Soul of any Man ceaseth to have a being, when it is not in a Fleshly body: and if the having of a Fleshly Body be so Essential to the being of the Soul, (which is most principally the Man) so as the Soul cannot be, or subsist before the Fleshly Body; the same reason holds as much, that the Soul cannot subsist, or have a being, after the Fleshly Body is put off: and so by</hi> W. Haworth <hi>his Argument, the Soul of every man dyeth with the body, and hath no immortal Subsistance. Let him see, how he can clear himself of this, and many other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, which he runneth himself into, by his foolish and inconsiderate way of reasoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as for other things in that he calleth his</hi> Winding Sheet, <hi>which he chargeth upon the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>as their Doctrines, and then upon some called</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

Quakers; <hi>as that one should say, that the Soul of man was the Devil, &amp; that the Devil was made an offering for sin; and another should say, that Christ was a bastard: These false, and abominable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, have been so fully and sufficiently answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red above, by the said five</hi> Hartford <hi>Friends; and especially in their last, called the Malice of the Independent Agent again rebuked, that it is to no purpose to give any further reply. Nor is the evidence he giveth by proof of some witnesses, of any more Authority than his own, who hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the face of the world, discovered himself to be a lyer, and false accuser; and can it be questioned, but he can find others like to himself, who because of their deep malice, and prejudice against the Truth, make no more conscience than himself, to bear false witness against the innocent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover, whereas these five Friends of</hi> Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>did justly blame</hi> W. H. <hi>for Charging the whole people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>with any errour, that some one or other called a</hi> Quaker, <hi>may be supposed to have writ or asserted, set case any one had so writ, or asserted: And they Query further, Is it just, the Independent party should be charged with the private Opinions of every one of them, because they pretend all to one rule, the Scripture?—The said</hi> W. H. <hi>giveth only this bare and naked evast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that he calleth his</hi> Winding Sheet: <hi>Should the</hi> Independants <hi>(saith he) hold Infallibiliy as you do, then might that party be Charged with</hi>

                  <hi>all the Religious Opinions, that any of them at any time vented. Unto which bare evasion, these Friends of</hi> Hartford, <hi>have given a sufficient reply, in</hi> pag. 13. <hi>of their last book: where among other things, they say; Such an absurdity was never the assertion of the people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>viz. That either every one pretending to be guided by the light within, or distinguished by the name</hi> Quaker, <hi>is therefore guided by the same light, in all discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or so to be owned by the said people. This which they have already said, is sufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his evasion; as because the</hi> Quakers <hi>do all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an infallible Spirit, that therefore all must be acknowledged to have that infallible Spirit, and to be guided thereby; which doth no more follow, than that because all the Independants so called, pretend to one Rule, the Scripture; that therefore, all that they or any of them speak, write, or do, is according unto the Scripture; which instance of parity, they did bring in their foresaid answer,</hi> pag. 13. <hi>(Yet do not thereby grant, that any of the people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>are guilty of any such Blasphemous Doctrines as before cited.) To which</hi> W. H. <hi>hath made no reply; and therefore, it is returned upon him, as wholly unanswered: as also the whole substance of their last book, which</hi> W.
