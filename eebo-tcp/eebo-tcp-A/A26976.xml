            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:50488:3"/>
a Spirit by the eſſential <hi>Virtus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis,</hi>
known to us by its acts; (for
nothing doth that which it cannot
do) than from the notion of ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.
And yet I dare not ſay that
a ſelf-moving principle is proper to
a Spirit. Nor do I conſent to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella
de ſenſu rerum,</hi> and Dr
<hi>Gliſſon</hi> that would make all things
alive by an eſſentiating form in the
very Elements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> diſtinguiſh <hi>Natures</hi> into <hi>Active</hi>
and <hi>Paſſive;</hi> and <hi>Paſſivity</hi> is a word
that ſerveth me as well as <hi>materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
But whence the <hi>Deſcenſus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium</hi>
is, I deſpair of knowing; and
if it be of an innate principle, I call
it not therefore a <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe it
is but <hi>paſſivorum motus aggregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus
ad unionem in quiete,</hi> when
Spirits motion is vital and ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to them, that they tend not to
union in quieſcence, but in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
activity; quieſcence in inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
being as much againſt their
nature as motion againſt a Stones. So
<pb facs="tcp:50488:4"/>
that I think we are agreed of the
formal notice of a Spirit in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and of an intellective, ſenſitive,
and vegetative <hi>in ſpecie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But truly I am at a loſs about the
<hi>conceptus fundamentalis,</hi> wherein
the true difference lieth between
<hi>Subſtantia</hi> and <hi>Materia.</hi> Do we by—<hi>Subſtantia</hi>
mean a <hi>conceptus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
or only <hi>Relative.</hi> To ſay it doth
<hi>ſubſtare accidentibus,</hi> ſpeaks but a
Relation directly, and leaves the
queſtion unanſwered, <hi>Quid eſt quod
ſubſtat accidentibus.</hi> To ſay it is not
an Accident, tells us not what it is,
but what it is not. To ſay it doth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<hi>per ſe,</hi> either ſaith no more than
that it is <hi>Ens reale,</hi> or elſe tells us
not what it is that doth ſubſiſt.
<hi>Quoad notationem nominis</hi> diſtinct
from uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth not <hi>materia</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi>
ſignify the ſame fundamental
<hi>conceptus?</hi> And is not the <hi>form</hi> the
notifying difference? You difference
Subſtance and Matter antecedently
to the formal difference by <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50488:4"/>
&amp; <hi>Impenetrability, Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility</hi>
&amp; <hi>Diviſibility.</hi> But 1. I deſpair
knowing in this life, how far Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Subſtances are <hi>penetrable</hi>
and <hi>indiviſible.</hi> I grant you ſuch
an extenſion as ſhall free them
from being <hi>nothing ſubſtantial,</hi> and
from being <hi>Infinite</hi> as God is.
2. We grant Spirits a <hi>quantitas
diſcreta;</hi> they are numerous, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduate;
and <hi>formae ſe multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</hi>
Generation is the work of
Spirits, and not of Bodies. And
how can I tell that God that can
make <hi>many out of one,</hi> cannot
make <hi>many into one,</hi> and unite
and divide them as well as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
But if he ſhould, that would
be no deſtruction of their <hi>Species,</hi>
as the <hi>mixtorum diſſolutio</hi> is; but
as every drop of divided Water is
Water, &amp; one Candle lighting many,
and many joyned in one, are all the
ſame fire; ſo much more would
it be with Spirits, were they uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or divided; and their locality
<pb facs="tcp:50488:5"/>
and penetrability are paſt our
conceit. 3. But were we ſure of
what we ſay therein; theſe two
<hi>(Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Indiviſibility)</hi>
ſpeak but Accidents, though proper;
and therefore are no ſatisfying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the notion of <hi>Subſtance Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
as diſtinct from <hi>Matter.</hi> I
am hitherto therefore conſtrained
to contain many thoughts in the
following compaſs.</p>
                  <p>1. I know Spirits beſt by the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
vitalis formalis una trina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I hold that of Created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<hi>ſubſtantia</hi> as notiſying a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
realis,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Conceptus
Fundamentalis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The word <hi>Immaterial</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing (but a negation) and
<hi>Materia</hi> being by many Antients
uſed in the ſame ſenſe as we do
<hi>Subſtantia,</hi> I uſually lay by the
words.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>I</hi> hold to the diſtinction of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
or <hi>Subſtances Paſſive</hi> and
<hi>Active.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50488:5"/>
5. <hi>I</hi> diſtinguiſh <hi>Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi>
as ſuch by the <hi>Purity</hi> of
the Subſtance, beſides the <hi>Formal
Difference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Yet <hi>I</hi> doubt not but all Created

Henry More; upon his Anſwer to à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                  </opener>
                  <p>§ 1. THat my haſty Letter ſhould
occaſion you to benefit the
World with more of your Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in ſo conſiderable a point, as is
the nature of a Spirit, was more than
I thought of, or could hope for: Had
I imagined that you would have ſo
far honoured it, I ſhould have ſo
written it, as might have drawn
out more of your Inſtruction, and
made your Animadverſions yet
more edifying.</p>

§ 2. I deſired you to have forborn
the title of <hi>Pſychopyriſt,</hi> for theſe
Reaſons: 1. Becauſe it tendeth
plainly to miſinform the Reader, as
if I held that <hi>Souls</hi> (or Spirits) are
<hi>Fire;</hi> whereas in my Books and
Letters, I ſtill ſay otherwiſe. And
that they may be ſo called not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter,</hi>
or <hi>univoce,</hi> but only <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter</hi>
and <hi>analogice.</hi> And when
a name on the Title page, &amp; through
the whole, and a ſuppoſition in much
of your arguing, implyeth that I hold
what I renounce, it may wrong your
Reader's underſtanding, though I am
below the capacity of being wronged.</p>
                  <p>2. And the faſtning of Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
on one another in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of Religion, hath ſo much cauſed
Schiſms, and other miſchiefs, that I
confeſs I the leſs like it about Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.
But I muſt ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. My underſtanding is grown
ſo ſuſpicious of ambiguity in almoſt
all words, that I muſt confeſs that
what you ſay alſo againſt thoſe whom
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50488:8"/>
you call <hi>Holenmerians</hi> and <hi>Nullibiſts</hi>
ſatisfieth me not, unleſs many terms
uſed in the controverſies, were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explained than I find them here,
or in your Metaphyſicks (your Books
againſt Judge <hi>Hale</hi> I have not ſeen.)
But I may take it for granted that
you know that they who uſe the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>[Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet
parte]</hi> ordinarily tell us;
1. That they uſe the word <hi>Tota</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively,
and improperly; ſeeing that
which hath no parts is improperly
called <hi>Tota.</hi> 2. That they mean it but
<hi>negatively,</hi> viz. That the Soul is
not in the parts of the body, <hi>per par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
part in one part, and part in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but indiviſibly. And one
would think this ſhould ſuit with
your own hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>And when I better know in what
ſenſe <hi>Locus</hi> is uſed, I ſhall be fitter to
enquire whether Spirits be in <hi>loco.</hi>
When ſome take it for a <hi>circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
body,</hi> and ſome for a <hi>ſubjective
body</hi> (on which it operateth) and
ſome for a meer room poſſeſt <hi>in vacuo,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50488:9"/>
and ſome for <hi>God himſelf</hi> in whom
are all things, the name of a <hi>Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſt</hi>
is as ambiguous to me.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. <hi>You tell your Reader that</hi>
[All created Spirits are Souls in all
probability, and actuate ſome Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or other.]</p>
                  <p>Sir, Philoſophers freedom is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken eaſilyer than Divines; I
will therefore preſume that our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
freedom ſhall not be in the leaſt
diſtaſtful to either of us: And ſo I
muſt tell you that I have long taken
it for a matter of very great uſe to
diſtinguiſh unknown things from
known, and to bridle my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from preſuming to enquire into
unrevealed things: And I take that
holdneſs of Philoſophers to have had
a great hand in corrupting Divinity.
Secret things are for God, and things
revealed for us and our Children,
ſaith <hi>Moſes.</hi> And when I preſume
moſt, I do but moſt loſe my ſelf, and
miſuſe my underſtanding: nothing is
good for that which it was not made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50488:9"/>
for: Our underſtandings as our Eyes
are made only for things revealed.
In many of your Books I take this to
be an exceſs; And I have oft won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at your Friend, and (ſometime)
mine, Mr. <hi>Glanvile,</hi> that after his
<hi>Scepſis ſcientifica,</hi> he could talk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
write of doubtful things with that
ſtrange degree of confidence, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
of Diſſenters as he did. I am
accuſed of overdoing, and curioſity
my ſelf: But I endeavour to confine
my enquiries to things revealed.</p>
                  <p>This premiſed I ſay, undoubtedly
it is utterly unrevealed, either as to
any <hi>certainty</hi> or <hi>probability,</hi> that all
Spirits are Souls, and actuate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Alaſs how ſhould we come to
know it. Neither Nature nor Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tells it us.</p>
                  <p>But 1. If this be ſo, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between you and the Pſychopy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts
muſt be opened as it is (much
like that of <hi>Mammertus</hi> and <hi>Fauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,)</hi>
whether the Soul (or a Spirit)
have Matter by <hi>compoſition,</hi> or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50488:10"/>
uncompounded: for a body you
ſuppoſe it ſtill to have. Is it ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from a Body or not? If it be, why
ſhould you think that it is never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated?
If it can ſubſiſt without
a Body, who can ſay that it doth
not? If it cannot but be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
it is a ſtrange compoſition that
God cannot diſſolve. And if it periſh
upon the diſſolution, then it was but
an Accident of the body, and not a
compounding Subſtance. Dr. <hi>Gliſſons</hi>
and <hi>Campanella's</hi> way is as probable
as this; And I marvel that when you
have dealt with ſo many ſorts of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
you meddle not with ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
a piece as that old Doctor's <hi>de
Vita Naturae:</hi> I have talkt with
divers high pretenders to Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
here of the new ſtrain, and askt
them their judgment of Dr. <hi>Gliſſons</hi>
Book, and I found that none of them
underſtood it, but neglected it as too
hard for them, and yet contemned it.
He ſuppoſeth all Matter to be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without compoſition, the Matter
and Form being but <hi>conceptus inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quati,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50488:10"/>
of an uncompounded being,
however that Matter as ſuch be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
into atomes, every atome ſtill
being uncompounded living Matter.
You ſuppoſe all <hi>Spirit</hi> to be in <hi>Matter.</hi>
but by way of compoſition as diſtinct
ſubſtances. I go the middle way, and
ſuppoſe that ſubſtance (ſimple) is
<hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Paſſive:</hi> that the three
Paſſive Elements, Earth, Water and
Air are animated only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or operation of the active;
But that the active ſubſtances have
no compoſition, (but intellectual) but
<hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> are <hi>conceptus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſdem
inadequati.</hi> So that what
Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> ſaith of every clod and
ſtone, I ſay only of Spirits, (of fire I
ſhall ſpeak after.)</p>
                  <p>2. And do you think that the Soul
carrieth a body out of the body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
with it, or only that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
a new body when it paſſeth
out of the old. If the latter, is there
any inſtant of time between the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion
of the old, and the poſſeſſion
of the new. If any, then the Soul is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50488:11"/>
ſometime without a body: And how
can you tell how long. If not what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is it that you can imagine ſo ready
to receive it without any interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
I have not been without tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to over inquiſitive thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
theſe matters: And I never had
ſo much ado to overcome any ſuch
temptation, as that to the opinion of
<hi>Averrhoes,</hi> that as extinguiſhed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
go all into one illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
air, ſo ſeparated Souls go
all into one common <hi>Anima
Mundi,</hi> and loſe their individuation,
and that <hi>Materia receptiva indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duat.</hi>
And then indeed your notion
would be probable; for the <hi>Anima
mundi mundum ſemper animat,</hi> and
ſo my ſeparated Soul ſhould be ſtill
imbodyed in the world, and ſhould
have its part in the worlds anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But both Scripture and Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
aſſure us of the individuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Spirits, and ſeparate Souls.</p>
                  <p>And I confeſs to you that I have
oft told the Sadduces and Infidels,
that urge ſeeming impoſſibilities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50488:11"/>
the Reſurrection, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of ſeparate Souls for want of
Organs, that they are not ſure that
the Soul taketh not with it, at its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
hence, ſome ſeminal material
Spirits (ethereal and airy;) and ſo
that this ſpirituous or igneous body,
which it carrieth hence, is a <hi>ſemen</hi>
to the body, which it ſhall have at the
Reſurrection, no man knoweth the
contrary, and no man knoweth that
it is ſo.</p>
                  <p>The Soul is many months here in
organizing its own body in generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and more in nouriſhing it to a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſtate: That particular organical
bodies are made ready to receive
them juſt at death, is hard to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
That the matter of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
is ſtill ready is paſt doubt. But
how organized, or how the Soul wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
without Organs, we ſhall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
know hereafter. Your opinion
much favoureth the Pythagoreans;
If the Soul be never out of a body, is
it not as like to come into one new
forming in the womb, as into we know
not what or where?</p>

§ 5. I could wiſh you had printed
my Letter wholly by it ſelf before you
had annexed your anſwer, that the
Reader might have underſtood it;
which I can hardly do my ſelf as you
have parcel'd it. But we muſt not
have what we would have from wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
men.</p>
                  <p>I take it for an odd method, when I
never aſſerted Spirits to be fire, but
denyed it, firſt to be in your Epiſtle
feigned to have ſaid it, and yet in the
end of it for you to ſay that <hi>[I mean
not ordinary fire,</hi> but that <hi>my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

never tell the Reader what it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you diſpute it, and then through
the whole anſwer to diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on a

not that Spirits are fire or material.</p>
                  <p>§ 6. Had I been to chooſe an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

                     <p>§ 1. THat my Notions are like thoſe of
Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> is no wonder; we
were no ſtrangers to each others thoughts
about theſe matters; and though he and
you have had ſome peaceable Velitations,
I take it for no diſhonour to be of his
mind.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>De Nomine:</hi> There is no ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among Philoſophers of the <hi>name
Matter</hi> as you ſuppoſe. I refer you for
brevity, but to a very ſmall Book of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Learned Author (advanced by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of one eminent for ſubtilty) the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks
of Dr. <hi>Rich. Crakenthorp,</hi> who
tells you at large, that <hi>Matter</hi> is taken
either <hi>properly</hi> (as you and I do <hi>Subſtance)</hi>
and ſo <hi>Spirits</hi> are <hi>material,</hi> or improperly
and narrowly for that only which hath
the three dimenſions; and ſo <hi>Spirits</hi> are
not <hi>material.</hi> It's unprofitable to cite
many more to to the ſame purpoſe: And I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50488:13"/>
ſuppoſe you know, that not only <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
but many other of the Fathers (many
of whom you may find cited by <hi>Fauſtus
Reg.</hi> whom <hi>Mammertus</hi> anſwereth) ſo
uſed both <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Corpus</hi> alſo.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. The word <hi>[Form]</hi> is as ambiguous;
You and I are not the only perſons that
uſe it not in the ſame ſenſe. Matter in its
firſt <hi>Conceptus</hi> called <hi>Primus,</hi> hath no <hi>Form;</hi>
that is, is conceived of abſtracted from
all Form. Matter in its next <hi>Conceptus</hi> is
conceived of as diverſified by accidents,
as quantity, figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the 3 paſſive
Elements, Earth, Air &amp; Water, are diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by many accidents, making up that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,</hi>
which is called their ſeveral <hi>forms,</hi>
known only by ſensſe, and capable of no
perfect definition. Many ſuch paſſive Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
conjunct have their Relative Form,
which is that Contexture in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
their aptitude for their uſe: as
a Houſe, a Ship, a Gun, a Watch. In Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
where the Active natures are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and operate unitedly on the paſſive,
there the Active is the <hi>Form</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
quite in another ſenſe than any of
the former, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is <hi>principium motus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You and I are enquiring of the different
<hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Spirit:</hi> You ſay that
<hi>Impenetrability,</hi> and <hi>Diviſibility</hi> are the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50488:13"/>
                        <hi>Form</hi> of Matter, and the contrary of Spirit:
I ſay, that 1. <hi>Subſtance</hi> as <hi>Subſtance,</hi> (and
<hi>Matter</hi> taken for <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which Dr.
<hi>Crakenthorpe</hi> thinketh is the propereſt
ſenſe) as ſuch hath no Form, that is, <hi>in
conceptu primo.</hi> 2. That ſubſtance diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by ſubtilty &amp; craſſitude, viſibility
and inviſibility, quantity, ſhape, motion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth herein differ <hi>Modally:</hi> And this
<hi>Mode</hi> may well enough be called the
<hi>Form,</hi> before it have another Form:
And as the divers foreſaid Elements thus
differ, ſo the ſubſtance of Spirits no doubt
hath ſome <hi>Modal Excellency</hi> above all
Bodies or Matter ſtrictly or narrowly ſo
called: And if you will call this a <hi>Form,</hi>
I contend not about the word, but it is
but equivocally ſo called, Spirits having
another nobler ſort of Form. 3. Nothing
hath two Forms univocally ſo called: But
Spirits have all that <hi>Virtus formalis,</hi> which
I oft deſcribed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is their very form:
There is no Spirit without it: It's not a
Compounding part, but the form of a
ſimple ſubſtance. <hi>Vital Virtue, Vis, Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
activa,</hi> ſignifieth not the ſame thing
with Penetrability, and Indiſcerpibility;
Therefore both cannot be the Form uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally
ſo called: And how you could put
both theſe your ſelf into one definition,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50488:14"/>
as a kind of <hi>Compounded Form</hi> I wonder.
Yea, your two words themſelves ſignify
not the ſame thing: Penetrable and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerpible
are not words of one ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And ſurely you will grant that
theſe two, <hi>Penetrable</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpible can
be</hi> no otherwiſe a Form to <hi>Spirits,</hi> than
<hi>Impenetrable</hi> and <hi>Diſcerpible</hi> are a Form to
Matter. And it's apparent that the firſt is
but a modal <hi>conceptus,</hi> and the latter a
relative notion of Matter, and neither one
nor both are contrary to <hi>Virtus Vitalis</hi> in
a Spirit (or <hi>Virtus activa:)</hi> Meer <hi>paſſive
potentiality</hi> is rather the contrary diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
here.</p>
                     <p>And I know not why you might not as
well have named divers other Accidents
or Modes, eſpecially <hi>Quantity,</hi> and the <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
dimenſio,</hi> and called them all the <hi>Form
of Matter,</hi> as well as your <hi>two.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed when we have from ſenſe a true
notion of Matter, we muſt know that it
<hi>hath Quantity,</hi> and is <hi>ſomewhere,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that one part of it, and another part
cannot poſſeſs juſt the ſame place; and ſo
we grant you the Impenetrability: And
how far you prove Spirits to be ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as are <hi>extended,</hi> and have <hi>Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
(as you ſay <hi>pag. 105.)</hi> and <hi>ſpiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
and be <hi>in loco,</hi> and in <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50488:14"/>
ſpace variouſly, and yet that they have
no dimenſions which the Divine Intellect
or Power itſelf can meaſure; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the Spirits in the univerſe can be
<hi>in eodem puncto,</hi> and all that are finite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into that one point, I leave this to
Wits more ſubtil than mine to judge of.</p>
                     <p>For to tell you the truth, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all without the mediation of
ſenſe, except the immediate ſenſation it
ſelf, &amp; the acts of Intellection &amp; Volition
or Nolition, &amp; what the Intellect inferreth
of the like, by the perception of theſe. I
have ſeen &amp; felt how <hi>Water differeth</hi> from
<hi>Earth,</hi> and from that ſenſation my Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
hath that Idea of the difference which
it hath: But without that <hi>ſeeing</hi> and <hi>feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it, all the definitions in the world, and
all the names of hard and ſoft, and dry and
moiſt, would have given me no true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the formal difference. Now hence
I infer, that I have no ſenſe at all of the
difference of a Spirits Subſtantiality in
ſuch modes and accidents from that of
<hi>Matter;</hi> and therefore how can I know
it? I know by <hi>knowing</hi> what <hi>knowing</hi> is,
and by <hi>willing</hi> what <hi>willing</hi> is: And I know
that theſe Acts prove a <hi>power</hi> (for nothing
doth that which it cannot do,) and that
<hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> prove a <hi>Substance,</hi> (for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50488:15"/>
                        <hi>nothing hath nothing,</hi> and <hi>can do nothing:)
ab eſt tertii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> adjecti ad eſt ſecundi valet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum:</hi>
And I know, that unleſs <hi>Light</hi>
might be called <hi>Spirit,</hi> Spirits are to me
inviſible: And ſo I can knowingly ſay,
1. What <hi>they do,</hi> 2. What they <hi>can do,</hi>
3. What they are in the <hi>genus</hi> of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,</hi>
4. And what they <hi>are not</hi>
as to many Attributes proper to Viſible
Subſtances or Bodies; 5. And I have
elſewhere fully proved in a ſpecial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
(in <hi>Methodo Theol.)</hi> that the <hi>Power</hi>
of <hi>Vital</hi> Action, Intellection and Volition,
is not a meer Accident of them, but their
very eſſential form. But as to that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of their Subſtance which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Impenetrability</hi> and <hi>Diviſibility,</hi>
I may grope, but I cannot know it poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
for want of ſenſation.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. Is an <hi>Atom Matter?</hi> or is it not?
If one Atom be no matter, then two is
none, and then there is none. If an Atom
be matter, is it <hi>Diſcerpible</hi> or not? If
not, how is this the <hi>Form</hi> of Matter? If
it be diviſible, it is not an Atom; that's a
contradiction. And if every Atom be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
in <hi>infinitum,</hi> it is as great, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the world, and then there are as
many Infinites as Atoms. That three
Atoms united cannot be divided juſt in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50488:15"/>
the middle, <hi>etiam per Divinam Potentiam,</hi>
is becauſe it implieth a contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi>
that an Atom is diviſible; ſo that by you
an Atom is a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Do you take the word <hi>[Penetrable]
actively,</hi> or <hi>paſſively,</hi> or <hi>both?</hi> If actively
according to you <hi>Matter</hi> is <hi>penetrable;</hi>
for it can penetrate a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
the ſame place. But I perceive you
mean that Spirits can penetrate Bodies, &amp;
alſo that they can penetrate one another.</p>
                     <p>And I ſuppoſe that by Penetration you
mean not that which ſeparateth parts, of
the Matter, &amp; cometh in between theſe
parts, but you mean poſſeſſing the ſame
place, as is ſaid: And if ſo, do you put no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation?
or what? I ask before, can all the
Created Spirits in Heaven and Earth be in
the ſame Atom of matter? If ſo, are they
then abſent from all other place? or is
every Spirit ubiquitary? You confute
the Nullibiſts by the operation of the
Soul on the Body: <hi>Ibi operatur, ergo ibi
eſt:</hi> And do you think that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in Heaven, and all Created Souls
may be in one Body by Penetration? If
ſo, Are they one Soul there, or innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in one man? And if they may be
all in one point, and ſo be all one, may
they not be divided again? I confeſs my
ignorance of the Conſiſtence of ſpiritual
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50488:16"/>
Subſtance is ſo great, that I am not able
to ſay, that God who hath given Souls
<hi>quantitatem diſcretam,</hi> and made them
innumerable, is not able to make one of
two, or many, and to turn that one into
two, or many again: I am not ſure that
it is a contradiction; eſpecially if it be
true that <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and many more ſay
of the multiplication of Forms by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>But if you take <hi>Penetrability paſſively,</hi>
then you mean that <hi>Spirits</hi> may be <hi>pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated</hi>
by <hi>Bodies,</hi> or by one <hi>another,</hi> or
<hi>both.</hi> No doubt you mean both, and ſo,
as I ſaid, <hi>Bodies</hi> alſo are <hi>penetrable,</hi> both
actively and paſſively; that is, Bodies
can penetrate Spirits, and be penetrated
by Spirits. Whether any Bodies penetrate
each other, <hi>viz.</hi> whether <hi>Light</hi> or its
vehicle at leaſt be a Body, and whether
it penetrate the body of Glaſs or Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal,
with more about theſe matters, I
have heretofore ſpoken in my Reaſons of
the Chriſtian Religion Append. <hi>Obj. 2.
p.</hi> 525. and forward.</p>
                     <p>§ 3. To conclude this; as in natural
mixt Bodies, there are three principles,
<hi>Materia, Materiae Diſpoſitio</hi> (for that I
think is a fitter expreſſion than <hi>Privatio)</hi>
&amp; <hi>Forma;</hi> ſo in <hi>ſimple Beings</hi> there are
three (not parts, but) <hi>conceptus inadaequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>
anſwerable hereto; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50488:16"/>
I. In the three paſſive Elements, Earth,
Water and Air, there is in each, 1. The
Matter, 2. The Diſpoſition of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by contexture, and various modes, of
which Impenetrability and Diviſibility
are parts; 3. The paſſive Form reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from all theſe, which conſiſteth in their
various aptitude to their uſes; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
their Receptivity of the Influx of the
Active Natures. Here you put two At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
together, which are both but
parts of the <hi>Materiae Diſpoſitio,</hi> and call
them two the Form.</p>
                     <p>II. In the <hi>Active Natures,</hi> there is,
1. The <hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> 2. The <hi>Subſtantiae
Diſpoſitio,</hi> 3. The <hi>Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the firſt (not part, but) inadequate
<hi>Conceptus, Subſtantiality,</hi> we agree, of the
ſecond <hi>Conceptus</hi> we differ: That ſuch
Subſtances have an incomprehenſible Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
of which we can have no diſtinct
Idea for want of Senſation, but a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conception only; and that this <hi>Purity</hi>
(whatever it be) is not the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
but the <hi>Subſtantiae Diſpoſitio,</hi> is that
which I ſay: And <hi>you</hi> ſay that <hi>Penetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
and <hi>Indiviſibility</hi> are the <hi>Form,</hi> which
(at moſt) are but the <hi>Diſpoſitio Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae;</hi>
and yet you joyn the <hi>Vital Virtue</hi>
as part of the formal Conception too,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50488:17"/>
which is quite of another conception.
And ſo we differ of the third <hi>Conceptus,
viz.</hi> the Form alſo; which I affirm of all
ſimple active natures to be the <hi>Virtus
Activa:</hi> And if they are Vital, the <hi>Virtus
Vitalis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>name Vita,</hi> there is a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
which muſt be diſtinguiſhed from
that <hi>de re.</hi> If it be true that Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi>
ſaith, that every Atom of matter hath in
it a <hi>Motive Principle</hi> without Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the <hi>Motive Virtue</hi> is the <hi>Form</hi>
of all Matter as well as of <hi>Spirit.</hi> If all
be to be called <hi>Living</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> which
hath a <hi>Virtus Motiva</hi> for its <hi>Eſſential
Form,</hi> then <hi>Ignis</hi> (or <hi>Aether)</hi> is <hi>Vital</hi>
and <hi>Spirit;</hi> for it hath an <hi>Eſſential Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Principle</hi> as its <hi>Form.</hi> Therefore the
Queſtion whether <hi>Ignis</hi> or <hi>Aether)</hi> be
<hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> is but a queſtion <hi>de nomine</hi>
(ſuch as too many uſually in Diſputes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
as if it were <hi>de re.)</hi> It is no <hi>Life</hi>
or <hi>Spirit,</hi> if by thoſe names you mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Senſitive</hi> and <hi>Intellectual</hi> Natures: But
it is <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> if by that name you
mean only an <hi>Eſſential Formal Motive
Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have oft profeſſed that I am ignorant
whether <hi>Ignis</hi> and <hi>Vegetative Spirit</hi> be
all one (to which I moſt incline) or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50488:17"/>
                        <hi>Ignis</hi> be an Active Nature, made to
be the Inſtrument by which the three
Spiritual Natures, Vegetative, Senſitive
and Mental work on the three Paſſive
Natures: And though I was wont to
think, that what I knew not my ſelf, all
men of great Learning knew, ſpecially
ſuch as you, in the points which you have
with ſingular induſtry ſtudied; yet now
experience hath baniſhed that modeſt
Errour, and convinced me that other
men muſt be content with an humble <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus</hi>
as well as I.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. And here I muſt note, that § 18.
<hi>p.</hi> 127. where you purpoſely define a
Spirit, you agree with me: Your defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
is <hi>[A Spirit is an Immaterial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
intrinſecally endued with Life, and
the Faculty of Motion.]</hi> Forgive me for
thinking that you are not ſtrict enough in
your terms for a definition; but plainly
you ſeem to mean the ſame as I do. You
ſhould, I think, have mentioned a Spirit
as a ſimple Subſtance differing from a
mixt; and have ſaid, not only <hi>[intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally]</hi>
endued, for ſo is every <hi>Animal</hi> who
is Body as well as Spirit, but alſo endued
with it as its <hi>ſimple Formal Eſſence:</hi> And
whether all <hi>Faculty of Motion (e. g. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation)</hi>
be <hi>Life,</hi> I am in doubt. But here
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50488:18"/>
1. You agree with me in the firſt <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
[Subſtance;]</hi> And 2. As to that mode
of Subſtance which I call the <hi>Diſpoſitio
Subſtantiae ad Formam,</hi> you call it but
<hi>[Immaterial]</hi> which is a negative, and
ſpeaketh nothing poſitively; which is
ſuch an honeſt Confeſſion as we poor Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norants
apertly make, that what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Purity</hi> or modal Conſiſtence of
Spiritual Subſtance is as compared to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
(or Corporeal) becauſe we never
ſaw or felt it as we do Corporeal; we
do not formally know, and therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell men <hi>de genere,</hi> that it is moſt
<hi>pure</hi> and <hi>excellent;</hi> but in ſpecial, that we
have no true Idea of it, and therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell men what it is not <hi>[not material]</hi>
and not what it is. 3. But you name no
<hi>Formal Difference</hi> but <hi>Life:</hi> When you
add [the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Motion]</hi> it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
Explication of the <hi>Virtus Vitalis,</hi>
which is ever <hi>Vnica-triplex,</hi> viz. <hi>Activa-Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when it operateth

you think that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immateriality</hi> are
<hi>Synonyma</hi>'s? Or that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Penetrable</hi>
and <hi>Indiſcerpible,</hi> are Synonyma's? Or
that the Form of a Spirit is a <hi>Compound</hi>
of ſuch and ſo many Heterogeneals? Had
you held to this definition, I think you
had done beſt.</p>

§ 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 129. You ſeem to explain <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi>
ſo as to make <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> an
immediate Attribute, and expound it, <hi>It is
indiſcerpible into real Phyſical parts:</hi> (ſo is
an Atom.) But as <hi>Phyſical ſignifieth corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real,</hi>
ſome will ſay, it may yet be <hi>per po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam

actively, that it <hi>can penetrate the matter
and things of its own kind,</hi> that is, <hi>paſs
through Spiritual Subſtances:</hi> And ſuch
any groſs Body can paſs through.</p>

                     <p>§ 7. As to your oft-mentioned <hi>per ſe

am paſt doubt, that Spirits more depend
on God for Being and Motion, than Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth on Spirits (Created.) But it's
difference enough that God giveth them

that by <hi>informing</hi> it without mixture, I

the Contradiction that makes it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Nor do I believe that it giveth a

I am not certain that Stones, Earth, and

that if a Stone in the Air fall down, it is
by a Spirits motion, and that God hath

are ſeveral modes of it; and that
mode which is moſt ſtated, moſt ſheweth
nature. I ſee no contradiction in it, that
a Stone ſhould fall without Life: I dare
not ſay, that God cannot make a Rock or
Clod to fall by an intrinſick Principle of
Gravitation, without vital motion. And
yet I am moſt inclined to your Opinion:

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50488:26"/>
Cauſe is ever one, but excludeth
not ſubordinate Moving Cauſes. My old
Friend Mr. <hi>Sam. Got</hi> (on <hi>Moſis Philoſ.)</hi>
ſuppoſeth each Element to have its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Spirit: I am not ſo well skilled in
ſuch things, as to come to that certainty
which others pretend to: I think to an
equal common Motion an Univerſal Cauſe
may ſuffice; but when Motions differ, I
know not the different Cauſes ſo well as
ſome think they do. How you anſwered
Judge <hi>Hale</hi> of the Rundle in the Water, I
know not: But you that think Fire in the
Sun to be no Spirit but Matter, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
will never make me believe, that Fire
and Sun are moved only by the Univerſal
Mover, without any motive principle in
themſelves. Your Metaphyſ. c. 13. I have
peruſed, and am paſt doubt of a Spiritual
Moving Power: But two things I ſee not
proved; 1. That there are not particular
Moving Principles ſubordinate to the
more Univerſal. 2. That the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath not put into the paſſive Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
a ſtrong inclination of the parts to
union with the whole, and to aggregative
Motion when forcibly ſeparated; which
Inclination Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> calleth their Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Life; but I think is ſomewhat that
deſerveth not that name. I have not read
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50488:27"/>
your <hi>Vol. Philoſ.</hi> nor <hi>Adnot am.</hi> nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

                     </p>
                     <p>§ 2. Sect. 6. You ſay, <hi>This is to joyn
the property of a Spirit to Matter. Anſw.</hi>
That's it that I doubt of, whether all <hi>Self-motion</hi>
(under the Univerſal Mover) be
proper to a Spirit, or only <hi>Vital Self-motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 3. Your Aſſurance of the <hi>Earth's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
aſſureth not me: I have ſeen a <hi>M. S.</hi>
of your Antagoniſt's Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
me to deny it; and nothing more
than the Igneous nature of the Sun, to
which Motion is natural, and the torpid
nature of Earth; God making every
thing fit for its uſe. But of this, as my
judgment is of little value, ſo I profeſs
Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. That there is <hi>Activity</hi> in <hi>fixed
Thoughts,</hi> I grant; for <hi>Thinking</hi> is <hi>Acting.</hi>
But that there is as much Activity in the
not-acting of a Rock, <hi>e.g.</hi> I deny.</p>
                     <p>§ 5. Again, you are at the <hi>Miſchief</hi> of
Leaving out your <hi>Penetrability,</hi> and <hi>Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibility,</hi>
and <hi>Immateriality;</hi> to which I
have oft anſwered. And I now add, you
make it an abſurdity to name that as a
<hi>Form,</hi> which is not proper to the thing:
But Immateriality, Penetrability, or Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibility
in your own Judgment (I
think) are none of them proper to Spirit.

                     <p>§ 1. YOU come to the main thing
which I importuned you to bleſs
the world with your explication of, <hi>viz.
The true difference of Subſtance and Matter.</hi>
And you ſay, <hi>It's obvious to any obſerving
Eye. They differ as</hi> Genus <hi>and</hi> Species.
<hi>Anſ.</hi> I would I had an obſerving Eye. If
by <hi>Matter</hi> you mean <hi>ſenſible Matter,</hi> ſuch
as Man can ſee, feel, or meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the
difference indeed is obvious: My doubt
is here; ſeeing you confeſs that <hi>ſubſtare
accidentibus</hi> is but a relative notion; (and
it's commonly ſaid that God hath no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
and yet is a Subſtance: How true
I ſay not,) and all your notice of it, beſides
Negatives is, that <hi>[Subſtance is a Being
ſubſiſting by it ſelf]</hi> and call this <hi>[a compleat
Definition;]</hi> 1. How you can call that a
<hi>compleat Definition</hi> of that which indeed is
not definable, for want of a <hi>Genus:</hi> For you
ſay Metaph. c. 2. that <hi>Ens quatenus Ens non
poſſe eſſe objectum Metaphyſicae cum tam gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale

ſtick not at: Things not definable may be
partly known. But 2. whereas it's grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you, that <hi>Subſtantia</hi> and <hi>Vita</hi> (or
<hi>Virtus Activa)</hi> are two inadequate <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus</hi>
of a Spirit, do you hold that the
<hi>Conceptus</hi> of <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> hath any more
in it of <hi>Real Entity,</hi> than the bare <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
of <hi>Virtus Activa</hi> (or <hi>Vitalis)</hi> alone?
Or whether the meaning be, that as it is
<hi>Res</hi> the <hi>Virtus Activa</hi> is its total <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>Subſtantia</hi> is but added to ſignifie
that <hi>Res illa quae dicitur Vita vel Virtus
Vitalis ſubſiſtit per ſe, &amp; non in alio, id eſt,
non eſt Accidens.</hi> If this be the meaning
that the word <hi>Vis,</hi> or <hi>Virtus,</hi> ſpeak all that
is <hi>Res,</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> ſpeak only its ſtate, as
being no Accident, but a <hi>Self-Being;</hi> this
is intelligible, and it agreeth with ſome
mens thoughts of God himſelf. But this
ſeemeth neither to be true (at leaſt of
Creatures) nor to be your ſenſe. Not
true; for a Created <hi>Virtus (vel Vita) quae
non eſt alicujus Subſtantiae Virtus, vel ut
Forma vel ut Accidens,</hi> ſeemeth above
our reach to conceive. Though I know
many call God <hi>Purus Actus,</hi> &amp; the Schools
moſtly agree that <hi>Subſtantia</hi> is not univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
ſpoken of God and us, and deny it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50488:28"/>
to be properly ſaid of God; and I can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grant that God is utterly above all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
knowledge of ours; yet that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Spirits ſhould be a meer <hi>Virtus</hi> (or
<hi>Potentia Activa,</hi> or <hi>Actus)</hi> ſeemeth hard
to believe.</p>
                     <p>And many words intimate that it is not
your Judgment, but that <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
not only the <hi>Modus</hi> of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of the <hi>Actus Entitativus,</hi> or <hi>Virtus,</hi>
but is the firſt half and fundamental <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus</hi>
of a Spirit as <hi>Res,</hi> ſpeaking halfly
its Entity. In this I think we agree.</p>
                     <p>And now if this be ſo, this very <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
of Fundamental Reality, is but that
ſame which <hi>Schibler,</hi> and abundance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
call <hi>Materia Metaphyſica,</hi> as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from <hi>Materia Phyſica;</hi> and which Dr.
<hi>Crakenthorpe,</hi> &amp; many others, take the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and moſt proper ſenſe of <hi>Materia</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
&amp; therefore I ſay but, that you ſhould
not take an equivocal word for univocal,
and lay ſo great a ſtreſs on an ambiguous
name. And I confeſs ſtill all your names
of <hi>Indiſcerpibility, Penetrability</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality,</hi>
give me no ſcientifical notion
of the true difference between the loweſt
<hi>Subſtantiality</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the higheſt
of <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Aether,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotelis quinta

                     <p>§ 1. TO your <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> I further
ſay, I diſtinguiſh, 1. Between Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Intellectual dividing; 2. Between
what God can do, and what a Creature
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50488:32"/>
can do, and 3. Between the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and created Spirits: And ſo I ſay, 1.
That if you had ſpoken of the meer <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Vitalis</hi> of a Spirit, I think it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to ſay that it is Diſcerpible or
impenetrable; But ſeeing you aſcribe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude,
Quantity, and Dimenſions, and
Logical Materiality to the Subſtantiality
of Spirits, I ſee not but that you make
them Intellectually diviſible; that is, that
one may think of one part as here and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there. 2. And if ſo, though man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſeparate or divide them, if it be no
contradiction God can. Various Elements
vary in diviſibility: Earth is moſt diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Water more hardly, the parts more
inclining to the cloſeſt contact: Air yet
more hardly: And if as you think the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Fire be material, no doubt the
Diſcerpibility is yet harder. And if God
have made a Creture ſo ſtrongly inclin'd to
the Unity of all the parts, that no other Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can ſeparate them but God only, as if a
Soul were ſuch; it's plain that ſuch a Being
need not fear a Diſſolution by ſeparation
of parts: For its own Nature hath no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to it, but to the contrary, and no
fellow Creature hath power to do it, and
God will not do it. God maketh all things
apt for their uſe, and uſeth things as he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50488:32"/>
hath made them, He made not Marble
and Sand alike, nor uſeth them alike. And
if he ſhould make a Spirit <hi>(e. g.</hi> an <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
hujus Vorticis, Solis, Stellae,</hi> &amp;c.) Such
as he only can divide, but hath no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
tendency to diviſion, but ſo much Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpibility
as no Creature can overcome,
this (beſides Scripture) intimateth Gods
purpoſe about it.</p>
                     <p>3. But doubtleſs God and Creatures
are both called Spirits equivocally or ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically
and not univocally: And it is the
vileſt Contradiction to ſay that God is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Diviſion: But whether it be ſo
with created Spirits I know not: They
have paſſivity and God hath none. It's no
great Wiſdom to confeſs ones Ignorance;
But not to confeſs it is very great folly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am ſcarce of your mind, that a</hi> man
may be in the like puzzle in another World
as he was in this, if he methodize not his
Thoughts aright. But if it be ſo, you are
beſt think again.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. For Penetrability you ſay, that <hi>one
Spirit may have a greater Amplitude than
another, and that the parts, as I may ſo
call them, of the ſame Spirit, may in the
Contraction of it ſelf penetrate one another,
ſo that there may be a Reduplication of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
through the whole Spirit. Anſ.</hi> You
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50488:33"/>
tempt me to doubt leſt you talk ſo much
againſt materiality of Spirits to hide the
name of your own Opinion, for that which
others call materiality. If Spirits have
parts which may be extended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
you'l hardly ſo eaſily prove as
ſay, that God cannot divide them. And
when in your Writings ſhall I find ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
into how much ſpace one Spirit
may be extended, and into how little it
may be contracted? And whether the
whole Spirit of the World may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
into a Nut-ſhell, or a Box, and
the Spirit of a Flea may be extended to
the Convexe of all the World.</p>

                     <p>§ 1. IN your further thoughts of this
Sect. 11. you do firſt miſ-ſuppoſe
that my Queſtion intimateth ſuch a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of Souls, as of terrene Bodies into
Atoms, or a contrary Union. Terrene
Atoms have the moſt imperfect Union.
All the Sands on the ſhoar are not only
diviſible, but partly divided: I cannot ſay,
that all the parts of the Air are ſo; much
leſs of the Fire. There is a far cloſer U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the Subſtance of that <hi>Lucid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactive</hi>
Element, than of Earth, Water,
or Air.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. And here I muſt inſert, that after
long thoughts, I doubt not but all things
Created are truly one, and truly many:
No one particle of the Univerſe is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on the reſt: Parts they are; as
every part of a Clock or Watch: Every
Leaf, and Grape, and Apple on the Tree
hath a certain individuate or numerical
Being, and yet every one is a part of the
Tree: And every Herb and Tree is a part
of the Garden or Orchard, and that a part
of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. and all a part of the Earth
in which they grow; and no doubt the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50488:34"/>
Earth is as dependant on other parts of
the Univerſe; and all on God. We dream
of no total ſeparation of any Creature
from the reſt, much leſs Spirits.</p>
                     <p>But all the <hi>Illuminated Air,</hi> is more one
<hi>flamma tenuis</hi> (though compound of <hi>Air</hi>
and <hi>Fire,</hi> and called by us <hi>Light)</hi> than the
Sands are one Earth: And I doubt not but
that Fire, which is the <hi>Motive, Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and <hi>Calefactive</hi> Subſtance, in all the
Air, and elſewhere, is yet much leſs divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
than the Air, and Souls than it: So
that ſhould God make many into one, they
would be many Individuals no more, but
one again Diviſible by God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>§ 3. And you miſ-ſuppoſe me to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that the whole Subſtance of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Souls, are but the ſame which once in
<hi>Adam</hi> was but one, and from him divided.
Writing is a tedious work, becauſe it ſo
hardly cauſeth men to underſtand us. I
ſuppoſe that a continued Creative Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Father of Spirits, giveth out
all that Spiritual Subſtantiality which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
new Souls; but that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that the Generating Souls ſhall firſt
receive this Divine Emanation, and be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
☞ in communicating it to the
<hi>Semen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and ſo to new organical Bodies;
not that the Parents Souls only diſpoſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50488:35"/>
the ſeminal recipient Matter, but are
themſelves partly receptive, and then
active in the communication: It will be a
defective ſimilitude if I ſay, as a Burning-glaſs
by a receptive contraction of the Sun
Beams, is inſtrumental in kindling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
matter: Rather as one Candle
kindleth a thouſand, and yet the ſubſtance
of the Lucid and Calid Being, is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
from the Ignite Air by the means of
that one Candle. (For that it is only <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
a <hi>Motu,</hi> I believe not.)</p>
                     <p>That you have drawn me thus <hi>effutire
quae circa generationem, opinor,</hi> muſt help
you to be patient with my tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And the rather, becauſe to avoid
offending you, I will now paſs by any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Anſwer to your Queries, <hi>Whether</hi>
Adam<hi>'s Soul was a Legion? which elſe was</hi>
Adam<hi>'s Soul? How come they to be Male
and Female? was that number of Souls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded
or contracted? what a change by Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery?
what becomes of the many Souls in the
Chaſt?</hi> and the reſt. I would not by a
particular Anſwer diſgrace your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
or the jocular urgent amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
No doubt Lights are too low Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations;
but the higheſt within the reach
of ſenſe. There was not a Legion of
Candles in that which lighted a Legion:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50488:35"/>
nor need I tell you which of the lighted
Candles was that which lighted it; nor
why lighting more conſumed not the firſt;
nor why it kindled a Wax-Candle, and
a Tallow-Candle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I knew not till now
that you thought Souls differed in Sex,
becauſe the Perſons do. But I will not
ſtrive againſt your Conceit. The Soul of
a Male and Female I better underſtand,

in divers Books againſt it, that I will not
here in <hi>tranſitu</hi> any further touch ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

have ſtudied the old Stoicks, Platoniſts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Patricius, Teleſius, Campanella,

I pitty you for believing him. I doubt
not the Subſtance of Fire hath a <hi>Virtus

And conſequently that <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>Heat</hi> are neither of them without <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
But that they are a tripple operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Vna-trina forma ignea,</hi> I am paſt
doubt, (after as hard ſtudy as you can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe

                     <p>That <hi>Lumen</hi> is <hi>ipſe motus</hi> methinks a

ſay, and think it ſo, as much as <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
is an effect of <hi>mental-Vitality,</hi> and
Volition of Intellection. But (to lay no
ſtreſs on Sir <hi>Ken. Digby</hi>'s Arguments) I
make no doubt <hi>Ignis lucens</hi> is as truly a
Subſtance as a Spirit is. If Light be an
Act or Quality it hath ſome immediate
Agent or Subject: It doth not exiſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from them. It is in the <hi>Air</hi> but as the
Recipient, as it is in the Oil of the Candle.
The Air ſhineth not of itſelf (as the Night

I ſtill tell you that difficulties make me
not lay ſo much on them as you do. To
add one more, As I told you <hi>Quality</hi> is
<hi>penetrable;</hi> as well as Spirit, <hi>e. g.</hi> heat, ſo
yet though we commonly ſay, it is <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi>
I wiſh you would ſolve this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
You prove the locality of Spirits
by their operation on this or that Body,
(And doubtleſs you may well prove that
the Recipient body is <hi>in loco,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Agent relatively.) But how
ſhall we avoid the diviſion of Qualities
or Spirits <hi>ex diviſione materiae ſubjectivae.
E. g.</hi> If a red hot Iron be penetrated by the
heat, yet if this Iron be cut in two, while
hot, and each part ſet <hi>(per potentiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem)</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:50488:38"/>
at 20 Miles diſtance. is not the
heat divided with the Iron? So if a mans
Head be ſtruck off, and (by ſuch a quick
mover as you think moveth the Earth)
the Head in a moment were carried far
off, while both parts of the Body are yet
alive, is not the Soul in each part? And if
the Parts were 20 or 100 Miles a ſunder,
is it ſtill one undivided Soul?</p>
                     <p>I can ſay ſomwhat to ſatisfie my ſelf of
this; but hardly without croſſing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that you ſay.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. Again when my chief diſſent from
you is more againſt your <hi>Confidence</hi> than
your <hi>Verity,</hi> yet you again tell us, that
we <hi>know not bare Eſſences,</hi> but <hi>Eſſential
Attributes.</hi> I tell you I take not theſe to
be notifying Expreſſions: We know ſome
Eſſences either <hi>intuitively</hi> (as <hi>Ockam</hi> ſaith)
or without ſigns, immediately, <hi>e. g.</hi> what
it is to ſee, taſte, hear, ſmell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
what to underſtand and will. And we
know other Eſſences <hi>Scientia abſtractiva
per ſigna.</hi> And what good would the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Attributes elſe do us. Attributes
in <hi>notione prima</hi> are the thing itſelf: And
to know an Eſſential Attribute, and to
know <hi>ipſam Eſſentiam Scientia inadaequata</hi>
is all one. But an Eſſential Attribute as <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
ſecunda,</hi> is but <hi>ſignum per quod res ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficata
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50488:38"/>
cognoſcenda eſt:</hi> And this is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And all is <hi>ſcientia valde imperfectâ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 5. <hi>You ſay, that</hi> Neither the faculty
nor Operation of Reaſoning is the Eſſence,

                     <p>§ 7. As to your Doctrine of Atomes,
I think no wiſe man dare ſay that God
made matter firſt in divided Atomes, and
after ſet them together. But that God is
able to divide all matter into Atomes or
indiviſible parts I doubt not. The <hi>Virtus

conſiſt not of Atomes: But how far God can
divide the ample Subſtance of them, I only
tell you, that I know not; and to pretend to
know it would be none of my Wiſdom.
Your Attributes of amplitude, quantity,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50488:40"/>
dimenſions, imply that God made ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
bigger in amplitude than others, as
well as <hi>Virtutis ſortioris.</hi> You think I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that which you call the <hi>Spirit of the
World,</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> bigger in amplitude
than the Spirit of a Wren.</p>
                     <p>§ 8. <hi>Ad Sect.</hi> 16. You that ſay, <hi>Spirits
have Extenſion and Spiſſitude,</hi> ſay that
<hi>ſpiſſitude ſignifieth more ſubſtance in leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</hi>
And theſe Phraſes ſound liker to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity
than any that I have uſed: More
ſubſtance and leſs ſubſtance, ſpiſſitude by
Contraction ſignifie much change, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that which the Intellect may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
into <hi>partes extra partes,</hi> though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
which would increaſe a mans
doubt, whether God be not able to make
a bigger Spirit leſs, and a leſs bigger, and
to ſeparate the parts that are ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable
in amplitude, and to make one
into two, or two into one.</p>
                     <p>§ 9. Whether <hi>Aether</hi> or Fire be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
methinks you ſhould be as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

that is the neareſt cauſe of Illumination by

this of Fire? Is any thing annihilated

not an inviſible active principle moving

Anſ.</hi> When I am ignorant of my
own Ignorance, I will hear you, I am far
from dreaming that I have one formal
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50488:44"/>
Conception of God, but only Analogical:
Only that of <hi>Ens</hi> is diſputed between
the Thomiſts and Scotiſts, whether it
be Univocal <hi>de Deo &amp; Creaturis.</hi> And
here <hi>Analogical</hi> is but <hi>Metaphorical:</hi> And
yet it is not nothing to ſee as in a Glaſs &amp;
enigmatically. And when I can perceive
that your two hard words do not only ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
more than negatively and modally,
or qualitatively, but alſo give us an <hi>Idea</hi>

Even who before twice told us that
we know not the intimate eſſence of
things, but the Attributes? Indeed I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Attributes are ſuch as will not
notifie Eſſences. I ask my own experience
whether <hi>Indiſcerpible</hi> is a word that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
any <hi>Idea</hi> of the Eſſence, ſave negative

The common note of Matter is, that it
hath <hi>partes extra partes:</hi> and I think you
thus make Spirits material. You make
them parts of the compound Animal: and
you deny them to be <hi>toti in toto;</hi> and you
give them locality, &amp; amplitude, &amp; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.
And if ſo, though they be indiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pible,
they have continued parts intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;
and that part of the Soul is not in
one hand which is in the other: and as
<hi>partes Animalis</hi> they are actually ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the matter. The <hi>Spiritus Mundi</hi>
you ſuppoſe to be a great continued am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude
or extended Subſtance. And A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
are in ſome Elements a cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Subſtance. You ſeem to make all
Subſtance to be Atomes, ſpiritual atomes
and material atomes. And I am not ſure
that God cannot make material atomes
ſo continued a matter as that no Creature
can diſcerp them: is it any contradiction?
and I doubt not but Souls and Angels are
ſo indiviſible, as that their Nature tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to continued, undivided Unity, and no
Creature can divide them. But that God
cannot do it I cannot ſay.</p>
                     <p>Even of the Souls Mortality not only
<hi>Arnobius,</hi> but many other Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

ſpoken but well meant: that is, God
hath made their Natures ſuch as have no
tendency in themſelves to a Diſſolution or
Deſtruction, but not ſuch as he cannot
diſſolve or deſtroy; Yea I doubt not but
without a continued Divine Suſtentation,
all the World would in a moment be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated;
Preſervation being a continued

cannot be; and it is not for want of power
that God cannot do it: It is no work of
power: Had you proved it a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for God, to make two Spirits of
one, or one of two, you had done that
part in an eaſier way, which I ſhould not
gainſay. But this Speech of yours is as if
you ſaid, <hi>[He denieth God to be the Creator,
or to be God, who ſaith that God is able to
divide an Ample ſpiritual Subſtance; that
is, who ſaith, that this is no contradiction,
and that God is Almighty: when our Creed

or annihilate his own works: Before he
made the World, he could have made the

able ſo to change it? If Spirits be unified
as the Bodies which they animate, cannot
God make many Bodies into one? Cannot
he make many Stars into one? And then
would that one have many unifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,

                     <p>§ 1. YOU ſay your <hi>definition is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
than defining a Spirit by
Fire,</hi> viz. <hi>[a Spirit is an immaterial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
indued with Life, and the faculty of
Motion]</hi> and <hi>virtually containing in it
Penetrability,</hi> and <hi>Indiſcerpibility] Anſ.</hi> 1.
Your definition is common, good and true,
allowing for its little imperfections, and
the common imperfection of mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Spirits. The ſame things need
not be ſo very oft repeated in anſwer to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50488:47"/>
you: but briefly I ſay; if by <hi>Immaterial</hi>
you mean not <hi>[without ſubſtance]</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
truth: but a negation ſpeaketh not
a formal eſſence. 2. <hi>Spirit</hi> is itſelf but a
Metaphor. 3. <hi>Intrinſecal, indued with Life,</hi>
tells us not that it is the form: Qualities
and proper accidents are intrinſecal. 4. The
<hi>[faculty</hi> of <hi>motion]</hi> is either a tautology
included <hi>in life,</hi> or elſe if explicatory of
<hi>life,</hi> it is defective; or if it diſtribute
Spirits into two ſorts, <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>motive,</hi> it
ſhould not be in the common definition.
5. No Man can underſtand that the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>[Immaterial]</hi> by the terms, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Penetrability and Indiſcerpibility.
6 You do not ſay here that they are the
form, but elſewhere you do: and the
form ſhould be expreſt, and not only <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
contained</hi> as you ſpeak. 7. They are
not the form, but the <hi>Diſpoſitio vel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio
ad formam.</hi> 8. If ſuch modalities or
<hi>conſiſtence</hi> were the <hi>form,</hi> more ſuch ſhould
be added which are left out. 9. <hi>Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
and <hi>Indiſcerpibility</hi> are two notions,
and you ſhould not give us a compound
form. 10. Yea you compound them with
a quite different notion, <hi>[Life</hi> and <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of motion:]</hi> which is truly the form,
and is one thing, and not compounded of
notions ſo different, as <hi>Conſiſtence</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50488:48"/>

iſſues from this immaterial ſubſtance:</hi>
But the form is concreated with it, and
iſſues not from it.</p>
                     <p>You mean well: It is informing truth
which you intend, and offer to the world.
And we are all greatly beholden to you
for ſo induſtrious calling fooliſh ſenſualiſts
to the ſtudy and notion of inviſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
without which what a Carkaſs or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
were the world. But all our concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
here muſt have their allowances,
and we muſt confeſs their weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>And you might have informed us of all
that you know, without fathering opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on others, which they never owned,
and then nicknaming them from your
own fiction: As if we ſaid that Souls are
fire, and alſo took fire as you do for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
and hot Irons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>§ 2. Now I that pretend not to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
definition repeat that which is the
neareſt to it that I underſtand.</p>
                     <p>And firſt I am for agreeing on the ſenſe
of words before we uſe them in definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>1. I take not the word <hi>[Spirit]</hi> to be
of <hi>univocal</hi> ſignification here, but ſo ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
as to be equivocal. God and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not univocally called <hi>[Spirits.]</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50488:48"/>
2. I know not (and I think no other)
that all Created <hi>Spirits</hi> in the univerſe are
ſo far of one ſubſtantial conſiſtence as that
the word <hi>[Spirit]</hi> univocally fits them
all, as a <hi>Genus</hi> among the 15 ſenſes of the
word before ſaid mentioned by <hi>Martinius;</hi>
when we confine it to one, men are apt
to boggle at the ambiguity: yet when we
have defined it, the name is to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Materia</hi> is as ambiguous as <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;</hi>
and is oft uſed for <hi>Res</hi> or <hi>Subſtantia,</hi>
which is fundamental to modes and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and active forms: and oft for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of ſuch a conſiſtence as is ſenſible
(to the higheſt ſenſes) and as a mind in the
fleſh can have an Idea of in its conſiſtence;
and if you will, ſuch as you call Impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
and Diſcerpible.</p>
                     <p>4. The word <hi>[ſubſtance]</hi> itſelf, if uſed
only to ſignifie, either <hi>Quoddity</hi> and not
<hi>Quiddity;</hi> (as <hi>Ens</hi> for <hi>Quod eſt,</hi> and not

<hi>Quod ſubſtat accidentibus;</hi> or <hi>negatively</hi> for
<hi>Quod non eſt accidens; ſed aliquid ſubſiſtens

                     <p>5. <hi>Forma</hi> being oft taken for <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae

corporeal parts making it receptive of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and oft for the union of the moving
and the moved parts, and oft for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
principle in a compound, and oft for
the Motive or Active Virtue in a ſimple
ſubſtance, but ever ſtrictly for the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
conſtitutive cauſe, <hi>per quam res eſt id
quod eſt;</hi> I take it to be but improperly
and equivocally applied to the meer Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
conſiſtence preſuppoſed to the form.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things ſuppoſed. I preſume not
to give a definition of God, but ſuch a
deſcription as we can reach.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing the word <hi>[Nature]</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
in general [Quoddity and Quiddity]
I firſt diſtinguiſh <hi>[Nature]</hi> into <hi>Active</hi>
and <hi>Paſſive:</hi> By <hi>Active</hi> I mean that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which hath a formal Power, Virtue,
and Inclination to Activity. By <hi>Paſſive</hi> I
mean that <hi>Nature</hi> which having no ſuch
Active form, is formed to receive the
Influx of the Active.</p>
                     <p>I refuſe not to call the firſt <hi>Spirit:</hi> but
becauſe they ſo greatly differ, I chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the common name of <hi>Active Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
being not metaphorical.</p>
                     <p>2. I ſuppoſe there is no ſuch thing as
<hi>Spirit</hi> (or <hi>Active Nature)</hi> which is not
ſome <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Spirit:</hi> Therefore I give
no definition of [Spirit] or <hi>Active Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nature</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50488:49"/>
in general, for where there is no
<hi>form</hi> and no <hi>ſpecies</hi> there is no proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.
And all Spirit being actually <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
Senſitive</hi> or <hi>Vegetative,</hi> and every thing
having but one univocal <hi>form,</hi> I name no
form but of each ſpecies, but as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore defining only the ſpecies, I

ſome do <hi>forma diſpoſitiva,</hi> I quarrel not:
But I uſe <hi>[Puriſſima]</hi> 1. to avoid many
words, and 2. To avoid pretending to
more diſtinct conceptions of ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies
than I find any idea of in my
mind.</p>
                     <p>I uſe but the Comparative degree of

in both <hi>conſiſtency</hi> and virtue in theſe

                     <p>I define the <hi>Vegetative Nature,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it to be <hi>ipſe Ignis,</hi> to be <hi>[ſubſtantia

profeſs my ſelf in this alſo uncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Natura Vegetativa</hi> and <hi>Ignea</hi> be all
one: or whether <hi>Ignis</hi> be <hi>Natura organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
by which the three ſuperior operate
on the Paſſive. But I incline moſt to think
that they are all one; when I ſee what a
Glorious Fire the Sun is, and what ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it hath on Earth, and how unlikely
it is that ſo glorious a ſubſtance, ſhould
not have as noble a formal Nature as a
plant. And I take all the ſuperior Virtues
to be the inferior, <hi>eminenter,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to have analogy to the ſuperiour.</p>
                     <p>Your frequent repetitions draw me to
this repetition. If we agree in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
I will not contend about any name.</p>
                     <p>And I confeſs if you could prove that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50488:50"/>
Indiviſibility is proper to any ſpecies, then
it would be a contradiction for it to be
that <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and yet to be <hi>diviſible,</hi> and ſo
it would be no act of Omnipotency to do
it. But as in Materials, ſo as far as I can
conceive in Spirituals, to make two into
one is no change of the Nature of the
things, nor to make one into two. This
belongs to Individuation, and not to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification.</p>
                     <p>Who can doubt but God being <hi>all in
all things,</hi> he is as intimate to us as our
Souls to our bodies, and more: And tho
the Schools commonly ſay, that God <hi>hath
no Accidents,</hi> pardon my diſſent who doubt
not he hath the accidents of Relations,
and dare not ſay that all the world is not
<hi>Dei Accidens,</hi> while in him we live, and
move, and have our being: for I will not,
and I do not think that it is <hi>Pars Dei,</hi> as
if he were but <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> and yet I
will not ſay that the world hath no entity
or ſubſtance; nor yet that the entity of
God and the world, is more than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
(or ſubſtance) of God alone; for
to be <hi>Minor</hi> or <hi>Pars</hi> is below God. But
Accidents though no parts are <hi>ſubſtantiae
accidentia.</hi> And though I think the Fryar
<hi>(Benedictus de Benedictis) in Regula Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionis</hi>
ſpeaketh fanatically when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50488:51"/>
it to be perfection to ſuppoſe we
ſee and know no being but God; yet we
muſt know nothing quite ſeparate from
God, and that hath not ſome dependent
union with him. And yet while all things
are in God, and ſo inſeparable from him
that nothing but annihilation can totally
ſeparate them, yet they are multitudes in
themſelves, and wicked Men and Devils
are ſeparated from the influx of his Grace
and Glory. And the human nature of
Chriſt hath ſome nearer union with God
than other Creatures have. And ſo I doubt
not but every Creature is ſo united to the
univerſe, that nothing but annihilation
can totally ſeparate it from the reſt; and
yet this is conſiſtent with individuation.
I remember when I told him whom you
ſo oft mention of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words <hi>de
Anima,</hi> in which he ſeemeth to favour
the ſaying that <hi>[All Souls are one,</hi> and yet
<hi>many]</hi> rather than that <hi>[All Souls are one
and not many]</hi> or <hi>[many and not one]</hi> he
ſeemed much taken with it: all which I
mention to infer that there is a <hi>ſeparabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(from God and the univerſe) which is
no way poſſible but by annihilation; and
in compounds ſome ſeparation of parts
will change the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> and if it were
proveable which <hi>Aquinas</hi> holds, that no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50488:51"/>
two Angels are not of diſtinct <hi>Species,</hi> then
every alteration of the individual might
alter the <hi>Species;</hi> but yet it wo'd be a Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And I have long thought that ſo much
ſelfiſhneſs as is our ſin or imperfection, is a
potent cauſe of making all men more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of Individuation and fearful of loſing
it by Union of Spirits than they ought; and
that holy Souls will be nearlier one with
Chriſt and one another than we can here
deſire or conceive; and yet Individuation
<hi>ſecundum quid</hi> at leaſt, ſhall be continued.
But yet I ſay, while there is <hi>numerus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum,</hi>
and it is uncertain whether alſo
each Orb hath not one, and you plead for
Amplitude, and Minority, (Quantity) and
the Bodies animated may as vaſtly differ
as a Flea, or a Wren, or a Pigmy, and the
Sun, it is quite above my reach to know
that a change of Individuals, by making
one many, or many one, is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>And as to Penetrability I repeat, that
ſeeing by <hi>Penetration</hi> I ſuppoſe you mean
not piercing <hi>inter partes,</hi> but poſſeſſing the
ſame place with other things, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of itſelf, into leſs amplitude, as I
know not how a thing that hath no parts
(and that <hi>extra partes)</hi> can contract itſelf
into leſs ſpace, (which is to contract parts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50488:52"/>
that are no parts) ſo I cannot ſee but ſuch
Contraction and Colocality muſt needs be
limited, ſo as that all the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deſerted and mortified by all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
Contraction to one narrow ſpace; nor
yet that at once every Spirit is every
where; and when the Contraction and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locality
is come to the narroweſt poſſible,
in that ſtate Spirits muſt needs be further
impenetrable, that is, no more can be in
that ſpace.</p>
                     <p>So that while I am paſt doubt, that God
hath made Spirits of no kind of parts but
what do naturally abhor ſeparation, and
ſo are inſeparable, unleſs God will ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them, and ſo there is no fear of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Individuation much leſs the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Souls; I there ſtop and will put no
more into my definitions of Souls or Spirits
than I know, at leaſt as ſtrongly probable,
much leſs by laying the formal Eſſence on
a Compoſition of hard &amp; doubtful words,
tempt all to believe tkat the very Being
of Spirits is as doubtful as thoſe words are.</p>

Spirits: And if ſo, I am paſt doubt that
the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of Spirits are not

                     <p>Too many Logicians have hitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

which rayes out a luminous Orb according to the
known Principles of Optiques: This Orb of Light
doth very much reſemble the Nature of a Spirit,
which is diffuſed and extended, and yet indiviſible:
For wee'l ſuppoſe in this Spirit the Center of Life
to be indiviſible, and yet to diffuſe itſelf by a kind of
circumſcribed Omnipotency, as the point of Light
is diſcernible in every point of the luminous Sphere.
And yet ſuppoſing that central lucid point indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
there is nothing diviſible in all that Sphere of
Light. For it is ridiculous to think of any Engine
or Art whatſoever to ſeparate the luminous Raies
from the ſhining Center, and keep them apart by
themſelves, as any man will acknowledge that does
but conſider the thing we ſpeak of. Now there is no
difficulty to imagine ſuch an Orb as this, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
as well as a Quality. And indeed this Sphere of
Light itſelf, it not inhering in any Subject in the
place it occupieth, looks far more like a Subſtance
than any Accident. And what we fanry unadviſedly
to befal Light and Colours, that any point of them
will thus ray orbicularly, is more rationally to be
admitted in ſpiritual Subſtances, whoſe central Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſpreads out into a ſecondary Subſtance, as the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50488:55"/>
luminous Rays are conceived to ſhoot out from a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
point. From whence we are enabled to return
an Anſwer to the greateſt difficulty in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That the conceived parts in a
Spirit have an inſeparable dependance on the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Eſſence, from which they flow, and in which
they are radically contained; and therefore though
there be an extenſion of this whole ſubſtantial
power, yet one part is not ſeparable or diſcerpible
from another, but the entire Subſtance, as well
ſecondary as primary, or central, is indiviſible.
But let us again caſt our Eyes on this lucid point
and radiant Orb we have made uſe of: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
that thoſe Raies that are hindered from
ſhooting out ſo far as they would, need not loſe their
Virtue or Being, but only be reflected back toward
their ſhining Center; and the Obſtacle being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
they may ſhoot out to their full length again:
ſo that there is no Generation of a new Ray.—</p>

that imagination create not new troubles to her
ſelf, I mean not ſuch an Indiviſibility as is fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
in a Mathematical point, but as we conceive
in a Sphere of Light made from one lucid point or
radiant Center. For that Sphere or Orb of Light,
though it be in ſome ſenſe extended, yet it is truly
indiviſible, ſuppoſing the Center ſuch. For there
is no means imaginable to diſcerpe or ſeparate any
one Ray of this Orb, and keep it apart by itſelf
disjoined from the Center.</p>
                     <p>Now a little to invert the Property of this lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Orb, when we would apply it to a Soul or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
As there can be no alteration in the radiant
Center, but therewith it is neceſſarily in every part
of the Orb, ſo there is alſo that Vnity and Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of the exterior parts, if I may ſo call them,
of a Spirit or Soul, with their inmoſt Center,
that if any of them be affected, the Center of Life
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50488:55"/>
is thereby alſo neceſſarily affected, and theſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
parts of the Soul being affected by the parts
of the Object with ſuch Circumſtances as they are
in, the inward Center receives all ſo circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
that it hath neceſſarily the entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confuſed
Images of things without, though they be
contrived into ſo ſmall a compaſs, and are in the
very Center of this ſpiritual ſubſtance. This Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical

                     <p>Here is the ſame and more than I have ſaid,

of offering ſo near to a corporeal Emanation from

                        <hi>Let us hear your ſelf,</hi> p. 359. [To prevent all
ſuch Cavils we ſhall omit the Spinoſities of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion

conclude briefly thus: That the manifold Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions

of matter, to be able to either think or ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to move itſelf, do well aſſure us that theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
belong not to it, but to ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
Wherefore we finding thoſe operations in
us, it is manifeſt that we have in us an immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Being really diſtinct from the Body, which we
ordinarily call a Soul: The ſpeculation of whoſe
bare Eſſence, though it may well puzzle us, yet
thoſe properties that we find incompetible to a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
do <hi>ſufficiently</hi> inform us of the different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thereof: for it is plain ſhe is a Subſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the power of Cogitation, that is, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and thinking of Objects, as alſo of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
and ſpontaneouſly moving of a Body;
which properties are as immediate to her as impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability
and ſeparability of parts to the matter,
and we are not to demand the cauſe of the one any
more than of the other.]</p>
                     <p>So here we have the true Form as ſufficient
notice.</p>
                     <p>And if voluntary <hi>Motion</hi> be proper to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
I think meer Fire (Solar or Aethereal) is
no Spirit; But if all <hi>ſelf-moving Power</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

(By Eſſence meaning ſomwhat elſe than that
which I can fully prove to be the Form.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, there are theſe different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
before us.</p>
                     <p>I. That the whole Entity or <hi>Conceptus realis</hi>

                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50488:56"/>
or rather <hi>ſimplex actus Entitativus;</hi> and that
<hi>ſubſtantia</hi> is added not as a partial real <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
but as <hi>reſpective,</hi> to notifie that this <hi>Virtus
vitalis</hi> is no Accident, but a thing that may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of itſelf. Some hold this true only of God,
and ſome of all Spirits: If this be true, your
notions of Penetrability and Indiviſibility are
moſt eaſily defended.</p>
                     <p>II. That Spirits have two inadequate,
real <hi>Conceptus,</hi> and that <hi>Subſtantia</hi> is the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
as truly as materia is in meer Bodies,
and an incomprehenſible <hi>purity</hi> of Subſtance
(or that it is <hi>Immaterial,</hi> not having <hi>partes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
partes</hi> with the <hi>trine dimenſion)</hi> is <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae
diſpoſitio;</hi> (yet that this hath degrees as
the Forms have, all Spirits not being of equal
<hi>Purity;)</hi> And that <hi>Virtus vitalis</hi> is the partial
<hi>Conceptus,</hi> viz. <hi>Formalis.</hi> And this I encline
to, as to created Spirits.</p>
                     <p>III. That the <hi>Conceptus formalis</hi> of Spirit is
this <hi>Virtus vitalis, vel motiva, perceptiva, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiva,</hi>
but that all <hi>Matter</hi> is eſſentially inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that Vitality, and ſo Matter and Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
are the inadequate <hi>Conceptus</hi> of every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and that not by Compoſition, but as
of one ſimple thing. And this is Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi>'s
and ſome others.</p>
                     <p>IV. That a Spirit is both a real <hi>Subſtance,</hi>
(as the fundamental <hi>Conceptus)</hi> and informed
both by <hi>Immateriality, Penetrability,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerpibility,</hi>
and alſo by a vital and moving
<hi>Power:</hi> But that it exiſteth only in Bodies
or Matter, and ſo always makes up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of <hi>two Subſtances,</hi> (ſaving that God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
beyond all Matter.) And that all ſuch
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50488:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Spirits were at firſt made together indiviſible
Individuals, both that of the leaſt Creature
and of the greateſt, but changed from Body to
Body, and ſo are parts of Animals. This I
ſuppoſe is your Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Our chief difference is, that I profeſs to be
ignorant of the <hi>Conſiſtency</hi> and <hi>Incorporation</hi>
which you talk of, and muſt be ſo: Though I
am aſſured of the <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi>
which ſatisfieth me; for Chriſt knoweth all
the reſt for me.</p>

                  <head>The PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. THE Author of the Letter
which I anſwer, being wholly
unknown to me, and making
me no return of his ſenſe of my
Anſwer, I ſuppoſe it can be no wrong to him
that I publiſh it. I have formerly thought,
that it is ſafer to keep ſuch Objections, and
falſe reaſonings, from mens notice, than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to confute them. But now in <hi>London</hi>
they are ſo commonly known, and publiſhed in
open Diſcourſe and Writing, that whether ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them be deſirable or not, it is become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.
And tho I have ſaid ſo much more, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
in two Books <hi>(The Reaſons of the
Chriſtian Religion, and the Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Infidelity)</hi> as may make this needleſs
to them that read thoſe; yet moſt <hi>Infidels</hi> and
<hi>Sadduces</hi> being ſo ſelf conceited, and fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
as to diſdain, or caſt by all that will coſt
them long reading and conſideration, it may be
this ſhort Letter may ſo far prevail againſt
their ſloth, as to invite them to read more. I
would true Chriſtianity were as common as the
profeſſion of it: There would then be fewer
that need ſuch Diſcourſes. But alas! how
numerous are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe Chriſtians that are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
no more than a Carcaſs or a Picture
is a man; yea, worſe Chriſtians, who hate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
whoſe Godfathers and Godmothers
<pb facs="tcp:50488:59"/>
(not Parents, but Neighbours) <hi>did promiſe
and vow three things in their Names. 1. That
they ſhould renounce the Devil. and all his
Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this
wicked World, and all the ſinful luſts of
the fleſh. 2. That they ſhould believe all
the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. 3. That
they ſhould keep Gods holy Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and walk in the ſame all the
days of their lives.</hi> Yea, before they could
ſpeak, the mouth of theſe Godfathers ſpeaking
for them, did not only <hi>promiſe,</hi> that they
<hi>ſhould</hi> believe, but <hi>profeſs in the Infants
name,</hi> That even then <hi>they did ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> The
Infant is ſaid to make both <hi>the Promiſe and
Profeſſion by</hi> theſe Godfathers; who alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<hi>to provide,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall [learn
all things which a Chriſtian ought to know
and believe to his Souls health, and ſhall
be virtuouſly brought up, to lead a godly
and a Chriſtian life].</hi> Whether theſe Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ever intend to perform this, or the Parents
uſe to expect it of them, I need not tell you:
But how little moſt of the baptized perform of
it, is too notorious. And what wonder is it, if
we have Chriſtians that in Satans Image fight
againſt Chriſt, even PERJURED, MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGNANT,
PERSECUTING Chriſtians,
haters of thoſe that ſeriouſly practice the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal
Vow, when they are PERJURED and
<pb facs="tcp:50488:59"/>
Perfidious Violaters of it themſelves, as to the
prevalent bent of heart and life.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Hypocrite nominal Ceremony Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
become the great hinderance of the cure of
Infidelity in the world. It is the SPIRIT by its <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Works,</hi> which is the great <hi>Witneſs</hi>
of Chriſt, and the infallible proof of ſupernatural
Revelation. Theſe witneſſing works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
are theſe five: 1. His <hi>Antecedent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</hi>
2. His <hi>inherent Divine impreſs</hi> on
the <hi>Perſon, Works,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
3. His <hi>concomitant Teſtimony</hi> in Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled
numerous Miracles, Reſurrection and
Aſcenſion. 4. His ſubſequent Teſtimony in the
numerous uncontrolled Miracles of the Apoſtles,
and ſupernatural gifts to the Chriſtians of that
Age. But tho the Hiſtory of theſe be as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
delivered to us, as any in the world; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the diſtance hindereth the belief of ſome, who
have not this hiſtory well opened to them. 5.
Therefore God hath continued to the end of
the world a more excellent Teſtimony than
miracles (thought not ſo apt to work on ſenſe)
even the ſpecial regenerating ſanctifying work
of the Spirit of Chriſt, on the ſouls of all ſincere
Believers: The raiſing of Souls to a Divine and
Heavenly Diſpoſition, and Converſation, to live
to God and the common good, in the comfortable
hopes of an everlaſting heavenly glory, as purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and given by our Redeemer, conquering the
allurements of the world and fleſh, the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:50488:60"/>
of Satan, and all the flatteries and frowns
of the ungodly; This is a work that none but
God can do and will do, which beareth his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and ſuperſcription.</p>
                  <p>But now theſe Hypocrites, obſcure it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and other unbelievers, and tempt men to
ſay, <hi>Are not Chriſtans as bad as Heathens?
and Mahometans.</hi> Are they not as fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and worldly, and <hi>falſe,</hi> and <hi>perjured,</hi> and
<hi>malicious,</hi> and <hi>hurtful,</hi> and <hi>pernicious</hi> to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
and <hi>themſelves?</hi> But I anſwer, No, They
are not: Theſe are no more Chriſtians, than
Images are men: They are the Enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that under Chriſts banner, and in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and name, do the moſt perfideouſly hate
him and fight againſt him: Who will tell them,
<hi>Inaſmuch as you did it to the leaſt of theſe,
you did it to me.</hi> They betray him for money,

any Infidel to find me One that ſeriouſly
believeth the Goſpel of Chriſt, as perceiving the
certain Evidence of its truth, who is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a holy and obedient heavenly life: How
can a man ſincerely believe that God ſent his Son
from Heaven in fleſh, to Redeem man, and to
bring us to Glory, and that he ſealed his Doctrine
by all his miracles, reſurrection and aſcenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Holy Ghoſt, and that he is our Head in
Heaven, with whom we ſhall live in joy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and is the Author of eternal Salvation
to all them that obey him, I ſay: How can a man
<pb facs="tcp:50488:60"/>
believe this ſeriouſly, and not eſteem, and chooſe and
ſeek it, before all the ſhadows and vanitie to this
world. It is not Chriſtians, but falſe hypocrites,
whoſe lives repreſent Chriſtianity, blaſphemouſly
as no better than Heatheniſm or Mahometaniſm;
It is but for worldly Intereſt, and Reputation, or
becauſe it is the Religion of the King, Countrey, or
Anceſtors, that they take up ſo much as the name
and badg of Chriſtianity. And will you judg of
our Religion by its enemies? Do you not ſee in their
drunkenneſs, ſenſuality, covetouſneſs, ungodlineſs,
how unlike their lives are to the baptiſmal Vow;
and that they hate, and ſeek to deſtroy them that
are ſerious in keeping that Vow, and living as
Chriſtians?</p>
                  <p>§ 2. And as I publiſh this for the uſe of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
ſo I muſt let the Reader know, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one of the uſual tricks of the Popiſh decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
to put on the Vizor of an <hi>Infidel,</hi> and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about the immortality of the Soul, and the
greateſt difficulties of Religion: And it is to puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
men, and convince them, that by Reaſoning
they can never attain to ſatisfaction in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
And then to infer, <q>[You have no way left,
but to believe the Church; &amp; we are that Church.
If you leave that eaſie quiet way, you will never
come to any certainty].</q> Why do they not try the
ſame triek about all the difficulties in Philoſophy,
Astronomy, Phyſick, Hiſtory, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> For every S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Art, hath its difficulties. But are not all
theſe as gaeat difficulties to the Pope and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
<pb facs="tcp:50488:61"/>
as they are to us? But God hath given us a
more clear and ſatisfactory way of the ſolution
of ſuch Doubts.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. I muſt further give notice to the Reader,
That it was the publiſhing of Dr. <hi>H. More</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a Letter of mine, which occaſioned the
publiſhing of this. When I was put on the one, I
thought it not unprofitable to premiſe the other,
as being of much greater uſe. It ſeemed good to
the worthy Dr. to deſire my thoughts of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of a Spirit, which he laid down in the
firſt Edition of Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi> of Apparitions:
which I gave him in a haſty Letter, which he
thought meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without my knowledg, to publiſh
an anſwer to, in his ſecond Edition of Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile.</hi>
Our difference is ſcarce worth the Readers
notice. And our velitation is only friendly, and
Philoſophical. But yet it may poſſibly be uſeful to
ſome at leaſt to excite them to a more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſearch than I have made. And it explaineth
ſome paſſages in my <hi>Methodus Theologiae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I much more commend to the reading of
the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> the Hiſtories them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of Apparitiins, and Watchcrafts, which
Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi> and Dr. <hi>More</hi> have there delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
many of them, at leaſt, with undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and proof. To which, if he will but add the
Devil of <hi>Maſcon</hi> and <hi>Bodin,</hi> and Remigius of
Witches; he will ſcarce be able to deny belief to
the existence and Individuation of Spirits, and
the future life of ſeparated Souls.</p>

                  <p>I have had many Diſputes with my ſelf,
whether or no I ſhould ſtifle theſe Doubts,
or ſeek Satisfaction. Shame to own ſuch
Principles bid me do the firſt; but the
weight of the Concern obliged me to the
laſt. For I could not with any chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
or with that vigor I thought
did become me, purſue thoſe unſeen Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
thoſe Objects of Faith Religion
holds forth, except I did really believe their

them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50488:62"/>
I thought at firſt to ſatisfie my ſelf in
the certainty of the things I did believe;
to confirm and eſtabliſh my Faith by theſe
Studies, that I might be able to render a
Reaſon of the hope that is in me: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of building up, I am ſhaken; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a clearer evidence, I am inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with uncertainties.</p>
                  <p>Unhappy that I am! I had better have
taken all upon Truſt, could I ſo have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
my Reaſon, than thus to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
my ſelf in an endleſs Study. For
ſuch I am afraid it will prove without help:
for that I may not in this Concern reſt
without ſatisfaction; and yet the more I
conſider, and weigh things, the more are
my doubts multiplied. I call them only
doubts, not to palliate any opinions; for
I have not yet eſpouſed any; but becauſe
they have not yet attained ſo much matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or ſtrength, as to take me off thoſe
things, my doubts being ſatisfied, I ſhould
conclude of indiſpenſable neceſſity; they
are but yet in the Womb: aſſiſt to make
them Abortives.</p>
                  <p>I have not been wanting to my ſelf, but
in the uſe of all means to me known,
have ſought ſatisfaction, both by Prayer,
Reading, and Meditation. I have weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſulted things according to my

Capacity. I have been as faithful to my ſelf
in all my reaſonings, as I could, and void
of prejudice, have paſſed impartial Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
on the things in debate, ſo far as that
light I have would enable me; and what
to do more, I know not, except this courſe
I now take, prove effectual, you inclining
to aſſiſt me, that I know have ſtudied theſe
things.</p>
                  <p>My requeſt to you therefore is, If your
more publick Studies will permit you,
That you would condeſcend to ſatisfie me
in the Particulars I ſhall mention. I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, I have no other deſign, but to
know the Truth: which in things of ſuch
moment, certainly cannot be difficult, tho
to my unfurniſhed Head they have proved
ſo: I hope my ſhaking may prove my eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</p>
                  <p>That I may therefore put you to as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
trouble as I can, I will firſt tell you
what I do believe, and then what I ſtick
at.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, therefore, I do really believe, and
am very well ſatisfied, That there is a God,
or a firſt Cauſe that hath created all things,
and given to every thing its Being. For I
am not acquainted with any independent
Being. I know not any thing that is able
to ſubſiſt without the Contribution of its

Fellow-Creatures. I am conſcio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to my
ſelf, when ſickneſs invades me, and death
ſummons my Compound to a diſſolution,
I can do nothing to the preſervation of the
Being I enjoy. And if I cannot preſerve
my ſelf as I am, much leſs could I make
my ſelf what I am: For when I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I could do nothing. And Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Senſe tells me, As it is with me,
ſo it is with others; as there is none can
preſerve their Beings, ſo there is none
could acquire to themſelves the Being they
have; and if none, then not the firſt
man. And indeed that was it I enquired
after, from whence every <hi>ſpecies</hi> had at
firſt their Beings; the way, how, and
means by which they are continued. I
know not any Cauſe of the Being of any
thing, of which again I may not enquire
the Cauſe: and ſo from Cauſe to Cauſe,
till through a multitude of Cauſes, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
arrive at the firſt Cauſe of all
Cauſes, a Being wholly uncauſed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cauſe, except what it was unto it
ſelf.</p>
                  <p>My next Enquiry was into my ſelf; and
my next buſineſs, to find what Concern I
have with my Creator: which I knew no
better way to attain, than by ſearching
the bounds of humane Capacity. For I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50488:63"/>
concluded it reaſonable to judg thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
I was capable of in my Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I was deſigned for. Now if man is
nothing more than what is viſible, or may
be made ſo by Anatomy or Pharmacy, he
is no Subject capable of enjoying, or loving
God, nor conſequently of a life of Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
                  <p>In this Enquiry I found Man conſiſted
of ſomething viſible and inviſible; the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
which is viſible, and ſomething elſe
that inviſibly actuates the ſame. For I
have ſeen the Body, the viſible part of
man; when the inviſible, either through
indiſpoſition of its Orgains, or its ſelf, or
being expelled its Manſion, hath ceaſed to
act (I ſpeak as one in doubt): the Body
hath been left to outward appearance the
ſame; it was yet really void of Senſe, and
wholly debilitated of all power to act:
But then what this inviſible is, what to
conclude of it, I know not: Here I am at
a ſtand, and in a Labyrinth, without a
Clue: For I find no help any where. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have, I acknowledg, defended the
Souls Immortality; but none have proved
the exiſtence of ſuch a Being, and a life
of Retrobution,<note place="margin">Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

but none have proved a Subject
capable of it. I know all our Superior
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50488:64"/>
Faculties and Actings, are uſually attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Soul; but what it is in man
they call ſo, they tell us not. To ſay it is
that by which I reaſon, or that now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
to me what I write, is not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
For I look for a definition, and
ſuch an one, as may not to ought elſe be
appropriated. Is it therefore a real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
really different from the Body, and
able to be without it? or is it not? If not,
whatever it be, I matter not. If it be, is
it a pure Spirit, or meerly material? If
meerly material, and different only from
the Body gradually, and in ſome few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of ſubtilty, it is then a queſtion,
whether or not that we call Death, and
ſuppoſe a ſeparation of the Compound,
be not rather a Concentration of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Principle in its own Body, which
through ſome indiſpoſition of the whole,
or ſtoppage in its Orgains, through groſs
Corporeity, hath ſuffocated its actings. If
it be a pure Spirit, I would then know,
what is meant by <hi>Spirit?</hi> and whether or
no all things inviſible, and imperceptable
to Senſe, are accounted ſuch? If ſo, it is
then only a term to diſtinguiſh between
things evident to Senſe, and things not.
If otherwiſe, how ſhall I diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the higheſt degree of material, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50488:64"/>
the loweſt degree of ſpiritual Beings, or
know how they are diverſified, or be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Being of the Soul is rightly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated.
For to me, an immaterial and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Being, ſeems but a kind of <hi>Hocus,</hi>
and a Subſtance ſtript of all materiality,
a ſubſtantial nothing. For all things at
firſt had their Origine from the deep dark
Waters: witneſs <hi>Moſes Philoſophy,</hi> in the
<hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> on which the Spirit of God
is ſaid to move. I am far from believing
thoſe Waters ſuch as that Element we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make uſe of; but that they were mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
appears by thoſe multitudes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Productions they brought forth.
And if thoſe Waters were material, ſuch
were all things they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d produce, among
which was Man, of whom the Text aſſerts
nothing more plain; for it ſaith, <hi>God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man of the duſt of the earth;</hi> the moſt
groſs part and ſedement of thoſe Waters,
after all things elſe were created. Now
the Body only is not Man; for Man is a
living Creature: it is that therefore by
which the Body lives and acts, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
the Man. Now the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
Man to conſiſt of Body, Soul and
Spirit. My Argument then is this, <hi>God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man of the duſt of the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50488:65"/>
But Man conſiſts of a Body Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</p>
                  <p>Therefore Body, Soul and Spirit are
made of the duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> are undeniable;
and therefore the concluſion. Yet do I
not therefore conclude its annihilation:
for I know all matter is eternal; but am
rather perſwaded of its concentration (as
afore) in its own body.</p>
                  <p>But of its real Being, purely ſpiritual,
and ſtript of all materiality, really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from its body, I doubt.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe that by ſeveral accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to the body, the man is incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from acting rationally, as before; as
in thoſe we call Ideots, there is not in ſome
of them ſo much a ſign of a reaſonable
Soul, as to diſtinguiſh them from Bruits:
Whereas were the Soul ſuch as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it would rather ceaſe to act, than act
at a rate below it ſelf. Did it know its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
ſuch as we make them, it would
as ſoon deſert its being, as degrade its ſelf
by ſuch bruitiſh acts: It is not any defect
in its Organs could rob the Soul of its
Reaſon, its Eſſential Faculty. Tho the
Workman breaks his Tools, his hands do
not loſe their skill, but ceaſeth to act, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50488:65"/>
than to do ought irregularly: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would the Soul then act contrary to its
own nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe all the <hi>ſpecies</hi> both of
the Mineral, Vegitable, and Animal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
appear to me, but as the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Works of a moſt excellent Operator,
as Engines of the moſt accurate Engineer;
they all live, and have a Principle of Life
manifeſt in their growth and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo far as they are living weights,
as I can perceive from the ſame ſource.
But then comes in thoſe Natures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
whereby each is diſtinguiſhed from
other, even like ſeveral pieces of Clock,
or Watch-work: the one ſhews the hour
of the day, and no more; the next ſhews
the hour and minutes, another ſhews both
the former, and likewiſe the Age of the
Moon; another hath not only the three
former motions, but an addition of the
riſe and fall of Tides; yet all this, and
many more that in that way are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are ſeveral diſtinct motions, ariſing all
from the ſame Cauſe, the Spring or Weight,
the Principle of motion in them. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
living Weights, the firſt do only
grow and augment their bulk, and have
no poſſibility in nature to augment their
kind; the next, to wit, Vegitables, do not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50488:66"/>
only grow and increaſe their bulk, but
likewiſe have a power of propagating
their like: the third Family, I mean the
Animal Kingdom, do not only live and
encreaſe their kind, but likewiſe are made
ſenſative. And laſtly, we our ſelves that
are not only poſſeſt of all the former, but
of ſomething, I know not what, we think
more excellent, and call Reaſon, and all
this from the ſame ſource; namely, that
we live; which if we did not, we could
not perform any of theſe acts. For life
in us is the ſame as the Spring or Weight
in the Watch or Clock, which ceaſing,
all other motion ceaſeth, as in a Watch
or Clock, the Spring or Weight being
down.</p>
                  <p>As Life therefore is the Cauſe of all
Motion, and all natural Operation and
Faculties; yet thoſe multifarious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Faculties, manifeſt in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the particular <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Three
Kingdoms, requires not divers Principles
of Life, no more than divers motions ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in a Watch or Clock, requires di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Weights or Springs. And as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of motion in Watch or Clock, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
not from diverſity of Weights or
Springs, but rather from other means: ſo
thoſe diverſities of Natures and Faculties,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50488:66"/>
manifeſt throughout the Three Kingdoms,
ariſe not from divers Principles of Life,
but from one Principle of Life, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
its power in Bodies diverſly organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
So that a Tree or Herb that only
vegitates and propagates its kind, hath
no other Principle of Life than an Animal
that hath Senſe, and more eminent
Faculties. The difference only, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
is, this Principle of Life in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable,
is bound up in a Body organized
to no other eud, by which Life is hindred
exerting any other power: but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
it's kindled in a purer matter, by
which it's capacitated to frame more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Orgains, in order to the exerting
more eminent Acts. For the Principle of
Life can no more act rationally in matter
capable of naught but vegitation (for it
acts in matter according to the nature
thereof, advancing it to its utmoſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency),
than a man can ſaw with a Coult-Staff,
or file with an Hatcher, or make a
Watch with a Betle and Wedges.</p>
                  <p>I am apt to believe thoſe rare Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and eminent Faculties, wherewith
men ſeem to excel meer Senſatives, are
only the improvement of Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have the advantage of them, and
the reſult of reiterated Acts, until they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50488:67"/>
become habits. For by the firſt we are able
to communicate our Conceptions and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
each to other; and by the other we
do gradually aſcend to the knowledg of
things. For is all the knowledg either in
the acts, Liberal or Mechanical, any
more than this acts reiterated, until they
become habits; which when they are, we
are ſaid to know them? And what is all
our reaſoning, but an Argument in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
toſſed from one to another, till the
Truth be found, like a Ball between two
Rackets, till at laſt a lucky blow puts an
end to the ſport? We come into the
World hardly men; and many whoſe
natures want cultivation, live, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to diſtinguiſh them from Brutes,
but the outward form, ſpeech, and ſome
little dexterity, ſuch as in Apes or Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys,
in the things they have been taught,
and the Affairs they have been bred to.
And could we imagine any man to have
lived Twenty or Thirty years in the
World, without the benefit of Humane
Converſe, What would appear then,
think you, of a rational Soul? which the
wiſe man well ſaw when he aſſerted the
Condition of Men and Beaſts to be the
ſame what a meer Ignorant hath; <hi>Moſes</hi>
himſelf made of <hi>Adam,</hi> that in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50488:67"/>
beſt ſtate, knew not that he was
naked: but I believe the Nine Hundred
and Thirty years Experience of his own,
and the continual Experiments of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in that time communicated to him,
might quicken his Intellect. So that he
died with more Reaſon than he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and humane nature in his poſterity.
The next Generation was imbelliſhed
with his attainments, to which their own
Experiences ſtill made a new addition.
The next Generation built on their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and the next on their; and ſo on:
and we are got on the ſhoulders of them
all. So that it's rather a wonder, that
we know no more, than that we know
ſo much. So that what we have, ſeems
rather times product, through the means
aforeſaid, than what our Natures were at
firſt enricht with.</p>
                  <p>The which appears likewiſe in thoſe
whoſe memory fails, and in whom the
<hi>veſtigia</hi> of things is wore out; the habits
they had contracted, and manner of
working in their ſeveral acts being forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
what ſilly Animals are they? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
were the Soul ſuch as repreſented, who
could rob it of its Endowments? It's true
the debilitating of a hand, may impead a
manual labour; but raſe what hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50488:68"/>
been done out of the Memory,
and you render Man a perfect Bruit, or
worſe: for he knows not how to give a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of his own mind.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, I know not any thing
wherein Man excels the Beaſts, but may
be referred to the benefit of Speech and
Hands, capable of effecting its Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
nor find any better way to attain a
right knowledg of our ſelves, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
our ſelves in <hi>Adam,</hi> and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
what Nature had endued him with,
which will fall far ſhort of what we now
admire in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But now ſuppoſing all this anſwer'd,
what will it avail us to a Life of Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
if all return to one Element, and
be there immerged as Brooks and Rivers
in the Sea? If we loſe our Individuation;
and all the Souls that have exiſted, be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of one, where are the Rewards
and Puniſhments of each individual. And
we have reaſon to judg it will be thus, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than otherwiſe, becauſe we ſee every
thing tends to its own Centre, the Water
to the Sea, and all that was of the Earth
to the Earth, from whence they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit returns
to God that gave it.</hi> Every thing then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to its own Element, Ioſeth its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50488:68"/>
For we ſee all bodies return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the earth, are no more individual
bodies, but earth: Have we not reaſon then
to judg the ſame of Spirits returning to
their own Element? And what happineſs
then can we hope for, more than a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the preſent calamity? or what
miſery are we eapable of, more than what
is common to all?</p>
                  <p>The ſame is more evident in the body
with which we converſe, and are more
ſenſibly acquainted with, ſeems wholly
uncapable of either, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all bodies
are material, and matter it ſelf is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of multiplication, but of being
changed. Therefore Nature cannot mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
bodies, but changeth them; as ſome
bodies ariſe, others periſh. Natures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in continual Productions being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſupplied by the diſſolution of other
Compounds: were it otherwiſe, her Store-houſe
would be exhauſted; for its by
continual Circulations, Heaven and Earth
is maintain'd; and by her even Circular
motion, ſhe keeps her ſelf imployed on the
ſame ſtock of matter, and maintains every
<hi>ſpecies.</hi> There is no body the ſame to day
it was yeſterday, matter being in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
flux; neither immediately on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of a Compound, and Corruption
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50488:69"/>
of the body, doth the earth thereof retain
any ſpecifick difference of that body it once
was, but is immediately beſtowed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ordered to the new production of
other things. That part of matter therefore
which conſtituteth a humane body, in a ſhort
time is putrified, and made earth, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
produceth either other inferior Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
or Graſs, or Corn, for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Beaſts and Fowl, which again are the
nouriſhment of men. Thus circularly innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
times round, Nature continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
new forms of the ſame matter. So
that that matter that now conſtitutes my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it may be a thouſand years ago was the
matter of ſome other mans, or it may be of
divers mens, then putrified; which in this
time hath ſuffered infinite changes, as it may
be ſometime Graſs, or Corn, or an Herb, or
Bird, or Beaſt, or divers of them, or all,
and that divers times over, before my body
was framed; who then can ſay, why this
matter ſo changeable, ſhould at laſt be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
my body rather than his, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was, or the body of a Bird, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animal? For by the ſame Reaſons that
the body of man is proved to ariſe again,
may, I think, be proved the Reſtoration of
all other bodies, which is equally incredible to
me (if underſtood at one time). For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50488:69"/>
ſtock of matter being all at firſt exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
ſhe could not employ her ſelf in new
Productions, without deſtroying ſome of
the old; much leſs can ſhe at once fabricate
out of the ſame quantity of matter, all the
bodies that ever were, are, or ſhall be;
which yet, notwithſtanding could ſhe, they
could not be ſaid to be the ſame bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all bodies ſuffer ſuch alteration daily,
that they cannot be ſaid to be the ſame to
day they were yeſterday; how then can
they be capable of Reward or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>Theſe are now my doubts; but are they
the fruits of Diligence? and am I thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for not believing at a common rate?
A great deal cheaper could I have ſate down,
and believed as the Church believes; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a why, or a wherefore, have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of theſe Diſputes, and never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged
my ſelf in this gulf, than thus by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
to create my own diſturbance. Had
I been made a meer Animal, I had had none
of theſe Doubts nor Fears that thus torment
my mind; for doubting, happy Bruits hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
far more happy than my ſelf! With
you is none of this; with you only is ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of mind, and you only void of Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties;
you only enjoy what this world is
able to accommodate with, and it may be too
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50488:70"/>
have thoſe Careſſes we know not of, while we,
your poor purveyors, go drooping and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding,
doubting, fearing, and caring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and our whole lives only a preying
on one another, and tormenting our ſelves.
You have the carnal content and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we nothing but the ſhell, a vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
boaſt of our Lordſhip over you, with
which we ſeek to ſatisfie our ſelves, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals,
with husks, while the truth is, we
are afraid to confront our Vaſſals, except
we firſt by craft and treachery beguile them
from whom likewiſe we flee, if once enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
and what a poor comfort is this? Is
this a Priviledg to boaſt of? Is this all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
advanceth to, only a Purveyor to
Beaſts, and to make my life more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by how much more ſenſible of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!
Well might <hi>Solomon</hi> prefer the dead
before the living; and thoſe that had not
been, before both; intimating thereby, that
being beſt, leaſt capable of miſery; that is,
of Trees, of Herbs, of Stones, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animates,
which wanting ſenſe, are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of miſery. Better any thing than man
therefore, ſince that every brute and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
ſtock or ſtone, are more happy in that
meaſure: they are leſs capable of miſery.
What the advantage then, what the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that occurs to us from them, or what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50488:70"/>
preheminence have we above them, ſeeing
as dieth the one, ſo dieth the other, and that
they have all one breath?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pardon this Degreſſion; the real ſenſe
and apprehenſion I have of things, extort it
from me. For I, as</hi> Job, <hi>cannot refrain
my mouth, but ſpeak in the bitterneſs of
my Spirit, and complain in the anguiſh of
my Soul,</hi> Why died I not from the womb?
why did I not give up the ghoſt when I came
out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent
me? or why the breaſts, that I ſhould ſuck?
<hi>I had then been among</hi> Solomon<hi>'s happy
ones:</hi> I ſhould now have lain ſtill and been
quiet; I ſhould have ſlept, and been at reſt:
<hi>whereas now I am weary of life. For</hi> tho
I ſpeak, my grief is not aſſwaged; and tho I
forbear, I am not eaſed; but now he hath
made me weary, and made deſolate all my
company: he hath filled me with wrinkles,
which is a witneſs againſt me; and my lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
riſing up in me, beareth witneſs to my
face, God hath delivered me to the ungodly,
and turned me over into the hand of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and my familiar friends have forgotten
me. I ſaid, I ſhall die in my neſt, and ſhall
multiply my days as the ſand, when my root
was ſpread out by the waters, and the dew lay
all night on my branch; when my glory was
freſh, and my bow was renewed in my hand:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50488:71"/>
but I find while my fleſh is upon me, I ſhall
have pain, and while my ſoul is in me, it ſhall
mourn. Have pity upon me, O my friend!
for the hand of God hath touched me. The
wicked live, and become old; yea, they are
mighty in power, their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in
their ſight with them, and their off-ſpring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes; their houſes are ſafe from fear,
neither is the rod of God upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
are planted, and take root, they grew; yea,
they bring forth fruit, yet God is never in
their mouth, and far from their reins. In
vain then do I waſh my hands in innocency, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things come alike to all. There is one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
to the righteous and to the wicked, to the
good, to the clean, and to the unclean; to him
that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth
not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; and
he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</p>
                  <p>I have now done (tho I hardly know
how), leſt I too far trouble you; and only

                  <p>§. 1. IT is your wiſdom in Caſes of ſo
great moment, to uſe all juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for ſatisfaction; and I think you
did but your duty, to ſtudy this as hard as
you ſay you have done. But 1. I wiſh you
had ſtudied it better; for then you would
not have been a ſtranger to many Books
which afford a juſt ſolution of your Doubts,
as I muſt ſuppoſe you are, by your taking
no notice of what they have ſaid. 2. And
I wiſh you had known, that between the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of all your Objections, and taking all
on Truſt from men, or believing as the
Church believeth, there are Two other
ways to ſatisfaction (which muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct):
1. Diſcerning the unanſwerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
in Nature and Providence, of the
Souls future Life. 2. And taking it on
truſt from Divine Revelation; which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to be proved, than by believing
as the Church by Authority requireth
you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50488:72"/>
I have written on this Subject ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
that I had rather you had told me,
why you think it unſatisfactory, than deſire
me to tranſcribe it, while Print is as legible
as Manuſcript. If you have not read it,
I humbly offer it to your conſideration. It
is moſt in two Books: The firſt which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to read, is called, <hi>The Reaſons of
the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> the other is called,
<hi>The Unreaſonableneſs of Infidelity.</hi> If you
think this too much labour, you are not ſo
hard or faithful a Student of this weighty
Caſe, as it deſerveth, and you pretend to
be. If you will read them (or the firſt at
leaſt), and after come to me, that we may
fairly debate your remaining Doubts, it
will be a likelier way for us to be uſeful to
each other, than my going over all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
of your Paper will be. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you know, that we have full aſſurance
of a multitude of Verities, againſt which
many Objections may be raiſed, which
no mortal man can fully ſolve, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from Modes and Accidents. Nay,
perhaps there is nothing in the World
which is not liable to ſome ſuch Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And yet I will not neglect, your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

§. 2. When you were convinc'd, That
there is a <hi>firſt Cauſe,</hi> it would have been an
orderly progreſs to think <hi>what that Cauſe
is;</hi> and whether his <hi>Works</hi> do not prove his
<hi>Infinite Perfection,</hi> having all that <hi>eminently</hi>
which he giveth <hi>formally</hi> to the whole
World, as far as it belongeth to <hi>perfection</hi> to
have it. For none can give more than he
hath. And then you ſhould have thought
<hi>what this God is to man,</hi> as manifeſt in his
Works: and you ſhould have conſidered
<hi>what of man is paſt doubt,</hi> and thence <hi>in
what relation he ſtands to God,</hi> and <hi>to his
fellow-creatures:</hi> And this would have led
you to know <hi>mans certain duty:</hi> and that
would have aſſured you of <hi>a future life
of Retribution.</hi> Is not this a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs?</p>
                  <p>§. 3. But you would know a <hi>Definition
of the Soul.</hi> But do you <hi>know</hi> nothing but
by <hi>Definitions?</hi> Are all men that cannot <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,</hi>
therefore void of all knowledg? You
know not at all what <hi>ſeeing</hi> is, or what
<hi>light</hi> is, or what <hi>feeling, ſmelling, taſting,
hearing</hi> is, what <hi>ſound</hi> or <hi>odor</hi> is, what <hi>ſweet</hi>
or <hi>bitter,</hi> nor what <hi>thinking,</hi> or <hi>knowing,</hi> or
<hi>willing,</hi> or <hi>loving</hi> is, if you know it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>defining</hi> tell you, and better than bare
defining can ever tell you. Every <hi>vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50488:73"/>
hath a <hi>ſelf-perception</hi> in its acting;
which is an <hi>eminent ſenſe: Intuition</hi> alſo of
<hi>outward ſenſible Objects,</hi> or immediate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of them, as <hi>ſenſata &amp; imaginata,</hi> is
before all Argument and Definition, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning

<hi>we ſee;</hi> and by <hi>underſtanding,</hi> we <hi>perceive</hi>
that we <hi>underſtand.</hi> I dare ſay, That you
<hi>know</hi> the <hi>Acts of your own Soul</hi> by <hi>acting,</hi>
tho when you come to <hi>reaſoning</hi> or <hi>defining,</hi>
you ſay you <hi>know not what they are.</hi> You
can give no <hi>definition</hi> what <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is, or
<hi>Ens</hi> at leaſt, much leſs what <hi>God is.</hi> And
yet what is more certain than that there is
<hi>Subſtance, Entity,</hi> and <hi>God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. <hi>But I'le tell you</hi> what the Soul of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n
is: It is a Vital, Intellectual, Volitive Spirit,
animating a humane organized Body. <hi>When
it is</hi> ſeparated, <hi>it is not</hi> formally <hi>a</hi> Soul, <hi>but
a</hi> Spirit <hi>ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 5. Qu. <hi>But what is ſuch a</hi> mental Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
It is a moſt pure Subſtance, whoſe form
is a Power or Virtue of Vital Action, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
<hi>and</hi> Volition (three in one).</p>
                  <p>§. 6. I. Are you not <hi>certain</hi> of all <hi>theſe
Acts, viz.</hi> That you <hi>Act vitall, underſtand</hi>
and <hi>will?</hi> If not, you are not ſure that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50488:74"/>
you <hi>ſee,</hi> that you <hi>doubt,</hi> that you <hi>wrote</hi> to
me, or that you are any thing.</p>
                  <p>II. If you <hi>act theſe,</hi> it is certain that
you have the <hi>power</hi> of ſo acting. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>doth</hi> that which it <hi>cannot do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. It is certain, that it is a <hi>Subſtance</hi>
which hath this <hi>power:</hi> For nothing can do
nothing.</p>
                  <p>IV. It is evident, that it is <hi>not</hi> the <hi>viſible
Body,</hi> as compoſed of Earth, Water and
Air, which is this mental Subſtance. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>any one</hi> of them, nor <hi>all</hi> together have
<hi>Life, Underſtanding,</hi> or <hi>Will.</hi> They are
<hi>paſſive</hi> Beings, and act not at all of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but as acted by inviſible Powers.
They have an <hi>aggregative inclination to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion,</hi>
and no other. Were it not for the <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi>
Nature which is active, or for <hi>Spirits,</hi>
they would be ceſſant. Therefore you are
thus far paſt the dark, That there is <hi>in man</hi>
an <hi>Inviſible Subſtance, which hath,</hi> yea,
<hi>which is a Power or Virtue of Vital Action,
Intellection, and Volition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. And that this <hi>Active Power</hi> is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
thing from meer <hi>Paſſive Power,</hi> or
<hi>mobilitie per aliud,</hi> Experience puts paſt
doubt. There is in every <hi>living</hi> thing a
Power, or Virtue of <hi>ſelf-moving,</hi> elſe <hi>Life</hi>
were not <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>

VI. And that this is not a meer <hi>accident</hi>
of the Soul, but its <hi>eſſential form,</hi> I have
proved ſo fully in my <hi>Methodus Theologiae,</hi> in
a peculiar Diſputation, that I will not here
repeat it. It's evident, That even in the
<hi>igneous</hi> Subſtance, the <hi>Vis Motiva, Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nativa,
Calefactiva,</hi> is more than an <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
even its <hi>eſſential form:</hi> But were it
otherwiſe, it would but follow, That if
the very <hi>accidental Acts</hi> or qualities of
a Soul be ſo noble, its <hi>eſſential</hi> muſt be
greater.</p>
                  <p>VII. But it is certain, That neither <hi>Souls,</hi>
nor <hi>any thing,</hi> have either <hi>Being, Power,</hi> or
<hi>Action,</hi> but in <hi>conſtant receptive dependence</hi>
on the continued emanation of the <hi>prime
Cauſe;</hi> and ſo no Inviduation is a <hi>total ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from him,</hi> or an <hi>Independence,</hi> or a
ſelf-ſufficiency. Thus far natural light tells
you what Souls are.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. You add you ſelf, That thoſe <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
which you were made capable of,
you were deſigned to.</hi> Very right. God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not ſuch noble Faculties or Capacities
in vain; much leſs to engage all men to a
life of duty, which ſhall prove deceit and
miſery. But you have Faculties capable of
thinking of God, as your Beginning, Guide,
and End, as your Maker, Ruler, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50488:75"/>
and of ſtudying your duty to
him, in hope of Reward, and of thinking
what will become of you after Death, and
of hoping for future Bleſſedneſs, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
future Miſery: all which no Bruit was
ever capable of. Therefore God deſigned
you to ſuch ends which you are thus capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. <hi>You ſay</hi> (p. 3.) Many have defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Souls Immortality; but none have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Subject capable of a life of Retribution.
<hi>It's a Contradiction to be</hi> immortal, <hi>or</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
<hi>and not to be a</hi> Subject capable.
<hi>For</hi> nothing <hi>hath</hi> no accidents. <hi>Nothing
hath that which it is</hi> not capable <hi>of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 9. You ſay, <hi>None tell us what it is.</hi>
How many Score Volumes have told it us?
I have now briefly told you what it is. You
ſay, <hi>[To ſay it is that by which I reaſon, is
not ſatisfactory. I look for a Definition].</hi>
But on Condition you look not to <hi>ſee</hi> or <hi>feel</hi>
it, as you do Trees or Stones, you may be
ſatisfied. I have given you a Definition.
The <hi>Genus</hi> is <hi>Subſtantia puriſſima;</hi> the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi>
is <hi>Virtus Vitalis, Activa, Intellectiva,
Volitiva (trinum a Imago Creatoris).</hi> What's
here wanting to a Definition?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50488:75"/>
I have told you, That there is an <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
more certain Perception,</hi> than by <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
by which I know that I <hi>ſee, hear, taſte,
am,</hi> and by which the <hi>Soul, in act,</hi> is <hi>conſcious</hi>
of it <hi>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 10. You ask, 1. <hi>Is it a real Being?
Anſw.</hi> I told you, Nothing can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Is it really different from the Body?
Anſw.</hi> A <hi>Subſtance</hi> which hath in it ſelf an
<hi>Eſſential Principle of Life, Intellection, and
Volition,</hi> and that which hath not, are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
different.</hi> Try whether you can make
a Body feel, or underſtand without a Soul.
2. Thoſe that are ſeperable, are really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
                  <p>3. You ask, <hi>Is it able to be without it?
Anſw.</hi> What ſhould hinder it? The Body
made not the Soul: A viler Subſtance giveth
not being to a nobler. 2. Nothing at all
can be without continued Divine ſuſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But we ſee, <hi>Juxta naturam,</hi> God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilateth
no Subſtance: Changes are but
by compoſition, and ſeparation, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but not by annihilation. An Atome of
Earth or Water, is not annihilated; and
why ſhould we ſuſpect, that a Spiritual
Subſtance is? Yea, the contrary is fully
evident, tho God is able to annihilate all
things.</p>

§. 11. <hi>You ſay,</hi> If it be meerly material,
and differ from the Body but gradually, Death
may be but its concentration of this active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

an ambiguous word. Sometime it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Creation of <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Spirits,</hi> out of them

2. And the Soul doth nothing indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
but as dependent on God, in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Operation: and therefore doth
what <hi>God knoweth,</hi> and <hi>uſeth it</hi> too, as his
Inſtrument, in the forming of the body;
and in what it knoweth not it ſelf. And
as God, as <hi>fons naturae neceſſitateth</hi> the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
agency</hi> of the Soul, as he doth the
<hi>Soul of Bruits.</hi> But as the wiſe and free
Governor of the world, he hath to <hi>moral
acts,</hi> given mans Soul <hi>free-will,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>conducting Reaſon;</hi> which it needs

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as it is not made to do <hi>all its acts
freely</hi> and <hi>rationally,</hi> ſo neither <hi>at all times,</hi>
as in Apoplexies, Infancy, Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It
is eſſential to the Soul, to have the <hi>active
power</hi> or <hi>virtue</hi> of <hi>Intellection</hi> and <hi>Free-will,</hi>
but not always to uſe it. As it is <hi>eſſential</hi> to
the ſubſtance of <hi>fire,</hi> tho latent in a flint, to
have the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>motion, lighe</hi> and <hi>heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And its conſiderable, that as a traveller
in his journey, thinking and talking only of
other things, retaineth ſtill a <hi>ſecret act</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi>
his end, (elſe he would not go on)
when he perceiveth and obſerveth it not at

ceaſeth when his Inſtrument is, out of

tune; becauſe he acteth by free-will.</p>
                  <p>But the Soul of an Idiot or mad-man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
only <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> not by <hi>free-acts,</hi>
but neceſſitated by God by the order
of nature. Only <hi>moral</hi> acts are free; and
that ſome other are but brutiſh, and
ſome but vegitative, is no-more a wonder,
than that it ſhould <hi>underſtand</hi> in the <hi>head,</hi>
and be <hi>ſenſible</hi> only in the moſt of the body,
and vegitative only in the <hi>hairs</hi> and <hi>nails.</hi>

by <hi>Spirits</hi> alſo as <hi>lucid,</hi> for that
uſe.</p>
                  <p>§. 14. But never forget this, That <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at any time doth what it cannot do:</hi> but
many <hi>can do</hi> that which <hi>they do not.</hi> Tho
the Soul in the Womb, or Sleep, remember
not, or reaſon not; if <hi>ever it do it,</hi> that
proveth it had the <hi>power</hi> of doiug it. And
that power is not a <hi>novel accident,</hi> tho the <hi>act</hi>
may be ſo.</p>

1. None doubts, but all the world is the

reſpects. And the unity of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
or of inferior univerſal Cauſes (as

                  <p>3. The <hi>Faculty</hi> and the <hi>Habit</hi> are Two
things. The <hi>Faculty</hi> is the <hi>Eſſential form</hi>
of the Subſtance. The <hi>Habit,</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> is
but an <hi>Accident.</hi> The <hi>Faculty</hi> is nothing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50488:82"/>
but the <hi>active Power.</hi> And the <hi>Power</hi> goeth
before the <hi>Act.</hi> Doth <hi>acting,</hi> without <hi>Power</hi>
to act, cauſe the <hi>Power?</hi> What need you
the Power, if you can act without it? And
what's a Contradiction, if this be not, to
ſay, I do that which I cannot do, or I can
do that which I have no power to do? You
are not a man without the Faculty, but
you are without the Act; or elſe you are
no man in your ſleep. The <hi>act</hi> then is but
the <hi>Faculties act;</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> are nothing
but the Faculties <hi>promptitude</hi> to act. And
this indeed is cauſed ſometime by very
<hi>ſtrong acts,</hi> and ſometime, and uſually, by
<hi>frequent acts;</hi> and ſometime ſuddenly, by a
ſpecial Divine Operation. No doubt, but
Oratory, and all Arts and Sciences, are
cauſed by frequent acts, and their Objects:
But thoſe <hi>acts</hi> are cauſed by <hi>humane Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
under God, the firſt Cauſe. You can
never cauſe a Carcaſs, or a Parrot, or any
Bruit, to <hi>think of God,</hi> and the <hi>glory to
come,</hi> nor to do any proper humane
act.</p>
                  <p>Credible Hiſtory aſſureth us, That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
or ſeparate Souls, have acted Carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and diſcourſed in them, and ſeemed to
commit Fornication in them, and left them
dead behind them; and they were known
to be the ſame that were lately executed,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50488:83"/>
or dead, and were re-buried. Here the dead
Organ was capable, when a Spirit did but
uſe it.</p>
                  <p>You too much confound <hi>Intelléction</hi> and
<hi>Ratiocination.</hi> The prime acts of intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Perception are before Ratiocination.
And there are a multitude of Complex Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which all ſound men know without
Syllogiſms. The diſpoſition to know them,
is ſo ſtrong, that ſome call it Actual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
                  <p>§. 25. Add <hi>page</hi> 6. It's well known, That
the Natives in <hi>New England,</hi> the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<hi>Abaſſines, Gallanes,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Ethicpia,</hi>
have as good <hi>natural Capacities</hi> as the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans.</hi>
So far are they from being but <hi>like
Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys;</hi> if they be not Ideots,
or mad, they ſometime ſhame learned men
in their words and deeds. I have known
thoſe that have been ſo courſly clad, and
ſo clowniſhly bred, even as to Speech,
Looks and Carriages, that Gentlemen and
Scholars, at the firſt congreſs, have eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them much according to your deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when in Diſcourſe they have proved
more ingenious than they. And if improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can bring them to Arts, the <hi>Faculty</hi>
was there before. When will you ſhew us
an Ape or a Monkey, that was ever brought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50488:83"/>
to the Acts or Habits before mentioned of
Men? Yea, of thoſe that were born deaf
and dumb?</p>

you.</p>

ſleep: and yet when we awake, we find
that there remains the ſame knowledg of
Arts and Sciences. They did not end at
night, and were not all new made tne next
morning. The Acts ceaſed, becauſe the
receptivity of the paſſive Organ ceaſed:
but the Habit and Faculty continued. And
when memory in old men faileth about
names, and words, and little matters, their
judgments about great things are uſually
ſtronger (by better Habits) than young
mens.</p>
                  <p>§. 28. <hi>You ſay, You</hi> know nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Man excels Beasts, but may be referred to
the benefit of ſpeech and hands, capable of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
its Conceptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50488:84"/>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is anſwered before. Thoſe
<hi>Conceptions</hi> are the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
and is there <hi>no cauſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
And if <hi>mans Conceptions</hi> differ from the
<hi>beaſts,</hi> the <hi>cauſes</hi> differed. And if the <hi>firſt</hi>
Conceptions did not differ, the Subſequent
would not differ neither, without a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the <hi>cauſal Faculties.</hi> Why do not
Beaſts ſpeak as well as Men? Parrots ſhew,
That it is not in all for want of a <hi>ſpeaking
Organ.</hi> If one be born dumb, and not
deaf, he will know but little the leſs for his
dumbneſs. If he be born deaf and dumb,
and not blind, he will ſtill be rational, as
Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> can tell you, who hath taught ſuch
to talk and converſe intelligibly by their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and other ſigns, without words. I
confeſs, if <hi>all the outward Senſes</hi> were ſtopt
from the Birth, I ſee not how the Soul
could know <hi>outward ſenſible things,</hi> as being
<hi>no Objects</hi> to it. And how it would work
on it ſelf alone, we know not; but <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi>
and <hi>will,</hi> we are ſure it doth: and
therefore <hi>can do it.</hi> And it's one thing to
prove <hi>Beaſts to be men,</hi> or <hi>rational,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to prove Men to be <hi>Beaſts,</hi> or <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational.</hi>
If you could prove the former,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Beaſts have Souls that can think
of God, and the Life to come, if they
could but ſpeak, this would rather prove
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50488:84"/>
                     <hi>them immortal,</hi> than prove <hi>man unreaſonable,</hi>
or of a <hi>mortal</hi> Soul. Your whole ſpeech
makes more to <hi>advance bruits,</hi> than to deny
the <hi>reaſon of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 29. <hi>You ſay, You</hi> know no better way
to attain a right knowledg of our ſelves, than
by beholding our ſelves in <hi>Adam,</hi> and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what Nature had endued him with, which
will fall far ſhort of what we now admire in
our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As a <hi>multitude</hi> of Objects, and
Experiences, more tend to Wiſdom than
<hi>one alone;</hi> ſo to know both <hi>what Adam
was,</hi> and <hi>what all men are,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> doth
evidence more to our information, than to
know <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Caſe alone.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt <hi>Powers</hi> are to be known
by <hi>his acts;</hi> and <hi>his acts</hi> were not to be
done at once, in a minute, or a day: And
we have not the Hiſtory of his Life much
after his Fall. But we may be ſure, that
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature in Innocency, was no baſer
than ours corrupted. And therefore <hi>Adam</hi>
had the Powers of doing whatever other
men ſince have done.</p>
                  <p>3. But let us come to your Teſt: 1. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was made a <hi>living Soul</hi> by the <hi>breath</hi>
of God, after the making of his body of the
earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50488:85"/>
2. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were bleſſed with a
generative multiplying Faculty: but they
did not <hi>generate God;</hi> nor did <hi>every bruit</hi>
that had alſo that Faculty. Therefore
there is a <hi>Soul</hi> which is <hi>not God,</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>Animal,</hi> (nor yet an Univerſal
Soul).</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Adam,</hi> no doubt, could not know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſenſible Objects, till they were brought
within the reach of his ſenſe: no more can
we.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Adam</hi> knew the Creatures as ſoon as
he ſaw them; and gave them Names ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
This is more than we could ſo ſoon
do.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Law</hi> given him; and
therefore knew that God was his Ruler.
He knew that God was to be obeyed; he
knew what was his Law: elſe it had been
no ſin to break it. He knew that he ought
to love, and believe, and truſt God, and
cleave to him: elſe it bad been no ſin to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him, and to believe the Tempter, and
to love the forbidden Fruit better than God.
He knew that Death was the threatned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Sin. In a word, He was made in the
<hi>Image of God:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, it is <hi>that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
into which we are <hi>renewed</hi> by Chriſt:
And he deſcribeth it to <hi>conſiſt in wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and true holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50488:85"/>
6. And we have great reaſon to think,
that it was <hi>Adam</hi> that taught <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>offer
Sacrifice in Faith,</hi> and delivered to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
the Traditions which he had from
God. Tho <hi>Adam</hi> did not <hi>do</hi> all this at
once, he did not receive a new Soul or
Faculty for every new act. Can <hi>Apes</hi> and
<hi>Monkeys</hi> do all this? Doth God give them
Laws to know and keep as moral free-agents?</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, <hi>Adam knew not that he was
naked. Anſ.</hi> What! and yet knew God
and his Law, and how to name the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and how to dreſs and keep the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?
He knew not that <hi>nakedneſs</hi> was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
for he had newly <hi>made</hi> it ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you think of <hi>Adam</hi>'s forbidden
<hi>deſire of knowledg,</hi> and his miſerable <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of it. But that did not make him a
<hi>new Soul,</hi> that had no ſuch Faculty before.
<hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>Son of God</hi> by Creation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.
and it was his <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> to live <hi>as a
Son,</hi> in abſolute <hi>truſt</hi> on his Fathers care and
love: and inſtead of this, he was tempted to
ſelf-dependance, and muſt needs know more
than his duty, &amp; his fathers love and reward:
He muſt know good and evil for himſelf: like
a Child that muſt know what Food, and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Work is fitteſt for him, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50488:86"/>
he ſhould know only by truſting his Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thers
choice; or as a Patient that muſt needs
know every Ingredient in his Phyſick, and
the Nature and Reaſon of it, before he will
take it, when he ſhould implicitly truſt his
Phyſician. Man ſhould have waited on God
for all his Notices, and ſought to know no
more than he revealed. But a diſtruſtful,
and a ſelfiſh knowledg, and buſy enquiring
into unrevealed things, is become our ſin
and miſery.</p>
                  <p>§. 36. <hi>You ſay,</hi> Suppoſe all this anſwered:
what will it avail, as to a life of Retribution,
if all return to one element, and be there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged
as Brooks and Rivers in the Sea, and
we loſe our individuation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer'd this in the <hi>Appendix to
the Reaſ. of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> I add
1. Do you believe, that each one hath <hi>now
one individual Soul,</hi> or not? If not, how can
we loſe that which we never had? If we
have but <hi>all one</hi> univerſal mover, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us as Engines, as the Wind and Water
move Mills, how come ſome motions to be
ſo <hi>ſwift</hi> (as a Swallow), and others ſo <hi>ſlow,</hi>
or none at all; in as <hi>mobile</hi> a body)? Yea,
how cometh motion to be ſo much in our
Power, that we can <hi>ſit ſtill</hi> when we will,
and <hi>riſe,</hi> and <hi>go,</hi> and <hi>run,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50488:86"/>
we will,</hi> and <hi>ceaſe,</hi> or <hi>change</hi> it when we
will? A ſtone that falls, or an arrow that is
ſhot, cannot do ſo. Sure it is ſome inward
formal Principle; and not a material Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
mobility of the matter, which can
cauſe this difference.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if we have all but <hi>one Soul,</hi> it's eaſie
to <hi>love our Neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> becauſe
our Neighbours <hi>are our ſelves.</hi> But it's as
eaſie to hate our <hi>ſelves</hi> as our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and
the <hi>good</hi> as the <hi>bad,</hi> if all be one (for <hi>forma dat
nomen &amp; eſſe).</hi> But it's ſtrange, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God, or the Soul of the World, ſhall
<hi>hate it ſelf,</hi> and put it ſelf to pain, and fight
againſt it ſelf, as in Wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you think ſtill, That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>dead matter actuated by
him,</hi> I would beg your Anſwer to theſe few
Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>1. Do you really believe, that there is a
<hi>God?</hi> that is, an <hi>eternal infinite ſelf-being,</hi>
who hath all that power, knowledg, and
goodneſs of will, in tranſcendent Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which any Creature hath formally, and
is the efficient Governor of all elſe that is. If
not, all the world condemneth you: for <hi>it
is</hi> not an uncauſed Being, and can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but from its Cauſe, who can give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
greater than it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50488:87"/>
2. Do you think this God <hi>can</hi> make a
Creature that hath a ſubordinate Soul, or
Spirit, to be the Principle of its own Vital
Action, Intellection, and Volition, or not?
Cannot God make a Spirit? If not, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe it is a Contradiction (which
none can pretend), or becauſe God is not
Omnipotent; that is, is <hi>not God;</hi> and ſo
there is <hi>no God;</hi> and ſo you deny what you
granted. But if God <hi>can</hi> make a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</p>
                  <p>3. Why ſhould you think he <hi>would</hi> not?
Some of your mind ſay, That he <hi>doth all
the good that he can; or elſe he were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
good.</hi> Certainly his <hi>goodneſs</hi> is equal
to his <hi>greatneſs,</hi> and is commmunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>4. Hath he not imprinted his Perfections
in ſome meaſure, in his Works? Do they
not ſhew his glory? Judg of his Greatneſs
by the Sun, Stars, and Heavens; and of
his Wiſdom, by the wonderful Order, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture,
and Goverument of all things. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Fabrick of a Fly, or any Animal,
poſeth us. And do you think, that his
love and goodneſs hath no anſwerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
                  <p>5. Do you think, that <hi>paſſive matter</hi> doth
as much manifeſt Gods Perfection, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Efficient, as <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50488:87"/>
Spirits?</hi> If it be a far nobler Work for
God to make a <hi>free, vital, mental Spirit,</hi>
to act under him <hi>freely, mentally, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi>
than to make <hi>meer atomes,</hi> why
ſhould you think that God <hi>will not</hi> do
it?</p>
                  <p>6. And do you not diſhonour, or blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the prime Cauſe, by ſuch diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of his <hi>Work,</hi> as to ſay, he never
made any thing more noble than Atomes,
and Compoſitions of them.</p>
                  <p>7. Is there not in the <hi>Creature</hi> a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
diſpoſition to cauſe their like? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
generate their like: Fire kindleth
fire: Wiſe men would make others wiſe:
God is eſſential infinite Life, Wiſdom and
Love: and can he, or would he make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
liker to himſelf than dead Atomes?
Yea, you feign him to make nothing but
by Compoſition, while you ſay, That <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
it ſelf is <hi>eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. But when the matter of Fact is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and we ſee by the actions, that there
is a difference between things moved by
God, ſome having a created <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi>
and ſome <hi>none,</hi> what needs then any further
proof?</p>
                  <p>§. 31. But if you hold, That we have
<hi>now diſtinct Spirits,</hi> which are <hi>individual
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50488:88"/>
Subſtances,</hi> why ſhould you fear the <hi>loſs of
our individuation,</hi> any more than our anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation,
or ſpecifick alteration? If God
made as many ſubſtantial individual Souls,
as men, is there any thing in Nature or
Scripture, which thteatneth the loſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation?
I have ſhewed you, and ſhall
further ſhew you enough againſt it.</p>
                  <p>§. 32. <hi>You ſay,</hi> page 7. Every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth
to its element, and loſeth its indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation:
Earth to Earth, Water to the Sea,
the Spirit to God that gave it. What happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
then can we hope for more than deliverance
from the preſent calamity; or what miſery
are we capable of, more than is common to
all?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Bodies loſe but their <hi>Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual forms.</hi> Do you think,
that any <hi>Atome</hi> loſeth its individuation? If
it be ſtill diviſible <hi>in partes infinitas,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.
And if every Atome be infinite, it
is as much, or more than all the world;
and ſo is no part of the world; and ſo
there would be as many Worlds, or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
as Atomes. It is but an <hi>aggregative
motion</hi> which you mention. <hi>Birds of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will flock together,</hi> and yet are <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
ſtill.</hi> Do you think any duſt, or
drop, any Atome of Earth or Water, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50488:88"/>
any thing of it ſelf, by its union with
the reſt? Is any <hi>Subſtance</hi> loſt? Is the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Nature changed? Is it not Earth and
Water ſtill? Is not the <hi>Haecceity,</hi> as they
call it, continued? Doth not God know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
duſt, and every drop from the reſt?
Can he not ſeparate them when he will?
And if Nature in all things tend to <hi>aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
or <hi>union,</hi> it is then the <hi>Perfection</hi> of
every thing. And why ſhould we fear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
                  <p>2. But <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> are
<hi>partible matter. Earth</hi> is eaſily ſeparable:
The parts of <hi>Water</hi> more <hi>hardly,</hi> by the
means of ſome terrene Separaror: The
parts of <hi>Air</hi> yet more hardly: and the
Sun-beams, or ſubſtance of fire, yet harder
than that (tho it's contraction and effects
are very different): And <hi>Spirits</hi> either yet
<hi>harder,</hi> or <hi>not at all.</hi> Some make it eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to them to be <hi>indiſcerptible;</hi> and all
muſt ſay, That there is nothing in the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of them, <hi>tending to diviſion,</hi> or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And therefore tho God, who can
<hi>annihilate</hi> them, can <hi>divide</hi> them into parts,
if it be no Contradiction; yet it <hi>will never

Therefore their <hi>diſſilution of parts</hi> is no
more to be feared, than their <hi>annihilation.</hi>

3. But if you take Souls to be <hi>partible</hi>
and <hi>unible,</hi> then you muſt ſuppoſe every
part to have ſtill its own exiſtence in the
<hi>whole.</hi> And do you think, that this doth
not more <hi>advance</hi> Souls than <hi>abaſe</hi> them?
Yea, you ſeem to <hi>Deifie</hi> them; while you
make them all to return into <hi>God,</hi> as drops
into the Sea. And if you feign <hi>God</hi> to be
<hi>partible,</hi> is it not more honour and joy to
be a <hi>part of God,</hi> who is <hi>joy it ſelf,</hi> than
to be a <hi>created Soul?</hi> If a thouſand Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
were put out, and their light turned
into one <hi>Luminary,</hi> as great as they all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part would have its ſhare in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning
of the place about it. Is it any
loſs to a ſingle Soldier, to become part of a
victorious Army.</p>
                  <p>4. But indeed this is too high a Glory for
the Soul of man to deſire, or hope for. It
is enough to have a bleſſed union with
Chriſt, and the holy Society, conſiſtent
with our Individuation. Like will to like,
and yet be it ſelf. Rivers go to the Sea,
and not to the Earth. Earth turns to
Earth, and not to the Sun, or Fire. And
the holy and bleſſed, go to the holy and
bleſſed: And I believe, that their union
will be nearer than we can now well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or than this ſelfiſh ſtate of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth:
But as every drop in the Sea, is the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50488:89"/>
ſame Water it was, ſo every Soul will be
the ſame Soul.</p>
                  <p>2. And as to the <hi>incapacity of miſery</hi>
which you talk of, why ſhould you think
it more <hi>hereafter</hi> than <hi>here?</hi> If you think
all Souls now to be but <hi>one,</hi> doth not an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Tooth, or a gouty Foot, or a calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Bladder, ſuffer pain, tho it be not the
<hi>body</hi> that feeleth; but the ſame <hi>ſenſitive
Soul</hi> is pain'd in one part, and pleas'd in
another. And if all Souls be now but God
in divers Bodies, or the <hi>Anima mundi,</hi> try
if you can comfort a man under the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Stone,</hi> or other Malady, or on
the Rack, or in terror of Conſcience, by
telling him, That his <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>a part of God.</hi>
Will this make a Captive bear his Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or a Malefactor his Death? If not here,
why ſhould you think that their miſery
hereafter will be ever the leſs, or more
tolerable for your conceit, that they are
parts of God? They will be no more parts
of him then, than they were here. But
it's like, that they alſo will have an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
inclination,</hi> even to ſuch as themſelves;
or that God, will ſeparate them from all
true unity, and ſay, <hi>Go you curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>

§. 33. No doubt it's true, that you ſay,
<hi>page</hi> 7, and 8. That <hi>matter is ſtill the
ſame, and liable to all the changes which you
mention.</hi> But it's an <hi>unchanged God,</hi> who
doth all this by <hi>Spirits,</hi> as ſecond Cauſes,
who are not of ſuch a <hi>changeable,</hi> diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
partible nature, as Bodies are: It is
<hi>Spirits</hi> that do all that's done in the world.
And I conjecture, as well as you, That <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Spirits</hi> are <hi>univerſal Cauſes.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
That this Earth hath a <hi>vegitative
form,</hi> which maketh it as a <hi>matrix</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Seeds, and the more active influx
of the Sun. But <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sun</hi> are but
<hi>general</hi> Cauſes. Only <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Virtue,</hi> cauſe the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> as ſuch. The
<hi>Sun</hi> cauſeth every Plant to grow; but it
cauſeth not the difference between the Roſe,
and the Nettle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Oak. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
unſearchable Virtue of the Seed
cauſeth that. And if you would know
that Virtue, you muſt know it by the
effects. You cannot tell by the <hi>Seed</hi> only
of a Roſe, a Vine, an Oak, what is in
it. But when you ſee the Plants in ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
you may ſee that the <hi>Seeds had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying
Virtue,</hi> by the influx of the general
Cauſe, to bring forth thoſe Plants, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither can you know what is
in the Egg, but by the ripe Bird; nor
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50488:90"/>
what the Soul of an Infant is, but by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

and nothing is difficult to God. <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Body</hi> hath more parts than <hi>Earth</hi> and

§. 35. <hi>You add,</hi> how eaſie it would have
been to you to believe as the Church believeth,
and not to have immerged your ſelf in theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Church</hi> is nothing but all <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Chriſtians;</hi> and it is their <hi>Belief</hi> which
makes them <hi>capable</hi> of being of the Church:
As we muſt be <hi>men</hi> in order of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are a <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>men;</hi> ſo we are
<hi>Believers</hi> before we are a <hi>Church</hi> of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
A <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Policy</hi> maketh us not
<hi>men,</hi> but is made of <hi>men;</hi> and <hi>Church-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>
or <hi>Policy</hi> maketh us not <hi>Believers,</hi>
but is made up of <hi>Believers.</hi> Therefore
<hi>Belief</hi> is <hi>firſt,</hi> and is not cauſed by that
which followeth it? And why doth the
Church believe? Is it becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
                  <p>And <hi>whom do they believe?</hi> Is it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
I doubt you have fallen into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with thoſe whoſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> hath
made it their <hi>Trade</hi> to puzzle and confound
men about things as hard to themſelves as
others, that they may bring them to truſt
the Church, and then tell them that it's <hi>they</hi>
that are that <hi>Church,</hi> as a neceſſary means
to the quieting their minds. And they tell
them, <hi>You are never able by reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the myſteries of Faith; the more you
ſearch, the more you are confounded. But if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50488:91"/>
you believe as the Church believeth, you ſhall
ſpeed as the Church ſpeedeth.,</hi> But it's one
thing to believe the <hi>ſame thing</hi> which the
Church believeth; and another to believe
it with the <hi>ſame faith,</hi> and upon the ſame
<hi>Authority.</hi> If a man believe all the Articles
of the Creed only becauſe men tell him
that they are true, it is but a <hi>human Faith,</hi>
as reſting only on mans <hi>Authority;</hi> but the
true Members of the Church believe all the
<hi>ſame things,</hi> becauſe God <hi>revealeth</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth</hi>
them; and this is a <hi>Divine Faith:</hi>
And ſo muſt you.</p>
                  <p>If you love light more than darkneſs and
deceit, diſtinguiſh, 1. Believing men for
<hi>Authority.</hi> 2. Believing men for their <hi>Honeſty,</hi>
3. Believing men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the <hi>natural impoſſibility
of their deceiving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the foundation of this difference is
here: Mans Soul hath two ſorts of acts,
<hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Contingent,</hi> or <hi>mutably free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To love our ſelves, to be unwilling to be
miſerable,</hi> and <hi>willing to be happy;</hi> to <hi>love
God</hi> as <hi>good,</hi> if known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are acts of the
Soul as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as for fire <hi>to burn</hi> combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
contiguous matter; or for a Bruit to
eat; ſo that all the Teſtimonies which is
produced by theſe <hi>neceſſary</hi> acts by <hi>knowing
men,</hi> hath a Phyſical certainty, the contrary
being impoſſible. And this is <hi>infallible hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50488:92"/>
knowledg</hi> of <hi>matter of fact.</hi> Thus
we know there is ſuch a City as <hi>Rome, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
Venice,</hi> &amp;c. and that there was ſuch a
man as K. <hi>James, Ed. 6. Hen. 8. William</hi> the
Conqueror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Statutes now
aſcribed to <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and other Kings and their
Parliaments are genuine. For Judges
judge by them; Lawyers plead them, Kings
own them, all men hold their Eſtates and
Lives by them. Contrary mens Intereſt by
Lawyers are daily pleaded by them againſt
each other; and if any one would deny,
forge or corrupt a Statute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Intereſt would
engage the reſt againſt him to detect his
fraud.</p>
                  <p>1. The certain effect of natural neceſſary
Cauſes hath natural neceſſary evidence of
Truth.</p>
                  <p>But when all knowing men of contrary
Diſpoſitions <hi>and</hi> Intereſts. acknowledg a thing
true, this is the effect of nataral neceſſary
Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> it hath natural neceſſary evidence of
Truth.</p>
                  <p>2. It is impoſſible there ſhould be an Effect
without a ſufficient Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But that a thing ſhould be falſe which all
knowing men of contrary Diſpoſitions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
acknowledg to be true, would be an
Effect without a Cauſe;</hi> for there is no Cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50488:92"/>
in nature to effect it. It is impoſſible in
<hi>nature</hi> that all men in <hi>England</hi> ſhould agree
to ſay, There was a King <hi>James,</hi> K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Q. Mary,</hi> or that theſe Statutes were
made by them, if it were falſe. This is
<hi>infallible Hiſtorical Teſtimony.</hi> It were not
ſo ſtrong if it were only by <hi>one Party,</hi> and
not by Enemies alſo, or men of contrary
Minds and Intereſts. And thus we know
the Hiſtory of the Goſpel; and this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
is naturally <hi>infallible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. But all the Teſtimony which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on humane Acts, <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> but <hi>free,</hi>
have but an <hi>uncertain moral humane Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
For ſo <hi>all men are Lyars;</hi> i.e. <hi>fallible,</hi>
and not fully to be truſted.</p>
                  <p>And I. Thoſe Teſtimonies which depend

than we <hi>know the Honeſty</hi> of the men: which

For before you can believe that Jeſus is the

have you to believe? 1. You muſt
believe that Chriſt hath a Church. 2. And hath
authorized them to determine what is to be
believed, before you believe that he is Chriſt.
3. You muſt know who they be whom you
muſt believe; whether all, or ſome, or a <hi>major</hi>

4. And how far their Authority extendeth?
Whether to judg whether there be a God,

or none; a Goſpel, or none: or what.
5. And how their determinations out of all the

where to find them. 6. And when Countreys

                  <p>1. You perceive that you <hi>ſee, feel, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,

is oft ſaid, that therefore you have an <hi>active
power</hi> to do theſe. 3. You may thence know,
that it is a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> which hath that power.
Nothing can do nothing. 4. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that it is not the <hi>terrene</hi> ſubſtance, but
an <hi>inviſible</hi> ſubſtance, actuating the body.
5. You may know, that there is no probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that ſo noble a ſubſtance ſhould be <hi>annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</hi>
6. Or that a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ſimple</hi> ſubſtance
ſhould be <hi>diſſolved</hi> by the ſeparation of parts
(or if that were, every part would be a <hi>ſpirit</hi>
ſtill). 7. You have no cauſe to ſuſpect, that this
ſubſtance ſhould loſe thoſe <hi>powers</hi> or <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
which are its <hi>eſſential form,</hi> and be turned
into ſome other <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or thing. 8. And you
have as little cauſe to ſuſpect, that an eſſential

when <hi>active inclination</hi> is its <hi>Eſſence.</hi> 9. You
have no cauſe to ſuſpect, that it will want <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to action in a World of ſuch variety of
Objects. 10. And you have as little cauſe to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50488:94"/>
ſuſpect, that it will be unactive, for want of
Organs, when God hath made its <hi>Eſſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;</hi>
and either can make new Organs; or
that which can act <hi>on matter,</hi> can act <hi>without,</hi>
or on other matter. He that can play on a
Lute, can do ſomewhat as good, if that be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
11. And experience might ſatisfie you,
that <hi>ſeveral</hi> men have <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſouls, by the
<hi>ſeveral</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> Operations. 12. And you
have no reaſon to ſuſpect, that God will turn

to ask, <hi>which part of Chriſtians</hi> it is that is
<hi>this Church,</hi> that is to be believed, that it
tendeth to the aſſertaining of us, that all
the Chriſtian World, <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtants,

fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>II. The <hi>inherent impreſs</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> on
the <hi>Goſpel it ſelf,</hi> unimitable by man. It
hath <hi>Gods Image and Superſcription;</hi> and
its Excellency, <hi>propria luce,</hi> is diſcerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>III. All the <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi>
and <hi>Aſcention</hi> of Chriſt, the Gift <hi>of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and extraordinary <hi>Miracles</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
and firſt Churches.</p>
                  <p>IV. The <hi>ſanctifying work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> by
this Goſpel, on all Believers in all Ages of
the World, by which they have the Witneſs
in themſelves. A full conſtant unimitable
Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>§. 40. And now how highly ſoever you
think of Bruits, think not too baſely of
Men, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> became a <hi>Saviour:</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50488:95"/>
And yet think not ſo <hi>highly</hi> of <hi>Men, Bruits</hi>
and <hi>Stones,</hi> as to think that they are <hi>God.</hi>
And think not that your true <hi>diligence</hi> hath
confounded you, but either your <hi>negligence,</hi>
or <hi>ſeducers,</hi> or the unhappy ſtifling of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
truth, by the ill ordering of your
thoughts. And I beſeech you remember,
that <hi>Gods Revelationt</hi> are ſuited to <hi>mans uſe,</hi>
and our <hi>true knowledg</hi> to his <hi>Revtlations.</hi> He
hath not told us <hi>all that man would know,</hi> but
<hi>what we muſt know.</hi> Nothing is more known
to us than that <hi>of God</hi> which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for
us: Yet nothing ſo incomprehenſible as God.
There is much of the <hi>Nature of Spirits,</hi> and
the <hi>world to come, unſearchable</hi> to us, which
will poſe all our Wits: yet we have ſufficient
certainty of ſo much as tells us our <hi>duty</hi> and
our hopes. God hath given us <hi>Souls to uſe,</hi> and
to <hi>know only ſo far as is uſeful.</hi> He that <hi>made</hi>
your <hi>Watch,</hi> taught not you <hi>how it's made;</hi>
but how to <hi>uſe it.</hi> Inſtead therefore of your
concluding complaints of your condition,
thank God, who hath made man capable to
ſeek him, ſerve him, love him, prai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e him,
and rejoyce in hope of promiſed Perfection.
Live not as a <hi>willful ſtranger</hi> to your <hi>Soul
and God.</hi> Uſe faithfully the Faculties which he
hath given you: ſin not willfully againſt the
truth revealed, and leave things <hi>ſecret</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>
till you come into the clearer light: and you

ſhall have no cauſe to complain, that God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whoſe goodneſs is equal to his greatneſs,
hath dealt hardly with mankind. Inſtead
of truſting <hi>fallible man, truſt Chriſt,</hi> who
hath fully proved his truſtineſs; and his <hi>Spirit</hi>
will advance you to higher things than bruits
are capable of. God be merciful to us dark
