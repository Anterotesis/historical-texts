            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>I am your servant and your friend,</l>
            <l>poor <hi>Taffie</hi> then replied,</l>
            <l>I hope my grief is at an end</l>
            <l>if I with you abide:</l>
            <l>The first design we'll set upon</l>

            <l>when people are asleep:</l>
            <l>And what is that quoth <hi>Taffie</hi> then?</l>
            <l>I do desire to know,</l>
            <l>You look like good plain dealing men,</l>
            <l>what is it I must do?</l>
            <l>Nothing but rob a house quoth they</l>
            <l>of Bacon we tell you:</l>
            <l>Quoth he I was in such a fray,</l>
            <l>her's some, I pray fall too:</l>
            <l>He pull'd a piece out of his poke,</l>
            <l>The Bacon it was warm,</l>
            <l>Quoth he this was in fire and smoke</l>
            <l>but I had all the harm:</l>
            <l>He shew<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <l>his hands and eke his face,</l>
            <l>They laughed at his burned side</l>
            <l>which he took in disgrace.</l>
            <l>They eat the Bacon greedily,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105720:9"/>but they found bread and drink:</l>
            <l>They praised it exceedingly,</l>
            <l>although the same did stink:</l>
            <l>Well now themselves to sleep they lay</l>
            <l>no dangers them affright,</l>
            <l>Most commonly they sleep all day</l>
            <l>and do their work by night.</l>
            <l>They all concluded at the last</l>
            <l>a rope should him befriend,</l>
            <l>That when their dangers it was past</l>
            <l>it might be <hi>Taffies</hi> end.</l>
            <l>This practice wise men will observe</l>

            <l>he looked wondrous pale,</l>
            <l>His manhood then he durst not try,</l>
            <l>his courage now doth fail,</l>
            <l>The man afraid, the Devil afraid,</l>
            <l>stood gazing on each other:</l>
            <l>At last the good wife and the maid</l>
            <l>call'd down the good mans brother:</l>
            <l>Brother lend me your sword quoth he,</l>

            <l>But when he came this Devil to see</l>
            <l>he was as much afraid:</l>
            <l>When <hi>Taffie</hi> see them all amaz'd</l>
            <l>he stoutly marcht away,</l>
            <l>Upon each other then they gaz'd</l>
            <l>and knew not what to say:</l>
            <l>They dined well mark what ensued,</l>
            <l>when as they came to sup</l>
            <l>They mist the Bacon and conclude</l>
            <l>The Devil had eat it up.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Taffie</hi> is a lusty blade,</l>
            <l>pessessed with strange fits</l>
            <l>Made all the children sore afraid,</l>
            <l>almost beside her wits:</l>
            <l>The children hiding places sought</l>
            <l>he put them in such fear,</l>
            <l>Lest <hi>Taffie</hi> who the Devil was thought</l>
            <l>would them in pieces tear.</l>
            <l>They durst not go to school by day</l>

            <l>For fear he should fetch them away,</l>
            <l>he put them in such frights.</l>
            <l>The women at this matter frown,</l>
            <l>and they conclude with speed</l>
            <l>To beat the Devil out of town</l>
            <l>that did this mischief breed:</l>
            <l>With shovels, spades, staves, and stones</l>
            <l>they beat poor <hi>Taffie</hi> so,</l>

            <l>And then he sets him down and weeps</l>
            <l>his courage now is tam'd:</l>
            <l>Unto a Church at last goes he,</l>
            <l>to hide him out of sight,</l>
            <l>So then he thought he should be free</l>
            <l>from all their hate and spight.</l>
            <l>Within a Pew he closly lay,</l>
            <l>all night untill the morrow,</l>
            <l>Untill the Sexton came, they say,</l>

               <hi>Taffie</hi> peept out with his black snont</l>
            <l>which made him sore afraid.</l>
            <l>He like a mad man run about</l>
            <l>and call'd aloud for aid:</l>

            <l>And for this Devil there they sought,</l>

            <l>A many then against him came</l>
