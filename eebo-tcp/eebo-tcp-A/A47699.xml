            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving seen a Letter, which I may judge comes from a friend, it <hi>reciting</hi> the truth of what Losses I have sustain'd, as well as the Profits I have made: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving 'tis more necessary at this time to shew the truth of what I have gain'd since I was Speaker, to undeceive the many that believe, and relate the contrary; and which I may hope will in some measure plead my Vindication, that the Errours I have fallen into were not willingly, but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally committed.</p>
            <p>When I was first call'd to be Speaker of the House of Commons, I think 'tis known to most that I had a plentiful fortune in Land, and ready money too, a good summe; and that if I had continued my way of practise, I might as well have doubled my fortune as got what I did, because the Estate I had then gain'd, was the profits of my beginnings, and having lost now twenty yeares of the best part of my life, and the greatest of my advantages, it will appear I have been a greater loser then an improver of my fortunes, by those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places, I have with so much hazard and danger under-gone.</p>
            <p>I received by the last yeares of my practice, five and twenty hundred pounds by the year, which I quitted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105990:3"/>
when I was made Speaker; and instead of making any advantage by that, I added a great charge, keeping a great Retinue and publick Table for two yeares, which his Majesty taking notice of, gave me six thousand pound, of which to this day I have not received above the one half.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Office of Master of the Rolls falling by the death of Sir <hi>Charles Caesar,</hi> I was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Master of the Rolls: but if any one will look back they will find I could not, as well as I have not made the benefit of that imployment as others my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had done; not onely by reason of the distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that then were, but also by reason that the Court of Wards was thought to be taken away, which yielded a yearly profit to that Office of at least eight hundred pounds: also the Bishops either for their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Translation or Restitution to their Temporalties, paying a fee of a hundred pounds, which one year with another made five hundred pound profit. Then there was taken away from me the Fines on Original Writs, which in truth was all that was left of advantage to the Office; and by the losse of these fees upon the Wardships, Bishops and Fines on Originalls, there was two and twenty hundred pounds yearly taken from the profits of the Place.</p>
            <p>But that which makes the greatest noise, and reflects on me to my greatest prejudice, is the Gaines I should make by being Speaker; when there is due onely to the Speaker five pound <hi>per diem,</hi> as a standing fee, and five pound on every private Bill; 'tis true both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105990:3"/>
were pleas'd to adde five pound upon the Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Delinquents. As for the five pound a day, from my first sitting to my last I never receiv'd one farthing of it: As for private Bills their profit was very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and so it will appear, is that of the five pound upon Pardons, I having not made by both of them two and twenty hundred and twenty pounds: and this will most evidently appear, because I am check'd by the Journall Books of the House, where every private Bill is enter'd, and so was every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; as also by the Serjeant that attends the House, and the Clarks, they having a fee also where I have one, and receiving what I had from their hands; and certainly if my gaines should be so great, theirs could could not have been so mean, especially the Clarks, who have a profit out of Orders, which the Speaker has not; and yet there was one of them that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the time of my greatest Gaines, and as able a Person as has executed that Imployment, whose Condition was such, that the Charity of his friends contributed to the expences of his Funerall.</p>
            <p>Other places I executed for some short time, but I think rather from necessity than choice, for there was no one would undertake the execution of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some other recompence than their fees: As I was one of the Commissioners of the Great Seal, which how unwillingly I received, will appear by my sudden putting of it off, and where none has since executed it without a Salary. I was also Chancellor of the Dutchy, but had onely my labour for my pains, and as soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my self of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105990:4"/>
I never had any recompence from the House in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, land, or by other reward, and from 1648. to the last time that I sate, I never received any profit by Fee or otherwise from them.</p>
            <p>And, because the truth may fully appear, and I may apply a cure to those wounds uncertain Relation hath given me, I will here following set forth to the view of all, what my Estate is both Real and Personal.</p>
            <p>In Real Estate I have not above Eight hundred pounds by the year, on the Rack rent to my use. The residue of my Estate I formerly setled on my Son in marriage, and is in his possession, and on the Racke rent is not above Eight hundred pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> This all my Real Estate.</p>
            <p>My Personal Estate in Money, Jewels, Plate, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold-furniture and Debts, is not above two thousand pounds, and of this I owe Eight hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>There is a Widow, one Mrs. <hi>Staveley,</hi> that divers years since made use of my name in putting out Four hundred pound upon the security of the Excize, but she constantly receives the Proceed thereof, and the Money is her own.</p>
            <p>This is a true and impartial particular of my Estate Real and Personal, and whatsoever I have besides, or any one to my use, or in trust for me, I freely relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish, renounce and disclaim, and shall willingly part with it, and confirm it to any who shall discover it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105990:4"/>
I shall onely adde for the satisfaction of those who may doubt the truth hereof, that I never lent nor put out any money, nor any one for me in my name or in trust for me, or to my use, upon Interest, or upon Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages of Lands, or any Security whatsoever, whereby or whereupon I might, did, or could receive any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest or recompence for my Money.</p>
            <p>And I am ready to attest the truth of this upon my Oath.</p>
