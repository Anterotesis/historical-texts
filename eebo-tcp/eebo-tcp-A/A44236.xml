            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout Two or Three Years ſince, I was content that Two Small Books, or rather Pamphlets, that I had collected, partly in my Youth, and partly at the Recreations of leiſure hours, ſhould be publiſhed in Print; The one Entituled, <hi>An Eſſay touching the Gravitation of Fluids;</hi> The other, <hi>Difficiles Nugae,</hi> or, <hi>Obſervations touching the</hi> Torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian Experiment.</p>
            <p>In the Publiſhing of them, I did not ſet them off with any Oſtentation; but let them go with uninviting Titles, and not ſo much as beſtowed upon them my
<pb facs="tcp:49448:3"/>
Name: For I thought that they were but Trifles, and ſuch as were below the Peruſal of the Learned men of the Age, and at beſt, a Divertiſement of ſome leiſure-hours, to young Students in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Nature.</p>
            <p>But beyond my expectation, theſe <hi>Nugae</hi> (for ſo I muſt ſtill call them) had the unexpected honour to be peruſed and examined by Two eſpecially of the moſt Learned Maſters in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> that this latter Age hath yielded; and not only ſo, but they have given them the honour to make Obſervations, Animadverſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which came out firſt were ſhort and <hi>obiter,</hi> upon occaſion of another Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which gave opportunity of a ſhort Defence. Thoſe that came out ſince, were more large.</p>
            <p>The Nameleſs Author of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> and <hi>Nugae,</hi> doth return to them his thankful Acknowledgment of thoir Favour, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Notice of ſuch Trifles, and uſing them and the unknown Author with that Civility that they have expreſſed in their <hi>Remarks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49448:3"/>The truth is. the Controverſie falls to be of that Nature, that among the Three Contenders, every one oppoſeth ſomewhat that the other two grant; and aſſerts ſomewhat that the other two deny: <hi>For inſtance,</hi> I contend againſt the ſolving of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the <hi>Torricellian Experiment,</hi> by the weight or Elaſticity of the Air, or by a common Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but that it is done Mechanically by <hi>Tenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My firſt <hi>Opponent</hi> ſuppoſeth it not done by <hi>Tenſion,</hi> nor the common Spirit of Nature, but by the Weight and Elaſticity of the Air.</p>
            <p>The Third contends that it is neither done by the Elaſticity or weight of the Air, nor by Tenſion; but by the Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Thus every one agrees and diſagrees with the other; and every Opponent in one kind, is in another kind the Advocate of the Party he oppoſeth.</p>
            <p>And this will both aſſiſt and juſtifie me, in writing in the farther Explication and Application of what I have aſſerted; which I ſhall do with plainneſs and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
<pb facs="tcp:49448:4"/>
but without Arrogance to my ſelf, as if I had wholly confuted my Opponents; or detraction from my Opponents, or their Aſſertions, by cenſuring them as abſurd or contradictory. For in thoſe caſes, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the Readers, not the Opponents.</p>
            <p>In Philoſophical Enquiries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, we may obſerve two kinds of Methods uſed by ſome men.</p>
            <p>Some begin at their Senſes, examine particular Matters of Facts, how they are, or fall out, ſearch into Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and viſible Trials, and thoſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Nature that are obvious to our Senſes, and from theſe they deduce their Concluſions and Theorems.</p>
            <p>And certainly he that attentively reads <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> eſpecially in his <hi>Hiſtory of Animals,</hi> of their Parts, Going and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in his <hi>Meteorologicks,</hi> in his Books <hi>De Anima;</hi> yea, in his very <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks,</hi> will find, that as he was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Maſter of Experience and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind, ſo it was the great Method of his Deductions and Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore they that when they would ſeem to cry up <hi>Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49448:4"/>
think they do but right in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> either have not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, or ſurely are too injurious to him.</p>
            <p>Again, There are ſome that lay the firſt Foundations of their Philoſophy in Notions, and Speculations, and precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Syſtemes of their own framing; and then conforming the Solution of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature, to thoſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And theſe moſt commonly do by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Natural Appearances, as that Tyrant did by his Priſoners that were too long or too ſhort for his Iron Bed; ſtretched the latter, and cut the former to its dimenſion; ſo theſe handle the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in Nature; torture and torment them into a conſonancy to their Notions; or at beſt, ſubſtitute new preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Notions to piece out their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and to render ſenſible Appearances to hold analogy with that Notional <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme</hi> of things that they have framed: And I muſt needs ſay, that I think the general Mode and Faſhion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of <hi>Lucretius, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:49448:5"/>
and Reformation of it by <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> hath too much of this latter Method in it, and is a very uncertain and prepoſterous way of forming Concluſions. I have therefore choſen the former of theſe Methods, and as near as I can, framed my Concluſions from the evidence of Senſe and particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences and Experiments.</p>
            <p>And although it is not impoſſible for me to be miſtaken in ſome of my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Inferences made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; yet I think I have not much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken herein; only one Experiment, which I call a double Trial, <hi>pag. 84.</hi> of the <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiles Nugae,</hi> is ſomewhat obſcurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by me, and not ſo much to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; of which I take notice in my Reply to the 6<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th</hi> Remark</hi> upon that Book.</p>
            <p>I have in the Beginning of this Book ſpent Ten chapters touching the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Motion, Eſſential Forms, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation;</hi> which have a general influence into much of what is ſaid concerning thoſe matters, which often occur in the <hi>Remarks;</hi> and thereby I at once give my ſenſe concerning
<pb facs="tcp:49448:5"/>
thoſe difficult points, and ſave my ſelf the labour of often Repetitions or Anſwers touching things therein delivered.</p>
            <p>The Subject of the Controverſie, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is of no great importance, neither is the fortune of <hi>Greece</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is) concerned whether of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverters Suppoſitions be the trueſt; or whether, it may be, ſome other may be diſcovered truer than any of the former. All that I ſhall ſay touching our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of this nature, is this, That though they are not very profitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of time in the Writers or Readers; yet they may be innocent Diverſions to both, and may be of ſome uſe in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagation of Natural Cauſes and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>Some Favours I muſt deſire of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That he will be contented to bear with ſuch vulgar Expreſſions which ſerve my turn to give account of my Thoughts in a Matter of this Nature; ſuch as are, <hi>Architecture, Cones, Capes, Maſonry,</hi> and twenty ſuch vulgar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb facs="tcp:49448:6"/>
which, it may be, Learned men may think too mean, and repeat them with ſome diſdain.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That though I do many times uſe Expreſſions that are not poliſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Grammatical</hi> or <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> Niceties or Modes, that I may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed herein, and that the Reader will look to the Scope and Drift; and mark at what I aim; and not cavil at bare Terms and Expreſſions, ſo long as the thing they deſign be laid open: This is an unhappineſs that too often befals men that are inquiſitive after Truth; that their Readers or Opponents miſs the ſcope of the Writer, and fall upon Criticiſmes about Words and Forms of Expreſſions. Words are but Signs of Conceptions and Thoughts; and as I have elſewhere ſaid, they perform their Office well enough, when they render our Thoughts intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That he will be content to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend his Cenſure upon Clauſes or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences apart, till he hath peruſed all: It is not poſſible, eſpecially in Diſcourſes
<pb facs="tcp:49448:6"/>
of this Nature, to ſpeak or write all at once. Some things that are but ſhortly or obſcurely delivered, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance omitted in one Sentence, Page, or Paragraph, may be ſupplied or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in another.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S an Introduction to what follows, I ſhall briefly ſet down ſome Obſervations touching Motion of Created Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Beings; for I ſhall not in this place meddle with thoſe more Noble
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49448:9"/>
Beings of Angelical or Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the Humane Soul, which is a Subject of another and higher nature, and not to be meaſured by thoſe ordinary Rules or Reaſons that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Bodies, Matter, and Material Natures.</p>
               <p>We may generally find in all Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Beings the thing called Motion; in ſome of one kind, in ſome of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome more ſimple, ſome more complexed and various; ſome more conſpicuous to ſenſe, as <hi>Local Motion;</hi> ſome leſs conſpicuous, as <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Alteration;</hi> ſome things are moved by others, ſome things ſeem to have the Principle or Original of motion in themſelves, which communicates mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Subject wherein that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple reſides, and alſo to other things by contact of their corporeity or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where as I remember, calls motion or endeavours of it, to be <hi>quaſi vita quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam quae omnibus ineſt, quae Natura con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The primitive Principle or Cauſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49448:9"/>
all Motion is the firſt Mover, the great and glorious Lord of Nature, from whom, as being ſo, all Motion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into created Beings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of cauſality; thoſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Beings that ſeem to have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Principle of Motions in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have that Principle from his <hi>Fiat</hi> and Inſtitution. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of Concurrence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance. There is a perpetual flux from that Fountain of Being that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and ſuſtains thoſe Principles of Motion which he at firſt lodged in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Beings, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ranks, kinds and natures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Durations; and if this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhould withdraw it ſelf but one moment, all the Motion of created Beings would ceaſe and expire.</p>
               <p>Matter it ſelf ſimply conſidered as ſuch, though it be ſuſceptive of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as we daily ſee) is not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate principle of Motion in thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that ſeem to be ſelf-moving, or primitive Movents of other things, according to that Law of Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49448:10"/>
by the Soveraign Lord thereof.</p>
               <p>And this ſeems apparent, among other Reaſons, by theſe that follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Matter in it ſelf, and ſimply conſidered, ſeems to be meerly paſſive, and receptive of active im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from ſomething elſe: It is true, one portion of Matter once ſet in Motion, will by contact put another portion of Matter into Motion. But we are not now upon the ſearch of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Inſtrumentals of Motion, but upon the ſearch of the Principles of ſuch Motions which ſeem primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and immediately to be elicited in any Phyſical Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Matter ſimply conſidered, ſeems to be one kind of uniform Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but diverſified by its Forms, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Modifications, as Weight, Colour, Hardneſs, Softneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Matter of a piece of Gold, and of a piece of Wood, abſtractively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſeems to be the <hi>Materia prima</hi> of the Ancients, and of the ſame nature; and conſequently, if Matter ſimply conſidered were the immediate active
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49448:10"/>
principle of Motion, the Motions of all things would be as ſimple and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form as the Matter it ſelf. But we ſee by daily experience that there are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſeveral Subjects, which have the immediate principle of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in and from themſelves, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what within them that obtains <hi>vicem Moventis,</hi> and are various, differing, differently exerted, and differently ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from the Motions of other Bodies.</p>
               <p>Therefore if there be any things in Nature, that have their Principle of Motion in themſelves, we muſt find out if we can, ſomewhat beſides Matter, that is the immediate root or ſpring of it.</p>
               <p>It is true, the great Maſter in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> tells us, that whatſoever is moved, is moved by another, which would make one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he thought there were no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſelf-moving principle in thoſe Beings we call <hi>Automata,</hi> but only the firſt Mover; and truly with reſpect to the Soveraign Cauſe of all things,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49448:11"/>
that every thing is moved by him that is unmoveable, as I have before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>But that there are created Beings, that by the powerful and ſoveraign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Almighty God, have an immediate Principle of Motion in and from themſelves, is beyond Diſpute.</p>
               <p>A Brute Beaſt poſſibly may be put immediately into Motion by his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and that Appetite excited by the preſence of an Object; and here the Object hath (as I may call it) a Moral Principle of Motion exciting the Appetite, moving the Brute to a nearer approach to the Object. But then in the <hi>Greſſus Brutalis,</hi> it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what within him that gives the Local Motion it ſelf, namely, the <hi>Brutalis Anima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ſame is evident in the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Augmentation and Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vegetables, the motions of Aſcent and Calefaction in Fire, the Motions of Attraction and Averſation in Magnetical Bodies, and the very Motion of Deſcent in heavy Bodies;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49448:11"/>
and infinite more inſtances of Phyſical Bodies, which have an intrinſick principle of exciting and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Motion to the Subjects of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, and to other things: Now touching this internal immediate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Motion, is this Enquiry upon which I am.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A farther Diſquiſition touching the immediate Cauſe of <hi>Motion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter I have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed theſe two things. 1. That there are ſome things that have an active ſelf-moving Principle lodged within them. 2. That Matter ſimply conſidered, is not that immediate ſelf-moving Principle: It remaines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be enquired what that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is.</p>
               <p>The ancient Bi-partition of created Beings was into Subſtance and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49448:12"/>
But this ſeems to me to be too narrow (I am ſtill ſpeaking of created material Exiſtences) and I ſhall not be aſhamed to own <hi>Helmont</hi> for my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer herein, becauſe he ſpeaks with great evidence of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>There ſeems therefore to be a third kind of Exiſtence or Entity participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſome reſpect of the nature of both, and yet differing in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects from both; for indeed it is an Entity among created Beings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Matter, far more noble than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two former, and is that which giveth Life, Vigor, Activity, and Motion, immediately next under the Lord of Nature, to every ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Being.</p>
               <p>And this Entity I call <hi>Vis,</hi> or <hi>Virtus activa,</hi> ſuperadded to Matter, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving immediately thoſe Motions to it, that are ſpecifically appropriate to that <hi>Vis,</hi> or <hi>Virtus Activa,</hi> and without which, Matter would be ſtupid, dull, unactive, and alwayes at reſt in it ſelf, unleſs accidentally moved <hi>ab extrinſeco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although thoſe <hi>Vires</hi> or <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49448:12"/>
activae,</hi> the immediate Principles of Motion in ſuch things as are <hi>Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> are various, and infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified, yet I ſhall inſtance but in few; which nevertheleſs will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to render my ſelf intelligible in what I ſay. And thoſe are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of two ſorts; the firſt of thoſe (the nobleſt below the humane Soul) are thoſe <hi>Vires,</hi> or <hi>Virtutes Eſſentiales,</hi> that are the principal Conſtituents of vital or ſubſtantial Forms. The ſecond are thoſe which are uſually called active qualities, which ſeem to be of a lower nature and allay than the former.</p>
               <p>Under the firſt of theſe Ranks, there are different <hi>Claſſes,</hi> not only gradually, but eſſentially more or leſs perfect than others, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, the <hi>Vis ſentiens &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis</hi> of Animals. 2. The <hi>Vis vegetans &amp; vitalis</hi> of Vegetables, and poſſibly of many Minerals. 3. The <hi>Vis combuſtiva &amp; calefactiva</hi> of Fire. 4. The <hi>Vis attractiva, directiva &amp; communicativa</hi> of Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bodies.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Virtutes</hi> or <hi>Vires Eſſentiales</hi> even of the nobleſt ſort (I mean below
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49448:13"/>
the humane nature) have this prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence above the Matter or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereunto they are united, that they are the immediate, vital, movent principle, that gives a kind of Life or Motion to the Subject wherein they exiſt, which would otherwiſe be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Life or Motion from it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Whether theſe <hi>Vires</hi> or <hi>Virtutes Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiales</hi> are in themſelves defectible or not, may be queſtioned: ſome have thought that they have certain <hi>Termini Temporales</hi> of their Exiſtence, and Operations in themſelves ſimply and abſtractively conſidered, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time languiſh and finally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and ceaſe, as the energy of the Spring of a Watch in its evolution, grows languid, and at laſt utterly ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from any farther evolution or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others have thought, and with great evidence of Reaſon, that there is no decay or natural terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Vis</hi> or <hi>Energia Eſſentialis</hi> it ſelf, but only by the decay or defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or diſſolution of the material <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> to which it is united, or of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49448:13"/>
the Organs which it uſeth in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which being compounded Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are ſubject to decay and diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore the Philoſopher tells us, that if an old man had a young mans eye, he would ſee as well as in his Youth; for the decay is not in the Viſive Faculty, or <hi>Vis</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Eſſentialis ſentiens;</hi> but in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or Subject, or <hi>Subſtratum</hi> of its Operation or Inexiſtence.</p>
               <p>But in ſome reſpects it is inferiour to Matter, and ſeems to participate of the nature of Accidents; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, It neceſſarily according to the common Laws of Nature, requires a material <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or Subject in which it may inexiſt, and to which it may be united: thus the <hi>Vis Sentiens &amp; Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis</hi> is immediately united to the Animal Spirits, or the moſt refined parts of the Animal Nature. The <hi>Vis Vegetans Vitalis</hi> of Vegetables is immediately united to the Vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and <hi>Succus Vitalis</hi> of Vegetables. As to Fire, whether the <hi>Vis Ignea</hi> have a proper <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of its own to which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49448:14"/>
it is united (as the <hi>Vis Sentiens</hi> hath) or whether it hath no other <hi>Subſtratum</hi> but the Body in which it is, as the Cole or Iron, or as the common Body of the Air it ſelf, through which it is univerſally diffuſed, may, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, be queſtionable; yet certainly it hath ſome <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> to which it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and primitively inexiſts, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it ſeems it cannot be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas no portion of Matter is loſt in Nature, or annihilable but by Omnipotence, thoſe <hi>Vires Eſſentiales</hi> are in their individuals extinguiſhed and loſt, and no where in Nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deſtruction, diſſipation or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the neceſſary <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or Subject of their inexiſtence: When the Animal Spirits are wholly diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſſolved, the <hi>Vis Sentiens</hi> of that Animal is loſt, and no where: When water is thrown upon the Cole of Fire, the <hi>Vis Ignea</hi> that was in it, is extinct and <hi>nullibi,</hi> and (as it ſeems) doth not <hi>faceſſere in elementum commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Ignis,</hi> at leaſt if it have not a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> of its own to which it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49448:14"/>
united; and when the Magnet is burnt in the Fire, the <hi>Vis Magnetica</hi> in it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. And the ſame is to be ſaid of that other more ignoble Principle of Motion hereafter mentioned, <hi>viz. Active Qualities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this, as I think, gives us a true notion of the Souls of Brutes, the Forms of Vegetables, of Fire, and other ſubſtantial Forms below the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould ask me what I take the Soul of a brute animal to be, I ſhould ſay, it conſiſted of two eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts; the one, this active <hi>Vis,</hi> or <hi>Virtus Sentiens Animalis,</hi> the Root and Fountain of all its motions, of Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Perception, Phantaſie, Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and Local Motion. And the other is the immediate <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Subſtratum</hi> in which this <hi>Vis Vitalis Sentiens</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> primitively inexiſts, and to which it is primitively united, and by which it communicates it ſelf to the whole <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and theſe are ſome ſelect <hi>Craſis</hi> or Portion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits: For the Animal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49448:15"/>
being a more curious piece than inferiour Subſiſtences, and fuller of variety, therefore there is a more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate and curious method of the union of its Eſſentials than in others: And next to Animals, there is a more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious method of union and colligation of the <hi>Virtus Vitalis</hi> of Vegetables to the more pure and ſubtil vital Spirits, or <hi>Latex Vitalis</hi> of Vegetables.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Vis Ignea</hi> and the <hi>Vis Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netica</hi> ſeem to be immediately united to the whole Fiery or Magnetical Maſs: But yet ſtill the activity of both is owing not to the bare <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Subſtratum</hi> wherein it is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to that incorporeal force, virtue or energy which acts in it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it and by it.</p>
               <p>And upon this accompt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to be underſtood, when in 1. <hi>De Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> he ſtiles the Souls of Brutes to be incorporeal, and yet in other places calls them ſubſtantial, <hi>viz.</hi> they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material and incorporeal with relation to the <hi>Vis</hi> or <hi>Virtus Eſſentialis activa,</hi> which is the regnant and nobleſt part
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49448:15"/>
of them; but they are ſubſtantial, and not only ſo, but material in relation to the <hi>prima Hypostaſis</hi> or <hi>Primum Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum,</hi> the Animal Spirits, whereunto this <hi>Vis Activa</hi> is united, or rather ſome <hi>Nodus</hi> or concrement of a refined Subſtance, which is as it were the root or <hi>Focus</hi> of theſe Spirits, that like ſo many Branches, are derived from it, through the Nerves, and by them communicated to the whole <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although I do here induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly omit the Examination of the Nature of the Humane or Reaſonable Soul; yet I cannot omit this ſpecial obſervation of the diſcrimination of the Humane Soul from the Souls of Brutes, <hi>viz.</hi> that although the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate faculties of the Sentient or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Soul be admitted indefectible in themſelves, yet their <hi>prima Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or immediate ſubject of their inexiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is corruptible, and ſubject to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation; but the appropriate powers or faculties of the reaſonable Soul, namely, Intellect and Will, are not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49448:16"/>
only indefectible powers, but alſo the <hi>prima Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>primum Subſtratum</hi> of their inexiſtence is by the Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination an indefectible <hi>Subſtratum;</hi> namely a pure, immaterial and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Subſtance, and the union thereunto indiſſoluble; whereby it comes to paſs that the Humane Soul is immortal, and preſerved both in its Eſſence, Exiſtence, Perſonality and in duration after the diſſolution of the Body. 1. Its <hi>Virtus</hi> or <hi>Vis</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectible. 2. The <hi>Prima Hypoſtaſis</hi> incorruptible. 3. The Union of both indiſſoluble by natural power.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning the firſt ſort of Active Principles in ſelf-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Automata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of motive Principles are <hi>Active Qualities,</hi> as they are commonly called; which, though poſſibly ſome of them may be the ſame with the former, eſſentiating Active Forms, yet ſome may be ſuch as are of a ſecond and more inferiour allay, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the primitive forms themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49448:16"/>I ſhall inſtance in two only. 1. In that of Heat. 2. In that of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>As to the former, it is evident that Heat (not only that which is ſo to the touch, but is ſuch virtually, as in Vegetables and Minerals) hath a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of exciting Motion both in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its inexiſtence, and in other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as appears in the Fermentation of Liquors and other things which are put into motion by that virtual heat that reſides in its particles, though not hot to the touch.</p>
               <p>Whether Cold be of any poſitive nature, and ſo have a poſitive activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its own, or whether it be an abſence only of heat, either totally, as in <hi>ſummè frigidis,</hi> if any ſuch be; or partially, according to the degrees of heat abated or removed, I ſhall not here diſpute; for I only propound ſome Inſtances, to render what I write intelligible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Gravity,</hi> or that Principle in heavy bodies that inclines them <hi>ab intrinſeco,</hi> to deſcend, this ſeems to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49448:17"/>
a quality of moſt tangible bodies that we converſe with, if not of all; for ſome contend that there is no ſuch thing in nature as ſimple Levity (at leaſt in any thing but Fire) but only ſome bodies are <hi>minus gravia</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and urged to aſcend by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or circumpulſion of other bodies more heavy; this is not my buſineſs at this time to examine.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gravity</hi> I take to be a quality intrinſick to heavy bodies at leaſt, in our inferiour Syſtem of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gravitation,</hi> which is a kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond act, may not altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be applied to motions of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent terminations, becauſe it ſeems to be only <hi>niſus</hi> or <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> which may have different terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>viz.</hi> upward, or downward, or laterally, and ariſe from different cauſes; but <hi>Gravity</hi> it ſelf, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a diſpoſition, propenſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in heavy bodies to deſcend, is not unfitly ſtiled a quality, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick quality.</p>
               <p>For we may obſerve in the motions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49448:17"/>
of natural bodies, ſome are from an extrinſecal cauſe or accidental; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſing from the preſſure of other bodies, ſometimes from the poſition of the bodies themſelves; as Water will be driven up perpendicularly by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer; as in Water-Engines; it will move collaterally or <hi>per declive,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its own fluid nature, or by its poſition upon a declining Plain. But when all Obſtacles of that nature are removed, a heavy body, as ſuch, will move by a right Line to the Center, from that inherent quality of <hi>gravity,</hi> which is intrinſick to it, and puts it into motion; ſo that I am unjuſtly blamed for ſaying <hi>Gravity</hi> is a quality inclining bodies to deſcend to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet at the ſame time ſaying, that it is not improper to ſay that things may gravitate upward or late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as well as downward; for when heavy bodies have another terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than downward, it is by reaſon of ſome other intervention of ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, or from ſome other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in bodies, accompanying their <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49448:18"/>
as <hi>Fluidity</hi> in Water or Air, which gives them a <hi>Niſus ad motum</hi> (which is <hi>gravitation</hi>) of a differing termination from that of bodies pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered as heavy. But when the motion proceeds ſimply and ſolely from that active quality of <hi>gravity,</hi> its <hi>niſus ad motum,</hi> which is its <hi>gravitation,</hi> is ſimply <hi>in linea recta ad centrum,</hi> which I often call a central motion or direction: This any fair Remarker might have eaſily ſeen, without char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Second Chapter of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> with a contradiction, where indeed there is none.</p>
               <p>And therefore in this place I cannot chuſe but take notice of two extreams in the modern Philoſophy: Some are ſo wholly intent upon vital and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Principles, that they contend even almoſt againſt all Mechanical motions of Bodies, which I ſhall have occaſion hereafter to meet with.</p>
               <p>Again, Others are ſo greatly taken up with the thoughts of Matter and Mechanical Motions, that they whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exterminate any intrinſick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49448:18"/>
of motion, and reſolve them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into Matter and its modifications, and Mechaniſm and Mechanical moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſuppoſe that there are no ſuch things as I call <hi>Active Forms</hi> (at leaſt excepting the Humane Soul, though ſome venture hard at that alſo) but that all <hi>Active Forms</hi> and their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals are only various modifications of Matter, as Size, Figure, Poſition, Texture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I think is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be true; for though the Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Matter may give variety of accidental or external Forms, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſing from the texture of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Figure, Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thoſe various modifications may in relation not only to the powers of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Faculty, but to other Bodies, make various impreſſions, as we ſee is done in ſome tangible effects; as by ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, roughneſs, hardneſs, ſoftneſs, ſharpneſs, bluntneſs, and the like: whereby ſometimes other bodies are affected; yet they can never arrive to thoſe greater activities which we ſee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49448:19"/>
in Phyſical Bodies, as Senſe, Life, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Motions of ſeveral kinds, nor can be productive of the principles thereof; for the modifications of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can never raiſe it to ſuch an activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as of it ſelf it is not capable of, but requires the union of ſome nobler active entity to quicken and actuate it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſuppoſe that all the moſt noble motions, as well of Senſe as Life in Animals and Vegetables, are nothing elſe but Mechaniſm, and not from any intrinſick active principle, which we uſually call the ſentient and vegetable Soul; nay, ſome by a vain petulancy have gone ſo far as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the noble faculties and motions of the rational Soul, as Intellection, Ratiocination and Memory, into a bare Mechaniſm, and Modification, and Motion of Particles of Matter, ſuch extravagancies as theſe need no other confutation but our very Senſes, in the obſervation of the curious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, inſtincts, operations and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the animal and vegetable ſouls
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49448:19"/>
and faculties, and the unevident and unintelligible explications that theſe men offer for the ſupport of their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; which is not my buſineſs here at large to examine.</p>
               <p>Now touching the production of theſe active ſelf-moving Principles, which I call <hi>Vires,</hi> or <hi>Virtutes activae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to their primitive inſtitution and production, there cannot poſſibly, as I think, be aſſigned any other than that conſtitution, inſtitution and communication which they received from the great Creator of all things, and that Law which he annexed and gave them in their firſt forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as to the ſubſequent and phyſical production of theſe active principles, in the common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary track of Nature, they are various, according to the methods ſetled by the ſame Divine Law; ſuch as are Generation, the Irradiation of the Heavens and Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, eſpecially the Sun, the various mixtures of ſimple and compounded
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49448:20"/>
bodies, and therewith of their eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms and active Qualities, whereby there ariſe many times ſuch Forms and Qualities as are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called equivocal, anomalous, or of various modifications. But the origination of Forms and Active Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, is a large Theme, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be proſecuted farther by me in this place.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TO ſolve or give an account of divers motions in Nature, there have been thoſe, that not content with the particular inherent active Principles in particular Subjects, as is mentioned in the former Chapters, have ſuppoſed certain more Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and indeed nobler Exiſtences, that manage the various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> and his School and after him, the <hi>Arabian</hi> Philoſophers, eſpecially <hi>Avicen,</hi> ſuppoſed an intelligent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubordinate to Almighty God, to preſide and manage the Univerſe;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49448:21"/>
which they call <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi> as they aſſign one common intelligent Nature, and depute it to the excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, action and regiment of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul in his intellective opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they call <hi>intellectus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others that have aſſigned ſeveral Syſtemes of the world, each having a ſpecial Province, which they ſtile <hi>Vortices,</hi> or <hi>Syſtemata,</hi> aſſign a certain common intelligent Nature to be, as it were, the common Soul of every particular <hi>Vortex,</hi> and thus our <hi>Vortex,</hi> whoſe Center they ſuppoſe to be the Sun, and the terms of extent to reach the remoteſt Limits of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and his Orb hath its <hi>Anima vorticis</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and motions within that <hi>Vortex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others again have ſubſtituted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principle, not altogether unlike the firſt; but differing in name, and ſome qualifications. This they call <hi>Principium Hylarchicum,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Spiritus Naturae,</hi> which though they make not an intelligent being, yet
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49448:21"/>
they make it plaſtick, vital, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, and poſſibly ſentient; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever accommodated to the regiment of Matter in the beſt and moſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and convenient way; and this I take it, they ſuppoſe a ſubordinate regent principle, ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the <hi>Archeus</hi> of <hi>Helmont,</hi> which is ſuppoſed a middle principle, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening between the Souls of Animals and their Body, and an immediate active inſtrument in its motions and operations.</p>
               <p>If by this <hi>Principium Hylarchicum,</hi> theſe men would underſtand the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Creator and Lord of the world (as many of the Ancients underſtood the <hi>Anima mundi)</hi> who is intimately preſent with all his Works, and by a continual influx ſupports them in their being and motions, according to the moſt wiſe Laws and Inſtitutions that he hath eſtabliſhed for them and fixed in them: Or if by the <hi>Spiritus Naturae</hi> they underſtand thoſe active eſſential Virtues communicated to every created Being by the Glorious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49448:22"/>
God, and that ſtatuminated Law, and Order, and Method, and Oeconomy which he hath given them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which thoſe active princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he hath planted in them, do exert and operate; this will be readily agreed to them as moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and in a great meaſure evident, not only to our Reaſon, but to our very Senſe and Experience, and the Diſpute about words, would ceaſe, and be at reſt.</p>
               <p>But the ſubſtitution of ſuch a vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, immaterial, common Principle, to regulate, order, excite and govern Matter, and its motions ſubordinate to Almighty God, a common Spirit, and different from the particular active principles variouſly implanted in Phyſical Bodies, though it be a pleaſant ſuppoſition, yet it is difficult, if not impoſſible to evince to any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſatisfaction. Only I muſt needs ſay, that as Suppoſitions of this nature, that are founded upon Notions, are for the moſt part unacceſſible by thoſe common <hi>Media</hi> whereby things are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49448:22"/>
to be proved to humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo upon the ſame account they are difficult to be confuted: If any man ſhould tell me that the Moon were a Globe of Water, as he could never prove it, ſo I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſprove it, unleſs I had ſuch <hi>Media</hi> of acceſs to that Body, that could to my Senſe and Experience confute it; and therefore in ſuch caſes the proof muſt be caſt upon the aſſertor</p>
               <p>Yet there ſeem to be ſome things that render this Suppoſition not very credible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it ſeems an unneceſſary multiplication of beings, whoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are well enough ſupplied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; namely, by the energy of the glorious God, and thoſe ſpecial active Principles that he hath lodged in almoſt all created Natures, and thoſe Inſtitutions and Laws that he hath alligated and annexed to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Works of his Creation, and the Syſtemes and Syntaxes of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But principally upon a ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49448:23"/>
it will appear that moſt of theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in nature and motion, are performed by the active principles, reſiding in particular Subjects, or by the uſual and neceſſary Mechaniſm of bodies, without our calling to their immediate performance this ſuppoſed Spirit of nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, It is very difficult to form to our ſelves a notion of this Spirits Nature, that may have any probable certainty: let us take but theſe few difficulties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it a diſtinct, ſelf-ſubſiſting Spirit, ſeparated from Matter? or is it a kind of common Soul or Form reſiding in the Univerſe, as the Soul of a Brute reſides in his Body, and united to it by a wonderful union? If it be the former, it is a kind of Angelick Nature, not united to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but acting ſeparately upon it, ſubſiſting without it, and is in all probability an Intelligence. If the latter, it were fit to know whether it were an immaterial Form, as the Humane Soul; and then perchance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49448:23"/>
we ſhould give it too great a prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Or is it a material Form, as that of Brutes? And then it will be worth knowing whether it hath the like perfection of Senſe, or be of a lower allay, and only vital, like thoſe of Vegetables. Or is it a kind of connatural Senſe, ſuted to all material Beings, together with a ſentient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and appetite, proportionate to the Nature of every material or ſubſtantial created being, as <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> and our learned Countriman hath lately aſſerted. Whatever it be, we are perfectly in the dark to form any conception of it with any tolerable evidence or ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Again 2. Are there other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or ſpecifical Forms in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Claſſes</hi> of material Exiſtences, as Animals, Vegetables, Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that exert the ſeveral operations that ſeem ſpecifical to their Natures, but individuated in the ſeveral indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual exiſtences, Or is this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpirit of Nature that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts all theſe Operations which are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49448:24"/>
therefore only diverſified by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification of the compoſitions of thoſe bodies in which and through which they are exerted, as the common Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Organ; and the breath thereof gives the various ſounds in the Organ-Pipe, according to their Figures, Stops or Amplitudes? If we ſuppoſe the former, we ſeem to multiply Entities without neceſſity; if the latter, we deſtroy all that we are building, and make all the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and Vegetables, and Material Beings in the Univerſe (if this Spirit be univerſal) or in this lower World (if ſingly belonging to this Syſteme) to be nothing elſe but pure mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical pieces, without any ſentient or vital principle of their own, but only are the dead Tools and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this ſpirit of Nature; ſuch difficulties as theſe would be cleared, to give us ſome <hi>Idea</hi> or probable fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed notion of this Spirit of Nature, or <hi>Hylarchical Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now if we ſhould ſuppoſe the interpoſition of this common Spirit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49448:24"/>
of Nature in ſome <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of particular Bodies, yet it ſeems neceſſary for us to ſuppoſe theſe two things in the exertions thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it doth not immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, unleſs upon great emergencies, and to deliver the things of Nature from ſome important inconvenience, which without ſo effectual an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition would befall them; as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the continuity of the parts of the Univerſe, or avoid vacuity, and the like, and not upon thoſe little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which are of no conſideration and importance, whether they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or ſupplied or not; ſuch as are the emergency of a Rundle of light Wood from the bottom of the Water, or the ſuſtaining of a weight, or attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the <hi>Embolus</hi> of a Syringe or Air-Pump, or the keeping up of the <hi>Valve</hi> or <hi>Operculum</hi> in the lower end of a Tube immerſed in Water. Theſe and the like Inſtances are of ſo ſmall concernment to the good of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, or to the Nature of Phyſical Bodies, that they were ſcarce worthy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49448:25"/>
the acceſs of the noble Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Nodi vix tali vindice digni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That if this Spirit of Nature doth at any time interpoſe, yet it rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all, acts by violent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions, but pacately, and as much as may be, in conſonance to the regular diſpoſition of Bodies; and therefore it is, that even in Animals, where their motion is exerted by a clear, internal, vital, ſentient princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it doth for the moſt part act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, and in the beſt Mechaniſm ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, their Bodies, Nerves, Bones, Muſcles are ordered by a rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mechaniſm for the exerting of thoſe motions, and the motions themſelves performed by thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, by the exploſion and retraction of the Spirits in their ſeveral veſſels, with admirable order and artifice, as will appear to any that will beſtow the pains to read <hi>Galen, De uſu Partium,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle, De Greſſu Animalium;</hi> and therefore we have much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think that this ſuppoſed noble Spirit, the Spirit of Nature, acts not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49448:25"/>
at random, or convulſively, or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, but according to the beſt Rules and mechanical methods appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to ſuch motions as it doth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally exert.</p>
               <p>So that if we ſhould never ſo much allow of the Spirit of Nature, and its interpoſitions, yet ſtill the neceſſary inſtruments, modes and methods of its motion according to Mechanical Rules, muſt ſtill be ſought after.</p>
               <p>For it would be a pitiful refuge for a man pretending to Philoſophy, to give this general ſolution to all <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Nature, that this is ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit of Nature thus orders it; without giving ſome probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the particular means or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by which the Spirit of Nature ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it, and likewiſe of the end, uſe and deſign of the Spirit of Nature in what it thus effects.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt and ſecond, Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacon</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria Denſi &amp; Rari,</hi> hath in a great meaſure fitted them to my hand; whoſe Method I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in follow.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Of the former ſort, ſome are more fixt, and of a more ſetled conſiſtence,

               <p>Although tangible Bodies may be capable of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> at leaſt in ſome of the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations thereof hereafter deſcribed, yet I ſhall not much meddle with them, unleſs it be ſuch as be fluid, becauſe not to my preſent purpoſe; and becauſe what is hereafter ſaid touching the <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> of ſome Fluids, and of thoſe <hi>Pneumatica,</hi> will in ſome meaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate ſomewhat concerning the <hi>Condenſation</hi> or <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of other tangible Bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation,</hi> thus much firſt in general
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49448:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is to be ſaid, <hi>Rarefaction</hi> is when the ſame Body, or at leaſt portion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Subſtance, takes up a greater external dimenſion, or a larger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing trine dimenſion, <hi>viz.</hi> of breadth, length and depth than it had before.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary, <hi>Condenſation</hi> is when the ſame Body or portion of material Subſtance takes up a leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal dimenſion than it had before; this may ſuffice as the common <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it ſtands objected to our ſenſe; though when we come to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, this general ſenſible deſcription of either will not ſerve alwayes the Subject, nor ſufficiently explicate it.</p>
               <p>Some Appearances in Bodies look like <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> which indeed are not ſuch, but only in appearance; ſuch as are <hi>Augmentation of Bodies</hi> by an unperceptible acceſſion of new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in <hi>Augmentation;</hi> ſometimes by aſſimilation of contiguous matter into its own conſiſtence, ſometimes by the apertures or diſtraction of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49448:28"/>
parts of a Body, and intruſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, or attraction of other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a different Nature, Quality, or Texture, or of the ſame Nature, Quality or Texture with it ſelf; theſe are not truly thoſe kinds of <hi>Rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> whereof our enquiry is inſtituted; for though the <hi>Moles</hi> or Bulk ſeem to be extended and enlarged, yet the true Bulk of the ſame Matter is the ſame as before, though it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a different configuration or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>Again, on the contrary, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in Bodies, look like <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation;</hi> but in truth are not ſuch; as when part of a Body is emitted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by perſpiration or diſſolution of ſome of its more ſubtil parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that which remaineth, taketh up leſs circuit or bulk, or where ſome of its parts are firſt ſubtilized, and then diſmiſſed, and ſome other Inſtances of like kind may be given; but theſe are not true and real <hi>Condenſations;</hi> for the entire matter remaines not in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy condenſed, as was before, but is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49448:28"/>
diminiſhed: Theſe therefore are not the <hi>Rarefactions</hi> and <hi>Condenſations</hi> whereof the Enquiry proceeds; for the ſame Body in both inſtances hold the ſame true ſpace it had before, though the extream appearing Limits ſeem to be altered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Queſtion therefore in hand is, touching that kind of <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> where the ſame Body or portion of material Subſtance, without acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of more or other bodily matter, yet takes up a larger ſpace than it did before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And where it doth not only take up a larger exterior compaſs, circuit or ſuperficies; but where it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fills thoſe intrinſick ſpaces which are within the circuit of that extent, as fully as it did before. For if for the purpoſe, a portion of Air of a Cubique Figure ſix inches ſquare, do ſwell to a Cubique Dimenſion of ſeven inches ſquare, yet if in that very dilatation there be as great a disjunction or divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the parts of the Air within the cubique ſpace of ſix inches, as amounts
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49448:29"/>
to that external acceſſion of one inch, whereby it becomes a Cube of ſeven inches ſquare, here is no true <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> nor is the ſpace enlarged, but only the Figure of the ſame Body, and of its Extention altered.</p>
               <p>If an Artificer take a little Cylinder of Silver of two inches long, and half an inch round, and guild it, he will by his Art draw out this little Bar into 40 yards or more of fine Silver Thred, though the length be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet the breadth is diminiſhed, and the Silver Thred takes up no more true extent of its trine dimenſion than it had before; nay, which is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the extent of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Silver is not enlarged, though the figure be altered; which appears by this, that every part of the <hi>Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the Silver thred will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue guilt as it was in the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Ingot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon the ſame account it is on the other ſide, when a Body or portion of material Subſtance is ſaid truly to be <hi>condenſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49448:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. It muſt be the ſame portion of matter that was before, without any diminution of its parts, or of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it that contributed to its former <hi>Moles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame matter without any diminution, muſt really take up leſs room or ſpace than it did before; for if it only take up a leſs <hi>Superficies</hi> or external extent, yet withal it makes up ſpaces or poroſities within the compaſs of that external extent, which before was not filled by it ſelf, but either was ſimply empty of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or only filled with ſuch a body as now recedes, and gives way to the body ſuppoſed to be condenſed, to take it up, then here is only a change of the ſpace it had before, and of its configuration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a leſs ſpace really taken up as commenſurate to that body that is ſuppoſed to be condenſed. So that the Queſtion between the ancient and modern Philoſophy, is not ſo much <hi>de modo,</hi> how <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Rarefaction</hi> is made, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the thing it ſelf, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49448:30"/>
and truly there be any ſuch thing or affection in bodies as <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation;</hi> the latter Philoſophy in truth denying the thing, when they give it ſuch an explication as really and in truth conſiſts not with it; as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>This being therefore the ſtate of the Notion of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> in its true explication, we are to conſider, what bodies, or motions in bodies are ſuch as are applicable to the Argument in hand.</p>
               <p>The ſpecial Inſtances that I ſhall uſe are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſation</hi> of bodies by Tranſmutation; thus Water by <hi>Rarefaction</hi> is ſometimes changed into Air, which hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a greater extenſion than it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by about 900 times; and Air by <hi>Condenſation</hi> is changed into Water, and thereby loſeth by contraction a like proportion of ſpace than it had before. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle in</hi> 4. <hi>Phyſ. cap. 9.</hi> and the great <hi>Verulam, in Hiſtoria Denſi &amp; Rari, pag.</hi> 88.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49448:30"/>2. The <hi>Rarefaction</hi> that is cauſed by external violence, as in the <hi>Air-Pump,</hi> in the <hi>Cacabus Evacuatorius,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburg</hi> Engin, this is a <hi>Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> by Tenſion, whereby the Air is dilated, not only in its external Bulk, but in all the parts of it, and in its internal, as well as external parts and dimenſions. And thus <hi>Merſennus</hi> and others tell us, Air may be dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to near 70 times its former and natural extent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Condenſation</hi> that is made by Compreſſion: Some there are that think Water is thus contractible and condenſible by compreſſion: The ſame <hi>Verulam, ubi ſupra,</hi> pag. 99. tells us, that taking a Leaden hollow Globe, and fill it with Water, and then ſtrongly ſtop the Orifice which took in the Water, and compreſs the Globe in a ſtrong Preſſer, whereby it may be reduced to an eighth part of its former dimenſion, the Water will ſuſtain that contraction; but if it be preſſed farther, the Water will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelf through the Globe <hi>ad
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49448:31"/>
modum parvi imbris.</hi> It is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but it might do ſo from its firſt compreſſion, though the ſtreams, by reaſon of their exility, were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the Eye, as the emanation of <hi>effluvia</hi> through the pores of the bodies of Animals, electrical effluxes, or the Odors of Herbs; for Water, though fluid, ſeems very impatient of <hi>Condenſation</hi> by compreſſion; yet it is not impoſſible, if under a very ſtrong preſſure; but to the very eye it appears capable of dilatation by Tenſion in its diſcharge of it ſelf by Bubbles, upon a ſtrong Tenſion.</p>
               <p>But howſoever it is with Water, it is apparent that Air is capable of condenſation and contraction by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; this appears viſibly in the compreſſion of the Air by Wind-Guns, and the careful injection of water by a well ordered Syringe in an empty <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> ſo that Air by theſe means may be contracted into a ſeventh, nay poſſibly a ſeventieth part of its natural ſpace or dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49448:31"/>4. The <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dilatation of Bodies by Heat or Fire: Thus Water it ſelf is rarefied and extended into Vapours by Heat. The Lord <hi>Verulam, ubi ſupra,</hi> pag. 28. gives us a notable Inſtance, by taking a Vial-Glaſs holding an ounce, filling it half full of Spirit of Wine, then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an empty Bladder that held about 8 pints, and tying it about the neck of the Vial ſtrictly, the Spirit of Wine heated upon the Coals, the <hi>Aura Spiritus Vini</hi> filled the Bladder, and yet only ſix penny weight of the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> ſpent, which did not amount to the 40th. part of a pint, yet filled the Bladder of 8 pints with its rarified Air. And although this Inſtance be in the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which is fuller of ſubtil Matter than the like quantity of Water, yet it will hold its proportion with the Fumes or Vapours of Water.</p>
               <p>And of the like kind is the <hi>Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> by Ignition in the Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where a grain of Gunpowder fired, will expand above a thouſand
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49448:32"/>
times its former dimenſion and more.</p>
               <p>But that which is moſt obvious to Senſe, and moſt appoſite to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore will be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of moſt of my enſuing applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is, the <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of <hi>Air</hi> by heat, whereby it may gain an expanſion of above 70 times its natural ſize and dimenſion, as is eaſily found by the ſtrong heating of a ſtrong Braſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave Globe, which if the included Air have no vent, will break it, and if it have a vent, and after it is ſtrongly heated, caſt into a Veſſel of Water, it will ſoon diſcover the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of its dilatation by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction that it receives from the cold Water, and by the quantity of Water it ſucks in upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Condenſation</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential contraction that the Air re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by the conſtipation of it by Cold, eſpecially after a ſtrong dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but although there be no ſuch preceding dilatation or expanſion of the Air by heat, yet it is viſible
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49448:32"/>
in Weather-Glaſſes, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of that nature, that the Air is contracted in its dimenſion, by the ambient Cold, from what it uſually hath at other times.</p>

               <p>TO purſue all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Condenſation</hi> and <hi>Rarefaction</hi> in its full Latitude, were too long a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and not ſo much conducible to my purpoſe: I ſhall therefore take up thoſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that are apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident to Senſe in the <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation</hi> of Air; for the due diſcuſſion of that ſingle Subject will give an eſtimate and explication of other <hi>Rarefactions</hi> and <hi>Condenſations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is evident to our very Senſes, that a ſmaller portion of Air, ſuppoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49448:33"/>
a Cubique Foot in a Veſſel, being ratified by heat, will take up a far greater ſpace than it did before ſuch application, and the like will be when it is done by Tenſion, as in the <hi>Air-Pump,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburg-Engin;</hi> for when a great part of the Air is driven out by Heat, in the one Inſtance, and drawn out by Traction, in the other; yet it is evident to Senſe, that the Receiver or other Veſſel remains full of a very rare and extended Air; for ſenſibly no other Subſtance ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is evident to Senſe, that this diſtenſion of the Air is not only in the <hi>Extima Superficies,</hi> but in all the very internal parts of it; for it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to our Senſe, that it hath a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effect as well upon the Birds, Water, or other Body, placed in the middle of the Cavity of the Receiver, as in thoſe that are conterminous to the Sides of it, as appears in thoſe many Inſtances given by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in 21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Experiments. And unleſs the whole Body were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49448:33"/>
every where and every way, it were impoſſible that a little portion of Air included in a Bladder, ſhould encreaſe its bulk by Heat, to ten times its extenſion, as it will do, and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to our Sight by the ample di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention of the Bladder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is apparent to our Senſe, that if the Air be rarified by Heat in any cloſe Veſſel, as the Heat, which is the cauſe of its <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> decays, ſo the Air endeavours its contraction, to gain its primitive ſize, which it then attains, when the Heat is perfectly gone out, if it be not impeded by the cloſeneſs of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>This is viſible in <hi>Weather-Glaſſes</hi> of 22 inches long; whereby, when for the purpoſe, the Water riſeth to ten Inches, and leaves twelve inches of Air in the Head of the Glaſs, the warm hand laid upon the Head of the Glaſs, will depreſs the Water, by expanding the included Air two or three inches; but the Hand being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Air will contract it ſelf to its former Staple, and ſo the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49448:34"/>
Water will riſe to ten, as before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is evident to Senſe, that the Air contracting it ſelf, doth by that which is called by ſome, <hi>Motus nexus,</hi> lay hold of the inward ſides of a cloſe Veſſel containing and ſtrictly impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning it; and if they be otherwiſe ſeverable, yet the ſtrong contraction of the filaments of the Air holds them together, as appears abundantly by the Inſtance of the <hi>Magdeburg Hemiſpheres,</hi> mentioned at large in the 18th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Obſervations</hi> upon the <hi>Tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellian Experiment,</hi> and other Inſtances of the like Nature, given in that Book.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is evident to Senſe, that in that ſtrong coheſion of the Filaments of the Air to the ſides of the Veſſel, when by the decay of Heat, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it ſelf with a <hi>motus</hi> or <hi>conatus</hi> of reſtitution, and with it the ambient Veſſel by a <hi>motus nexus,</hi> yet if a ſmall degree of Heat be moved to the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that contraction is relaxed, and the Veſſels fall aſunder; and the like is done by the ſmalleſt admiſſion of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49448:34"/>
the free or ſolute Air, though through a Pin-hole; for by the Heat the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air is again dilated, left lax, as before it grew cold, and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of foreign Air, the included Air is relieved gradually to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion as is natural to it, and as it had before its <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It is evident to Senſe, that upon the ſmalleſt Pin-hole made in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel where the Air is, that thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and endeavours its reſtitution, either upon Tenſion, or upon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold after <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> the Air thus tenſed or contracting it ſelf, will greedily ſuck in the foreign Air, yea, or Water, for its relief againſt that Tenſion that it is under.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In <hi>Condenſation</hi> of Air, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by compreſſion, it is apparent, that the Air takes up, or may take up a far leſs room than is natural to it, as appears in Wind-guns or <hi>Aeoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. It is alſo apparent to Senſe, that the compreſſed Air in thoſe Inſtances,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49448:35"/>
endeavours with great ſtrength and force its relaxation from this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in ſo much as if it can get liberty, it will caſt out a Bullet with great force in Wind-guns, and in <hi>Aeolipiles</hi> well made, and well char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Water, by a Syringe it will throw up the Water above twenty foot high.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are as evident to our Senſe of Sight and Touch, as any thing we ſee or feel; and though there is difference among the Learned in the ſolution or manner of explication of theſe <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> yet the effects themſelves are plain and ſenſible, and do give a ſenſible demonſtration that ſurely there is ſome alteration of the ſtate of this Body of the Air, or of its Texture or Fabrick under theſe various Appearances, which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But whether they are really ſuch, or how made or ordered, will be the Subject of farther Enquiry.</p>

                  <hi>RArity</hi> and <hi>Denſity</hi> of Bodies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it terminate in a greater or leſſer dimenſion or extent, which properly reſpects Quantity, yet they ſeem in themſelves to be but various Paſſions, Affections or Qualities of Bodies ariſing from their different Textures, either more craſs or more ſubtil: And <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Bodies ſeems to be thoſe ſeveral Motions towards theſe Qualities of <hi>Rarity</hi> or <hi>Denſity,</hi> cauſed for the moſt part by ſome external or adventitious Agent, which changeth and altereth the Texture of any Body whereby it aſſumes thoſe Qualities of <hi>Rarity</hi> or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49448:36"/>
                  <hi>Denſity</hi> different from its own natural conſtitution, and ſutable to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Texture they do for the time undergo.</p>
               <p>There have been various Solutions or Explications of theſe apparent <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of <hi>Condenſation</hi> and <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> which I ſhall in the next place conſider; holding my ſelf to that of the Air, either by compreſſion, in caſe of <hi>Condenſation,</hi> or by expanſion by Heat, or by Tenſion by force, in caſe of <hi>Rarefaction;</hi> becauſe this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Air, is moſt obvious to Senſe, and doth in a great meaſure explain the <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſation</hi> or other Bodies capable of thoſe Affections.</p>
               <p>Theſe Methods of Solutions of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that have been taken up by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parties, are principally three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of thoſe that ſuppoſe the ſame to be performed by reaſon of interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vacuities, Poroſities, or Spaces, empty of all body interpoſed between aery particles, which in caſes of <hi>Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49448:36"/>
are made wider by a kind of divulſion or greater apertures of the particles of Air, or other bodies rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, whereby the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of the aerie Particles are greater, and thoſe empty interſperſed Vacuities made lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and in caſe of <hi>Condenſation,</hi> the aerie Particles are crouded cloſer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and thoſe empty ſpaces or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtitia</hi> made leſs by reception of thoſe particles of Air into thoſe Vacuities, in a cloſer poſture or conjunction than they were before ſuch compreſſion, conſtipation or condenſation; and this I call the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Solution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of thoſe that admit no Vacuities at all in the Univerſe, but that all places or ſpaces are full of ſome body or other, but that in the <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of the Air, whether by Heat (which I call ſimple Rarefection or Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) or by a forcible diſtraction or divulſion of the particles of ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied or expanded body by force, which I call Tenſion, thoſe particles of the extended or rarefied body, are removed to a greater diſtance one from

another, and as they are ſo removed, other more ſubtil, corporeal particles do interpoſe gradually, and fill up thoſe <hi>Interſtitia;</hi> and in caſe of <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> the more ſubtil parts with which all bodies are furniſhed, but eſpecially the Air, are driven out by compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and take up a temporary reſidence at leaſt in the conterminous Air. And this I call the <hi>Carteſian Solution;</hi> though this, as ſhall be ſhewn, have ſome variation in the manner of its expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>But though theſe methods differ in the application to the matter in hand, yet they both much agree in this, that the firſt material Principles of Bodies are certain minute Corpuſcles or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; which, though they are really bodies, and therefore Mathematically diviſible, yet they are ſo minute, that phyſically and actually they are indiviſible; and therefore in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hard and unfrangible into leſſer portions. This I ſhall examine hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſeventh and eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49448:37"/>3. The third Solution is that of the ancient Philoſophers, and ſome other of the Modern, which ſuppoſe that <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Denſity</hi> are really natural Affections or Qualities of Phyſical bodies, and that <hi>Rarefaction</hi> is a real expanſion of the very entire <hi>Moles</hi> of the body truly rarefied; and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation</hi> is a real contraction of the whole dimenſion of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, namely, where it is truly and formally a true <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> as the Queſtion is above ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter? And this I call the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian Solution;</hi> and ſeems to me the trueſt, in the manner hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, Touching the firſt of theſe <hi>Solutions,</hi> by interſperſed Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities: This, though it doth in truth take away the true Notion of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> as it is before ſtated; for ſtill the ſame body holds but the ſame quantity of ſpace, though in different poſition or ubica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its parts, yet I muſt needs ſay,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49448:38"/>
were the ſuppoſition of interſperſed Vacuities true, would in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (though not altogether) ſalve many of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are theſe two grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that I think render this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> impoſſible to be true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſeems to me utterly untrue, that there are any ſuch interſperſed Vacuities, wholly deſtitute of Body, either in the Air or any other Body, and herein the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and I agree. And that which renders this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition untrue, is that excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration improved by Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> in his <hi>History of Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there were ſuch interſperſed Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities, it muſt neceſſarily follow that thoſe Bodies of an equal <hi>Superficies,</hi> that are more rare, muſt have more or greater interſperſions of ſuch Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than ſuch as are more denſe; or which is all one, the ſame <hi>Moles</hi> of body that is more denſe, muſt needs have more of matter or body in it than that which is more rare; or which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49448:38"/>
ſeems to be equally conſequential, that where the body is more weighty, the ſame external <hi>Moles</hi> of the more weighty body muſt needs have more of body, and leſs of interſperſed Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuities than that which is more light, where the external <hi>Moles</hi> of either is equal.</p>
               <p>And therefore a Cubique Foot of Gold muſt have more of Body, and leſs of interſperſed Vacuities than the like Cubique Foot of Silver, and that than the like Cubique Foot of Water; and that than the like Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique Foot of Air.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria Denſi &amp; Rari,</hi> pag. 8 <hi>&amp;</hi> 9, by an exact computation, gives us the Eſtimate of the diſproportion of Weight of the ſame extrinſick <hi>Moles</hi> of ſeveral bodies; whereby he finds that a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pure Gold reduced into a Cubical Figure or <hi>Moles,</hi> weighed 20<hi rend="sup">d</hi> weight, and the like <hi>Moles</hi> of of <hi>Mercury</hi> 19<hi rend="sup">d</hi> weight and 9 grains; the like <hi>Moles</hi> of Silver weighed 10<hi rend="sup">d</hi> weight and 21 grains; and the like
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49448:39"/>
                  <hi>Moles</hi> of Water weighed 1<hi rend="sup">d</hi> weight and 3 grains; and upon a like trial, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. found, that the heavier any ſolid body is, and more united its parts are, the lighter was the ſame body reduced into Duſt (though cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compreſſed together) in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the weight of the ſame body before its pulverization.</p>
               <p>His Experiment goes not ſo far as the diſproportion between the weight or denſeneſs of Air or Water, but <hi>Merſennus</hi> and ſome others that have been curious in this Computation, tell us, that the ſame extrinſick <hi>Moles</hi> of Water is about 14 times lighter than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Moles</hi> of Air is at leaſt 900 times, others ſay, 1300 times lighter than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of Water.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof is, that if we ſhould ſuppoſe a Cubick inch or foot of <hi>Mercury</hi> to be entirely full without interſperſed Vacuities or other Matter in it (which yet upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given, wants much) it muſt follow that in one Cubique inch or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49448:39"/>
foot, or other <hi>Moles</hi> of Air, for one particle of body, there muſt be 11699 parts of empty ſpace, each of theſe ſpaces equal to the ſpace that the real body of the Air takes up; ſuch is the diſproportion of the weight between the like quantity or <hi>Moles</hi> of Air to that of like <hi>Moles</hi> of <hi>Mercury, viz.</hi> as 1 to 11700.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof would be, that yet the Cubique foot, or inch, or other meaſure or a Veſſel contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but Air, might receive a quantity of <hi>Mercury</hi> that bears pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as 11699 to 1, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water as bears the proportion of 899 to 1, without extruding any part of the included Air, or overfilling or breaking the Veſſel wherein it is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And if we ſhould ſuppoſe that in the common Air we breath in, there ſhould be but 891 parts of Vacuities, for one part of true ſubſtantial Air (as there muſt be upon this ſuppoſition) all reſpiration would preſently be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and indeed all that Motion which we ſee, eſpecially in Meteors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49448:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>But as this is prodigiouſly incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo it is apparently untrue: For take a Tube full of Air, and ſtop it at one end, immerſe the open end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water, and preſs it down as low as may be, yet not one half of the Tube will be filled with Water; nay take an <hi>Aeolipile</hi> of Braſs with a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe to drive in the Water, it will with great difficulty receive into it ¾ parts of Water; and thereby the Air contracted into a quarter of its former room, and with great pains and force it may be, into a much leſs room; but never any pretended it could be compreſſed into the 899<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of its former room; and yet thus it may be, and with great eaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here are 899 empty ſpaces which may receive the water with as much eaſe as if the Bottle or veſſel were not empty only of Water or Air, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly empty of any other body, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only 1/900 of the room to receive the Air.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second difficulty in this Suppoſition ſeems to be this, that it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49448:40"/>
doth not anſwer the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in condenſation of Air by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as in <hi>Wind-Guns</hi> and <hi>Aeolipiles,</hi> which viſibly with a great force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours its reſtitution, as appears in the exploſion of the Air in <hi>Wind-guns,</hi> and ejection of Water preſſed into <hi>Aeolipiles;</hi> for the Air upon this Suppoſition, hath a free room far more than ſufficient for its reception, and therefore hath no need of any ſuch violence in its motion of reſtitution, it having 899 empty cavities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it hath need but of 1/900 part thereof for its reception, and more vacuity can contribute nothing either to reſiſt compreſſion, or to cauſe a ſenſible force of reſtitution, becauſe nothing can have no activity or motion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, if Air or Water be ſtrongly rarefied by Heat, we ſee it takes up a larger extention than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had, and that with ſuch an energy and force, that it will break a ſtrong Veſſel incloſing it; which it could never do, were there any conſiderable interſperſions of Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49448:41"/>
becauſe the body of the Air would with much more eaſe break into thoſe <hi>vacua Interſtitia,</hi> which have no reſiſtance againſt it, than it would or could force its room upon the ambient Veſſel that containes it, and reſiſts its dilatation with all the ſtrength it hath. And this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth as effectually conclude againſt the ſecond <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> by the admiſſion of <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> into the ſuppoſed <hi>Interſtitia,</hi> if duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Concerning the Second Solution of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> and its inſufficiency.</head>
               <p>I Come in the next place to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Second Solution above of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which ſuppoſeth theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no empty ſpace or interſperſed vacuity in the Air or any part of the Univerſe; with which I agree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded bodies are certain minute Atomical Corpuſcles, phyſically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible, and yet for all this, theſe very minute bodies are ſome groſſer, like little <hi>Globuli,</hi> ground to as ſmall a magnitude as is naturally poſſible, and yet the <hi>Ramenta</hi> or Filings of theſe <hi>Globuli</hi> are ſmaller than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and make that Conſtituent or Principle which they call <hi>Materia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49448:42"/>
which interpoſeth between other groſſer Atoms or Corpuſcles, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth up the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> between them; this Suppoſition I deny, and ſhall ſhew my Reaſons againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or Tenſion of the Air, or other Bodies capable of <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> there is only a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or disjunction of the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to a greater diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which doth not at all encreaſe its extenſion, but only varies the poſition or vicinity of its parts; and hereupon to fill the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> between the parts thus divulſed, there is immitted into thoſe <hi>Interſtitia</hi> ſubtil matter, or thoſe ſubtil Filings of the <hi>Globuli</hi> that fill thoſe ſpaces which are therefore bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the ſubtil matter of the other parts of circumjacent Air; or finally from the <hi>Aether,</hi> which ſeems to be the ſubtileſt matter in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in Condenſation of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by compreſſion that <hi>Subtiliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima Materia</hi> that reſided before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the body of that portion of Air,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49448:42"/>
is by compreſſion ſqueezed out, and driven into the conterminous Air, whereby that which we call the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed portion of Air and its parts come cloſer together, and take up leſs room or ſpace than it ſeemed to have before; namely, in the external bulk or <hi>Superficies,</hi> though in truth and reality the Air it ſelf thus ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly condenſed, and its particles, take up really as much room or ſpace as before, though the figure, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ubication of that ſpace that it takes up now, is only altered by its ſeceſſion into the ſpaces where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>ſubtiliſſima materia</hi> now flown away, did formerly reſide.</p>
               <p>This Solution of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> I think is neither true, nor doth it in any meaſure anſwer the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, I think the very Suppoſition it ſelf of theſe ſolute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is but imaginary and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Brain, and therefore I think may deſerve the Title of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49448:43"/>
Epicureum,</hi> or <hi>Carteſianum,</hi> never intended by the latter as any real Truth, but only as a Suppoſition, Engin or <hi>Medium</hi> to explicate the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, though now unwarily enough taken up by many <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> as a Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It robs all bodies of any real or poſſible continuity without a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or the ſubſtitution of ſome ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting matter, differing from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms or ſolute bodies, to hold the parts of the Univerſe together; for how can really ſeparate bodies, ſuch as the very leaſt of Atoms are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be, have any continuity, or ſo much as mutual coheſion barely by contiguity? For as to the <hi>Atomi ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matae,</hi> they ſavour too rankly of fiction and invention, and the Polar Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and difference of Sexes of Atoms ſeems as vain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſee in many bodies not only a continuity, but a ſtrong texture, whereby they will not readily be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that yet at firſt ariſe from a thin watry ſubſtance or concrement, as the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49448:43"/>
Nerves of Animals, the Wood of Trees, the Barks of Trees and Plants; as <hi>Withy, Flax, Nettles,</hi> nay the very <hi>Spiders Web,</hi> hath beſides its continuity, a certain tenaciouſneſs; ſo hath <hi>Water</hi> it ſelf, as appears by the traction of the water in the longer Leg of a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon;</hi> this tenaciouſneſs, glutinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrong coheſion of parts of bodies one to another, could never be by the appoſition of ſolute particles one to another, though never ſo ſmall, but from a kind of intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick contexture of the bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon this Suppoſition, it were neceſſary that all bodies ſhould be equally hard, and equally weighty, and equally denſe. Thoſe Atoms, even thoſe that are the moſt minute, that are the Conſtituents of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria ſubtiliſſima,</hi> are yet ſuppoſed to be bodies, and eſſentially diviſible, though not divided, nor indeed divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible phyſically by any force, and therefore hard and unfrangible; and therefore, if we ſhould take a Veſſel
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49448:44"/>
of a foot ſquare filled with Air, this <hi>Moles,</hi> though we call it of Air, is yet really made up of thoſe hard particles, and then how is it poſſible it ſhould be ſoft to the touch any more than Braſs or Steel? For the ſoftneſs of duſt of Gold or other ſolid Bodies, is not from the duſt it ſelf, but from the numerous interſperſed particles of Air. Again this Cubique Veſſel full of Air is entirely full of body, or not; if it be not, then this ſuppoſition muſt neceſſarily admit interſperſed Vacuities; the thing that the whole Suppoſition of the <hi>Carteſians</hi> deny: But if it be full of body in every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable ſpace thereof, why ſhould not this Cubique <hi>Moles</hi> of Air thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipated with a plenitude of body, be as weighty as the like Cube of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea, or Gold; for as to ſolidity, the Atomical bodies themſelves in both, are of the ſame conſiſtence, and all ſpaces are ſuppoſed full both in the Cubique foot of Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for exceſs of weight, is but the effect of exceſs of Matter or bodily ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:49448:44"/>4. Again, It is moſt certain that the ſmalleſt Atoms or Particles of matter, even the <hi>Ramenta</hi> that are ſuppoſed the Conſtituents of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria ſubtiliſſima,</hi> are yet bodies, and conſequently have their <hi>Trina Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio,</hi> and variety of configurations; ſome ſpherical, ſome cubical, ſome triangular; be theſe never ſo little, yet it is impoſſible they can exactly touch one another in all parts of their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies;</hi> a ſpherical body cannot be in all its <hi>Superficies</hi> contiguous to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpherical or cubical body; and conſequently there muſt be ſome real, though ſmall Intervals between theſe minute Particles, and then the <hi>Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> to make good their Suppoſition, muſt have yet another matter more ſubtil than that which they yet call <hi>ſubtiliſſima,</hi> to fill thoſe Chinks: <hi>Et quis cuſtodiet ipſos Cuſtodes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is not enough to ſay theſe fiſſures between the minuteſt Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, are inconſiderable: For if they be at all, it ſpoiles the Suppoſition; but beſides that, certainly he that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49448:45"/>
holds this Suppoſition, muſt yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that in the Cubique Foot of Air, the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> muſt needs be greater than in Water or <hi>Mercury</hi> of the like <hi>Moles;</hi> for certainly otherwiſe the weight of <hi>Mercury,</hi> Water and Air, would be all one; and ſo they fall in with the <hi>Vacuiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore upon the whole Matter, it ſeems more agreeable both to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Senſe and Reaſon, that in the firſt production of bodies homogeneal, whether by Creation by Almighty God, or by Generation, according to his inſtituted Law of Nature, the conſiſtency of things, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral textures, to be the immediate effect of their firſt production, and that they conſiſt of parts in union, and not ſeparated till actual ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that theſe parts are of the like conſiſtence and texture with the whole in bodies homogeneal, as in Air and in Water, and not of parts or principles quite of another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence and frame from the whole; all the parts of the Air to be Air; but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49448:45"/>
yet ſome Air or Airs at ſome times more ſubtil than others; and ſo for Water: And therefore all this <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> of Atoms, and <hi>Globuli,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute particles, are not of things that ever really exiſted, but only the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fictions of the Brain.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhould admit of any one common material principle of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bodies, it is moſt conſonant both to the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and to ſome of the ancient Philoſophers, that it ſhould be Water.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus it is declared in that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Narrative of the Creation, the firſt diſtinct body we find mentioned, is the Water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was the opinion of the Learned <hi>Thales, Mileſius,</hi> and others of the Ancients, <hi>Ex Aqua omnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The accommodation of Water to the production of other bodies by the tranſmutation of its texture, ſpeaks much for it to be the common principle of material bodies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is productive of Conſiſtences rarer and more ſubtil than it ſelf, as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49448:46"/>
Vapours, Fumes; yea and of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Air it ſelf, by the means of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Heat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is productive of things more craſs and ſolid than it ſelf, as <hi>Leaves, Fruit, Wood, Shells, Stones,</hi> which we ſee ariſe from certain concretions ſingly of water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is productive of conſiſtences that have greater tenaciouſneſs and connexion than it ſelf; as we ſee in the production of the <hi>Nerves, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, Tendons, Muſcles</hi> of Animals, which are at firſt but certain wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh concrements, digeſted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal heat into thoſe Ligaments, and in the tough and ſtrong barks and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments of Vegetables, in their trunks, rinds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are at firſt but a kind of limpid juice or water ſucked up into the bodies of Vegetables; and that even where it hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible nutriment but ſimple Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the diſſolution of bodies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artificially or naturally, they ſeem moſt readily to reaſſume a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49448:46"/>
Conſiſtence: Water therefore ſeems more accommodate to be the common material principle, much rather than theſe imaginable Atoms, though I take not upon me poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to determine it.</p>

               <p>Take a Corn of Gunpowder, and give it fire, it turns in a moment to a body of flame above 1000 times larger than it ſelf; it drives away the conterminous Air from it; and if it be a good quantity of Powder, it will break the Windows. Walls and Contignations next to it, and this done in a moment, and in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its expanſion: Is it imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to any man that thinks twice, that in that moment of its expanſion, when it drives all before it and from it, this <hi>Subtiliſſima Materia,</hi> which is ſo ſubtil and delicate, ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and admiſſion in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make good an expanſion of

ſuch an extent, nature and quality?</p>
               <p>Again, When Air in a Veſſel, is brought near the fire, and warmed by this Heat, the Air is expanded, and a great part of it driven out of the Veſſel; and if the Veſſel be cloſe, it will break, from the dilatation within; ſo that in all this rarefaction, the Air, and all the particles of it, and within it, have a preſſure out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not any motion of receptive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any thing from without, and therefore muſt neceſſarily drive away thoſe gentle particles of <hi>Materia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſſima,</hi> and can never admit them in the act of rarefaction done by Heat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a very hard ſuppoſal that the ſubtil Matter ſhould paſs through the moſt impervious bodies, as <hi>Glaſs, Braſs,</hi> yea <hi>Gold</hi> it ſelf, for the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of tenſe or rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied bodies, as it muſt according to this Suppoſition. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not only difficult to believe it, but the contrary thereof is moſt apparently evident to the very Senſe, eſpecially in the <hi>Magdeburg Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49448:48"/>
deſcribed, <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Nugarum:</hi> If you take the two Braſs Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres there deſcribed, and by heat rarefie the Air in them, then clap them together in the manner there deſcribed, when the included heat is ſpent, they will cohere ſo ſtrong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that 30 <hi>l.</hi> weight will not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, but let them receive a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate heat again from the fire, or let there be a hole no bigger than the point of a Needle to let in any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Air, they will be quickly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; for the tenſion which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded particles of Air do gain by their motion of reſtitution, and <hi>Motus nexus,</hi> is thereby relaxed: And it is obſervable, that theſe <hi>Hemiſpheres,</hi> if they are kept from heat or perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will remain in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of coheſion an hour, nay poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a day, or week, or more: Now if this ſubtil matter, which muſt be the means of <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> or extenſion, according to the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Suppoſition, pervades the Veſſel ſo eaſily, how comes it to paſs that it is kept in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49448:48"/>
this ſtraight priſon without avolation through the Braſs <hi>Hemiſpheres?</hi> Or rather, why doth not a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof pervade the Braſs <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere</hi> all this while, and releaſe the Air from its hard tenſion, by ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby the <hi>Hemiſpheres,</hi> and ſo reſtoring the Air in all parts to its juſt and natural texture and poſition? And certainly if the Spirit of Nature or <hi>Hylarchical Principle</hi> had any thing to do in matters of this Nature, or were effective in it, here were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per buſineſs and exerciſe for it; But we ſee that without perforation or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Heat, nothing of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation is effected, notwitſtanding the great ſtreſs that the Air is under in the <hi>Hemiſpheres,</hi> and which yet would be inevitably relaxed, if a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable portion of ſubtil Matter did penetrate through the <hi>Hemiſpheres,</hi> and mix it ſelf with the included rarefied Air, as well as if a little Air were let into it through a Pin-hole.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Inſtance laſt given, and many other of like nature, that might
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49448:49"/>
be given, where the filaments of the Air in their relaxation from heat, have a motion of contraction in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>per viam reſtitutionis,</hi> and a conſequential attraction on the Veſſel including them <hi>per modum nexus,</hi> it is impoſſible this can be ſalved by the Suppoſition of the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and <hi>Lucretians,</hi> which ſuppoſe the Air to conſiſt of minute particles only joyned together by contiguity, for where there is only contiguity without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of parts, that body can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver draw another body <hi>per modum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis,</hi> it will be really leſs tenacious than a Rope of Sand; ſo that ſuch an intromiſſion of particles thus ſolute, as they ſtate moſt bodies to be, by a bare contiguity of Atoms, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver explicate this viſible <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> that enſues upon tenſion of the Air, or after the avolation or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment of Heat that firſt expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as this Suppoſition by no means ſalves the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> of the Air, and what enſues
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49448:49"/>
thereupon, ſo it as little ſalves that of <hi>Condenſation</hi> or Conſtipation of Air by compreſſion, as we ſee in <hi>Wind-Guns,</hi> and other Engines, which upon a Diſcharge, or a Motion of that compreſſion, do with a force ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode or diſcharge themſelves, and preſs very hard upon bodies that are in their way; ſo that a <hi>Wind-Gun</hi> will drive a Bullet through a pretty thick piece of Wood, which could never be, if this Solution of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation</hi> were true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Air it ſelf, and alſo this ſubſidiary <hi>Materia ſubtiliſſima</hi> were but a collection of minute bodies, joyned only in contiguity one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the compreſſion in the world would give it no more elaſticity, or that exploſive motion, than if a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Calice-Sand</hi> were forced into a Gun or other Veſſel, with all the compreſſion imaginable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But again, in that elaſtical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion by the Air compreſſed into a narrower room, what is it that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerciſeth that exploſive Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49448:50"/>
Is it the ſubtil matter that was mingled with the included com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Air? Surely no; for according to this Suppoſition, that is ſqueezed out and permeated through the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel or Trunk of the <hi>Wind-gun:</hi> Or is it the groſſer Particles of the Air that is yet left in the Gun, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out till the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> be removed? But there is no reaſon for that to have any Elaſticity; for by the avolation of the ſubtil Matter, there is room enough left for it; and under that narrow dimenſion that now it hath, yet hath it as much room as before; for the avolation of the <hi>Materia ſubtilis</hi> hath made a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect room for it, and left it a ſpace exactly commenſurate to its corporeal <hi>Moles.</hi> But it may be that the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſubtilis</hi> that was driven out by the compreſſion, now upon the aperture of the <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> pervades the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Gun with that force that it gives the exploſion. But it is apparent that neither this can help it; for it doth appear that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49448:50"/>
of the Subtil Matter into the Orifice of the <hi>Wind-gun</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> muſt needs run counter to the exploſion of the Air, and obſtruct it. Again, it is apparent that the ſubtil Matter is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out gradually and with iterated force, and it cannot pervade the Iron ſides of the Gun, but gradually, and with great ſtraining, and to imagine that in a moment, the moment of a Motion of the <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> the whole body of that removed Matter ſhould pervade the ſtrong and cloſe Metal in an inſtant to give that ſtrong and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible exploſion, exceeds all reaſon, ſenſe and credibility. And therefore it was but neceſſary for thoſe that will maintain this Aſſertion to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Spirit of Nature, or an <hi>Hylar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Principle,</hi> which for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Bodies in their due natural ſtate and poſition, ſhould act little leſs than miraculouſly to ſupply all theſe Difficulties, which yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be ſuppoſed according to this Suppoſition to act in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49448:51"/>
to it ſelf and Nature alſo. For when in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of Bodies this <hi>Spiritus Naturae</hi> ſends ſupplies of ſubtil Matter to fill the <hi>Interſtitia,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily rob other parts of the Air of ſome of that ſubtil Matter that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to its texture and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution; and ſo when one portion of Matter is gratified, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is impoveriſhed of what belongs to it, which ſeems wholly unſutable to the office which this vicarious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nature (according to this new Suppoſition) is ſubſtituted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Touching the Third Suppoſition of the Method of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation</hi> according to the Ancient Philoſophy, and ſeems to be the trueſt.</head>
               <p>HAving examined the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Suppoſitions, and as near as I can, diſcovered their inſufficiency, I now come to the Third, which I think to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> as to that kind of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation</hi> (which before in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter is ſtated to be the true Matter of the Queſtion) for in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of a Body (ſuppoſe Air) either by Heat or Tenſion, there is a real expanſion or dilatation of the ſame <hi>Moles</hi> of Matter of the Air, and all its parts to a larger ſpace, extent or dimenſion than it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and in <hi>Condenſation,</hi> by Cold,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49448:52"/>
(but more evidently by compreſſion) the ſame <hi>Moles</hi> of Matter, and all its parts have a narrower or leſs ſpace or expanſion than before.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe therefore that although <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation</hi> of any Body from its natural ſize and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion belonging to it, is for the moſt part, if not alwayes, by the agency or efficiency of ſome external cauſe, yet under ſuch circumſtances: <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Denſity</hi> are but natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or rather Paſſions, Qualities or Modes of ſuch Bodies ariſing from their very texture and make, and are as naturally belonging to them as Heat or Cold, Humidity or Drineſs, Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Roughneſs, or other tangible Qualities to other Bodies that are more groſs and corporeal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do ſuppoſe that whatever men have talkt or wrote concerning <hi>Spatia imaginaria,</hi> without relation to any Bodies to fill it, yet as time or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive duration is a kind of Attendant upon ſucceſſive Motion, ſo ſpace is a kind of Entity relative to Bodies, and dependent upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49448:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. To make way to what I have to ſay herein: It ſeems to me no kind of repugnancy in Nature, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſonant thereunto, and that it is equally poſſible and reaſonable that a Body that is much more rare than another, and having in it leſs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid corporeity, and conſequently of weight, than another, yet may as entirely fill the whole ſpace within the compaſs of its external <hi>Superficies,</hi> as a body of a denſer conſiſtence, ſo that although Gold be 18000 times bulk for bulk heavier than Air, and near 20 times heavier than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and although Water be near 14 times lighter than <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet it is no way repugnant, but highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Nature, that all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a Tube of Air may be as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united one to another, and as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely fill that Cubical ſpace, as the like Cubical body of Water or <hi>Mercury,</hi> or Gold: And that although it is inherent in the very nature of a rare body, not to have ſo firm a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency as that which is more craſs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49448:53"/>
and ſolid; yet ſuch a rare body may be wholly deſtitute of Pores or <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia</hi> between its parts, as the moſt ſolid body imaginable; for poroſity or diſtance of parts is not an effect neceſſarily reſulting from Rarity. For it would be a ſtrange poſition, that no Body that were not <hi>ſummè ſolidum</hi> or <hi>craſſum,</hi> could have been created, that had all its parts commenſurate to all the ſpace within the external di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, or <hi>extima Superficies</hi> of ſuch body, and yet this muſt neceſſarily follow, if ſuch a commenſuration <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> were contradictory to, and inconſiſtent with any body that is not <hi>ſummè ſolidum</hi> or <hi>craſſum,</hi> whereof poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly there is no inſtance that is or can be made; for Gold it ſelf is not <hi>ſummè craſſum</hi> or <hi>ſolidum;</hi> for one piece of Gold may be ſolider, and have more of craſs Matter than another: which appears by the Diſparity of weight between two ſeveral kinds of Gold of the ſame bulk.</p>
               <p>Nay, upon a ſtrict ſearch it may be found <hi>de facto</hi> true, that ſome
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49448:53"/>
kinds of Wood or Metals that are more craſs, and conſequently more weighty than others, may yet be more porous than ſome Woods or Metals that are lighter and of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tenuity; yea, Glaſs or Cryſtal, that is lighter and leſs craſs than ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodies, may be leſs porous than ſuch as are heavier and craſſer; or if compariſon be made between it and common Iron-Ore, the like between <hi>Calice-Sand</hi> and yellow Wax, and many more, whereof the Table of the Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> in his <hi>Historia Denſi &amp; Rari,</hi> may yield us many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>Again, we have no better meaſure of the Rarity or Denſity in Bodies than their difference of weight, <hi>Quod Rarum, leve; quod Denſum, grave.</hi> Let us reſume the Inſtance given <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra, cap.</hi> 6. Wherein it appears that Air is at leaſt 12000 times lighter; and conſequently rarer than <hi>Mercury:</hi> Now if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Air in a Cubique Veſſel of a Foot ſquare, ſhould fill but 1/12000 of that ſpace,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49448:54"/>
and the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 11999 parts of that ſpace muſt be either totally empty, or ſupplied with another kind of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous ſubtil Matter, differing from Air: This muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Suppoſition that the <hi>Moles aeris</hi> is not commenſurate to all the ſpaces within the Cavity of that Cube, and yet it is ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Senſe, that it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be admitted, or almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable by any that duly thinks of it.</p>
               <p>Water is ſubtiler than <hi>Mercury,</hi> by 14 times; Air is ſubtiler than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by 900 times; and poſſibly the <hi>Aether</hi> above the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> or the <hi>Elementa Stellarum</hi> is as much ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than common Air of our lower <hi>Atmoſphere.</hi> It were a wild conceit to think that every given portion of the Ethereal world muſt neceſſarily have forty thouſand equal portions, either of Vacuity, or of ſubtil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more refined than <hi>Aether,</hi> and that no one given portion of <hi>Ethereal</hi> Matter; ſuppoſe a Cubique Foot could
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49448:54"/>
be exactly commenſurate to all the ſpace within that Cubique Foot, but muſt have forty thouſand interſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed pores, either wholly vacant, or filled with another more ſubtil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, it is equally conſonant to the nature of Bodies, that a more rare or ſubtil Body may be, and is equally commenſurate to all the ſpaces within the extent of its Ubication, as the craſſeſt body in the World.</p>
               <p>The thing I drive at is this real Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Body though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo rare, may be entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to all the ſpace within the compaſs of its external <hi>Superficies,</hi> as well as the denſeſt or craſſeſt Body that is or can be in Nature; and conſequently that the ſame Body, if it have at ſeveral times ſeveral tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may in theſe ſeveral ſeaſons entirely poſſeſs ſpaces anſwering ſuch textures; as, if Water gain the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Air, it may be commenſurate to all ſpaces within its <hi>Superficies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49448:55"/>4. It ſeems to me, that although ſome particles of Air included in the common Body of the Air, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be more ſubtil than others, yet as to point of extenſion or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, all the parts thereof, even the minuteſt parts thereof, as to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Rarity and Tenuity, and the motion of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> are of the ſame nature, and perfectly homogeneal; and the like for Water; and although ſome imaginable parts thereof may be rarer, others craſſer, yet they are perfectly mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as common Conſtituents of the ſame Body we call Air; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſuppoſe the firſt Conſtituent minute particles of Air or Water, are hard, or of any other nature than the whole Body, is a precarious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident and unreaſonable Suppoſition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I do ſuppoſe it as a certain, evident truth, that the actual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of parts or particles of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Bodies (as moſt evidently Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Air are) are but only poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, or by the operations of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49448:55"/>
Underſtanding in ſuch Bodies, and not really exiſting, as parts, or as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, till a real and actual ſeparation of them with integral parts, though they may be bigger or leſs, according to the method of their ſeparation; yet,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Still remain Bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cannot be indiviſible, no not phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Are of the very ſame nature, texture or make with the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of which they are cancelled; and therefore when the external <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> of the whole bulk in <hi>Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> is expanded, or in <hi>Condenſation</hi> is contracted, the like expanſion and contraction happens in proportion in every particle thereof, in a true and proper <hi>Rarefaction</hi> or <hi>Condenſation,</hi> whereof the Queſtion is ſtated.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I do not think that corporeity or bodily conſiſtence is the ſame thing with quantity or <hi>trina dimenſio;</hi> but that this is but an affection or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it; for otherwiſe all Bodies that have an equal <hi>trina dimenſio,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:49448:56"/>
muſt needs have the ſame Denſity, or an equal maſs of Matter, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal <hi>Moles,</hi> which is contrary to Experience; for a Cubique Foot of Water hath leſs of Matter than a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique Foot of <hi>Mercury,</hi> as appears by the diſparity of their weight, the beſt indication of the diſparity of the <hi>Moles</hi> of Matter.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, I now proceed to declare my thoughts touching <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> holding my ſelf ſingly to it as it is ſtated, to be the Queſtion in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, and principally applying my ſelf to thoſe Bodies that are moſt <hi>Pneumatical</hi> or Spirital (I ſay not Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.)</p>
               <p>It ſeems therefore to me, that as ſeveral Bodies of the ſame external extent or <hi>Superficies;</hi> as, ſuppoſe a Cubical Foot of Air, Water, <hi>Mercury,</hi> or Gold, may have, and have yet a cloſe continuity of all their particles without any <hi>Interſtitia</hi> of vacuous ſpaces, or of other Matter, to fill them up, and all this ariſing from the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49448:56"/>
various textures of thoſe bodies, ſo the ſame body by a various texture acquired by accidental emergencies either of heat, tenſion or compreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may acquire a greater or leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion, according to thoſe varieties of acquired textures, yet without any new acceſſion of ſubſtance, or deper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any its included particles, but ſtill remaining individually the very ſame Matter.</p>
               <p>For if ſeveral bodies of various tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may be ſome more rare, and ſome more denſe, from their very Make and texture, and yet as well thoſe that are more rare, as ſuppoſe Air or Water may as exactly fill all the ſpaces within the compaſs of their extenſion, without the ſubſidiary help of vacuities or other interſperſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well as thoſe of a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe conſiſtency; ſuppoſe Gold, Lead: or <hi>Mercury;</hi> the very ſame reaſon doth enforce that the ſame body, if its texture be either by force or accident, altered to a greater Rarity or Denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than it had before, may alter its
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49448:57"/>
ſpace, and yet be entirely and exactly commenſurate to a greater or leſſer ſpace, according to ſuch alteration of its texture, as well as thoſe ſeveral bodies that had primitively the like variety of texture conſtant to their nature.</p>
               <p>For Matter or material ſubſtance is of it ſelf equally ſuſceptive of a laxer or craſſer, a rarer or denſer conſiſtence or texture of parts; only when it is lax or rare, the ſame portion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter takes up more ſpace, when it is craſs or denſe, it takes up leſs ſpace.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, in Diſtillation we will ſuppoſe that firſt by ſome mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heat the diſtillatory Veſſels, the Veſſel (wherein the Roſes for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are placed to be diſtilled) the Head of the Still, and the Recipient to be as much evacuated of Air, or the included Air attenuated as much as may be, and then the Veſſels cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luted one to another, the moiſt Matter of the Roſes by gentle heat is reſolved firſt into a ſubtil Fume or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49448:57"/>
Vapour, and ſo rarefied from what it was in the Roſe-Leaves: Then again theſe Fumes or Vapors partly by the coldneſs of the Head of the Still, partly by the collection and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Vapors themſelves, reſolve into drops of water, and ſo diſcharge themſelves into the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Here the very ſame body by the change of its texture, namely, the watry or moiſt ſubſtance of the Roſes is firſt dilated into Fumes or Vapors, and then contracted into Water; and the firſt receive a dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or expanſion into Vapors, where it takes up a larger dimenſion in all its parts, as well as in its ambient <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,</hi> and then a contraction into a narrower compaſs, when reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water, and yet continues ſtill the ſame body; but by variation of its textures, aſſumes a larger or narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dimenſion in all its parts without reception of new foreign particles to dilate it, or emiſſion of ſome of its ſubſtance in contraction or condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49448:58"/>Which Inſtance explains what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; namely, that the ſame indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual body, according to the variety of its textures, may acquire a larger or leſs ſpace, and yet continue the ſame body, though altered in the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Rarity</hi> or <hi>Denſity;</hi> as Air hath a larger expanſion than Water, ſo if Water be converted into Air, and thereby its texture altered into a more ſubtil expanſive body, it takes up the ſame dimenſion as if it had been never Water, but alwayes Air. And if Air again be converted into Water, it takes up the ſame contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted dimenſion, as if it had ever been Water.</p>
               <p>And this method of ſolution of <hi>Condenſation</hi> and <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> anſwers all the evident, apparent and ſenſible <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> above delivered, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty or ſtrained ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For inſtance, In Rarefaction by Heat, or by tenſion of a Cubical Foot of Air in a Veſſel, it is viſible that the Air, and every particle of it,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49448:58"/>
gains a larger extent every way; for it will break the Veſſel, unleſs it have vent, which it could not do, unleſs the entire body were extended, and not barely the <hi>Superficies,</hi> becauſe unleſs the whole <hi>Moles</hi> were every way expanded, it would have room enough within it ſelf for its reception without breaking the Veſſel that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it.</p>
               <p>Again, when the Heat decays, and conſequently the Air relaxed from that extent, it endeavours its own contraction to its juſt and natural ſize and texture which it loſt for the time, by the foreign violence of expanſion by Heat or Tenſion, and this by a natural motion of reſtitution to its natural texture; and becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gain its relaxation to its former texture by contraction, by reaſon of the vacuity that would thereupon follow, it doth as much as it may, and lays hold on the internal ſides of the Veſſels wherein it is impriſoned, and pulls them together; but as ſoon as it gains a relaxation by the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49448:59"/>
of foreign Air into it, the very ſame portion of expanded Air that under its expanſion filled a Cube of a Foot ſquare, will ſubſide into a ſpace of leſs than ſix inches ſquare, which was its true natural ſpace reſulting from the texture it then had, by that admiſſion of foreign Air.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Condenſation</hi> a portion of Air, ſuppoſe a Cubique Foot in its juſt and natural texture, entirely fills all the ſpace within that Cubical Foot (for its texture is ſuited to ſuch a ſpace) but being compreſſed forcibly into a <hi>Wind-gun</hi> or <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> the texture is changed by this violence, and it takes up perchance not the twentieth part of that ſpace: The difference of its extenſion ariſeth from the alteration of its texture by this external compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force uſed upon it; and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it gains an Elaſticity, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a natural motion or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> to be reſtored to its former juſt and natural texture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that juſt extent, and Liberty, and poſition of ſpace that belongs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49448:59"/>
to it, as a Stick, or Branch of a Tree, or Spring of Steel being bent beyond, or againſt its juſt poſition, hath its motion of reſtitution to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poſition, with a force or reſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For the Air in its natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, hath a certain determinate texture belonging to it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a juſt and natural extenſion proportionate to that texture. And this it greedily endeavours to keep; and when diſturbed from it, to re-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, which is the motion of reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I often expreſs by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpontaneous contraction of a Lute-ſtring, after an extention beyond its proper texture. And this is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and true cauſe of that ſtrong and violent exploſion that happens in thoſe <hi>Pneumatical</hi> Engins of various ſorts.</p>
               <p>So that in theſe and all other <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> this plain, and common, and ancient Solution ſquares exactly with them, as might be inſtanced in infinite more Particulars, if it were needful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49448:60"/>And with this agree the beſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that great Prieſt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in 4 <hi>Phyſicor.</hi> cap. 9. wherein he anſwers the Objections brought by others to prove Vacuities from the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> tells us that <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Denſity</hi> properly ſo called, are not by acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of new Matter, or loſs of any of the old, but from the potentiality of Matter it ſelf, to undergo ſeveral textures, and conſequently ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, <hi>Si factus eſt Aer ex Aqua, eadem materia facta eſt Aer, nulla re inſuper alia aſſumpta ſed quod erat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, id tandem facta eſt actu; &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mili modo ſi orta eſt Aqua ex Aere, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem namque materia nunc in magnam ex parva, nunc in parvam ex magna verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur molem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Qua re ipſa Moles ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilis non ideo extenditur aut conſtringi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quia materiae aliquid inſuper adjicit aut objicit, ſed quia ipſa Materies utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſubire poteſt, quo ſit ut idem ſit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; denſum, &amp; utriuſque Materia una,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49448:60"/>
atqui denſum eſt grave, rarum autem leve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> a great inquiſitor into Nature, and not very friendly to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria Denſi &amp; Rari,</hi> after ſeveral Inſtances of <hi>Pſeudo-rarefactions,</hi> when he ſpeaks of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of Air by Heat, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. tells us, <hi>Aer per calorem dilatatur ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter, neque enim ſeparatur quippiam, aut emittitur, ut in tangibilibus, ſed ſimpliciter fit expanſio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Rarefaction</hi> is not therefore by the diſtraction of the particles of Air one from another to a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and interpoſing poroſities or <hi>interſtitia</hi> either of perfect empty ſpaces as the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> would have it, or filled with adventitious ſubtil Matter, as the <hi>Carteſians</hi> would have it; neither in <hi>Condenſation</hi> are any parts of Air, or included in Air drawn out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the remaining particles rendred into a cloſer order and contiguity one to another:</p>
               <p>But in the former the extenſion of the whole portion of Air, and of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49448:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
every particle is thereof <hi>quaquaverſum</hi> enlarged, and in <hi>Condenſation</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire extenſion of the Air and every part thereof is <hi>quaquaverſum</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and this variation is no other but a common affection, or rather poſition or quantity of Matter neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ariſing from the various tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that it ſucceſſively acquires.</p>
               <p>And therefore the great Objections that are made againſt this Method of the Ancients in their accounts of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> fall to juſt nothing; as for inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> of the Air, it muſt be ſofter to the touch, and in <hi>Condenſation</hi> harder: I would gladly hear of that man that ever knew <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi> Air condenſed but to its 100<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part yet if it were condenſed 900 times, it would not be ſo denſe as Water, or what diſproportion to the touch he can find between Smoke and Air, and yet the former is far more denſe; for it is conſpicuous to the view: ſo that he had need be a man of exquiſite ſenſe, to make any concluſion from his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49448:61"/>
touch, touching the <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of a <hi>Pneumatical</hi> Body.</p>
               <p>Again, if the Atomical <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> were admitted, it is not conceptible but that all bodies, whether in their natural texture, or under the motions of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> muſt be hard and equally hard, becauſe conſiſting of a plenitude of Atoms, which are all ſuppoſed to be hard and infrangible.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> A farther Conſideration of <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> and of the Suppoſition of the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability or impenetrability of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Material Subſtances, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Extenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe principal Objection againſt the method of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> propounded in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, is this, That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the ſame <hi>Moles</hi> of Matter can aſſume a larger ſpace and dimenſion, as in <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> without a diviſion of one part from another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leaving certain vacant <hi>Interſtitia</hi> between the parts ſeparated, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſuppoſition of a pre-exiſtent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of the parts of Matter, while in its former more condenſed conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49448:62"/>
and in <hi>Rarefaction</hi> thruſting out thoſe parts that formerly penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another, being unfettered in <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> or by admiſſion of new poroſities made in the rarefied Matter, and reception therein of other foreign Matter. Again, <hi>Condenſation</hi> of the ſame portion of Matter cannot be without ſuppoſition of vacant empty <hi>Spatiola,</hi> which are cloſed up by the ſtrict coalition of parts, or by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a penetrability and penetration of the parts of the ſame portion of Matter in its new acquired ſtate of <hi>Condenſation,</hi> or by driving out from that portion of Matter ſome of its more ſubtil parts, whereby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining parts are fewer, and take up leſs room or ſpace than before ſuch <hi>Condenſation:</hi> The firſt is the firſt way propounded by the <hi>Vacuiſts,</hi> and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. The ſecond is in effect the way propounded by me in the former Chapter, but is ſaid to be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent in nature, becauſe penetrability of bodies or of extenſion of Material Subſtance, is rejected by almoſt all
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49448:63"/>
Philoſophers; therefore the laſt, which is the middle way, contended againſt in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, muſt be the true Method of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is true, I have laid aſide, and that juſtly, the Opinion of the <hi>Vacuiſts,</hi> in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, and likewiſe the Opinion of acqueſt of new Matter, and expulſion of part of the old, in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, and have entertain'd the Opinion of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and ſome of the Modern Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter. And it is true that this Opinion thus by me entertained, cannot well be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a ſuppoſition of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability of material Subſtances, or ſomewhat analogal thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi> Contraction and Dilatation: And it is true, that although I think that this penetrability of Material Subſtance, be a great truth, yet it is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to explain it; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I ſhall endeavour to do; and in doing of it, the Anſwer to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will evidence it ſelf. And I
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49448:63"/>
ſhall chooſe to do it this way, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by explication of Terms and Words, and rendring my apprehenſions ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe Explications, though it may be in a different manner from the uſual or Scholaſtick expreſſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning Penetrability and Impenetrability.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concerning Body, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it differs from the Notion of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concerning Quantity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning Rarity and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Concerning Extenſion or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Concerning Penetrability, how it is or is not applicable to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Penetrability or Penetration of Matter or Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is of three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The permeation or penetration of one Body into or through another, by poroſities of the penetrated Body,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49448:64"/>
either found or made by the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Body; this is common almoſt to all Bodies, and is not the Penetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſeparation, diſtraction or diviſion of the parts of a penetrated Body by the force and energy of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body; as the Arrow through the Air, or the Bullet through the ſides of a Ship; this is alſo uſual, and is not the penetration or penetrability in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When one part or particle of Matter is taken into another portion of Matter by a kind of contraction, and ſwallowed up and drowned as it were, in another portion of Matter, by a ſtricter union than it had before; whereby the ſame numerical portion of Matter hath a leſs extenſion and ſpace than it had before, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the ſame portion of Matter without diminution or encreaſe of ſubſtance, and this is that which is the Subject of the Queſtion in hand.</p>
               <p>And this penetration of Matter or Bodies may be conſidered two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49448:64"/>1. When two diſtinct divided bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or portions of Matter are ſaid thus to penetrate each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the united parts of the ſame portion of Matter do penetrate and ſwallow each other, as is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be done in <hi>Condenſation;</hi> and though the former be conſiderable, yet this latter is that kind of penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching which the Queſtion grows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Matter or Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is the <hi>Subſtratum</hi> of Bodies; and although it is not poſſible for it to exiſt one moment without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate extent and determination into ſome Body compleated in <hi>Eſſe Corporeo,</hi> yet it is of it ſelf indifferent to any particular extenſion or bodily Concrement. This is that <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> the Subject of all Generation and Corruption, yet it ſelf ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and incorruptible; that <hi>Proteus</hi> which in various ſucceſſions is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of various Forms, Extenſions and Variety of Bodies; as we ſee in a piece of Wood thrown into the Fire,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49448:65"/>
that ſame material ſubſtance which but now was Wood, aſſumes ſeveral Natures and Extenſions, ſome more fixed than the Wood, as its Salts; ſome more lax, as Aſhes and Smoke, and accordingly undergoes Varieties of Extenſions different from what the very ſame portion of Matter had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: the very ſame individual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed portion of Matter is capable of being determined into Air, Water, or ſome other Body; and if deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined into Water, it may be the ſuppoſed portion of Matter would make up a Cubical Body of an inch ſquare; but if determined into Air, it would make a Cubical body of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1000 times that extenſion, and yet the individual portion of Matter ſimply the ſame, and neither more nor leſs under thoſe different textures and extenſions; for Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is naturally ſuſceptive ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of various textures and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences, from whence do neceſſarily reſult ſucceſſively various extents or diminutions of that one individual
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49448:65"/>
particle of Matter under thoſe various conſiſtences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Body is nothing elſe but Matter determined into a Body of this or that Nature, Figure, Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Plexus,</hi> Quality and Dimenſion; theſe are ſuperadditions to Matter, and being added to it, determine it into Body; and when this Body by the power of the Agent, aſſumes another diſtinct conſiſtence; then is that Body, either eſſentially changed into another kind of Body, or elſe accidentally altered in figure, dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, texture, or otherwiſe, and yet the Matter continues entirely the ſame, as in ſome Bodies; the very ſame Cubique inch of Bees-Wax may be moulded into a Globe, a Cone, a Trigone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet continues the ſame numerical and individual piece of Wax.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Quantity; and herein I ſhall take the Liberty to uſe this word according to my own ſenſe, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from others acceptation: I call therefore <hi>Quantity</hi> that Habitude
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49448:66"/>
whereby a Material Subſtance under any determination is denominated more or leſs, and is a kind of proper inſeparable Accident (if we will call it ſo) of Material Subſtance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick to it, and really differs from Extenſion or Dimenſion: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a Cubique inch of Water is rarefied into 1000 Cubique inches of Air; or a Cubique Foot of Air is by heat rarified into five cubique Feet of Air; here is variety of Extenſion, and yet the ſame quantity of Matter in the cubique inch of Water, and in the cubique foot of Air, as is after <hi>Rarefaction</hi> in the 1000 cubique inches of Air, and 5 cubique feet of Air, <hi>Quantity</hi> being cloſely knit to Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Subſtance, but this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular extenſion variable, though the quantity (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the <hi>Moles,</hi> the much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Subſtance be the ſame.</p>
               <p>And herein, among other things, it differs from Extenſion, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion is meaſured by artificial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Inches, Palms, Feet, Cubits; but Quantity, in my acceptation, is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49448:66"/>
meaſured by weight, which gives the diſcrimination of Quantity or Much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Matter, where, it may be, the extent is equal; as a cubique foot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is equal in dimenſion to a cubique foot of <hi>Mercury;</hi> but there is 14 times more weight, and conſequently more Matter and Material quantity in the latter than in the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Denſity and Rarity are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Qualities both of Bodies and Material Subſtance; and they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſuſceptive of thoſe qualities, as they are of Colour, Figure, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Texture, or the like, namely, in ſucceſſive portions of Time or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and hence it is infallibly true that the ſame Material Subſtance that is now actually rare, is potentially denſe; or that which now is actually denſe, is potentially rare, without any admiſſion of new Subſtance, or deperdition of any of the old. And as ſeveral portions of Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are ſuſceptive of, or actually under ſeveral degrees of Rarity or Denſity, as Gold, Iron, Wax, Water,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49448:67"/>
Air; ſo the ſame portion of Material Subſtance may in ſucceſſive portions of times be ſuſceptive of ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Rarity or Denſity; for, as I ſaid, they are but ſeveral qualities, or if you will, modes of Matter.</p>
               <p>The Motion to Rarity or Denſity, is that which is uſually called <hi>Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or <hi>Condenſation;</hi> and though Matter or Body be ſuſceptive of it (ſome more eaſily, ſome more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly) yet it is moſt ordinarily the effect of an extrinſecal Agent, as Fire, Tenſion, Conſtipation, Compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The Method whereby the alteration from Rarity to Denſity, or to a leſs degree of Denſity, and <hi>e converſo,</hi> is effected, is the alteration of the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body ſo rarefied or conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a more dilate or contracted conſiſtence.</p>
               <p>And this Alteration is ſometimes ſo great, that it alters the very nature or <hi>Species</hi> of the Body, as when Air is condenſed into Water, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Air; ſometimes it only alters
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49448:67"/>
the texture, without altering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as when Air is compreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a narrower compaſs in Wind-guns, or dilated by heat in <hi>Aeolipiles,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains Air ſtill, though under differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing texture from what it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The effects of <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation</hi> are neither increaſe nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Subſtance thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed or rarefied, nor of its quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or muchneſs: If a cubique inch of Braſs were condenſed into Gold, indeed the <hi>Moles</hi> would be leſs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but there would be the very ſame individual portion of material ſubſtance in both; and the very ſame weight that the cubique inch of Braſs had, would the portion of Gold have upon ſuch a condenſation: For weight and not extent is the beſt meaſure of equality or diſparity of material ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>But indeed as to Extenſion, the meaſures would differ; the ſame <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> of Matter condenſed might not take up half the extent it did before,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49448:68"/>
and being rarefied, might take up ten times its extenſion or dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Dimenſion or Extenſion; Though as Quantity imports much or little, it be inſeparable from the notion of material Subſtance, yet actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion in this or that determinate meaſure or degree, is but purely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental to Material Subſtance; for it may have one extenſion one hour, and the next hour have another, as its texture is altered: For variety of extenſion is conſequential, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conſequential upon alteration of texture.</p>
               <p>There are certain diſtinctions to be obſerved touching Extenſion, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. An actual, and an habitual, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinary and potential extenſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>de facto</hi> every portion of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is under ſome actual extenſion, yet, as I ſaid, this or that actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion is not intrinſecal or eſſential to Matter; for as it is capable of a variation of its texture, ſo it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a change, variation and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49448:68"/>
of its dimenſion. But that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, aptitudinary and potential ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion whereby it muſt neceſſarily be at ſome time or moment under ſome determinate extenſion or other, is intrinſick to it, though it be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively alterable as its texture is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>Again, 2. We muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the extenſion in the ſuperficial and external dimenſion, and that which is the whole portion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the former may be without the true and real encreaſe of extent or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion; for poſſibly by the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſeparation of the more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior parts of Matter, and the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereby of poroſities, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſuperficial extent may be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and yet the whole extent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the ſame, but only with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified ubication of the more interior parts of Matter; but that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is intended by me in <hi>Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> is an entire extenſion of the whole Matter and all its parts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no true and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49448:69"/>
extenſion; and that contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or penetration of Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to Condenſation, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the whole triple dimenſion, length, breadth and thickneſs of the whole Body and every part, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſame quantity or much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Subſtance.</p>
               <p>And as I have ſhewed that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral portions of Material Subſtance, it is not only conſiſtent with the Laws of Nature, but evidently true in fact that a portion of rarefied Matter (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it Air) may be, and is co-exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the ſpaces within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of that Matter, and fills them as entirely as a moſt denſe Body or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter fills all the ſpaces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its ſuperficial dimenſion (as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it Water, or even <hi>Mercury</hi> or Gold it ſelf) ſo the ſame portion of compacted Matter, ſuppoſe it Water or <hi>Mercury,</hi> being rarefied into a more dilated and expanded conſiſtence, as into Air or Fumes, may upon the very ſame account fill all the ſpaces within the extent of that dilated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49448:69"/>
without any <hi>hiatus</hi> or <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia</hi> of empty ſpaces, or the acqueſt of any additional Matter, becauſe the texture of that portion of Matter is only changed, and a greater extenſion or dimenſion is neceſſarily conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial upon, or concomitant with the variation of the texture of that very ſame portion of Matter to a greater expanſion in <hi>Rarefaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Contraction or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution and Expanſion of a Spirit or Spiritual Subſtance, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Penetration,</hi> is incident to Spirits and Spiritual Subſtances, that are void of Matter; but this doth not at all impeach that natural pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of Material Subſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have ſpoken; for they differ <hi>toto coelo</hi> one from another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the principle of each Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration: In Material Subſtance it always, or at leaſt, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, proceeds from an external effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or force, as in Contraction or Penetration of Material Subſtances by compreſſion, or by conſtipations from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49448:70"/>
without; but the penetration or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, or dilatation of a Spiritual Subſtance, is from an internal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, poſſibly the determination of the will of ſuch a Spirit to contraction or evolution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Conſequent, or rather Concomitant of ſuch Penetration or Expanſion: In Material Subſtance, upon contraction or penetration, the Matter is neceſſarily thereupon more denſe; and in evolution or expanſion, more rare; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be one or other without the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a new texture of its parts, <hi>viz.</hi> more lax in Rarefaction, more cloſe and compact in Condenſation; but in the contraction or evolution of a Spirit, there is no alteration in the texture, or Rarity or Denſity of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſubſtance: For Rarity and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are Qualities and Affections com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible only to Bodies and Material Subſtances, not to Spirits or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances purely immaterial; therefore I do diſmiſs the Penetrability of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as a thing wholly unapplicable
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49448:70"/>
to the Matter in Queſtion, and no way applicable to the Argument in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Now to apply the buſineſs of Penetrability or Impenetrability to what hath been formerly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In caſe of ſeveral Bodies that are under ſeveral actual dimenſions, and not united one to another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, this concerns not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Queſtion, which is touching one common portion of Matter, whoſe parts are united one to another, and ſo in a ſtate of union: yet whether that a Body may not be of ſo high a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied purity and tenuity, that it may penetrate the dimenſions of a groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Body without poroſities for its tranſition, either found or made in that penetrated Body, may be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine, becauſe we are unacquainted with the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſubtilty of Bodies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of thoſe Energies that are conſequential thereupon: Only if Light be a Body, or if the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal effuſion be corporeal effluxes as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49448:71"/>
ſome of the late Philoſophers aſſert, it ſeems to favour ſuch a penetrabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch ſubtil Bodies; for Light will pervade every part of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanum,</hi> and Magnetical Effluxes will pervade the ſolideſt Bodies, even Gold it ſelf, as Experience ſhews us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making poroſities for its tranſition. But I diſmiſs this as not to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand; and poſſibly the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that Light or Magnetical Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes are Bodies, is untrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to portions of Matter, Bodies and Extenſions thereof, where its parts are united in one common continuity, as in the caſe of proper <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſation,</hi> it ſeems that ſuch a penetration of actual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, or of Bodies determined in or under actual dimenſions, ſuch a penetration either of Bodies or actual dimenſions, or extenſions, is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and contradictory in it ſelf, ſo long as ſuch actual dimenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unaltered by an alteration of the texture of ſuch Body, and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially of ſuch actual dimenſions; for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49448:71"/>
a cubique Body of 12 inches cannot be more or leſs in extenſion than it is, ſo long as it is a cubique Body of 12 inches: This is that penetration of Bodies and Dimenſions that we do reject under that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But in as much as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame portion of Material Subſtance is ſucceſſively capable of ſeveral tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſequently of ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, there is nothing in Nature or Reaſon that prohibits a ſucceſſive penetration of Material Subſtances under ſuch a mutation of textures and actual dimenſions, ſo that one and the very ſame numerical portion of Matter that this moment is under a texture accommodate to the nature of the moſt ſubtil Air, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into a degree of Air leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, or condenſed into Water, its parts will be conſtipated and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into a cloſer poſture, and take up leſs ſpace according to the degree of its Condenſation; which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or conſtipation of its parts, may not improperly be called penetration
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49448:72"/>
of material Subſtance, but is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a penetration of Bodies, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion actually determined, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining unaltered in its texture.</p>
               <p>And this gives the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1. Penetration of actual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions; and, 2. Penetration of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. 3. Penetration of Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The two former are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible without an alteration of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion or texture of the Body. The third is not only poſſible but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and neceſſarily conſequential upon the alteration of the texture of the Body into a more rare or denſe conſiſtency.</p>
               <p>And the evidence of the Truth hereof is, becauſe the ſame numerical portion of Subſtance material in a ſtate of Rarity, is as commenſurate to all the particles of Space within the compaſs of its external <hi>Superficies,</hi> and hath as perfect and undivided continuation of its parts one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as when it is condenſed into a conſiſtence that bears not the 100<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part or 1000<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the ſame ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49448:72"/>
dimenſion; for otherwiſe it were not poſſible to conceive, but that in the whole Body of Air and <hi>Aether,</hi> for one portion of Material Subſtance, there muſt be 1000 portions of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty ſpaces or nothings, which is againſt Nature.</p>
               <p>And this Sentiment, though not warily enough examined and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by ſome Philoſophical Heads, hath made them run on with one common cry againſt all penetration of Material Subſtances, under the name of penetration of Bodies and Extenſions, as a great abſurdity: But of latter times, ſome more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and inquiſitive perſons have ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched more freely and impartially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this buſineſs; and though they do reject that impoſſible and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory penetration of Bodies and actual Extenſions or Dimenſion remaining unaltered in the ſenſe before given; yet do not only allow, as poſſible; but alſo aſſert, as natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary penetration of the parts of the ſame individual portion of Material
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49448:73"/>
Subſtance, conſiſting in a State of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and under an alteration of tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſequently a change of extenſions, as any man may ſee in the Learned Treatiſe of <hi>Bodies,</hi> of Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> pag. The large Diſpute of <hi>Guarinus, Guarini Diſputatione</hi> 4to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſione,</hi> 2. <hi>De Rarefactione &amp; Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatione.</hi> And our Learned Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> in his Tractate <hi>De Natura Subſtantiae Energetica,</hi> cap. 27, 28. Wherein, among other clear Explications of this Matter of Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trability of Material Subſtances, he hath theſe Paſſages, namely, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that men have taken up againſt penetrability of Matter, is, <hi>Quod ab incunte aetate conſuevimus cogitare &amp; dicere non dari penetrationem Corporum aut dimenſionum quodque ſimul pro conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo habuimus penetrationem Corporum &amp; Subſtantiarum idem ſonare.</hi> Again, <hi>Impoſſibile est, ut manente eadem Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſione, mutetur Denſitas, aut ut hac mutata, illa non mutetur; mutata di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſione, ut in Condenſatione, Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria partes aliquas ſui quaſi abſorbet in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49448:73"/>
ſeipſam.</hi> And again, <hi>Sola terminata extenſio eſt quae materiam durante eadem terminatione, &amp; non diutius impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this any Novel Doctrine, but the very Natural Senſe of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> in 4<hi>to Phyſicorum,</hi> cap. 9. before cited, and thoſe expreſſions of the potentiality of the very ſame portion of Matter to become rare or denſe, and thereby the Extenſion altered, without any diminution of its Matter in Condenſation, or acquiſition of new Matter, in Rarefaction; though it mention not Penetrability in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, yet aſſerts the thing, as it is above declared.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter therefore it ſeems, 1. There is no neceſſity of a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a penetration of Dimenſions on Condenſation; neither is it indeed poſſible where the Dimenſions conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſame, but would be a kind of contradiction. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſequently where the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions continue the ſame without alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it is impoſſible there ſhould be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49448:74"/>
a penetration of Bodies or Material Subſtances, remaining under the ſame actual dimenſion unaltered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But there is not only a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the change of Extenſion, but the ſame will neceſſarily follow upon the change of the texture of the Body or Matter under ſuch Extenſion: And,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſequently the Extenſion there remaines not the ſame, but is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Under ſuch a change of Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Extenſion, or together with it, there may be, and will follow that which is called a penetration of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Material Subſtance; for that which was the impediment thereof, namely, the actual Extenſion or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion is not only changeable, but now changed. And,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Therefore it ſeems no abſurdity in Nature or Reaſon, to ſuppoſe ſuch a penetration of Material Subſtances, in the caſe of <hi>Condenſation,</hi> and is the moſt reaſonable Solution of it.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given an Accompt of what ſeems probable to me touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49448:74"/>
this dark and intricate Enquiry touching <hi>Rarefaction</hi> and <hi>Condenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and therefore I have been the longer in it, becauſe I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and becauſe in the enſuing <hi>Remarks</hi> it is often urged againſt the Solution offered of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>Torricellian Experiment;</hi> and I ſhall remit the Anſwer of the <hi>Remarks</hi> of that kind to this Preliminary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; which, though poſſibly it may not ſatisfie every Reader, yet it will at leaſt render it evident, that the Objections made upon theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and intricate Suppoſitions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrability of Material Subſtance, are not ſo effectual, nor indeed proper to evince or prove, unleſs we had a clearer Diſcovery of the Nature and Affections of Bodies, than we have yet attained. And therefore Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made from this Topique, loſe their uſe, in as much as the <hi>Medium</hi> is more obſcure than the very thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about. And now I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the <hi>Remarks</hi> themſelves.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Remark</hi> fiercely, and in the firſt greeting, chargeth the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, in that in ſome places thereof, it is ſaid, That <hi>Gravity is a quality whereby heavy Bodies tend to the Center;</hi> and yet in other places it is ſaid, That <hi>Gravitation is but</hi> Niſus <hi>or</hi> Conatus ad Motum; <hi>and therefore that it is not improper to ſay, that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that have a</hi> Niſus <hi>or</hi> Conatus ad Motum verticalem, <hi>do gravitate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> which the Remarker thinks
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49448:75"/>
to have been more properly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Levitation;</hi> and to call it <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> is repugnant and contradictory to what is ſaid of the quality of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to avoid a frivolous contention of Words, it might have been fairly and eaſily obſerved, that in truth all kind of <hi>Gravitation</hi> is but <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Conatus ad Motum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in that <hi>Conatus</hi> or <hi>Niſus ad Motum,</hi> we are neceſſarily to conſider two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Principium Motivum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Terminus Motus,</hi> or <hi>Conatus ad Motum.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>Principium Motivum</hi> may be various, and tending to various ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, it may be extrinſecal and accidental; as when I throw a Stone into a Bucket of Water, the motion of the Water is thereby cauſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and raiſeth its <hi>Superficies,</hi> and the motion of the Water upward, is not altogether improperly called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi> upward, coming from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49448:76"/>Again, The Principle of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or <hi>Conatus ad Motum,</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick, and from that intrinſick Principle, may have a motion or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus ad Motum</hi> downward, which I call the intrinſick quality of <hi>Gravity;</hi> this intrinſick quality governs and enclines the Motion and <hi>Conatus ad Motum,</hi> to a central termination, when it hath no collateral impediment. Any man with half an eye may ſee here is a <hi>Conatus ad Motum</hi> of the heavy Body to a central motion, which is its <hi>Gravitation,</hi> and yet the Principle that impreſſeth this kind of termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Motion, is that which I call, and call truly, the Quality of Gravity in the heavy Body.</p>
               <p>In the very Inſtance of the Motion of Water in relation to the Rundle of Wood, ſpecifically lighter than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we may obſerve both theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations or Motions the Water preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth downward from its intrinſecal Principle or Quality of Gravity, and thereby undermines and gets below the Rundle; and then by a relative,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49448:76"/>
occaſional or accidental motion, in relation to the Rundle of Wood, it preſſeth upward, and drives up the Rundle of Wood with a force and kind of gravitation or motion upward to the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water: The ſame Water hath theſe various termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, one downward, from its own intrinſick quality of Gravity, though the exerciſe thereof be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till it find a lighter Body within its dimenſion to exert it; the other, upward, in relation to the Rundle of Wood, which by circumpulſion it drives upward.</p>
               <p>And therefore the kind conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that I hold, there is nothing but mobility in Bodies, and that I uſe the phraſe of Gravity according to the vulgar acceptation, and as <hi>Idolum fori,</hi> or that the actual deſcent of Water or other heavy Body, is from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Being, as is inferred in the firſt, ſecond and ſixth Sections of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are but miſtaken Collections, and have no conceſſion from me or any thing I have therein aſſerted, nor are at all true, as I think.</p>

                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49448:77"/>As to the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Illation in that <hi>Remark,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The Water hath no</hi> Niſus ad motum <hi>upward into the Tube immerſed, and ſtopped at the lower end, till opened,</hi> that, in the Sequel of this Enquiry will appear not to be altogether true: But if it were never ſo true, yet it impugnes not what is above by me delivered; for the Water is driven up into the Tube by the weight of the body of the Water in the Bucket, upon the Cavity of the Tube filled only with Air, and ſo the riſing of the Water into the Tube, is by the preſſure of an accidental Poſition, and the flui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the aſcending Water, meeting with an Element in the Tube lighter than the Water.</p>
               <p>We ſee in a pair of Scales a weight of two pound in one Scale, makes the weight of one pound in the other Scale, to aſcend, though both are heavy Bodies; and this by Mechanique and Statique Principles: So in the <hi>Siphon,</hi> A B, Water poured into the Leg A, raiſeth the water in the other
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49448:77"/>
Leg, to an equal <hi>Superficies,</hi> upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſtatique grounds, without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in any ſubſidiary Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to effect the aſcent; for rhe <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> is a kind of natural <hi>Libra:</hi> And ſo when the Tube ſtopped with the Finger beneath, is immerſed into a Bucket of Water, and then opened, the circumjacent water being both fluid and heavy, is driven up into the vacant Tube, till it come to an equal <hi>Superficies</hi> with the reſt of the water in the Bucket, by a kind of due <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium.</hi> And all this is moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and neceſſarily effected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common Mechaniſm of Statique Principles, without any help from the ſuppoſed Spirit of Nature, to fetch out the Air out of the Tube, or to raiſe the Water into it.</p>
               <p>There be many accidental cauſes of the motion of water vertically up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which yet conſiſt with its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal principle or quality, which I call <hi>Gravity,</hi> or <hi>Conatus</hi> to a central motion; For inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is moved upward by caſting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49448:78"/>
into it a heavier Body, which takes up ſome of its room; as throwing a Stone into a Bucket of water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is moved upward by attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as in Pumps and Syringes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is moved upward, when within its own dimenſion it meets with a lighter body than it ſelf; as in the inſtance of the Tube of Air immerſed, and then unſtopped at the bottom; or where a Rundle of lighter Wood is immerſed in it, it is apparent the water raiſeth it, and caſteth it to the <hi>Superficies</hi> with a kind of Force; ſo that it will leap above the <hi>Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the water, when it comes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But theſe accidental vertical Motions do not at all take away the intrinſick principle of its <hi>Gravity,</hi> but conſiſt with it; and therefore it is no contradiction to ſay that <hi>Gravitation</hi> is but <hi>Conatus ad Motum,</hi> be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lateral or vertical, or central; and yet at the ſame time to ſay, that <hi>Gravity</hi> is a quality in heavy bodies, that ſpecificates and determines their <hi>Conatus ad Motum</hi> to be central or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</p>

               <p>FOr the rendring my Thoughts more intelligible, touching <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi> of <hi>FLUIDS,</hi> and to make my Approaches to it the more eaſie and fair, I give in that Chapter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſolute ſolid Bodies, and how the preſſure of their parts are refracted, I begin with meer groſs Bodies, ſquare Stones of a foot ſquare; then deſcend to Wheat, Shot and Sand; and in theſe latter, I make my application to their own incumbency upon an Egg-ſhell, becauſe not ſo eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable by a perforation of their Baſe in reſpect of the exility of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles.</p>
               <p>But yet I muſt tell the Reader, that allowing the proportion of their perforated Hole in the Baſe, to be but anſwerable to the exility of their
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49448:80"/>
Bodies, the coalition of more grains of Wheat, Shot or Granules of Sand at the ſame Orifice ſo proportioned, would ſtop their ſubſiding; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to any that thinks it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, to obſerve in Hour-glaſſes, where the paſſage, though big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for one Granule of Sand, will not admit the paſſage of two or three crowded together; and Wheat will quarre in the Binn of a Mill if not ſhaken by the Clack.</p>
               <p>But as to the thing deſigned by theſe Inſtances, it is only to ſhew how by various, eſpecially lateral preſſures, the preſſure of a Column of Stone, Wheat, Shot or Sand upon a ſubjected Body, is much broken. And certainly in ſolid Bodies, <hi>ita ſe habent minora ad minora, ut majora ad majora.</hi> If we had a good Magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, we ſhould find the piling of the Granules of Sand upon Sand, though not ſo regular as is done by Maſonry; yet holding a fair and well-near equal analogy to it; one Granule of Sand would appear to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49448:80"/>
ſupport two or three, and thoſe again others; and the declivity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sands would be conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and their bearing againſt the ſides of the Veſſel, and their declination from the middle of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>But the great Objection that is all along made, is, that the Corpuſcles of Water are not to be reſembled to thoſe of Sand, but are much more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute and glib, and therefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances hold no proportion to that of water.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould admit the Remarkers Aſſertion, that Water is no continued Body, but conſiſts of minute ſeparate Corpuſcles, yet it would not much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Objection, for theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles are not Indiviſibles, but Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies conſiſting of trine dimenſion, and poſſibly there is not that diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between ſuch an Atome of Water and a Granule of Sand, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Granule of Sand and a white Peaſe, much leſs a Cube of 12 inches ſquare. And certainly in Bodies, <hi>ita ſe habent minora corpora ad minus ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49448:81"/>
ut majora ad majus:</hi> But I muſt not admit of this Suppoſition, that Water is no continued Body; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Water conjunct, though it be a fluid Body, is as really a continued Body, as Steel or Gold.</p>
               <p>But to render the Inſtances of Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as reaſonably explicative of this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in Water, I ſhall ſubjoin and explicate this rude Diagram.</p>

I ſay it is impoſſible the Column of water incumbent on the ſhell, could preſs upon it, unleſs it could preſs upon and remove the circular Baſe of Water, encircling the ſhell, and unleſs that ſink or remove by the incumbent water, the Egg-ſhell can be preſſed no more in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of water, than that of Sand or Peaſe mentioned, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. of the <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the <hi>Pamphlet.</hi> But ſince the encircling water B A D, is of the ſame texture, weight and conſiſtence with the reſt of the water, it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unmoved as a Rock, and bear the preſſure both of the perpendicular and declining water, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily protect the ſhell from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire preſſure of a Column of water commenſurate in Baſe to the Egg-ſhell, which cannot be without preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſplacing the circumjacent water, which is not poſſible; for now
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49448:82"/>
the water incumbent upon the ſhell, and the circumjacent water, make, as it were, one common Baſis to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior water.</p>
               <p>The analogy therefore between the inſtance of the ſand and water, and the accommodateneſs of the former to the explication of the latter, in this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the non-gravitation of Fluids upon included heavy bodies, conſiſts in theſe two Parallels.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the upper parts of the ſand or water, in relation to the lower parts, <hi>viz. premendo</hi> the lateral and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining motion and preſſure of both, breaking and allaying their perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or central preſſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the lower parts of the ſand and water in relation to the upper, <hi>viz. ſuſtinendo</hi> the Baſe of water or ſand, circumjacent to the Egg-ſhell, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the ſuſtentation of the whole ſuperior maſs of ſand or water, and every particle incumbent upon that Baſe, ſuſtaining a numerous company of other Particles, and thoſe again o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo that the whole commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

Column of the ſuperior ſand or water (abating that ſmall proportion, which, for want of a better expreſſion, I call a Cap or Cone) incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhell, cannot gravitate upon it. And thus I uſe my Maſonry of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique Stones to explicate the manner of the gravitation of Sand, and the Arch of Sands, to explicate how the perpendicular preſſure of water upon a ſubjected body in a Column com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate thereunto, is remedied; only in Sand the Monads and their mutual ſuſtentation is more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Eye, than in Water; but in Water the advantage is in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect more effective of this alleviation by the continuity of its Matter.</p>

               <p>THat the parts of Water, when in conjunction one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are only contiguous, I do admit by way of Argument; but I no where admit it by way of Conceſſion: for if I ſhould, I think I ſhould grant that which is by no means true. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore in that place argue, that were the parts of water ſolute, and only contiguous, yet even there the actual gravitation of them would be ſuſpended as well as in Sand.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the buſineſs of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and contiguity often occurs in the Remark, and great endeavours are therein uſed to prove the particles of Water and Air only contiguous, I ſhall here once for all, make ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations touching Continuity and Contiguity, that I may avoid Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>We learn both from the Ancient and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49448:84"/>
Modern Philoſophy, that <hi>Contigua ſunt, quorum ultima ſunt ſimul in ſitu, &amp; non eſt poſſibile quod inter ea cadat aliquid quod habet ſitum. Continuum autem il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud, cujus natura eſt quod inter partes ejus reperitur unus terminus communis,</hi> or, <hi>quorum ultima ſunt unum in actu:</hi> which is a little clearer explained by the Moderns, that <hi>Continua ſunt, quando ex pluribus quantis fiat unum totum nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſenſibili commiſſura inter partes rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nente;</hi> or, <hi>implicatio &amp; incorporatio partium unitarum;</hi> ſo that they, as it were, run one into another without any ſenſible diſcrimination of their <hi>Moles</hi> or <hi>Situs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although in groſſer Bodies there is more required than contiguity, to make them continuous, yet in Liquids, eſpecially perfectly homogeneal, as Water and Water, Air and Air, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> there ariſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of parts meerly upon their contiguity or contingency; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they preſently incorporate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and mingle ſo one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there remaines no poſſible
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49448:85"/>
diſtinction of the parts united, one drop of water touching another, one portion of Air touching another, one little globule of <hi>Mercury</hi> touching ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, become perfectly continued bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without more ado, though they were before divided by their diſtance, and interpoſition of another Body; this is apparent to our very Senſe, that theſe are undiſtinguiſhably united, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated and implicated one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their very contact, as cloſely, though not ſo firmly as Lead, Iron, or Gold, after Hammering or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>In all Bodies that are in continuity, as there is a unity of Exiſtence, ſo (ordinarily, though not alwayes) follows a unity of motion. It doth not alwayes follow, becauſe there may intervene ſomething that may diſorder or break it.</p>
               <p>But in things barely contiguous, as they are not in themſelves united ſo regularly; <hi>ad motum unius non ſequitur motus alterius,</hi> unleſs united by alliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in Chains of ſeveral Links;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49448:85"/>
by ſome other accidental intervention, as in the coheſion of diſtinct contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bodies, for the avoiding of Vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in poliſhed Marble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And herein we may eaſily obſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of Water.</p>
               <p>Take a <hi>Siphon,</hi> and fill it with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtopping both Legs with your finger, till the ſhorter Leg be immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into a Veſſel of water, the water will be entirely drawn out of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel by a <hi>Funiculus</hi> of continued water, aſcending and deſcending from the firſt immerſion, as is ſhewed in the <hi>Additions</hi> to the <hi>Nugae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But fill the <hi>Siphon</hi> with the fineſt Powder or Sand, that traction will never follow upon its immerſion into a Veſſel of the ſame or the like Sand or Powder; for in the former there is a traction by the continued Body of Water: But in the latter, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are ſolute, and only contiguous, and will not cohere, but gives us the Proverb of a Rope of Sand.</p>
               <p>And what is here obſerved touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuity of Water, and the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49448:86"/>
traction wrought in the virtue of that continuity, is obſervable touching the Air, and the traction wrought by its filaments, as appears moſt evidently in the <hi>Magdeburg Hemiſpheres,</hi> in the 18th. Chapter of the <hi>Difficiles Nugae,</hi> and in the raiſing and holding up of water in the heated Tube or Glaſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 16th. Chapter, which could never be effected, did the Air conſiſt only of contiguous and ſolute particles, unleſs we ſhould dream they were faſtened together by Hooks or Chains.</p>
               <p>And upon what hath been ſaid, it is moſt apparent, that neither the ſoftneſs of the Air, nor its eaſie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility or ſeparability by a Feather or a Cobweb, nor the attenuation of the particles of water into vapors, by the heat of the Sun, are ſo much as tolerable Reaſons againſt their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity; for although the disjunction and ſeparation of the parts interrupt the continuity between the parts, when actually ſeparated, yet the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parability or eaſineſs of ſeparability of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49448:86"/>
the parts of it, are not ſo much as a ſhadow of Argument againſt their continuity, till ſuch an actual ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be made. No man that thinks twice, can imagine that Lead in fuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is leſs a continued Body, than when it was ſolid; or that Gold bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into Leaf, is leſs continued than when in the Ingot, and yet the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability of its parts much more facile than before. And therefore the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of contiguity only of fluid Bodies, is the effect of that <hi>Idolum Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> or <hi>Carteſianum,</hi> which with his imaginary <hi>Globuli,</hi> and their <hi>Ramenta,</hi> the <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> hath diſordered mens Sentiments, as in many other things, ſo in this, touching <hi>Continuity</hi> and <hi>Ratio Continui.</hi>

                  <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in his Third Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>De Inſidentibus Humido,</hi> tells us, that if ſolid Bodies, having a Bulk or <hi>Moles,</hi> be equally heavy to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein they are placed, being let down into the Water, are ſo immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that nothing of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water is above them, yet they are not preſſed downward.</p>
               <p>And in the Sixth Propoſition, he tells, that a Solid Body, lighter than the Water, being forced down into
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49448:88"/>
the Water, is driven up with ſuch a force, as the Water having an equal <hi>Moles</hi> to that immerſed Body, is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than that Body.</p>
               <p>And this driving upward of the lighter Body, is by that circumpulſion of a heavier fluid Body upon another Body lighter than it ſelf, which will (if it can) take up the place that the lighter Body hath invaded within its Dimenſions, and the Limits of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, the reaſon of the motion of a Ballance or <hi>Libra Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialis</hi> in the Air, wherein a heavier weight in one Scale, lifts up a lighter weight in the other Scale, is in effect the ſame with this natural libration between the heavier Body of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the lighter Body of the Wood; only here it ſeems like a Ballance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, wherein the counterpoiſe of the <hi>Moles</hi> of Water being greater and more than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of a lighter ſolid Body, muſt needs overweigh it, and if it be poſſible, get below and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as in this Scheme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:49448:88"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe A, be a Cube of Wood of 6 inches ſquare, immerſed towards the bottom of the Cubical Veſſel of Water C D, and lighter than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water, this Cube takes up the room of 234 ſquare inches, which (were not the Cube there) would be in a great meaſure taken up by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Cube of wood is environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a quantity of water equal in <hi>Moles</hi> to this Cube of wood, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it conſiderably in weight, the weight of the water muſt neceſſarily preponderate the Cube of wood, and conſequently muſt thruſt it upward, that it may poſſeſs the place the Cube of wood hath invaded, and ſo in this <hi>Libra Naturalis</hi> the heavier <hi>Moles</hi> of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49448:89"/>
water muſt neceſſarily drive up the lighter <hi>Moles</hi> of wood, as in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Scale, the heavier Scale raiſeth the lighter.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that without the aid of an <hi>Hylarchical Principle</hi> the Water bears and carries up the Rundle of light wood in the Inſtance ſo often magnified by the <hi>Remarker.</hi> For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Rundle were ſo cloſely faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Baſe, either by ſome glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous matter, or by its ſtrict jointing and adheſion to the ſides or Baſe of the Veſſel, as would be too ſtrong for the water, to diſplace it, it is hardly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by any art whatſoever to make the Rundle ſo cloſe to the Baſe of the Veſſel, but the ſubtil particles of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will creep between the Rundle and the Baſe, and throw it up in ſpite of the imaginary Column of water, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the Rundle that is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to keep it down: and herein, as I before obſerved, the water hath acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, and upon this occaſion a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upward, which yet is but the Conſequent of its motion downward below the Rundle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:49448:89"/>And upon the ſame account it is, if you take a hollow Cane, ſuppoſe one inch diameter, 12 inches long, let the Baſe thereof be filled with a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Lead for about an inch, then let there be powred in 6 inches of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then there will remain 5 inches of Air in the upper part of the Cane, although the Lead be heavier than ſo much water, and the water in the Cane equal in ſpecifical weight to ſo much water; yet as long as the whole weight of the Cane thus compounded, doth not equal the weight of a like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> of water, this Cane immerſed into a Veſſel of water 12 inches deep, will not ſubſide or reſt at the bottom of the Veſſel, but will be driven up to that height in the water, that the parts of the Cane ſubſiding in the water, will countervail a <hi>Moles</hi> of water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the weight of the whole Cane, and there it will ſwim erect. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the very Reaſon of the thing, makes the truth hereof apparent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stevin</hi> (that next to <hi>Archimedes,</hi> hath written beſt of <hi>Hydroſtatiques</hi>)
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49448:90"/>
in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book, <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. ſuppoſeth nevertheleſs, that if this Rundle co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a hole in the bottom of the Veſſel, it will not riſe, but will be kept down by the impending Column of water commenſurate to the Baſe of the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albert Girard,</hi> the Commentator, denies this; unleſs the Rundle be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual or greater weight than the like quantity of water.</p>
               <p>But the truth lies between them both; for the Rundle lighter than the water, will be undermined in the Rims and Edges, and ſo the water will get out, do what the Artiſt can, if the Rundle be lighter than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water.</p>
               <p>But then when the water hath thus gotten a paſſage to paſs through the Orifice into the free Air (upon which it hath been ſhewn, the <hi>Moles</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commenſurate to the paſſage it hath now, preſſeth with its full ſwing) and if it meets with the Rundle in the way of its motion, ſo long as it ſtands in its way, it will gravitate upon it
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49448:90"/>
till the water hath wholly diſcharged it ſelf through the Orifice.</p>
               <p>And therefore the reaſon is obvious why there is ſome impediment in the aſcent of the Rundle, when it is thus placed upon an Orifice, without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in any other principle than the natural preſſure of the water upon that Orifice, now giving it an acceſs to an Element that it can preſs upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Air below the Orifice.</p>
               <p>Juſt as we ſee in our Kettles and Brewing Furnaces, when they have a ſmall Leak, the Servant throws in a handful of Bran, which though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance it would not ſo readily ſink, much leſs ſink to the Leak, yet the motion of the water to the Leak, will carry thoſe light and ſmall particles thither, which being crouded in by the weight of that Column of water that is commenſurate to the Orifice of the Leak, ſtops it.</p>
               <p>And the like is done upon a Leak in a Ship, where a light Fardel thrown out into the Sea, will be carried down to the Leak, and crowded into it by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49448:91"/>
the water, &amp; ſometimes ſtop the Leak.</p>
               <p>And therefore touching the gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Column of Water upon the Rundle of light wood, where there is a hole under it in the Baſe (which I add as an exception, <hi>pag.</hi> 57. and is no more than what <hi>Stevin</hi> tells us in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Book of his <hi>Practical Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques</hi>) both He and I muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood where any little water paſſeth under the Rundle to the Hole, and therefore to clear that Experiment, and the reaſon of it, I made exact tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als concerning it, as followeth.</p>
               <p>I took a Cylindrous Bucket of about eight inches diameter, and five inches deep, and made a round hole in the bottom, of two inches diameter, and a rundle of light wood of 4 inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to cover it, with a ſtick in the midſt,
<figure/>
to lift it up, or preſs it down, or to ſuſpend the Rundle by it to a Balance, according to the Figure in the Margin, and made it as ſmooth and even to the Baſe of the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket as I could, and preſſed it
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49448:91"/>
the Orifice, and filled the Bucket with water, yet the water, do what I could, would preſs between the ſides of the Rundle and the Baſe of the Veſſel, and ſo diſcharge it ſelf in ſome ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion through the Orifice, and all that while it did ſo, the Rundle, though lighter than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water, was kept down by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and iſſuing of that ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, and ſo continued, till al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the water had thus run out; the reaſon whereof is before given, <hi>viz.</hi> the motion of the water to the Orifice, kept down the Rundle. But then emptying all the water, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Orifice and Rundle dry, I applied Neats-foot Oyl to the Rundle and Baſe, which by its glutinous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence kept the Rundle and Baſe cloſe together, and applied the Ballance to the hook of the Handle of the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and it was not ſevered from the Baſe by leſs than 7 ounces, though the Rundle weighed not above an ounce.</p>
               <p>Then oyling the Baſe and Rundle as before, and uniting them, I filled the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49448:92"/>
Bucket with water, which by reaſon of the glutinous Oyl, did not paſs, nor ſever the Rundle from the Baſe.</p>
               <p>Then fixing the Rundle as before, to a Scale, I tried what weight was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſever the Rundle from the Baſe, being under the ſuppoſed preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that imaginary Colum of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of 5 inches deep, and I found that very near the ſame weight would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it from the Baſe under water, as did ſever it when it lay dry; and though in ſeveral trials there was ſome little diſparity, which might ariſe from the unequal ſtrictneſs of the juncture, either by the quantity of Oil, or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rundle, wherein I could not poſſibly be exactly uniform, yet the Rundle was ſeparated under tnat <hi>Moles</hi> of water, ſometimes with ſeven ounces weight, ſometimes with eight; but at moſt, with ten ounces. And yet in the Column of water commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the Rundle, were 55 ſquare inches; which, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt computation of the weight of water, amounted to at leaſt 24 ounces
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49448:92"/>
weight: And this ſheweth that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of the water upon the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, is to be underſtood, when there is ſome paſſage to give the water mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that it ſeems to me, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that the <hi>Remarker</hi> makes from this Inſtance, in favour of the <hi>Hylar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Principle,</hi> or the ſuppoſed Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of a Cylinder of water upon the Rundle where no water paſſeth, muſt be laid aſide, as no way aſſiſting his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> in impugning mine.</p>
               <p>And therefore, whereas <hi>Stevinus</hi> in his <hi>Practical Hydroſtatique, ubi ſupra,</hi> grants, that the Body of a man, or other Body, lying flat upon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a great Veſſel of water, feels no conſiderable preſſure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent water, yet if there be a hole in the bottom of the Veſſel under that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it ſhall find a conſiderable preſſure of the incumbent water; this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>cum grano Salis, viz.</hi> if the Body do not ſo entirely and cloſely ſtop the Orifice in the bottom of the Veſſel; but that the water finds a paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Baſe, to diſcharge
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49448:93"/>
it ſelf, the Body then indeed ſhall find a preſſure from the ſuperior water at leaſt, according to the weight of ſuch a Column of water as can thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelf between the Body and bottom through the Orifice. But if it ſtop the Orifice ſo entirely and cloſe, that no water can paſs that way, there will enſue no Gravitation upon the Body, by reaſon of that Hole or Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thus ſtopped; for it is as if it were not: the body becomes as it were part of the entire cloſe Baſe of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>And thus much may ſerve to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the orifice or hole in the Baſe of a veſſel under the Rundle.</p>
               <p>But now as to the Inſtance given in the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Remark,</hi> whereunto the Learned <hi>Remarker</hi> appeals as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Inſtance to take away at once the Mechanical Accounts of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and Architecture, I doubt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives us this Experiment without exact trial; for if he had tried it, I think he would never have urged it.</p>
               <p>The Experiment, as I take it, is this; Take a Cylindraceous Bucket
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49448:93"/>
of 63 parts in the internal Diameter, and let another Cylindraceous Bucket be of 62 parts external diameter, with 4 ſloping holes at the bottom, and put the leſs into the greater, and fill them up with Water to the Brims, then take away your hand, and the narrower Bucket will emerge, leaving no more in the water than what is equal to the weight of ſuch a <hi>Moles</hi> of water as is equal to the whole Veſſel in weight.</p>
               <p>I ſhall take this Inſtance in pieces, and then we ſhall ſee what is in it,</p>
               <p>And for the better clearing of it, I ſhall make my way to it by Inſtances, though not altogether like it, yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great light to it, and it may be, to other matters of this kind; and I ſhall firſt conſider the compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bodies ſpecifically heavier than the fluids, and then in Bodies ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally lighter.</p>
               <p>If there be a Bucket or a Cylindra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous Veſſel, ſuppoſe 9 inches deep, then take a Cylinder of 9 inches high, and narrower than the Bucket, but of a Material ſpecifically heavier than
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49448:94"/>
the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water, as ſuppoſe it Tin or Ebony; if the Veſſel be filled with a <hi>Moles</hi> of water of twice or thrice, or ten times the extrinſick weight of that Cylinder, yet the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder will ſtill ſink to the bottom, by its advantage of its intrinſick or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical over-weight or heavineſs more than water.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall conſider the proportion where the ſolid Body is ſpecifically lighter than Water or other fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Which it is immerſed.</p>
               <p>I took a Cylinder of wood 4 inches deep, and 4 inches diameter, which weighed 18 ounces.</p>
               <p>The like Bulk of Water equal in Bulk to that Cylinder of Wood, weighed 32 ounces.</p>
               <p>So that the Water had a ſpecifical or intrinſick weight near double to the Wood.</p>
               <p>And conſequently the Wood being immerſed in a Veſſel of Water, near one half thereof lay above the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies</hi> of the Water, as it muſt do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of <hi>Hydroſtatiques.</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:49448:94"/>
I took 2 Cylindrous Veſſels, one of 6 inches diameter, the other of 9 inches diameter; I put the Cylinder of wood into the Veſſel of 6 inches diameter, and as much water as countervailed the Wood-Cylinder in extrinſick weight, but not in Bulk, and the wood-Cylinder would not ſwim; for though the intrinſick weight of the Water was near double to the weight of the Wood, yet the extrinſick weight of both was equal, <hi>viz,</hi> 18 ounces, and ſo there was an <hi>Equipondium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Water and the Wood, and conſequently that Water would not raiſe the Wood from the Baſe of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>But putting in ſo much Water more into that Veſſel, as that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral or ambient Water would riſe ſo high as to cover a little more than one half of the Cylinder of Wood (namely, ſuch a quantity thereof as was equal to a <hi>Moles</hi> of Water, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderating the weight of the whole Cylinder of Wood) then the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Wood would ſwim, though
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49448:95"/>
the Baſe of the Water between the Cylinder of Wood and the bottom of the Veſſel had not half an inch in depth.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, becauſe the entire water both lateral, and at the bottom, is one continued body, and entirely preſſeth the Cylinder of wood upward, in as much as the lateral or ambient water hath gained an height upon the Cylinder, ſomewhat more than the immerſed parts of the Cylinder of wood proportionable to a <hi>Moles</hi> of water equal to the whole weight which that whole Cylinder of wood amounts unto; for the Cylinder of wood weighed but 18 ounces, but the whole weight of the water might be 20 ounces or more.</p>
               <p>But again, put this Cylinder of wood into the Cylindrous Veſſel or Bucket of 9 inches diameter cloſe to the Baſe, and pour in four or five times the quantity of water into the Bucket more than what was in the former Cylindrous Veſſel of ſix inches diameter; as ſuppoſe it be five pounds
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49448:95"/>
of water, yet unleſs the <hi>Superficies</hi> of that water riſe not to more than the height of half the Cylinder of wood, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomething more than two inches high upon the ſides, the Cylinder of wood will reſt upon the Baſe, and will not ſwim: And the reaſon is, becauſe the water preſſeth according to its altitude, and not according to its amplitude, and therefore though the whole water in the 9 inches buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket be five times more in weight than the Cylinder of wood is, if it riſe not ſo high as to take ſomething more than half of the height of the Cylinder of wood, namely, ſuch a quantity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as is commenſurate to a quantity of water equal in weight to the whole weight of the Cylinder of wood, the Cylinder of wood would not ſwim, but will ſtand upon its Baſe at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel. And this is the reaſon why a Ship or Veſſel that draws for the purpoſe 4 fathom of water, will ſwim in a narrow Cut or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel that hath 5 or 6 fathom of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though the Channel be leſs than
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49448:96"/>
20 fathom over in breadth; and if the Channel were 20 Miles over, and of a leſs depth than the Ships draught of water, <hi>viz.</hi> 4 fathom, the Ship will be on ground, and will not ſwim, and yet the weight and quantity of whole water in the broader Channel, is many thouſand times more than that in the narrow Channel.</p>
               <p>And the like Inſtance may be given in Floats of Timber in a deep and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Channel, and a broad and ſhallow Channel.</p>
               <p>For the preſſure of water is more or leſs according to the height or depth of water, and not according to its amplitude or breadth, though the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ampler <hi>Superficies</hi> be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more in weight and bulk than the deeper water.</p>
               <p>Now to the Buckets inſtanced in the <hi>Remarks;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be a Bucket of 20 inches diameter, and another of equal height but of 6 inches diameter, fill the leſſer Bucket with water, and place it in the middle of the greater Bucket, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49448:96"/>
then fill the circumjacent ſides of the greater Bucket with water, though the greater Bucket hold 5 times the water of the leſſer Bucket, yet (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I muſt, the wood of the leſſer Bucket to be but of the ſame weight with the like <hi>Moles</hi> of Water) the leſſer Bucket will ſtill remain conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the bottom, and will not riſe one inch, and the reaſon is, becauſe the water without, and the water within the Bucket, though of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Moles,</hi> yet have the ſame ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical weight, and (as to this purpoſe) as if it were ſo much unveſſeled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (I ſay, as to this purpoſe, for as to the other purpoſes, there will be a difference, as I ſhall ſhew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.)</p>
               <p>But if the leſſer Bucket be totally empty, or only filled part with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuppoſe half way, then the water in the greater Bucket, will drive up the leſſer; but not till only ſo much be immerſed as countervails its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of weight, according to the 4<hi>th.</hi> 5<hi>th</hi> and 6<hi>th. Propoſition</hi> of <hi>Archimedes, ubi ſupra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:49448:97"/>But now to come to the Experiment of the leſſer Bucket or Cylindraceous Veſſel perforated in the bottom, and then water poured into the greater or leſſer (for it comes all to one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) will the leſſer Bucket emerge, unleſs held down by the hand? By no means in the world; for the water will preſently paſs through the perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from one Bucket to the other, till they come to one common ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial height, and ſtill the leſſer Bucket will reſt upon the Baſe of the greater, becauſe they have an <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium;</hi> ſuppoſing (as we muſt) that the wood of the leſſer Bucket is of equal ſpecifical weight to the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water. Indeed it is true, that if the holes be ſmall, ſo that there muſt be a <hi>Mora</hi> before the water can be conveyed from one Veſſel to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then if the water be plentifully poured into the ſides of the greater Bucket, the leſſer will riſe till it have received ſo much water as equals the <hi>Superficies</hi> of both, and then the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Bucket will ſubſide contiguous
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49448:97"/>
to the Baſe; for the water in both Buckets being of an equal height, was in <hi>aequipendio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that as the Inſtance it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth little to the ends propounded, were it true; ſo I doubt it is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and upon trial will not be found true.</p>
               <p>I did expect to have met with an Objection which may ſeem <hi>prima facie</hi> to impugne what I have formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; yet upon a ſtrict examination it would not have any efficacy.</p>
               <p>Take a Cube or Cylinder of wood of equal intrinſick weight with ſo much water, ſuppoſe it a Cube of ſix inches diameter, and put it into a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder or cubique Veſſel of water of eight inches deep, and twelve inches diameter, this Cube or Cylinder would reſt two inches above the Baſe of the Veſſel, and would not gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate either upon the two inches of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Baſe of the Veſſel, nor upon any Body that were but two inches thick, and lay between the Cube and the Baſe of the Veſſel of water, yet

here can be no lateral preſſure or <hi>per declive</hi> in the Cube, it ſelf being ſolid, and having only a central gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that it may ſeem the lateral preſſure which is the Subject of the Eighth Chapter of the <hi>Eſſay,</hi> applied to the Water, is no ingredient into its Non-gravitation.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that the Fact is true, but the illation thereupon is not conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
               <p>In my Obſervation upon the 4<hi>th,</hi> 5<hi>th,</hi> and 7<hi>th. Remark,</hi> I ſay the non-gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Fluids</hi> is in relation to the preſſure of the upper parts upon the lower, which is <hi>per declive premendo:</hi> and in relation of the lower parts to the upper <hi>ſuſtinendo;</hi> now although in this Inſtance the former hath no part, yet the latter hath.</p>
               <p>In this inſtance the Cube or Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder is ſuſtained and born up by the ſubjacent water, which is as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal upon which it is bottomed; and therefore neither doth nor can preſs below the poſition it holds: But ſuppoſe the Body ſubjacent to it,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49448:98"/>
were 6 inches deep, then it would be under the preſſure of that Cylinder or Cube of wood, as much as the weight of 4 inches of the Cube a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to in the water, and the body would be under a preſſure commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at leaſt to ſo much weight as the Cube, or ſo much thereof as is thereby driven out of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water, exceeds in its extrinſick weight the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water, with ſo much of the Cube as lies in the water.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, where there is nothing impending upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent body but the ſuperior imaginary Column of water, the ſubjected body is not compreſſed at 9, 6 or 3 inches immerſion below the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water, partly by reaſon of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm (I do not ſay Maſonry of the water, though that expreſſion is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, but needleſly uſed by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi>) and partly by reaſon of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious termination of the motions of fluid Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:49448:99"/>It ſhall not be altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſubjoin the enſuing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I took a Cube of wood 4 inches ſquare, and very near of an equal ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick weight of the like <hi>Moles</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for it did not riſe half an inch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water, and being let down to ſubſide freely in a Veſſel brim-full of water, it threw over a portion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very near of the ſame weight with it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> 28 ounces and a half.</p>
               <p>This Cube being laid into a Veſſel of 8 inches deep of water, therefore was raiſed at his Baſe about 4 inches above the water in the Baſe of the Veſſel, which water ſuſtained it. And now it had been unqueſtionable that if a body of leſs than 4 inches thick, had been ſubjected under the Cube, it would have ſuſtained no preſſure from the water nor from the Cube, which was entirely born up to that height by the ſubjacent water.</p>
               <p>But if the body ſubjected to the Cube, had been 5, 6 or 7 inches thick, it would have been preſſed upon by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49448:99"/>
various proportions from the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cube.</p>
               <p>For fixing a ſtring and hook to the middle of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Cube, it required near 12 ounces in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Scale, to raiſe the <hi>Superficies</hi> 2 inches above the water; near 20 ounces to raiſe it 3 inches above the water; and near 28 ounces and a half to raiſe the lower <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Cube equal in height to the upper <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water, which anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the full weight of the Cube of wood; and therefore according to theſe proportions, it would gravitate upon a ſubjacent body that gave it the like elevations.</p>
               <p>But in water we ſee the preſſure dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the preſſure of ſuch a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cube; for in whatſoever depth the ſubjected body is immerſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deeper or ſhallower, it ſuſtains no ſenſible difference of the preſſure of the Column of water impending upon it, nor indeed any ſenſible preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at all, though at five or ten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep; which, as it gives us the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49448:100"/>
difference between the preſſure of a ſolid and fluid body, upon a body in water ſubjected to it, ſo it gives us the reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſſure of the ſolid body is impeded only by the ſubjected water, bearing it up, <hi>viz. ſuſtinendo.</hi> But there are two impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments that hinder the preſſure of the ſuperior water upon the lower water on the body under it, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuſtentation of the ſuperior water by the inferior; and likewiſe the lateral and declivous motion of the water, refracting its perpendicular preſſure, while it is ſolute water.</p>
               <p>And now becauſe that the various habitudes of heavier or lighter bodies immerſed in fluids heavier or lighter than themſelves, ſeems to be a pleaſant, and poſſibly a uſeful Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and yet is difficult to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and explicitly, and clearly declared: And poſſibly in what is before ſaid in this Obſervation, the ſame is not ſo diſtinctly delivered as might be wiſhed; I ſhall therefore deſire the Readers pardon, if I reſume
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49448:100"/>
and repeat much of what is before ſaid, and digeſt the whole in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a clearer method.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall declare the difference between the terms of intrinſick and extrinſick weight, whether of fluids or ſolids, and what I mean by thoſe terms, and how one body is ſaid to exceed another in intrinſick or extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick weight, or both; That body which hath more of bodily <hi>Moles</hi> or Matter than another body of the ſame dimenſion, is intrinſecally heavier than that body which hath the ſame dimenſion, and yet hath leſs corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Matter or material Subſtance in it; and therefore is denſer and craſſer than the latter, and the indication of that denſity and craſſitude is by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight it hath over the other body; as a cubique inch of Gold is heavier, and therefore hath more of material ſubſtance than a cubique inch of Braſs or Iron; and a cubique inch of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is heavier, and therefore hath more of material ſubſtance in it than a cubique inch of water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49448:101"/>And therefore a heavier body im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed into a lighter fluid, as a cubique inch of Gold, Braſs, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into water, though it take up but the room and dimenſion of a like cubique inch of the water wherein it is immerſed, muſt needs ſink into the water, and drive up that cubique inch of water in its motion of deſcent; for it out-weighs it: and as in an artificial bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the Scale that is charged with the greater weight, raiſeth up the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath the leſſer; ſo it is in this natural libration between the heavier body and the lighter fluid. And that I may here ſay it once for all, there is a moſt perfect analogy between the artificial Ballance and this natural Ballance, in relation to the motions of and in fluids; and he that means to have a true image of the latter, muſt attain it beſt by compariſon of it with the former.</p>
               <p>A body that is ſpecifically or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally lighter than another, yet by acceſſion, or accumulation, or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of more parts of Matter than
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49448:101"/>
another body intrinſecally heavier, hath, may thereby extrinſecally, and in denomination, and alſo in its effect of preponderation, be heavier than that other; as two pounds of water is heavier extrinſecally, and in prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration than a pound of Gold, though intrinſecally heavier: And therefore, if a Cube or Cylinder of wood be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed intrinſecally lighter than water, yet if ſuch a Cylinder of wood, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 4 pounds, be immerſed into a like cylindrous Veſſel of water, which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath not 4 pounds of weight, the cylinder of wood will ſink, and will not emerge, becauſe in extrinſick weight it exceeds the extrinſick weight of the water in the Veſſel into which it is immerſed. But if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be of the weight of four pound and a half (and in a due poſition, as ſhall be ſhewed) the cylinder of wood will riſe and ſwim in the water, becauſe, now as well the extrinſick, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick weight of the wooden cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is over-weighed by the water.</p>
               <p>If a body that is intrinſecally hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49448:102"/>
be immerſed into a body intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally lighter, as Gold into water, it will ſubſide, as hath been ſaid: But yet a body intrinſecally heavier than the fluid wherein it is immerſed, may accidentally be extrinſecally lighter than the body wherein it is immerſed, namely, when it acquires a Bulk or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſo large, that a like <hi>Moles</hi> of water will be of a greater weight than ſuch an immerſed body ſpecifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intrinſecally heavier, and then that body, though intrinſecally hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, will ſwim upon the water, and be ſuſtained by it.</p>
               <p>The moſt obvious Inſtances of this kind, are two, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When that body intrinſecally heavier is mingled and concreted with other bodies intrinſecally lighter than the fluid wherein it is immerſed, and ſo the whole concrete immerſed body weighs leſs than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of water would weigh; as where a ſmall quantity of Gold or Lead is mingled with a greater quantity of wood lighter than water, and ſo both
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49448:102"/>
make up a concrete body lighter than ſo much water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the body intrinſecally hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, is formed into a Cavity, as in Tin, Silver or Lead-Bottles, though the Material be ſpecifically heavier than water, yet if they have ſuch a dimenſion as that a quantity or <hi>Moles</hi> of water, of the ſame external dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will exceed ſuch Bottle (as it ſtands empty) in weight, this body intrinſecally heavier, yet extrinſecally is lighter than the water wherein it is immerſed, and therefore will be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by it.</p>
               <p>And upon this reaſon it is that Ships and other Veſſels are born up by the water, although they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lad<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> with great Ordnance, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and other things intrinſecally heavier than the like quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet in as much as the whole Ship or Veſſel hath a great Cavity, and takes up room in the Sea, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to that ſtructure, and a <hi>Moles</hi> of water commenſurate to the hull of the Ship, as it hath that concave
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49448:103"/>
poſture, is of much greater extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick weight than the Veſſel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is born up and ſuſtained by it. And thus a body intrinſecally hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than a fluid wherein it is immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, may be extrinſecally lighter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of its concretion or compoſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of its ſtructure and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which gives a greater ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to it. That body is ſaid to be both extrinſecally and intrinſecally heavier, when it exceeds another body in both reſpects, as an Ingott of Gold that weighs two pounds, is both extrinſecally and intrinſecally heavier than an Ingot of Silver, weighing only one pound.</p>
               <p>And thus far concerning weight extrinſick and intrinſick.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Second thing which I intend, is, to declare the various habitudes of heavier or lighter bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with relation to the fluids in which they are immerſed; whereby poſſibly much of the Learning and Experience <hi>De inſidentibus humido,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:49448:103"/>
may be explicated, namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where a body ſpecifically or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally heavier, is immerſed in a fluid intrinſecally lighter than it ſelf, as Gold, Lead or Iron in water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where a body is immerſed into a fluid of equal weight with it ſelf, which though it may be difficult to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet attainable it is, as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a body ſpecifically or intrinſecally lighter, is immerſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fluid, and intrinſecally heavier than it ſelf; as a Globe or Cube of Fir or Elm into water, which is much heavier intrinſecally than ſuch light Woods.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When a body intrinſecally ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, y<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> extrinſecally heavier than that portion of fluid wherein it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed, be equal in weight to it, as where a Globe or Cube of Fir or Elm, weighing ſix pounds, is immerſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Veſſel of water containing juſt ſix pounds weight of water, or any quantity leſs than it. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If a denſe body being immerſed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49448:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a fluid intrinſecally lighter than it, that denſe body will ſubſide to the bottom, though the fluid body in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal weight be more than forty times of greater extent than ſuch a denſe body; as if a Cube or Globe of Lead or <hi>Mercury,</hi> though but of an inch diameter, be caſt into the deep Ocean, for the Reaſons before given, where I treat of the difference between extrinſick and intrinſick diſparity of Gravity: Only it hath thoſe Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before given, touching the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch heavier body with a lighter, and the configuration of ſuch denſe body into Cavity or hollowneſs, for the Reaſons there given, which I need not repeat.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a denſe body be immerſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fluid of an equal intrinſick weight with ſuch denſe body, it is generally thought that ſuch denſe body will keep any poſition that it is put into, if placed near the top, or in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or near the Ballance of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel containing the fluid (though I have for the moſt part obſerved it to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49448:104"/>
riſe towards the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the fluid, and hold its upper <hi>Superficies</hi> equal to it) as ſuppoſe a Cube of water ſix inches ſquare weigh 14 pound, a like cubique piece of wood of the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion and weight, will ſtand at all poſitions in a Veſſel of 7 or 8 Gallons of water; for ſuch a denſe Body is as ſo much water in this reſpect, they being of equal Bulk, and equal intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick weight. But it is a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to find juſt ſuch an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity between Solids and Fluids, being of ſuch different textures. The beſt Expedient is by a hollow Vial-Glaſs, reduced to ſuch an <hi>equipondium</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſmall leaden Shot into it, till the Glaſs and Shot ariſe to the juſt <hi>equipondium</hi> of a Bulk of water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the whole <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Glaſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When a Body intrinſecally lighter than a Fluid is immerſed in ſuch fluid, part of that lighter Body will riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water, or other Fluid into which it is immerſed, and will leave ſo much of it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49448:105"/>
the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water, as is equal to a Body or Bulk of water fully commenſurate to the whole weight of ſuch immerſed Body. For inſtance, Suppoſe a Globe of light wood of ſix inches diameter weigh 5 pound, and a globular portion of water of the like diameter weigh 10 pounds, this globe of wood immerſed in a large Veſſel of water, will riſe ſo that one half there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will be above the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water and the other half will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the water; for the intrinſick weight of the water is double to the intrinſick weight of the wood; ſo that a portion of water equal to half the Globe of wood, weighs as much as the whole Globe of wood. And the like proportion will hold where the Globe of wood is lighter than the like portion of water by one third, or one fourth, or one ſixth part, <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If a groſs Body (ſuppoſe of wood) ſpecifically lighter than the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, be immerſed into a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water extrinſecally lighter than
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49448:105"/>
that immerſed Body, that Body, though ſpecifically and intrinſecally lighter, will not riſe from the bottom of the Veſſel, but will ſink down to the Baſe or bottom of the Veſſel, and remain contiguous to it, notwithſtanding the intrinſecal overweight of the water to the immerſed Body; as if in the former inſtance, a Globe of wood of 6 inches diameter, and 5 pound weight, be lighter by half intrinſecally than the like portion of water, if this Globe of wood be immerſed into a cylindrous Veſſel of 7 or 8 inches diameter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 4 pound weight, nay 5 pound weight of water, the Globe of wood ſhall not ſwim nor riſe from the Baſe of the Veſſel, and the reaſon is apparent, becauſe though in intrinſick weight, the water is double to that wood, yet in extrinſick weight the Globe of wood in one inſtance exceeds, in the other inſtance equals the extrinſick weight of the water, and ſo the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick weight of the water, is over-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the extrinſick weight of the wood, and therefore cannot preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49448:106"/>
it, nor conſequently drive it up; as in a pair of Scales, if there be two pound of Feathers in one Scale, and but a pound of Lead in the other, the pound of Lead, though intrinſecally heavier than the Feathers, will not raiſe the Scale of the Feathers, but will be raiſed up by them; and if in one Scale there be two pound of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in the other two pound of Lead, neither Scale will be raiſed by the other, but ſtand in a ſtate of reſt, becauſe in <hi>Aequilibrio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If a Cube or Globe of wood of ſix inches diameter, and weighing ſix pound, be but half ſo heavy as the like Globe or Cube of water (weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the purpoſe 13 pound) and be immerſed into a Veſſel of water ten or twenty foot ſquare, which is filled with water only to two inches deep; though this water be of an intrinſick double weight to the Cube or Globe of wood, and extrinſecally it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove forty times more weighty than that Cube or Globe of wood; yet that Cube or Globe of wood will
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49448:106"/>
ſubſide to the Baſe of the Veſſel, or reſt there in contiguity to it, without any ſwimming or bearing up above the Baſe of the Veſſel. And the reaſon is, becauſe the ſtrength of the preſſure of water is alwayes <hi>ſecundum altitudinem vel profunditatem,</hi> and not at all <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum latitudinem vel amplitudinem;</hi> and the water in the Veſſel riſing but two inches high, doth not equal the half weight of the Cube or Globe, which requires ſomewhat more than three inches of water to overmatch the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal weight of the Cube of wood, without which, it will not be moved by the preponderation of the water; but the wood will preponderate the energy of that expanded water, or at leaſt be in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> with it, and ſo not moved from the Baſe of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if in the Inſtance laſt given, a Globe of wood of ſix inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſix pounds weight, being but of half the weight of the like Globe of ſix inches diameter of water (weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore 12 pound) be immerſed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49448:107"/>
into a cylindrous Veſſel of water of 7 or 8 inches diameter, and of ſuch a depth as may hold 7 or 8 pound of water, without being forced over by the immiſſion of the wooden Globe into it, and let there be but 7 or 8 pound of water powred into it, and then let the Globe of wood of half the intrinſick weight of the water be put into it; or let the wooden Cube be firſt put in, and then the 7 pound of water; here the water between the Baſe of the wooden Globe and the Baſe of the Veſſel, it may be, will not be an inch deep; but the water in the ſides of the cylindrous Veſſel may riſe four, five, or ſix inches higher. In this Inſtance, this wooden Globe will ſwim, and the reaſon is plain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the water in the Veſſel is not only intrinſecally, but alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally heavier than the Globe of wood, this weighing only 6 pounds, and the water in the Veſſel 7 or 8 pounds; but that over-weight of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alone would not be ſufficient to bear up the Globe of wood, as is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49448:107"/>
in the next precedent Obſervation. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The immediate reaſon thereof is, becauſe the ambient or lateral water between the Globe and the Veſſel, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to above half the diameter of the wooden Globe, and preſſeth <hi>ſecundum altitudinem,</hi> upon the little portion of water next the Baſe of the Veſſel, as a weight of water of near 7 or 8 pound and ſo exceeds the whole weight of the Globe of wood.</p>
               <p>But if by reaſon of the amplitude of the Veſſel, the lateral water encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling the Globe of wood, had riſen but an inch or two above the Baſe of the Globe of wood, that would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver raiſe the Globe of wood from the Baſe of the Veſſel, but there it would ſtand contiguous to the Baſe of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; or if the Globe of wood were put into ſuch a Veſſel of water, it would ſink to the bottom, for it preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the weight of the water in ſuch a poſition; theſe Figures will explain it.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Remark</hi> is ſufficiently anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, where I ſay that heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in bodies, is an intrinſick quality, that it is not mobility at large, but a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or ſpecifick mobility, whereby its Gravitation is naturally determined to be central. That mobility upward in heavy Bodies, is occaſional and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, and not purely natural, as a heavy body.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I do not underſtand what the <hi>Remark</hi> means, when it ſays, that Water hath no tendency to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion downward, but when it is out of its place, what is meant by the place of Water? Is it a place determinate with relation to the poſition of the Vniverſe? If ſo, we find no place in Nature, but the Water will deſcend from it, unleſs it be in the very indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Center, which though it be the termination of its motion, was ſurely never intended for its place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49448:109"/>
never ample or capable to receive it; let the water be in the Ocean, or in the middle Region of the Air, or in the Bowels of the Earth, it will ſtill, as a heavier Body, deſcend, if it be not impeded: Or, is the place of it, that place where any portion of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is placed; ſuppoſe in a Veſſel upon my Table, or upon the top of my Houſe, or on the top of a Steeple; yet there this water will ſtill deſcend if it be not impeded? Or is it, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having gotten into any place in its fluid conſiſtence, it is now become its natural place <hi>per occupationem,</hi> and all other Bodies invading that place, are intruders, and put it out of its place, and ſo give it a <hi>Niſus</hi> downward? But the Water it ſelf, when I remove a Veſſel of it out of the River, into a Boat, or upon the Shore, invades the place that the Air before had, and ſo cannot be the proper place of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole account, the Water unleſs otherwiſe impeded, muſt neceſſarily move downward in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49448:109"/>
all poſitions, though ſometimes it hath an accidental or conſequential motion upwards; and by reaſon of its fluidity, a lateral motion: therefore I confeſs I am to ſeek what is meant, when it is ſaid that the <hi>Niſus</hi> of Water down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is occaſional, and <hi>pro re nata</hi> as well as upward, namely when it is out of its place.</p>

               <p>I Anſwer to the Demand, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Water downward, is natural, being thereunto, as a heavy Body, determined by the Principle thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> intrinſick Gravity, but the other Motions are either from its fluidity, or occaſional.</p>
               <p>Though it be not pertinent to the Debate, yet it is plain that at the ſame time Water may have an occaſional
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49448:110"/>
motion upward or laterally, and yet a natural motion downward. The Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Water weighing 12 pound, will weigh as much when a Tube ſtopped below and immerſed, and then opened below, gives an occaſional motion to part of the Water upward into the Tube. And the ſame is apparent when it drives up a light Rundle of Wood from the Baſe to the <hi>Superficies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſt of the <hi>Remark</hi> is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally levelled againſt Continuity of Water; the contrary whereof is here affirmed to be proved in the former <hi>Remarks.</hi> Indeed I find this often ſaid, but without any proof that I can find. And indeed it requires a very evident proof; for its Continuity is affirmed by all others that I know of, and is evident to ſome.</p>
               <p>Concerning the motion and preſſure of Sand, I have ſaid enough; only where it is ſaid, that an Animal is not damnified under a high heap of Sand, may have ſome ſuch reaſon as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion of Fluids; I freely agree herein; for, as I take it, the Animal
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49448:110"/>
is protected in both by the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm of the incumbent parts, but not by ſuch <hi>Hylarchical Principle</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſuppoſeth.</p>

               <p>THat the natural gravitation down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is not inconſiſtent with an occaſional gravitation lateral; yea, and in ſome caſes vertical, is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by what hath been ſaid upon the laſt <hi>Remark:</hi> And therefore thoſe other actual gravitations are not bare imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but may be as real effects in Nature; as when a Bullet is ſhot out of a Gun in a horizontal Line, at the ſame time there is a <hi>conatus ad motum Horizontalem &amp; Centralem</hi> (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Bullet could never ſink from a ſtraight Line) the former is <hi>conatus ad motum violentum,</hi> and the latter <hi>ad motum naturalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to the diſtinction that I make between the fluid Water in the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49448:111"/>
and the Bucket, containing an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Cylinder, conſtituted both of the Bucket and Water in it, and that the latter hath one ſimple motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as a heavy Body, or as a Keg of Ice; but the fluid water in the Bucket, had as a fluid Body, thoſe various motions, which in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I aſſign unto it. I muſt confeſs, when I wrote it, I thought, and ſtill think it ſo plain, and intelligible, and evident, that I wonder it ſhould not be underſtood, or ſhould be thought a repugnancy in Nature.</p>
               <p>The Water in the Bucket is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly a fluid Body, and hath its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular motion downward; which is ſimply natural to it as a heavy Body, and its lateral motion belonging to it, as a fluid Body; by which it would drive out the ſides of the Bucket, near the top, eſpecially, were it not well fenced; and though by the ſtrong gards of the Bucket, it be kept in, that it cannot effect what it endeavours; yet it hath ſtill its <hi>conatus ad motum lateralem;</hi> but that <hi>conatus</hi> is ſtill kept
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49448:111"/>
in by the ſtrong ſides and bottom of the Bucket.</p>
               <p>But the Bucket of Water is now one entire aggregate Body conſiſting of Wood formed into a Cylindraceous form, and Water contained within it, and ſo preſſeth ſimply centrally, as if the Water were congealed into Ice; or as if Water and Earth were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together into one ſolid Maſs, in which Inſtances the Bucket of Water preſſeth not as a fluid Body of Water, but as a common ſolid aggregate Body.</p>
               <p>And now if you ask, But why doth not the Bucket of Water preſs laterally as well as the Water in the Bucket? The Anſwer offers it ſelf, even before the Queſtion asked; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſides of the Bucket are ſolid, and not fluid, and can no more preſs laterally upon the circumjacent Air, than if they were empty of Water; the Water within the Bucket preſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the interior ſides and cavity of the Bucket, but is reſtrained from preſſing farther by the contignation of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49448:112"/>
Bucket, but the convexity of the ſides of the Bucket do not, cannot preſs upon the ambient Air; and ſo the whole weight is diſcharged from it in a central direction, as in truth it doth alwayes in a ſolid Body.</p>
               <p>And the conſequence that would be drawn from hence, that then Water congealed ſhould be heavier than the ſame Water ſolute, is the vaineſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference imaginable; for the Water as one common Body, had the ſame, and poſſibly a little more weight before its congealing, than after; and though its congealing hinder the various moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it as a fluid Body, it doth not encreaſe nor conſiderably impair its weight upon the Scale as a heavy Body.</p>
               <p>Methinks the Reaſoning of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker</hi> in this Caſe, is juſt as if a ſhip were ſayling from North to South, a man ſhould ſay it were unconcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a Paſſenger ſhould walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Deck from South to North; for then he ſhould be moved with two contrary motions, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49448:112"/>
terminations at the ſame time, and yet is apparently true, that at the ſame time he is moved ad <hi>motum Navis,</hi> from North to South, and <hi>ad motum proprium,</hi> from South to North: ſo the ſame Veſſel of water, as it is one entire heavy bulk, hath ſimply its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral termination; yet the ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded fluid parts in their fluid conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, have and may have various ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as well lateral or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as perpendicular or central.</p>
               <p>But to put a period to this Debate, when I ſpeak of the various motions of fluids as fluids, I ſpeak of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the parts of that common bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is fluid, and thoſe are hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal, <hi>per declive,</hi> lateral and central. But when I ſpeak of its motion as one common body, then it is true the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is central, which is its motion of natural gravitation upon the Scale; and therefore 12 pound of water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to the Veſſel wherein it is, will weigh ſtill 12 pound upon the Scale, and yet its parts have thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral motions before deſcribed, which
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49448:113"/>
abate not the weight of the whole Maſs, but correct the particular preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of it, and the ſeveral parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of while <hi>in fluore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by way of illuſtration of what I ſay, take theſe few Inſtances; a Barrel of new Wine or Beer, ſuppoſe it weigh 100 pound, after a little time, it will gain a motion of fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; which by reaſon it proceeds from heat, is principally upward, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Superficies,</hi> yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this motion, the Barrel of Beer or Wine, will as a heavy body, weigh as much as before the excitation of tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And the ſame I ſay of Water; though there be particular motions of its parts, as a fluid body, and thoſe correct and refract one another; yet the motion of the entire <hi>Moles Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> as conſtituting one entire body, retains its entire weight upon the Scale, <hi>viz.</hi> 12 pound, and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any repugnancy to, or diminution of the Laws of Nature, in relation to the deſcent of heavy bodies to the Center.</p>

Scale with 3 pound weight, the other with 2 pound weight, the preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Scale with 3 pound weight, will raiſe up the Scale with 2 pound weight, ſo that in a relative conſideration between the weights, the latter hath no ſenſible gravitation, and yet the hand that holds the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, will ſuſtain and feel in both Scales together the weight of 5 pound; and it were an unreaſonable way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation to urge, that becauſe the lighter weight hath loſt its actual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation in relation to the heavier weight, therefore the weight of both ſhould be but 3 pound, which is the preponderating weight of the heavier Scale.</p>
               <p>If there be a triangular body made of Boards, Latin, or any other like Matter, whoſe Baſis A B, is parallel to the Horizon, and the Cathet B C, perpendicular to it, and 3 foot high, the ſubtenſe C A, 6 foot long, as in the Figure following, which is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the length of the perpendicular, it is demonſtrable that a weight E,

                  <figure/>
of 2 pound weight, will counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the weight D, of 4 pound weight, and that as the diſtance C A, is to the diſtance C B, ſo the <hi>momentum</hi> of the weight E, is to the <hi>momentum</hi> of the weight D. The moment of the weight therefore in the perpendicular deſcent C B, will be double to the moment of the ſame weight upon the declive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Line A C. That which I would obſerve in this Inſtance, is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That notwithſtanding this <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondium</hi> in this Inſtance between the 2 pound and 4 pound, whereby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative weight of each is abated, yet the entire Engin with its weights, will weigh 6 pound beſides the weight of the Engin.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:49448:115"/>2. That by the declivity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of D, it loſeth half of that weight that it would have in a direct deſcent from C to B; and ſo this accidental interpoſition of a motion <hi>per declive,</hi> corrects that natural gravitation that is truly central and perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet it doth not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or take it away, only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clive termination or direction takes off one half of the actual perpendicular or central gravitation. And this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance explicates, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure proves what I have ſaid, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth that theſe 29, 30 <hi>Remarks</hi> are not of that moment as the <hi>Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> takes them to be.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole Matter, though a Tun of Water in a Veſſel, weigh 2000 pound weight, and that a man being laid upon his back in the bottom of that Veſſel, be ſubjected to a Pile or Column of Water, equal in Baſe to the half of that Tun of Water, yet the man ſhall not be preſſed with 1000 pound weight of Water, nor the

               </p>
               <p>I have more largely given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my thoughts touching it, in the beginning of this Book; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will appear whether the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I take up, are unproved; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they or the <hi>Remarkers</hi> Principles be, or can be proved by any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>THe Learned <hi>Remarker</hi> miſtakes the Scope of the Aſſertion; it is true that the conjunction of ſolid heavy bodies contribute to their weight, and conſequently to the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole ſolid body downward.

               <p>IN the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, <hi>pag.</hi> 64. of the <hi>Nugae,</hi> I have given an account touching the various preſſure of ſolute and included water; namely, that in a <hi>Siphon</hi> there deſcribed, the Water in the open Air poured into the longer Leg, being 24 inches, depreſſed the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49448:121"/>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> 2 inches and ¼, and drove it out of the ſhort Leg; but the ſolute water in an open Tube incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhorter Leg, drove back only one inch, the longer Leg being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty: Now if the impelling down of 2 inches and ¼ of <hi>Mercury</hi> by the 24 inches of Water in the longer Leg, be no more than the preſſing down of one inch of <hi>Mercury,</hi> by the ſolute Water of 24 inches deep in the ſhorter Leg, the <hi>Remarker</hi> is in the right, and I was in the wrong; but if theſe be differing preſſures, and the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing down of one inch of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> by the ſolute Water leaning upon the ſhort Leg, be leſs than the preſſing of two inches and ¼ by the 24 inches of Water included in the longer Leg, then I was not miſtaken; and a little Arithmetick will ſerve to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Remark</hi> gives this Anſwer to this part of the Experiment, That more was impelled up by the ſolute Water, becauſe the ſhorter Leg was wider, and ſo required more <hi>Mercury</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:49448:121"/>
in the other Leg to counterpoiſe it.</p>
               <p>But to give the <hi>Remark</hi> ſatisfaction herein, I have made a moſt exact ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into this part of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; and to the Objection I give theſe Anſwers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Cavity of the <hi>Siphon</hi> in the ſhorter Leg was ⅛ parts of an inch, or ¼ of half an inch, the breadth of the Cavity of the longer Leg was not the 40<hi>th</hi> part of an inch leſs than the ſhorter, which is ſo ſmall a diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that it could ſcarce be ſenſible, and this upon an exact admeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And again, when the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the ſhorter tube was depreſſed an inch by the ſolute Water incumbent upon it, there was not any viſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the extent of the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> driven up in the longer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſhorter Leg, both being indiſtinguiſhably the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> an inch ſubſiding in the ſhorter, and an inch only riſing in the longer Leg, which evidenceth the imperceptibleneſs of the difference.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:49448:122"/>2. If it gave an advantage of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> it muſt be to the ſhorter Leg, becauſe it had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moles</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> in it, and of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the truth is, the preſſure of Water or <hi>Mercury</hi> in an inverted <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> is equal, though the amplitude of the Legs differ; for Fluids in that Inſtance, preſs <hi>ſecundum altitudinem</hi> or <hi>longitudinem,</hi> not <hi>ſecundum amplitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> A <hi>Siphon</hi> inverted, having one Leg of 6 inches diameter, and the other but of an inch diameter, filled with Water or <hi>Mercury,</hi> will have their <hi>Superficies</hi> of equal heights, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſproportion of their amplitude.</p>
               <p>This part of the Experiment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtands unſhaken by the <hi>Remark,</hi> and therefore ſurely the Experiment it ſelf, nor the Collection thereupon made by the <hi>Remark,</hi> gives little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the magnified demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentioned in the <hi>Remark,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes effectually againſt it.</p>
               <p>Indeed as to the ſecond Inſtance or
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49448:122"/>
Trial, which I call the double Trial, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. it hath reaſonably given a juſt cauſe of exception, yet not without ſome Miſtake in the <hi>Remark,</hi> becauſe it was tried when two inches and more of the <hi>Mercury</hi> was firſt driven out of the <hi>Siphon,</hi> by the Water poured into the longer Leg, and therefore I lay no weight upon it; yet even there, there is a diſparity in the preſſure of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and encloſed water, there being a greater height of water preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the ſhorter Leg than in the longer: But becauſe this ſecond trial is leſs evident, I lay it aſide; yet howſoever this doth not impeach the former trial, nor the Concluſion which I lay upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the force of the ſame Column of water contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the longer Leg of the <hi>Siphon,</hi> and having no other Baſe but the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> it ſelf, is of greater force than the like Column of ſolute Water in the open Veſſel impending upon the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Leg, eſpecially ſince in the one caſe and the other, the open Air gives the moſt fair trial to the energy of both:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49448:123"/>
and therefore the diſparity of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of encloſed and ſolute water, which the <hi>Remarker</hi> is pleaſantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed to call the Maſonry of the water, is not hereby impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor the notable demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Enchiridion Metaphyſicum,</hi> by the Rundle of wood any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p>And for evidence of the truth of the preſſure of water <hi>ſecundum altitudinem,</hi> and not <hi>ſecundum amplitudinem,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the diſparity of preſſure of ſolute water, and water under a conſtriction to a narrow Baſis, I have obſerved that if a Tube of half an inch diameter, and 4 foot high, with a <hi>Lumen</hi> of a quarter of an inch diameter in the ſide near the Baſe, be filled with water, the parabolical Line that the water will make out of that Veſſel in its firſt exſilition, will be as long, yea, and ſomewhat longer than the like parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Line made in the firſt exſilition, by the like <hi>Lumen</hi> out of a Veſſel of ſix inches diameter, and the ſame height, which muſt needs proceed from the

               <p>THe true reaſon of the riſing of the Rundle of wood is neither from the Spirit of Nature, nor from an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchical Principle,</hi> but from the plain common known Rules of <hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> whereby neceſſarily a fluid Body drives up a ſolid Body lighter than it ſelf, to the <hi>Superficies,</hi> if it can by any means in the leaſt proportion, inſinuate it ſelf between the Rundle and the Baſe of the Veſſel, and this is done by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumpulſion.</p>
               <p>But as touching <hi>Stevinus</hi> his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the Rundle covering a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe or hole in the Baſis of the Veſſel, I muſt needs ſay, <hi>Stevinus</hi> delivers it in his Obſervations upon the 10<hi>th. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> of his <hi>Hydroſtatiques,</hi> from whence I tranſcribe it, <hi>pag.</hi> 94. of the <hi>Nugae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough touching this Buſineſs before upon <hi>Remark</hi> 19, 20.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49448:124"/>
upon the <hi>Eſſay;</hi> I ſhall therefore ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collect ſomewhat of what is there more fully delivered.</p>
               <p>If the Rundle of Wood be ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally lighter than a portion of water equal to its <hi>Moles,</hi> and the Rundle be preſſed down as contiguous as may be to the plain Baſis of the Veſſel, yet it will riſe; for by reaſon of the poroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and chamfers of the wood, all the induſtry imaginable will not preſs it ſo cloſe, but there will be ſome <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia</hi> between the Rundle and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or bottom of the Veſſel into which the Water will creep, and ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and drive up the Rundle to the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water, by an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding preſſure of the Water, which aſcending preſſure is nevertheleſs wrought and effected firſt by a deſcent of the water round the ſides of the Rundle, and ſo by a kind of Ballance, overweighing the Rundle of wood, and thereupon neceſſarily weighing it up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Rundle be cloſely fixed to the bottom by a viſcous, or gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49448:125"/>
or thick Oylie matter, that the water cannot get under it, the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle will not riſe, upon this double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that adhering Oyl by the mutual adheſion to the Rundle and Baſe, renders the Rundle conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and effectively, and extrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heavier by its adheſion, than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of Water, whereby the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot raiſe it.</p>
               <p>But, 2. and principally, Becauſe the interpoſed viſcous Oyl doth obſtruct the migration or inſinuation of the Water between the Rundle and Baſis or bottom of the Veſſel, and ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get under it to drive it up; but ſtands now as one common fixed Baſe of the Veſſel united to the true Baſe thereof,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be a hole in the bottom of the Veſſel, ſuppoſe of two inches diameter, and the Rundle of light wood be 4 inches diameter, and ſo overlap the Orifice, the Rundle will not riſe, becauſe the Water, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the care imaginable, will
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49448:125"/>
creep under the ſides of the Rundle, and diſcharge it ſelf gradually through the hole; for the water having never ſo little paſſage through the pertuſe or hole, though not commenſurate to the 40th. part of its amplitude, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and preſs that way, and ſo gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the Rundle that lies in its way, by its <hi>Conatus ad motum</hi> to that Orifice, where it finds never ſo little vent that it may diſcharge it ſelf; for the water preſſing upon and through the Orifice, doth neceſſarily preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the interpoſed Rundle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And if the Rundle of wood could be kept ſo cloſe to the bottom, either by its own exquiſite ſmoothneſs (which is hardly poſſible) or by any viſcous Oyl, or by any fixation to the bottom or Baſe of the Veſſel, now it ſtands as one common Baſe to the water, as the reſt of the bottom of the Veſſel doth, and is of no uſe to explicate the <hi>Phaenomenon;</hi> for it is all one as if it were one continued ſolid Baſe to the Veſſel, unmoved and unmoveable by the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:49448:126"/>And this upon more than one trial, I find true; and when duly weighed, it makes nothing in favour of the <hi>Remarkers Hypotheſis,</hi> or to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my Suppoſition in the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> though I confeſs it doth more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and clearly explicate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I have given my reaſon of that <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> why the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> will not ſubſide in ſuch an immerſion into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this is the Subject of <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garum, pag.</hi> 102, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation upon the <hi>Remark;</hi> which is this in effect.</p>
               <p>When the whole Tube with its <hi>Valve</hi> cloſed, is counterpoiſed with a portion of water of greater, or at leaſt, equal weight to the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and of equal Bulk to ſo much thereof as is immerſed in the water, the whole Engin muſt neceſſarily ſwim; for it is in <hi>aequilibrio</hi> with, or preponderated by ſo much water, which it diſplaceth by its immerſion. And it is in effect no other, than if a Cylindrical Body, ſuppoſe a Cane,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49448:128"/>
were of two inches diameter, and of two foot long, the bottom filled about an inch with Lead, and then 11 inches with Water, and the reſt with Air, and ſuppoſe the whole Cane were lighter than the like Bulk of Water, ſo that a <hi>Moles</hi> of water countervail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 12 inches of this Cylinder, would counterpoiſe it, it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that this Cylinder muſt ſwim perpendiculary and erect in the water at an immerſion of twelve inches; for the water bearing againſt its Baſis, muſt neceſſarily ſuſtain it at that height.</p>
               <p>And perfectly the ſame reaſon is that which keeps up the <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> by preſſing againſt it at the bottom; which now is as it were one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon piece of the whole Latin Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder or Valve; And this <hi>aequilibrium</hi> is the true Cauſe of its ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Remarker</hi> hath given us another kind of Solution; which if I underſtand aright, is to this purpoſe, that in this Inſtance the Air is out of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49448:128"/>
its place being in the Latin Cube be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water, and that the Spirit of Nature, or the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium Hylarchicum,</hi> to reſcue it from this inconvenience, draws up the Air, and drives down the contiguous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therewith draws and drives up the <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> which by the Abituriency (as it is called) of the Air, is ſuſtained: And as a ſtrong proof hereof, it is ſaid both in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and in the <hi>Enchiridion Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicum,</hi> that if the Tube be ſtopped near the Sucker or <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> it will by no means be ſuſtained; becauſe now the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> is not concerned in the abiturience of the Air thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it by the interpoſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>This I call an obſcure Solution; and had I then ſearched into it, as I have done ſince, I ſhould have ſtiled it a miſtaken Solution; for ſo it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I do not underſtand how the Air is out of its place, when it fills the Tube below the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, any more than if the Veſſel were
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49448:129"/>
placed upon a Steeple, the Air on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide reaching below the fund of the Veſſel, it may be 40 yards, were out of his place, becauſe the Bucket of Water ſtands above it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither do I underſtand how the Spirit of Nature is concerned to fetch up the Air out of the Tube, or to bring the water into the Tube; but it is performed by a plain ſtatical ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and the relative preſſure of the Water upon the Baſis of the Tube, being lighter than the like <hi>Moles</hi> of Water.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be it in his place, or out of his place; if the inſtance given by the <hi>Remarker</hi> of the falling off of the Valve or <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> when another <hi>Obtura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> is interpoſed, were as true as it is confidently affirmed, there might have ſome relief thereby been given to the Solution, which I called ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure: But moſt plainly it is not true; and by frequent trials I have found that notwithſtanding that interpoſed ſtopping a little above the Sucker, or <hi>Obturaculum,</hi> the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49448:129"/>
ſuſpended as well as if there were no ſuch interpoſed ſtoppage. I took a Latin Tube of two foot five inches long, and one inch and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diameter, with its <hi>Valve</hi> and <hi>Obtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum</hi> cloſely fitted each to other, but ſo as with its own weight the <hi>Obtura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> would ſubſide in the open Air, the weight of the whole Engin weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 12 ounces and a half and 9<hi rend="sup">d</hi> weight.</p>
               <p>I ſtopped the Tube within leſs than ah inch above the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> with Cork, ſo every way encompaſſed with a ſtrong Cement, that all poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between the ſuperior Air and the lower brazen <hi>Obturaculum</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſtopped.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Valve</hi> or <hi>Obturaculum</hi> being put up, and the Tube immerſed into a full Veſſel of Water, ſubſided to 18 inches depth, and thereby drave over a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water equal in weight to the weight of the Engin, and equal in Bulk or <hi>Moles</hi> to the 18 inches of the Engin immerſed in the Water; and all this while the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> ſtuck faſt; I therefore gently raiſed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49448:130"/>
till it came within 5 or 6 inches of the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water, and yet it continued ſuſtained till it was raiſed to ſuch a height as the weight of the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> counterpoiſed a Column of Water commenſurate in weight unto it, and ſo long the <hi>Obtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculum</hi> continued ſuſpended; but when the Tube was lifted higher, ſo that the <hi>aequipondium</hi> between the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaculum</hi> and the like <hi>Moles</hi> of Water was loſt, then the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> fell down, as in the inſtance of the <hi>Valve,</hi> that had no ſuch interpoſed obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>This was the event of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often made, and will doubtleſs fall out upon any other mans Trial, if it be carefully and ſoberly put in ure.</p>
               <p>Only this muſt be remembred, if the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> be not very true and exact, but that the water comes in conſiderably between the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> and the <hi>Valve,</hi> the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> will fall off after a little while at leaſt, as well in this, as in the unſtopped Tube
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49448:130"/>
deſcribed in the Fifth Chapter of the <hi>Nugae,</hi> partly by reaſon of the laxneſs of its adheſion, and partly by reaſon of the additional weight of water get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in above the lower <hi>Obturacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet it muſt be remembred alſo, that though there be the greateſt care imaginable uſed, if the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> be ſo lax as to fall from the <hi>Valve</hi> in the open Air, though it be ſo cloſe as to ſtick together in the Water, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will creep between the Fiſſures of the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> and the <hi>Valve,</hi> with a force, if it have any room to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And whether even that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſſure of the water upwards through that Fiſſure, may for a while contribute to the bearing up of the <hi>Valve</hi> (as in the inſtance of the Rundles of Wood covering the Orifice in the Baſe, it contributes to the keeping down of the Rundle) may be conſiderable. But howſoever, if it receive too much water, it preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the <hi>Obturaculum</hi> the more down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49448:131"/>
and thereby in time weakens the adheſion thereof.</p>
               <p>And now what part hath this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Naturae</hi> to act in this caſe?</p>

               <p>Only where the <hi>Remarker</hi> ſubjoynes that upon the gentle gradual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Tube of <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet when it comes to an erect poſture the <hi>Mercury</hi> ſubſides to 29 inches, is an

Argument that there are no ſuch <hi>efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> from the <hi>Mercury,</hi> to ſupply the derelicted ſpace in the top of the Tube. This, though often repeated by him in the ſubſequent <hi>Remarks,</hi> ſeems to be no Objection; for whether the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding be more gradual, or more ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the compreſſion of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> parts, and traction upon them, are equal when it attains its perpendicular preſſure; as to uſe my old compariſon, if a man ſtrain a Lute-ſtring from a lower to a higher Note, ſuppoſe from an <hi>Eighth</hi> to a <hi>Third,</hi> if he do it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly, he ſhall indeed endanger the Lute-ſtring; but whether it be wound up ſwifter or ſlower, the tenſion of the Lute-ſtring is the ſame at an equal height, in both motions of the Pin: Indeed while the inclination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, the preſſure and gravitation of the <hi>Mercury</hi> upon it ſelf, is leſs, and conſequently the tenſion weaker; and therefore the portions of <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſent or drawn out in that poſture, are leſs; but when it comes to an erect perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular poſture, the preſſure and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,

               <p>TOuching the various poſition of the <hi>Mercury</hi> upon the top and bottom of a Hill, I need not ſay more than what is ſaid in my 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Nugae,</hi> and therefore I ſpare repetition.

               <p>IN theſe two <hi>Remarks</hi> the <hi>Remarker</hi> endeavours to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Groundleſsneſs of the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered by me to the <hi>Torricellian Phaenomena.</hi> And, 2. Its Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
               <p>The former he ſaith he hath ſhewn in <hi>Remark</hi> 32. But all that is done to ſhew it, is to ſubſtitute certain inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and I think, miſtaken Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The perviouſneſs of Glaſs to the ſubtiler aerial particles; this indeed he hath often ſaid, but no where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and if it were admitted, would not only perfectly deſtroy the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in that Inſtrument, but would utterly confound his Anſwer to the reſiliency of the <hi>Mercury</hi> upon a ſudden lifting up and ſeparation of the Tube from the reſtagnant <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> For what need ſuch a violent
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49448:136"/>
reſilition where the top of the Tube admits the ſubtiler aerial particles to pervade the Glaſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The gentle inclining of the Tube to prevent the tumultuary agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Mercury.</hi> But what I have ſhewn in my Obſervation upon <hi>Remark</hi> 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think ſufficiently diſcovers the impotence of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The gravitation upward by a Circle of motion, is utterly unapt to ſalve the reſilition; for that circulation can be but a ſlow, gentle motion, and cannot poſſibly have ſo rapid a motion by the imaginary ſtraightneſs of the Channel; as we may ſuppoſe in the Streights in the Sea; upon which the Ocean preſſeth; but this neither can nor need receive a greater portion of ſubtil Air to relieve it than poſſibly 2 inches in height, and the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of an inch in Diameter, where the amplitude of the Tube is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, namely, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy which is aſſigned.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:49448:136"/>1. In that I deny a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which he ſaith cannot be by another way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but by the tranſition of the ſubtil particles of Air through the Glaſs; but ſuch a courſe of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſeems to be of kin to that which is called <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> he knows I aſſign another cauſe, though he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the truth of it. Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the leiſurely inclining of the Tube; which I confeſs is often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I think need not be more than once anſwered, which I think is done in my Obſervations upon <hi>Remark</hi> 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to the Argument touching <hi>Rarefaction,</hi> and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the penetration of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſo endeavours to prove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancies in what is ſaid by a <hi>Problem</hi> that deſerves more diſcuſſion than the Argument in hand, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beginning of this Book, wherein I have nevertheleſs expreſſed my thoughts touching it.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell what the <hi>Remarker</hi> imagines or conceives againſt the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49448:137"/>
of groſſer Bodies by the tenſion of lighter bodies, but I can tell what is evident to my ſenſe, and ſo may any that will give his Senſes leave freely to determin, without ſtifling them by Notions, namely, that there is as plain a coheſion in the <hi>Magdeburgh Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheres;</hi> yea, and in the <hi>Torricellian Engin,</hi> as there is between things faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned each to other by a ſtring: And therefore I cannot ſo over-readily change the conviction of my Senſes, for a Notion or Conception aſſerted and magnified, but not proved.</p>
               <p>But to infer that becauſe Water, which is above 900 times craſſer than Air, is not compreſſible to a ſenſible ſmaller room by a great weight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a portion of ſubtil Matter cannot be extracted out of it or <hi>Mercury,</hi> with ſo ſmall a weight as the Mercurial Cylinder, or that the <hi>effluvia</hi> of Water or <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are as ſubtil as Air, cannot be expanded by a leſs weight than Water compreſſed into a ſenſible narrower room, ſeem hard il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and very inconſequential; for

               <p n="6">6. And as the <hi>Remarker</hi> confeſſeth, and the moſt clear evidence of Senſe evinceth, thoſe <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49448:140"/>
wrought, nor indeed poſſible to be wrought, either by the weight, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or elaſticity of the external Air, as the <hi>Elateriſts</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence of all which is, that certainly as far as Senſe can lead us, the Air is rarefied by the Heat; and as the Heat decayes, the Air endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours its own contraction, and there neceſſarily follows, even to our Senſe, an attraction upon the ſides of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres,</hi> whereby they cohere; and that coheſion will continue till relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another acceſſion of Heat, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of more Air.</p>
               <p>But now what doth the <hi>Remark</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in this Inſtance? Marry, an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſtatical</hi> Spirit, which, <hi>pro re nata,</hi> works theſe various <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which is only a conjecture, and hath no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to prove it beſides Notion or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination; but the method of the effecting it by this <hi>Hyloſtatical</hi> Spirit, is more admirable, though it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly offered, that thereby all goes off glibly. And it is to this effect, as I take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:49448:141"/>
                  <hi>The Hyloſtatical Spirit finding the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Matter impriſoned in an undue place between the Hemiſpheres, preſently makes up an occaſional Gravitation or Elaſticity in the ambient Air to ſqueeze out the included ſubtil Matter, and give it liberty, and thereby preſſeth the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheres together.</hi> And ſo in this glib <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the <hi>Remark</hi> doth two things. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It creates a weight or elaſticity in the ambient Air <hi>pro re nata,</hi> which as it is in effect contrary to all that he hath before delivered againſt the weight or elaſticity of the Air, ſo it hath this diſadvantage, as is propoſed by the <hi>Remark,</hi> that it is infinitely more incredible than the common Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Elateriſts,</hi> and indeed little leſs than miraculous.</p>
               <p>And 2. It is a <hi>Conatus</hi> of this <hi>Hylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical</hi> Spirit to no purpoſe at all, and meerly fruſtraneous, unleſs by ſuch an admirable condenſation of the ambient Air it could break the brazen Ribs; whereas indeed it makes the Priſon the ſtronger. I muſt confeſs, this Fetch
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49448:141"/>
goes not down ſo eaſily with me, nor I believe with many more.</p>

               <p>I Come to the <hi>Remarks</hi> upon the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of the Glaſs-Pump, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I attribute the raiſing of the Water in the Glaſs to the traction made by the tenſed Air in the Shank of the Pump, and the dilatation of the Air in the top of the Glaſs, by the extraction of the Water. And the reaſon why after ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated evacuations of the Water by that ſuction or traction, no more will riſe, to be, becauſe the Air in the Bottle hath undergone as great a tenſion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation as a Pump of that length can give it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I muſt obſerve touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Pump.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The length of the Shank or Pump if ſelf above the Glaſs, was not much above fourteen inches, and the <hi>Embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> proportionable thereunto, if it had
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49448:142"/>
been longer, the attractive force muſt have been greater, and would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have given a ſtronger traction, and conſequently a greater expanſion, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or rarefaction to the Air in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Glaſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in this Inſtance here is no miſplacing of the Air or Water; upon which the Author builds much of the activity of his <hi>Hylarchical Principle</hi> in divers of his <hi>Remarks;</hi> for the Air in the Bottle, and in the Shank of the Pump, are both above the ſcituation of the Water in the Bottle. And here the Author, after ſome recourſe to the impoſſibility of penetration of dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ſo often inculcates, gives us his Solution, returns to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Hyloſtatical Principle,</hi> which becauſe the ſubtil Matter miſplaced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorates the external Air to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this buſineſs, but tells us not expreſly what, or how, in this place: We ſhall hereafter, it may be, find what is meant.</p>
               <p>Only he tells us two things. 1. That it is impoſsible ſo heavy a Body as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49448:142"/>
ſhould riſe ſo high into ſo extream a thin Body in the Glaſs, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out freſh Air ſucceeding. 2. That the <hi>Embolus</hi> that at the firſt pumping, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the conſiſtence of the Air ſhould as reaſonably overcome it ſtill.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, It ſeems he is now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to admit an intrinſick Gravity in the Water, which renders it unwilling to aſcend; but beſides, according to the Authors Aſſertion in his <hi>Remarks,</hi> the more ſubtil parts of the Air will pervade the Glaſs, if that were true, there would be ſupplemental ſubtil Air at leaſt, to ſupply the evacuation of the Water to the laſt drop.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, There is nothing more plain to our very Senſe, than that any extendible or tenſible Body till it be broken, doth more eaſily yield to the firſt attempts of its extenſion, which yet with more difficulty, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds afterward as is evident in the Air-Pump and a Lute-ſtring, which is an Inſtance I frequently uſe, I confeſs; but it explains my meaning; ſo that this <hi>Remark</hi> concludes nothing againſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49448:143"/>
what I have delivered in relation to my Glaſs-Pump, nor to evidence the interpoſition therein of the ſuppoſed <hi>Hylarchical Principle.</hi>

               <p>BEfore I come to my Obſervations upon theſe <hi>Remarks,</hi> it may be convenient to give an explication of the dimenſions of the Glaſs-Pump that I made uſe of; referring my ſelf to the Figure thereof, deſcribed in the <hi>Nugae, Fig.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>The whole length from the upper end of the <hi>Embolus</hi> to the bottom of the Glaſs-Globe, was near 21 Inches; whereof the <hi>Embolus</hi> reaching to D, near as low as H, where the Water was to be pumped out, was about 8 inches from H, to the upper Surface of the Glaſs, near 4 inches; from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Surface of the Glaſs to the bottom of it, about 9 inches, which was the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49448:143"/>
diameter of the globular Glaſs; the continued Pipe of the Pump being leſs, running into the Glaſs about 7 inches, and ſo at E, opening and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 2 inches from the bottom of the globular Glaſs; conſequently from the lower end of the Sucker at D, to the middle of the globular Glaſs about 8 inches and a half or 9 inches; the cavity of the Pump it ſelf near two inches diameter or thereabouts; ſo that the Air between the bottom of the <hi>Embolus</hi> and the top of the Glaſs, might be a Cylinder of near 2 inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and about 4 inches long; by the tenſion whereof, the Water in half the Glaſs is by me ſuppoſed to be attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and raiſed. The other and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per half of the Glaſs contains the other half of the Globe, and is filled with Air, which contained about 5 pints; which was more than twenty times the quantity of Air contained in the Pump, between the lower end of the <hi>Embolus</hi> and the top of the Water. I ſay, by iterated pumpings I drew out a quart of Water, which made the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49448:144"/>
ſubſide in the lower half of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above an inch and an half; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Air in the upper half of the Bottle expanded ſo, that now it contained about 7 pints of Air; after which, it was not capable of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expanſion by my ſmall Pump: The Engin it ſelf is more punctually deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Nugae;</hi> but the dimenſions not ſo fully mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there as here.</p>
               <p>This Inſtance I uſe as an evidence to prove the attraction of the Water by the tenſion of that little portion of Air in the cavity of the Pump and the ſequaciouſneſs of the Water to relieve that tenſion, and to preſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity of the <hi>Mundana Materia</hi> which in theſe <hi>Remarks</hi> is oppoſed by my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Antagoniſt.</p>
               <p>And the Inſtance is oppoſed upon this account, that the Air in the Glaſs is tended from 7 to 5; whereas the Air in the Pump is tended from 1 to 5 ſpaces at leaſt, which is ſaid, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that there is no ſuch tenſion; for if there were, the Air in the Glaſs
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49448:144"/>
would receive a greater tenſion than from 5 to 7, when the Air in the Pump is ſuppoſed to be tended from 1 to 5, which is ever proportionate to the tenſion of the Air in the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>But ſurely this is an Objection of no force, for apparent Reaſons: Though the expanſion of 5 to 7, is not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the ſame with the expanſion from 1 to 5, yet ſuch a proportion need not, nor indeed is poſſible in this caſe; for as the Body of the Air in the Glaſs, is above 20 times the quantity of the Body of the Air in the Pump, ſo ſuch an expanſion ſerves its turn, as may make good the ſpace that is left by the evacuated water, which being no more but one quart, the Air in the Glaſs can receive no greater ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of expanſion than one quart of ſpace more than it had before. The meaſure of the extenſion of the Air not being governed by the bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion which happens in another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct portion of Air, and that of a leſs dimenſion: But by the room or ſpace that is left by its next contiguous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49448:145"/>
that muſt be ſupplied by its expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>In the 45th <hi>Remark,</hi> that which was before wanting, ſeems now to be ſupplied, <hi>viz.</hi> The method which the <hi>Hyloſtatical Spirit</hi> uſeth in raiſing the Water in this and in other Pumps, <hi>viz.</hi> by a circular preſſure and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Air and Water incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the bottom of the Pump is on, which jointly gravitates upwards, in regard of that ſubtil Element in the top of the Tube, that there may be no bare ſubtil Matter in the Pump; which gravitation and circulation is carried on by the <hi>Hyloſtatical Principle,</hi> that there may be no miſplacing of the Elements of the Univerſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> is one. This is the Solution in ſubſtance, and very near the words of the Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>This Solution, in my underſtanding, is not only wonderful inevident, but alſo very improper.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is granted an occaſional E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticity
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49448:145"/>
of the Air and of the Water alſo, though ſuppoſed to be effected by the Spirit of Nature or <hi>Principium Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchicum;</hi> which Elaſticity I had thought the Author would not have granted to Air, much leſs to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the Suppoſition of this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation encounters it ſelf: For either the <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> (which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſubtil enough to pervade the Glaſs, though the craſſer parts of the Air cannot) is either a diſtinct Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ſelf, not incorporated with the Air, but of a diſtinct conſiſtence; or elſe is part of the aery concretion of the Air, the ſubtil part thereof, and mingled with the Air as one conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent part thereof, though in ſome caſes ſeverable from it; which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we take it, the difficulties of the Authors Suppoſition are unanſwerable. It is plain, the Air in the upper part of the Glaſs, upon the exſuction of a quart of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, takes up a quart more of room or ſpace than it had before: If this be
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49448:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſed by the perforation of the Glaſs by the <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> as a diſtinct Element, and ſo uniting it ſelf to the Air in the Glaſs, then this <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> (which in reſpect of its purity, muſt needs have its proper place ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above the place of the Air, by the Laws of Nature, and not below it) is called down by the Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from its proper poſition into the cavity of the Glaſs, and ſo the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order, Poſition and <hi>Taxis</hi> of the parts of the Univerſe diſordered and diſcompoſed.</p>
               <p>Again, if the <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> be but a conſtituent part of the Air, then is the fas;ter external Air robbed of part of its conſtitution, and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed of what naturally belongs to it, to ſupply the ſpace in the Glaſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relicted by the exhauſted Water, and that portion of Air in the Glaſs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a greater portion of the <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> then belongs to it; and all this done by the Spirit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is ſuppoſed to be an active plaſtick principle to conſerve the order
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49448:146"/>
of the Univerſe, and not to diſorder it; which according to the Learned Authors ſuppoſition, muſt yet be the neceſſary conſequence of this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tranſpoſition of the <hi>Materia Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> in this Circulation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, in this Circulation and circular preſſure, we ſhall find the Chain broken, and the Circulation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, or a worſe inconvenience; the Air in the Glaſs moves upon the Water, and that again preſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and moves upon the ſubtilized Air in the Pump, and then it is thrown out in the open external Air, and ſo moves upon that: It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the compleating of the Circle, that now at laſt by ther interpoſition of the <hi>Hyloſtatical Principle,</hi> the external Air muſt circulate by a preſſure upon the Air in the upper part of the Glaſs, and ſo the Dance is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>But 1. We muſt note that even the Author himſelf agrees that the groſſer parts of the Air cannot pervade the Glaſs, but it muſt be the <hi>Materia Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis.</hi> I demand therefore, whether
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49448:147"/>
this <hi>Materia Subtilis</hi> pervades the Glaſs, and is united to the Air in the top of the Glaſs or not?</p>
               <p>If it do not, ſurely the Circle is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and with it, the circular preſſure or gravitation.</p>
               <p>If it do pervade the Glaſs, and be united to the Air included in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, theſe inſuperable difficulties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Hyloſtatical Spirit,</hi> whoſe Office it ſeems is to keep the Univerſe in its due Libration, and to preſerve the Air it ſelf in its juſt ſize and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of groſs and ſubtil Matter, as is above obſerved; breaks that order that it is placed there to conſerve; for it takes too great a proportion of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Matter from the common external Air which is due to it, and crowds it into the Air in the top of the Glaſs, which hath already more, or at leaſt, as much as belongs to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It would follow that by ſuch a Current of ſubtil Matter through the Pores of the Glaſs, that the Water ſhould riſe into the Pump even to the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49448:147"/>
laſt drop; for here is a perpetual ſpring and ſupply of ſubtil Matter, ſtrained every where through the Glaſs into the Air or aery ſpace that was in the head of the Glaſs, and no fear of any <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> to enſue by the paſſing away of the Water; ſo that it may (to uſe the Authors word) as glibly paſs to the laſt drop, as at the firſt, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contrary to experience.</p>
               <p>This Circular Gravitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is but a ſupplemental Invention, to help the Flaws that ariſe from the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Interpoſition of the <hi>Hylarchical Principle,</hi> as the true cauſe of this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I Shall not ſpend many words touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Concluſion.</p>
            <p>In ſome things therein mentioned, we very well agree; namely, in the excluſion of that prodigious Gravity and Elaſticity of the Air, whereunto the late Philoſophers attribute the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not only of the <hi>Torricellian Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> but many other <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome things we differ; he from me, in my Solution of many of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> mentioned in my Pamplets, by <hi>Rarefaction, Condenſation</hi> and <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I differ alſo from him, and the ſtate of that difference I ſet down ſhortly thus, both in the Negative, and in the Affirmative.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do not deny, but do really aſſure my ſelf, there are created Spirits, ſome ſimply void of all corporeal or phyſical matter; others, that though poſſibly
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49448:149"/>
they may have a material or phyſical <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or <hi>Substratum;</hi> yet it is ſo ſubtil, that it may deſerve the name of a ſpiritual being in common expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not conclude it impoſſible in Nature, but that there may be ſuch a kind of common Spirit of Nature as the Author would have, and not much unlike to <hi>Helmonts Archeus,</hi> which he puts into a middle Office between the Soul and Body, or the <hi>Colcoda</hi> of <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet I do ſay I am not ſatisfied that there is ſufficient evidence clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to evince the ſame; &amp; the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee no neceſſity for ſuch a being, in as much as Almighty God and his intimate preſence with all his Works, and the Laws that he hath alligated to the natures of things, abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all the general Offices for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good and order of the Univerſe, deputed to this Spirit of Nature: And the particular active Forms or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Life or Motion, placed by the God of Nature in the ſeveral Ranks
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49448:149"/>
of Beings, ſupplies what is neceſſary for their particular motions, operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inſtincts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the exiſtence of a Spirit of Nature is not at all proved by thoſe Motions and Effects in Nature, that are either purely mechanical, or that have any other immediate cauſe of greater, or but as great probability as ſuch an unſeen Spirit of Nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That conſequently the riſing of a Rundle in the Water, or the ſuſpenſion of a weight in the <hi>Embolus</hi> of an Air-Pump, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Experiment,</hi> or in the <hi>Magdeburgh Hemiſpheres,</hi> or in <hi>Pumps</hi> or <hi>Siphons,</hi> are non only invalid Arguments to prove ſuch an <hi>Hylarchical Spirit,</hi> but very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and diſadvantageous to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But if there be any ſuch <hi>Hylar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Spirit,</hi> the proofs thereof ſhould be made from ſuch things as ſeem to have in themſelves the Principles of their own motions, or at leaſt, no other viſible or probable immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe of ſuch their motions.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:49448:150"/>7. That if there be ſuch an <hi>Hylarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principle</hi> as is contended for, and that he doth interpoſe in many things that are not <hi>Automata,</hi> yet it is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite methods of Mechaniſm are the moſt probable <hi>Media</hi> whereby it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth ſuch operations.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That therefore the Author of the <hi>Remarks</hi> ſhould not be too much averſe to the Mechaniſm of thoſe Motions in Nature, as purely inconſiſtent with his <hi>Hylarchical Hypotheſis;</hi> for hereby he renders it leſs credible, by denying things that are evident to Senſe, and tranſpoſing them beyond credibility, leſt they ſhould ſeem to prejudice his Suppoſition of an <hi>Hylarchical Principle.</hi> It is too much the faſhion of men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Suppoſitions, to run into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, and that even in this Inſtance of <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> and <hi>Mechanical Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in Natural Bodies; as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond preliminary Chapter of this Book; ſome attributing too much to the <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> of things in Nature, and ſome too little.</p>
