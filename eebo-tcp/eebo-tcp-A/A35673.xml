            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Presume to Dedicate the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Trifles to you; which, if you were one, who judg'd by the Volume, would yet have more the appearance of Trifles. Let them be what they will, they are the most valuable things that I have to offer: and the Obligations which I have to your Lordship are so extraordinary, that to endeavour to make no return, would be down right Ingratitude. Your Lordship will be inclin'd to think me bold to excess, when you hear me
<pb facs="tcp:95995:3"/>
boasting of Favours receiv'd from you, tho perhaps you have never so much as heard of me. Yet, I desire leave to repeat it, the Obligations which I have to you are altogether Extraordinary. For it is owing to your Lordship that I have pass'd some moments of a melancholy Life with inexpressible pleasure. For as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has always been my chief di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, your Lordship's admirable Writings have been able to give me joy in spight of ill Fate. Your happy and commanding Genius never fail'd to controule my evil weaker one, and seem'd still to cry out to it, <hi>Whilst I am by, he must not be unhappy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor have I only the obligation to your Lordship of your own incomparable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but of most of the productions of the best Writers of our Age. 'Tis from your Generous Approbation, that
<pb facs="tcp:95995:3"/>
they have deriv'd that spirit which renders their Works Immortal. For when ever a Man who is so true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great as your Lordship, shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to look with a favourable aspect on Poetry, it will not fail to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, tho all the Stars look malignant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Ev'n I, My Lord, who am no Poet, have notwithstanding found that the desire of pleasing so accomplish'd a Iudge, has more than once inspir'd me with that noble warmth, which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Nature deny'd me. When Heaven sent <hi>Mecoenas</hi> into the World to be first Minister to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> and of Learning, then arose <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> and the rest of those extraordinary Men, whose very single Names are grown to be entire and glorious Panegyricks. When several Ages after him, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> was establish'd in <hi>France</hi> in his double Capacity, the Muses were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb facs="tcp:95995:4"/>
to pass the Mountains, and breath the sweetness of the Gallick Air. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Mecoenas</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> your Lordship will stand eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Fame, as the last in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that Illustrious Triumvirate, and it will always stand recorded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the same everlasting Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, That in your Lordship's time <hi>England</hi> had more good Poets, than it could boast from the Conquest to You before. By animating and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the very best of which, you will for ever oblige all those who are to receive Delight and Instruction, from them. Thus is your goodness grown so diffusive, that its influence extends to thousands whom you never heard of. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was the Delight and Ioy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but your Lordship is, and for ever will be so. You have found out a better way than either <hi>Mecoenas</hi> or <hi>Richlieu,</hi> to oblige not only the present Age, but
<pb facs="tcp:95995:4"/>
ev'n remotest Posterity. For if we cherish <hi>Mecoenas</hi> his Memory, tho we know that he endeavour'd at the same time to polish and enslave the World; if the Memory of <hi>Richlieu</hi> be dear to us, tho at the same time that he treated the Muses magnificently, he laid the cursed design of <hi>Europe</hi>'s Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: with what blessings must not we mention your Lordship, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that we owe at once our Delight and our Safety to you? For at the very time that you are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Ioy of your Age, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of your Country, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time that you exalt the Honour of <hi>England</hi> by your own admirable Writings, and the Labours of those Excellent Men, whom your authentick applause inspires; at the same time by giving wholesome Counsels to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust Monarch, you become instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the defence of our Liberties,
<pb facs="tcp:95995:5"/>
and the general security of the Christian World. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> and <hi>Richlieu</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Muses, but their Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was partly at least political, and necessary for the gaining or softning some unruly Spirits, who would have been else too turbulent for the New Yoak. But your Lordship's Patronage proceeds from no sinister end, no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just design on our Liberties; but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the greatness of your noble Mind, and a Godlike principle of inbred Beneficence.</p>
            <p>Thus, My Lord, have I been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a fault which is common to all the most supportable Dedications. For I have hitherto told the Publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning you, but what I learnt from the Publick before. There is no Man but knows that of all the Nobility your Lordship has been always the most true and most can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<pb facs="tcp:95995:5"/>
Friend to the Muses. Whilst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are imploy'd in finding their faults, it is your prerogative to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, and approve their Beauties. This is what is known to every one. But every one does not know that to find faults requires but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense; but to discern rare Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, requires a rare Genius. Thus if your Lordship will pardon so poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a Similitude, when one of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the fairer Sex, one who was fram'd and design'd by Providence to bless some Man who is greatly good, and give an earnest of Heaven below to him; when such a one is at any time seen amongst us, the vulgar Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, those Criticks in Beauty, are busie in censuring some Mole or some Blemish, or some inconsiderable Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, which Nature industriously perhaps contriv'd with intention to set off her great Masterpiece. But when
<pb facs="tcp:95995:6"/>
a Man who has a Soul that in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was form'd to be mov'd by Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, a beautiful Soul, when he contemplates her, he gazes, admires, and loves in a Moment; then follow transporting impatient wishes to return that happiness he receives from the lovely Object. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship could never be the Muses best Friend, if you were not the Man who understood them best. If you had not heighth of Genius, and largeness of Soul to comprehend all their Excellencies: If you did not sensibly feel their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thought with all its warmth, its force and its delicacy; which you could never fully discern, if you did not throughly understand their Tongues, if you had not skill to judge of its finest Grace, its Vigour, its Purity, its judicious Boldness, its comprehensive Energy, and all its glorious attractive ornaments. Your Lordship could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:95995:6"/>
be compleatly skill'd in those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, if you had not a piercing and a delicate Eye; an Eye that can readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge betwixt tawdry Trimming and proper, that can discern betwixt gay and curious Colours, and can distinguish vain gawdy Pageantry, from pompous richness and true Magnificence. You could never converse with the Muses so freely as to understand them fully, if you did not perfectly speak that language of the Gods, in all its Sweetness, all its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, in all the power of its various Numbers, and in all its harmonious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty. No, My Lord, you could never be pleas'd to a height with the Writings of others, if in writing, your self you had not felt those happy Enthusiasms, those violent Emotions, those supernatural transports which exalt a mortal above mortality, give delight and admiration to all the World, but shake and ravish a Poet's Soul with insupportable pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:7"/>
But it is high time to take leave of a Subject which throws me into a heat, which is very inconsistent with the respect that is due to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Character.</p>
            <p>Otherwise it would be no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prove from the same affection which you bear to the Muses, that your Lordship's Virtue shines as bright as your Genius.
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Carmen amat quisquis Carmine digna gerit.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But there is small need of proving that Virtue which all men discover by its own light. Your Lordship's Genius shines but to a few, to none but those happy few, who have some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in their breasts of the same eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire. For inspiation alone can capacitate a Mortal to behold Celestial
<pb facs="tcp:95995:7"/>
Beauties. The Vulgar discern it as they do a fix'd Star, they see that it is, they see that it shines: but the Rays that it casts at that infinite distance, can but just reach their benighted Souls thro the horrid gloom that surrounds them; and it is with pleasing wonder that they hear the Sons of Art pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming its prodigious Grandeur, its amazing Glory. But all men have a clear Idea of Virtue, tho few have a just notion of Genius. Your Virtue, My Lord, like the Sun, is nearer to them, tho that too is at a mighty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet not so remote but that at the time that it cherishes them, it casts more light upon them, than their Souls can directly bear.</p>
            <p>Who does not admire your Goodness, your Charity, your generous Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, your greatness of Mind, your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Friendship; and to crown all, your
<pb facs="tcp:95995:8"/>
Passionate Concern for your Countries welfare? These are the qualities which have caus'd your Lordship to be belov'd universally, nay, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd too with as much warmth as if you were neither much esteem'd nor respected, yet at the same time so profoundly esteem'd, and in that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner respected, as if you were not belov'd. The news of your late Promotion was receiv'd with the universal acknowledgement, That your Lordship was an honour to that most noble Order, which is an honour to Kings; and we all cryed out una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously with your own <hi>Horace,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Mecoenas equitum decus!</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But I must be forc'd to stop short in this full career, lest proceeding I should please all Readers but you, whom of all Readers I would least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please.
<pb facs="tcp:95995:8"/>
Before I conclude, I think fit to acquaint your Lordship, that I omitted the prefixing your name to this bold Epistle for several reasons: the chief of which is that. I might not be liable to the accusation which one of our greatest Wits has some time since brought against dedicating Authors; which is, that they paint so grosly, that it were impossible to know for whom the Dawbers design'd their Pictures, if they did not; to inform us, set their names on the Top. I appeal to all those who shall happen to read this, if before they found you nam'd, they did not conclude that what has been said all along could be addrest to no man, and justly applyed to no man; but my Lord <hi>Dorset</hi> alone. <hi>I am,</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Verses composing this little Volume, were Writ on such various Subjects, that many of them requir'd quite different Spirits, and quite oppose Characters. Some of them demanded the Enthusiastick Spirit; and all that others were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of was a little good Sense, and an air of Gaity. The first were the most difficult to handle by much; which yet, if they should chance to be manag'd aright, would make me an ample a mends for my toil. For tho
<pb facs="tcp:95995:10"/>
mear Enthusiasm is but Madness, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more noble than that which is rightly regulated; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come nearer that which I fancy to be a true description of Wit; which is a just mixture of Reason and Extravagance, that is such a mixture as reason may always be sure to predominate, and make its mortal Enemy subservient to its grand design of discovering and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating sacred Truth. When I writ the Pindarick Ode, the high Idea that I had of the Subject and of the way of writing, made me resolve to spare for no Pains before I set Pen to Paper, that I might form a design which might have something great and Pindarical. For the skilful Reader will easily discern, that the disorder in that Ode is studied, and that the Transitions which appear so wild and so foreign, tend directly to shew what I design'd to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb facs="tcp:95995:10"/>
the happiness of <hi>England,</hi> and the Success of the Confederacy depended on the King's Person. How I have succeeded I must leave to the Readers to judge; yet not to every Reader. For the Pindarick why, if you'l give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a great Master, is dangerous both to Writer and Reader. The first must have some qualities at the time of writing, which are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found together, as Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Address, Boldness and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Sublimeness and Clearness, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Sense; the last must have Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to see his flights, and Skill to judge of their Art He who mounts the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darick Pegasus may be compar'd to a man a Hawking, who rides at all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a headlong Hunter, with his Eye still fix'd on a towring Game, so that he must not only have something of Art, but of Happiness besides, to escape a Fall. Let my Fortune be what it will, my comfort is this, That <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:11"/>
since Mr. <hi>Cowle</hi> ys time, has not seen many Pindarick Odes, whose Authors have reason to boast of their kind reception.</p>
            <p>I should now say something of the Verses upon the Sea-Fight, and one or two Copies more. But tho they have something in them that seems bold to presumption; yet they have already met with such kind entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, that the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that in some measure as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures me.</p>
            <p>But since almost a third of this little Book consists of Burlesque Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures, and since Burlesque, at present, lies under the disadvantage of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two great Authorities against it; viz. <hi>Boileau</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s: I think my self oblig'd not only upon that account, but upon considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too of that wonderful pleasure which I have so often receiv'd from <hi>Butler,</hi> to vindicate Burlesque from
<pb facs="tcp:95995:11"/>
the scandal that is brought upon it, by the Censures of two such extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Men.</p>
            <p>The charge of <hi>Boileau</hi> is in his Art of Poetry, <hi>Chant pre</hi> in these Lines.
<q>
                  <l>Quoyque vous ecriviez, evitez la bassesse</l>
                  <l>Le style, le moins noble, a pourtant sa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse,</l>
                  <l>Au mepris du bon sens le Burlesque ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronté.</l>
                  <l>Trompa les yeux d' abord, pleut parsa noveaute,</l>
                  <l>On ne vid plus en vers que pointes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viales;</l>
                  <l>Le Parnasse parla le language des Hales.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which in <hi>English</hi> paraphrastick Prose, is thus: <hi>Whatever you write, let a Gentleman's manner appear in it; The lowest stile of the man, who knows how to write, will still have a noble Air with it. But rightly to observe this rule, you must be sure to decline Burlesque, which not long since in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solently
<pb facs="tcp:95995:12"/>
appear'd in contempt of Reason, and pleas'd at the expence of good Sense: it pleas'd indeed a while, but pleas'd only as it was a fantastick novelty: It debas'd the dignity of Verse by its tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Points, and taught</hi> Parnassus <hi>a</hi> Billingsgate <hi>Dialect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is a violent charge, and may hold very good against <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Burlesque; but there is not one Article of it but what will fall to the Ground, if it comes to be apply'd to <hi>Butler. Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s Burlesque has nothing of a Gentleman in it, little of good Sense, and consequently little of true Wit. For tho there may be good Sense found without Wit, there can be no true Wit, where there is no good Sense. For a Thought that is really witty, must necessarily be true, and have something in it that's Solid; So that Quibbles and all Equivocals can have little or nothing of true Wit in them. Wit is a just mixture of Reason and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance,
<pb facs="tcp:95995:12"/>
and the Extravagance must be there, only in order to give the Reason the more lustre. Now that there is little of Reason and good Sense in <hi>Scaron</hi>'s Burlesque, all who are accquainted with him, very well know; Instead of it there are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocals and trivial points in abundance. His language is so very mean that it may well be call'd <hi>le language des Hales. Scaron</hi> therefore pleas'd but a while (by his Burlesque, I mean, for his Novels will certainly please eternally) and I do not remember that he has been imitated by any one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>French</hi> Wits. It is no wonder if his manner with all these ill qualities, has been rejected by the <hi>French</hi> Court, and condemn'd by this judicious Poet and Critick.</p>
            <p>But the contrary of whatever has been said of <hi>Scaron,</hi> is certainly true of <hi>Butler:</hi> There is seen much of a Gentleman in his Burlesque; There
<pb facs="tcp:95995:13"/>
is so much Wit and Goodsense to be found in him, and so much true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation on mankind, that I do not believe there is more, take Volume for Volume in any one Author we have, the <hi>Plain-Dealer</hi> only excepted; Besides, there is a vivacity and purity in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, whereever it was fit it should be pure, that could proceed from nothing but from a generous Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from a happy Nature. And further <hi>Butler</hi>'s Burlesque was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ with a just design, which was to expose Hypocrisie. <hi>Scaron</hi>'s Burlesque, was writ either with no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or but with a very scurvy one. For the only design that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd of his <hi>Virgil Travesty,</hi> was to ridicule Heroick Poetry, which is the noblest invention of human Wit. Since then, <hi>Butler</hi> excell'd in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in which <hi>Seakon</hi> is defective, we may very well conclude, That <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean</hi>'s accusation reaches not our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:13"/>
Poet. Which Sir <hi>William Soames</hi> saw very well, when he translated this Art of Poetry, for he was so far from declaring against Burlesque, that he ventur'd, tho it was foreign from his Author, to propound <hi>Butler</hi> as a model to those who had a mind to write it. The late Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> who was very well acquainted with <hi>Boileau,</hi> and who defer'd very much to his Judgment, did not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the censure of <hi>Boileau</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Butler:</hi> For if he had, he would never have follow'd his fashion in several of his masterly Copies. Nor would a noble Wit, who is a living Honour to his Country, and the <hi>English</hi> Court, have condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to write Burlesque, if he had not discern'd that there was in <hi>Butler</hi>'s manner something extreamly fine, as well as something extreamly sensible in very many of his Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:14"/>
I now come to examine Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s objections to <hi>Butler,</hi> which I shall do with all the submission and deference that is due to the judgment of that extraordinary Man. And therefore I have reason to hope that I shall give no offence to him nor to any Man, by undertaking my own defence. For to plead the Cause of <hi>Butler</hi> is at present to maintain my own. For if he who is so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Original, is rightly reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for writing in Burlesque: I who am but his follower, and can never pretend to come near his excellence, ought much more severely to be censur'd. I must confess that in Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s accusation of Burlesque, there are no such murdering Articles, as there are in that of <hi>Boilean</hi> against <hi>Scaron;</hi> For Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> allows <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> to have shewn a great deal of good Sense in that way of writing; so that we have here gain'd one conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:95995:14"/>
Point, which <hi>Boileau</hi> seem'd not to allow us, which is that good Sense is consistent with Burlesque. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s quarrel is to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Butler:</hi> he says that he might have chosen a better sort, affirming that he would equally have excell'd in all.</p>
            <p>Whether he would have practised all sorts of Numbers with equal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, is what I have not now time to examine. But granting that, it is more than probable that he chose aright. For I would fain ask any man one question; Whether he thinks Nature had given <hi>Butler</hi> a Talent to treat of the adventures of <hi>Hudibras?</hi> For if any one grants that she had given him such a Talent, I will not stick to affirm that it could not fail to suggest to him the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est means for the carrying on his design.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:15"/>
Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s objections to the Numbers of <hi>Butler</hi> are two, the first is to the Measure, the second to the Rhymes. The Verse of eight Syllables he says is too scanty, and there is not room enough for the Thought to turn it self with ease in it. But how vain a thing is it to argue against ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? For <hi>Butler</hi> has not only as many and as beautiful thoughts as most Authors, but he is as clear a Writer. Besides, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> may be pleas'd to remember that the most sensible Copy of Verses in all <hi>Waller,</hi> is in the measure of eight Syllables, which is that which begins,
<q>
                  <l>Anger in hasty words or blows.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himself in his Preface to the second part of the <hi>Sylvae,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises all who attempt the Pindarick way, to consine themselves chiefly to Lyrical Numbers: and Numbers
<pb facs="tcp:95995:15"/>
which are truly Lyrical are seldom to be extended beyond the eight syllable. His practice too is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to his precept in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parble Translation of <hi>Tyrrhena Regum Progenies.</hi> Now it is plain that in the Pindarick way the Thoughts rise, and the Soul swells more, if I may have leave to use that expression, than in any other sort of writing. Whereas in Satyr the thoughts ought to be more simple, and the expressions less mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. It follows from what has been said, that if the measure of eight syllables is agreeable in Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Verse; it is much more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Burlesque, which is a kind of Satyr. Besides it is apparent that in Burlesque, the measure is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the ninth and sometimes to the tenth syllable.</p>
            <p>But it is high time to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Rhymes. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> complains that they return too thick
<pb facs="tcp:95995:16"/>
upon us: but then the thoughts have the quicker turns, and I never can be persuaded that succinctness can be a fault in writing, unless it be destructive of perspicuity. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that double and treble Rhymes are effeminate, and debase the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Veise below manly Satyr. But this objection will be in force too against <hi>Tassone,</hi> whose manner Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> seems to approve of: For he has writ his Satyr in double and treble Rhymes too, but with this difference from <hi>Butler,</hi> that <hi>Butler</hi> makes use of them but sometimes, and <hi>Tassone</hi> does it perpetually. Nay the great <hi>Tasso</hi> has written his Heroick Poem in them. I shall find another time to speak at large of the Gierusalemme: but this I can say at present, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably to the purpose, That some parts of that Poem are so far from being effeminate, that they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more gravity than any
<pb facs="tcp:95995:16"/>
long winded Poem which has been writ by the Moderns, if you only except some passages of the <hi>Paradise lost of</hi> Milton.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> himself in his own Satyrs has sometimes made use of double and treble Rhymes, ev'n in Heroick Verse. And in the Character of <hi>Zimri,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> prefers to any part of <hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> there are two couplets in the space of eight Lines, which are writ in double Rhymes, and those two coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets are two of the very best in all that admirable Character.</p>
            <p>There is more than one considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage that we have by our Burlesque Rhymes. For first, they show the power and plenty of the English Tongue. For neither <hi>Italian</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> have a sort of Rhymes for their Burlesque, which is different from those which they have for their other kinds of Verse. Nor
<pb facs="tcp:95995:17"/>
have they in either of those Tongues any of those odd Rhymes, to the making up of which two or three words conspire. These Rhymes thus constituted (which is another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our English Burlesque) seem to me to be as peculiarly becoming of a Jest, as a roguish Leer, or a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical tone of a Voice; and that it may plainly appear that this is no Whimsie, let the best Versifier in <hi>England</hi> turn these two Lines of <hi>Butler.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>And Pulpet drum Ecclesiastick</l>
                  <l>Was beat with Fist instead of a Stick;</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let any one I say turn these two Lines into other Rhymes and other Measures, and I dare engage that the Jest shall loose considerably.</p>
            <p>Before I take my leave of Burlesque &amp; <hi>Butler,</hi> I think fit to say something of the latter, which has not so direct a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:95995:17"/>
to his way of writing (tho that too is indirectly commended by it) as to the incomparable genius of the Man. It is this that if any one would set the Common places of <hi>Tassone</hi> and <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau</hi>'s <hi>Lutrin</hi> against those of <hi>Butler,</hi> it would appear for the Honour of <hi>England,</hi> that neither the <hi>French</hi> man nor <hi>Italian</hi> could stand before us. The most diverting thing in all the <hi>Lutrin</hi> is the Battle at <hi>Barbin</hi>'s Shop. <hi>Chant.</hi> 5. Yet that, if it is compar'd with the Battle in the second Canto of the first part of <hi>Hudibras,</hi> tho it is so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting when we read it alone, will appear to be perfectly insipid.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude I have two things to say farther. The one is, that the Verses to <hi>Flavia</hi> were writ by a Friend of mine and only Corrected by me, and it is by my friends leave that they are here inserted. The other thing is this, that tho I may expect to have this little Book se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
<pb facs="tcp:95995:18"/>
examined, because I have attack'd several great men, who are all of them many degrees above me, yet I shall not at all repent of any thing I have writ by way of Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism, if I do but in any measure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what I design'd by it, which was nothing but to advance Polite Learning amongst us. Not that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my self capable of performing it, but I thought that the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my impotency might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite some generous spirits whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Education have capacitated for so noble a work. There is no man should be more glad to see it carried on than my self. I love my Country very well, and therefore should be ravished to see that we out did the <hi>French</hi> in Arts, at the same time that we contend for Empire with them. For Arts and Empire in Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd Nations have generally flourish'd together.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Passion of <hi>Byblis</hi> seems to be, in the Original, not only of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly pieces, but a Passion in some places the most happily touch'd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that I have seen amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients or Moderns. The Sentiments are so tender and yet so delicate, the Expressions so fit and withal so easie, with that facility which is proper to express Love, and peculiar to this charming Poet; the turns of Passion are so surprizing and yet so natural,
<pb facs="tcp:95995:22"/>
and there seems to be something in the very sound of the Verse so soft and so pathetick, that a man who reads the Original, must have no sense of these Matters if he is not transported with it.</p>
            <p>When I was desired to make it <hi>English,</hi> I read over the Original to some men of sense, to see whether they would be touch'd with the same pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages with which I had been mov'd so much. And when I saw that I was not mistaken, I resolv'd to imitate them in our native Tongue, with as much address as I could.</p>
            <p>Not that I am of the opinion that I have done justice to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Original; but then you must give me leave to do some to my self;
<pb facs="tcp:95995:22"/>
and as I would not have my faults imputed to <hi>Ovid,</hi> so, since I have so many of my own to account for, I do not desire to stand charg'd with his, which as his Translator I was oblig'd to copy.</p>
            <p>I will chiefly take notice of two, the one general, and the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The general one is the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency that appears in the Character of <hi>Byblis.</hi> For she, who in some places of her Passion appears so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant, seems too abandon'd in others; which are two or three Passages of her Letter (for from the beginning of the Story to the Letter, every thing seems to me to be just enough) in which she says some things that are by no means consistent with that Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
<pb facs="tcp:95995:23"/>
which she ought to have, as a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, a Virgin, and a Woman of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I know very well that a Woman of Honour, when once she is seiz'd by a great Passion, has more violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires than the most abandon'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can have. For abandon'd Women are consequently weak, and it is a true Observation, that weak People, tho they are subject to Passions at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very turn, yet are they never through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated by them. But this is most certain, that a Woman of Honour can never break out into immodest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, let her Passion be never so violent. For Immodesty in Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must show her profligate to the very last degree, and must be utterly inconsistent with any measure of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb facs="tcp:95995:23"/>
Now <hi>Byblis,</hi> who shows in some places so much of Honour, by such sharp remorse, and such furious relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, ought certainly to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented her self with a bare Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her Passion; and not to have behav'd her self as if she thought her Brother so very young, that he was to be instructed how to proceed in the Cure of it.</p>
            <p>It may be said perhaps that the relation of the Dream, which precedes the Letter is the most immodest thing in the Story. I will easily grant it, and that that relation is in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal the most alluring description that can be imagin'd, and almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually transporting with what it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes. But it must then be consider'd
<pb facs="tcp:95995:24"/>
that what <hi>Byblis</hi> says there, she on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaks to herself, which amounts to no more than if she but barely thought it. And there is nothing certainly in that Reflection on her Dream, but what is extremely natural.</p>
            <p>The second Fault in this Passion of <hi>Byblis,</hi> is in the passage that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows the return of the Messenger. For that which ought to be the most moving, is the coldest part of the Story. I speak of the first thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Lines of the <hi>Latin</hi> (for all that follows seems to be sufficiently warm) where <hi>Byblis,</hi> who can scarce speak for the Violence of her Grief, is yet for speaking in Allegory; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an imperfect kind of Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:24"/>
Now Simile in this place could not be moving, because it could not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; it being by no means the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of great grief. For to be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to make a good similitude, the mind must have several qualifications, and two more particularly; which are utterly inconsistent with that Passion. First, The soul must be susceptible of a great many Idea's, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination capacious of a great many Images. For the Fancy must run thro', and compare a great many Objects, before it can start a hint from them, which may carry with it that appearance of likeness, which may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the Iudgment be improved to an exact resemblance (not but that
<pb facs="tcp:95995:25"/>
I know very well, that the Soul on those occasions acts with that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Celerity, that it is its self insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the degrees of its own motion.) Now it is the Nature of Grief to confine the Soul, and straiten the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and extremely to lessen the number of tqeir Objects. And indeed if the Passion is very violent, a man is incessantly thinking of the cause of it. For example, the unfortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has eternally before his Eyes the Image of his Cruel Fair-one. He thinks Day and Night of her alone, he contemplates nothing but her; and if he complains of her, 'tis only after that simple unaffected way, by which Nature teaches man to discharge his Soul of sorrow. And it is for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:95995:25"/>
reason that the greater part of Mr. <hi>Cowley's</hi> amorous Verses, are universally exploded by men of sence, at the same time that they confess, that several of his Miscellaneous Writings, his Pindaric Odes, and his Divine Hymn to Light, will justly deserve the Admiration of our latest Posterity. For in most of those amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Verses, there appears thro' the disguise of an affected Passion, a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Heart, a wantonness of Wit, and a Soul that's at liberty to roam about the Universe, and return home laden with rich, but far fetch'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. As merry in this respect as the Madrigals of our amorous Rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hells; who languish in Simile, whilst they thrive in Carkass; and who eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:95995:26"/>
their Half-Crowns every day thrice, decay and dye by Metaphor. In short, no sort of imagery ever can be the Language of Grief. If a Man complains in Simile, I either laugh or sleep. For this is plain, that if a man's affliction will suffer him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his mind by one Simile, he may as well do it by twenty, and so on to the end of the Chapter. If such a man therefore is miserable, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is resolved he will be so. Now a man must have an extraordinary stock of good Nature, who can pity a Blockhead, who is a wretch by choice.</p>
            <p>But secondly, For the mind to be capable of making Similitudes, it is necessary it should be serene (unless it be transported with that noble Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm,
<pb facs="tcp:95995:26"/>
which delights, illuminates, and exalts the soul, at the very same time it disturbs it.) For without serenity a man can never have penetration e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to discern the Nature of things, which penetration is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the making a just Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: and it is upon this very account that <hi>Aristotle</hi> says in his Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, that to be happy in making si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, it is absolutely necessary to be a man of good sense.</p>
            <p>Some of my Friends, to whom I have recited in Conversation, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what I have here repeated in Writing, have advised me to leave out this unseasonable similitude, especially since I have made so bold with <hi>Ovid;</hi> as to insert here and
<pb facs="tcp:95995:27"/>
there a Thought of my own. For it is my Lord <hi>Roscommon's</hi> opinion, that it is much safer to leave out than add. Tho' no man pays more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Iudgment than I do, I cannot be of his mind in this. For tho' I am not ignorant that a scurvy present, is but a more civil Affront; I cannot but believe it to be less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious than a Robbery. And if any man should be caught, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> stripping another upon the Road, it would be but an impudent excuse in him, to alledge that the Cloaths but ill became their Owner. All that I could do here, was by giving this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage another turn, to make that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Copy to be spoken in a short, but downright Fury, whose fault
<pb facs="tcp:95995:27"/>
it was in the Original to seem to be spoken with too much Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness, and too much Coolness of Temper.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Satyrs upon the Iesuits, who has translated this Passion of <hi>Byblis,</hi> has not meddled with the Catastrophe. Now the Catastrophe was absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that the Story at ending might make a deeper impression: I have therefore contracted it in the last five Lines, but at the same time I have alter'd it. For to make it moving it was necessary to make it credible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:28"/>
The Transformation of <hi>Byblis</hi> might do very well in the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> For at that time those Transformations were a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and the Poets may be said to be the secular Priests, who transmitted its Mysteries to the People. But those transubstantiating Doctrines, which were taught in those times by that Harmonious Clergy of the credulous Church of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> would look as absurdly to us as the Chimerical Metamorphosis, which is pretended to be acted at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time it is sung in our modern <hi>Roman</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:28"/>
I must beg Pardon for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which I have taken in the numbers, which is so great that it may well be entitled License. But then the Reader will have the greater Variety, and if those Numbers are not harmonious, it is not for want of care about them: I have particularly taken care to be exact in the Rhimes, in which the former Translators of this passage have been very defective. I am not so miserably mistaken, as to think rhiming essential to our <hi>English</hi> Poetry. I am far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with <hi>Milton,</hi> than that comes to. Who without the assistance of Rhime, is one of the most sublime of our <hi>English</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.
<pb facs="tcp:95995:29"/>
Nay, there is something so transcendently sublime in his first, second, and sixth Books, that were the Language as pure as the Images are vast and daring, I do not believe it could be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd, no, not in all Antiquity. But tho' I know that Rhiming is not absolutely necessary to our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sification, yet I am for having a Man do throughly what he has once pretended to do. Writing in blank Verse looks like a contempt of Rhime, and a generous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of a barbarous Custom; but Writing in such Rhimes as a Boy may laugh at, at <hi>Crambo,</hi> looks
<pb facs="tcp:95995:29"/>
at the best like a fruitless Attempt, and an impotent Affectation.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Roscommon</hi> who writ in blank Verse with so much Success, yet was nicely exact in Rhiming, whenever he pretended to rhime. And in the very Essay upon translated Verse in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims against Rhime, I defie any Man to show me half a dozen coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets which do not rhime exactly.</p>
            <p>In short, if rhiming is ever neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in so strong and masculine a Language as ours, it must be on these tender occasions. For tho' I have heard several maintain, that a thing may be expressed as nobly
<pb facs="tcp:95995:30"/>
and vigorously in blank Verse, as in Rhime; I never yet heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one pretend that it might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed as softly. But granting it could, it is yet very certain, that a thing must be much more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in perfect Rhimes, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. For where the Reader ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a Rhime, there jarring sounds must render that harsh, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing sounds would render easie. But then it is necessary that the Rhimes should be unconstrained, and no word us'd upon their account in the place where it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95995:30"/>
But since I have mention'd Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi>'s performance, in this Transiation, I think fit to add farther, that I have been told by some, that a great many will never forgive me the attempting it after him. I desire them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the same Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi> undertook <hi>Horace</hi>'s Art of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try after my Lord <hi>Roscommon.</hi> Now my Lord <hi>Roscommon</hi> was Politeness it self. Never man thought more clearly, more truly, more justly than he did; never man express'd himself more fitly and more becomingly. In every thing that he writ, his Language
<pb facs="tcp:95995:31"/>
was as perfect as his Conceptions were often sublime. On every thing that came from him, he has stamp'd the Character not only of an exalted Wit, but of a Man of a high Condition, and of a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mind.</p>
            <p>If I should affirm that Mr. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had by no means all the good Qualities which are conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in my Lord <hi>Roscommon,</hi> who is there that must not assent to it? If then I am guilty of presumption in attempting what Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi> undertook before me, I hope I may be excused by his
<pb facs="tcp:95995:31"/>
own Example. But if some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yet can resolve to be angry, I must beg them to consider for what. Is is because I have a desire to please them? That methinks is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. Tho' I should own, I have an Ambition to give them more Delight than the fore-mentioned Gentleman has done before me, I cannot see any thing in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession which can reasonably disob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them. Such an acknowledgment ought rather to gain me their Favor, or at least to conquer their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, especially since 'tis the Interest of every Reader to be as candid as the Case will let him be. 'Tis
<pb facs="tcp:95995:32"/>
true, a man of sence can never be satisfy'd with a silly thing. But a peevish, unreasonable Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, will never be satisfy'd with any thing. Little considering that by a false delicacy he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pass those moments scurvily, which another, perhaps, has done his part to make him pass agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
            <p>Besides, if I should succeed here, even beyond my wish, I should be very far upon that score, from arrogating Preheminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man. The following Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is a Trifle, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:95995:32"/>
be conclusive of any such thing. To succeed in it, required neither Force nor Genius, but only a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Soul (which Mr. <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Masculine Temper dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd) and an extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity to that Humane Frailty, Compassion; and a certain Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which usually accompanies the Dictates of the softer Passions. To conclude, I leave it to any one to consider whether a Satyrist, as Mr. <hi>Oldham</hi> was, at the very time that, inspir'd by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Rage, he had assum'd a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of exposing the Follies, and lashing the Vices of the Age,
<pb facs="tcp:95995:33"/>
could be fitly dispos'd to excite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion; by setting before our Eyes an unfortunate Lady, whose Love was at once her Folly and her Crime.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Passion of</hi> BYBLIS.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>BRight Nymphs, the Objects of Mankind's Desires,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Byblis</hi> learn t' avoid incestuous Fires:</l>
               <l>She <hi>Caunus</hi> lov'd, with tenderness above</l>
               <l>The cold endearments of a Sister's Love.</l>
               <l>At first she knew it not, unhappy Maid!</l>
               <l>To impious Flames by Piety betraid.</l>
               <l>She frequently would kiss the beauteous Boy,</l>
               <l>And thought her Duty what she found her Joy.</l>
               <l>Her Love for Duty she mistook with ease,</l>
               <l>Yet was surpriz'd that Duty thus should please.</l>
               <l>Her twining Arms his lovely Neck would clasp,</l>
               <l>Fierce was each Kiss, and furious ev'ry Grasp,</l>
               <l>Insensibly her Passion gathers force,</l>
               <l>And has to Female Stratagems recourse.</l>
               <l>About to visit <hi>Caunus,</hi> ere She goes,</l>
               <l>Her skilful Maids her wanton Dress compose;</l>
               <l>And all the Ornaments of Art prepare</l>
               <l>To set forth all that Heav'n has giv'n the Fair,</l>
               <l>Ten thousand <hi>Cupids</hi> in her Eyes, and Graces in her Air.</l>
               <l>Then in her Glass sh'explores what pow'r there lyes,</l>
               <l>In a Majestic easie Meen, and lovely glancing Eyes;</l>
               <l>Practices Smiles, such by which Souls are caught,</l>
               <l>Great, God-like Spirits to dependance brought,</l>
               <l>The Magic by the great Enchantress Nature taught.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:95995:34"/>
She envies ev'ry Face that's form'd to please,</l>
               <l>And wonders why, not knowing her Disease.</l>
               <l>So Men in Hecticks, wasting for their Urn,</l>
               <l>Hourly consume, yet feel not that they burn.</l>
               <l>Pent in her inmost Breast the raging Fire,</l>
               <l>Had not as yet flam'd up to high desire;</l>
               <l>Her Brother, now her Lord, her Dear she names,</l>
               <l>And Kindred, Love thus tenderly disclaims,</l>
               <l>Her Passion now she doubts, yet does controul,</l>
               <l>No guilty thought yet stain'd her waking Soul,</l>
               <l>On it, with Night, the black pollution stole.</l>
               <l>A pleasing Dream t'her side her Brother brings,</l>
               <l>With panting Breasts she murmuring to him clings.</l>
               <l>Strait in her Face offended Nature flies,</l>
               <l>And Blushes dawn around her darkned Eyes,</l>
               <l>She wakes, but hush'd and rapt in fearful wonder lies.</l>
               <l>Her Dream at once can charm her and torment,</l>
               <l>The aery Omen boads some dire Event.</l>
               <l>A long time mute she all her Soul surveys,</l>
               <l>And then its grief in these wild words displays.</l>
               <l>What means the Vision of the guilty Night?</l>
               <l>Ah Wretch! What Horror! mix'd with what delight!</l>
               <l>Why did that lovely shape break in upon thy sight?</l>
               <l>'Tis true, ev'n Envy no defect can find,</l>
               <l>Or in the Beauties of his Face, or Graces of his mind</l>
               <l>Ev'n Envy can contented on him gaze,</l>
               <l>By liking sullenly it self amaze,</l>
               <l>And learn to speak a foreign Lauguage, Praise.</l>
               <l>The Gods have made him fit to be desir'd,</l>
               <l>Have made him by themselves to be admir'd.</l>
               <l>But oh! a Brother's once endearing name</l>
               <l>Is now the Foe that's fatal to my Flame.</l>
               <l>Yet whilst awake I can continue chaste,</l>
               <l>May ev'ry golden Dream be like the last.</l>
               <l>For what vain Fop the sport of such a Bed</l>
               <l>Can idly blab? or what dull Libel spread?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="1" facs="tcp:95995:34"/>
Honour's secure, whilst Pleasure I pursue,</l>
               <l>And this false bliss is surely worth the true.</l>
               <l>Bright Queen of Love, and wing'd delicious Boy,</l>
               <l>Soft, sweet, and swift, as was my flitting Joy;</l>
               <l>Into what Heav'n of Rapture was I caught!</l>
               <l>Too powerful joys for words, too vast for thought!</l>
               <l>By dying Sighs, and broken Murmurs, best</l>
               <l>When absent mourn'd, and when enjoy'd exprest.</l>
               <l>The Vision did such quick delight dispense,</l>
               <l>I sometimes doubt if fancy were not sense.</l>
               <l>I felt, perfectly felt, what I adore,</l>
               <l>The God-like touch gave bliss unknown before.</l>
               <l>Th' immortal Pleasure ran thro' all my Frame,</l>
               <l>Tho' all my Bones, and inmost Marrow came,</l>
               <l>That melted and ran pouring down before th' im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Flame.</l>
               <l>For ever shall the charming Memory last</l>
               <l>Of Transports, which, alas! <hi>too</hi> quickly past!</l>
               <l>For the Malignant Goddess of the Night,</l>
               <l>Envying my Bliss, urg'd on her Head-long Flight.</l>
               <l>O! could we but dissolve great Nature's tye,</l>
               <l>How well we link'd in stricter Bonds might lye?</l>
               <l>Who could be fitlier pair'd than thou and I?</l>
               <l>As thou no Maid can'st e'er transport like me,</l>
               <l>Who such high Happiness can give to thee?</l>
               <l>Ah <hi>Caunus!</hi> that we ev'ry Night like this</l>
               <l>Might lye entranc'd in vast exstacic Bliss!</l>
               <l>Curs'd be the time when my great Father did</l>
               <l>The Deed for me, which I'm with thee forbid;</l>
               <l>Would I had been (deriv'd from some poor Swain)</l>
               <l>But the most lovesome she upon the Plain:</l>
               <l>What Nature must deny me now, the God might then obtain.</l>
               <l>Ah! who must ravish'd in thy Embraces be?</l>
               <l>Exalted above Goddesses is she,</l>
               <l>Fairest of Men! who must b'embrac'd by thee.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95995:35"/>
I never can that full content enjoy,</l>
               <l>Thou, Brother! Thou! too dear, too charming Boy!</l>
               <l>By being thus far mine, dost all my Hopes destroy.</l>
               <l>But what import, or what are then my Dreams,</l>
               <l>The fond Results of Hypochondriack Streams?</l>
               <l>Or do they as divinely inspir'd presage?</l>
               <l>The Gods forbid! The Gods repel this Rage!</l>
               <l>The Gods this Fever of my Soul assuage!</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Saturn</hi> of his Sister made his Bride,</l>
               <l>And in incestuous Fires the Thunderer fry'd.</l>
               <l>But Gods have high Prerogatives, and they</l>

               <l>Perhaps thy Servant caus'd thy ill success,</l>
               <l>By hasty management without address.</l>
               <l>He might absurdly chuse some busie hour,</l>
               <l>Too rude and harsh for Love's soft tender pow'r.</l>
               <l>Therefore he fail'd the noble Youth to move,</l>
               <l>Can one who has those Eyes inexorable prove?</l>
               <l>His Breasts of no impenetrable mold,</l>

               <l>His Int'rest with his Fame to undermine.</l>
               <l>That specious baits were for his Virtue laid,</l>
               <l>To be to public Infamy betray'd.</l>
               <l>He'll fancy this some common, base desire,</l>

                  <l>Then guiltless I'd despair'd, and suffer'd Scorn.</l>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas the reason that I make her give is just opposite to it,</hi> vid. <hi>Then I might guiltless have enjoyed my</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Ovid <hi>expresses no reason, but implies one; for there is something Pindarical in the sense of this passage, and the Connexion is left to be made by the Reader, as we shall find anon. In the mean while let us see, whither Mr.</hi> Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham'<hi>s reason or mine is that of</hi> Ovid. <hi>To discover which let us consider, which is most agreeable to good sense, and the nature of her Passion, and most suitable to the Design of the Poet. It does not seem to me to be consistent with good sense, to make</hi> Byblis, <hi>who so vehemently desir'd to enjoy her Brother, and who at the same time saw the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of it, and felt the Plague of Despair, wish that she had been of a more obscure Descent, rather than that of her Brother's illustrious Stock; only that with the same vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment desire she might have the same Despair. Nor does this seem to be consistent with the Nature of Love. For they who are throughly seiz'd with that Passion, place all their Felicity in the beloved Object, and even in Despair most ardently desire Possession. And such can no more wish to be in a Condition of Life, that might render them incapable of enjoying what they love, than any Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can truly wish to be miserable. It had been therefore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95995:40"/>
more consonant to good sense, and the Nature of her Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to make her speak thus.</hi> Had my Birth been more lowly; and I had been tormented with the same desire, though there had been an improbability of satisfying; yet considering what a Leveller Love is, there had not been then, as there is now, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute impossibility of innocently enjoying my <hi>Caunus. To discover if this be not</hi> Ovid'<hi>s sense, I think fit with this passage to cite what immediately precedes and follows.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>O ego, si liceat mutato nomine jungi,</l>
                  <l>Quam bene, <hi>Caune,</hi> tuo poteram nurus esse Parenti!</l>
                  <l>Quam bene, <hi>Caune,</hi> meo poteras gener esse Parenti!</l>
                  <l>Omnia Dii facerent essent communia nobis</l>
                  <l>Praeter avos, tu me vellem generosier esses,</l>
                  <l>Nescio quam facies igitur pulcherrime matrem!</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That is to say,</hi> Could we but dissolve the bonds of Nature, how well we might be join'd in stricter! I wish that having every thing else in common, we had at least a different Lineage; would I had been inferior to <hi>Caunus,</hi> rather than thus have been equal to him. But alas! this is but a vain wish, and therefore another must be the happy she who must possess all that I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish for. <hi>I believe this will be allow'd to be a just expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of</hi> Ovid'<hi>s sense. For the last verse by the word</hi> igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur <hi>must necessarily be an inference, from something ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or implied in the last but one. Now that which is implied can be nothing but this.</hi> If you had been of a different Parentage, thô you had been more nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, yet there had then been a possibility (such is the force of Love) of my being blest in innocently pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing you; which possibility now is destroyed by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Therefore another, <hi>&amp;c. Besides, if we do but consider, that every thing that precedes and follows</hi> Byblis'<hi>s wish, that her Brother had been more nobly descended, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95995:40"/>
plainly to be spoke out of a furious desire of enjoying him; we need make no doubt but that very wish too proceeds from the same desire.</hi>

               <hi>This is not the Thought of</hi> Ovid. <hi>Mr.</hi> Sands <hi>has touch'd upon it, but very faintly. Mr.</hi> Oldham <hi>has kept wide of it. But because no thought that can ever be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, can make amends for that of the Original, I think my self obliged to do</hi> Ovid <hi>that Iustice as to insert it here. The</hi> Latin <hi>is thus then.</hi>

               </q>
               <hi>That is to say,</hi> Either I will expel this incestuous Love from my Breast, or dye in the Attempt, and be laid out on the mournful Herse. <hi>One would have thought that there had been an end of her and her Passion, when by an admirable and surprizing return of it, she immediately adds,</hi> positae<expan>
                  <am>
                     <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  <ex>que</ex>
               </expan> det oscula Frater. Let my Brother embrace me as I lie sensless there. <hi>So that here she seems to make provision for her Passion, against a time when it can be no more, to anticipate the satisfaction of her Brothers embracing her in the moment in which she cannot be sensible of it, and, by imagination in the same sentence, to extend her Love beyond that death by which she propounds to end it. This is indeed lively to paint the extreme dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of a violent and irregular Passion. But what Hand must give us a Copy of so divine an Original? Who must not despair of imitating successfully the wonderful celerity of this incomparable turn?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that he makes</hi> Byblis <hi>start several difficulties enough to frighten her Brother, if he were inclin'd to compilance; and then exhorts him to go on in spight of them. Whereas the design of</hi> Ovid, <hi>is to make her answer such Objections as may probably be made by</hi> Caunus. <hi>The things that can chiefly be objected in such a case are two;</hi> viz, <hi>The Rigour of Parents, and Apprehension of Infamy. Now neither of these have reason to frighten us. For, says she,</hi> Dulcia fraterno sub nomine furta tegemus. <hi>That is, we shall conceal our incestuous Love under the disguise of fraternal Affection; and tho we appear never so fond to our Parents, and the rest of the World, they will be rather apt to extol our Piety, than to arraign our Incest. But this Verse,</hi> Dulcia, &amp;c. <hi>which</hi> Byblis <hi>speaks as a reason for what preceded it, looks in Mr.</hi> Oldham <hi>like the Introduction of a new Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</hi>

               </q>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Oldham <hi>has render'd it thus:</hi>

               </q>
               <hi>Which Mr.</hi> Oldham <hi>renders thus:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Should I desist, 'twill be believ'd that I,</l>
                  <l>By slightly asking, taught him to deny.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I wonder that a Man of Mr.</hi> Oldham'<hi>s Sense and Learning should mistake</hi> leviter voluisse <hi>for slightly ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By which mistake he has run himself upon two absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. For first he puts a sentiment into the mouth of</hi> Byblis, <hi>that is altogether base, and unworthy of a Woman of Honour, as if she were afraid of not being thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent enough, or of not being thought in good earnest. —Secondly, He makes her bring that as an argument for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in her design, which is directly conclusive of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For what she says, in Prose, and in plain</hi> English, <hi>is this:</hi> If I should now conquer this Passion, and grow once more the vertuous <hi>Byblis,</hi> I am afraid the World, who may come to know what a civil Request I made to my Brother, and afterwards took the very first Denial, I am afraid this ill-natur'd World will believe that I was but in jest. <hi>Truly a very pleasant and very reasonable Fear. But what does she call slightly ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? The sending such a Letter as hers? For my part I know but one way she had to put the business more home to him. This cannot be the sense of</hi> Ovid. <hi>For tho</hi> Ovid <hi>is not the justest Man in the World in his thinking, (for just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not his Talent) yet he seldom thinks so preposse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously. nor could Mr.</hi> Oldham <hi>have done it, if he had not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95995:42"/>
writ this in a hurry. By</hi> leviter voluisse <hi>then is meant not slightly to have asked, but lightly to have inclin'd my Will; and then the meaning has not only something very sensible in it, but very extraordinary and very noble. For thus</hi> Byblis <hi>is made to assert her Honour, by her very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in a most execrable Crime; for now the sense runs thus.</hi> If I should now upon this first Repulse give over, then Men will reasonably conclude, that since it was in my power so soon to desist, it was in my power not to have given way to this Passion at first; and that she who could so easily stop its progress, might much more easily have prevented its very beginning; and consequently the advances which I have made to my Brother, will be imputed rather to my natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to such horrible Wickedness, or some strange and base infirmity in me, than the force of a Passion inflicted by an offended God. But if after having shown so much Remorse, and so much Reluctancy, I still persist, notwithstanding that Remorse, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that Reluctancy, nay notwithstanding De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair; why then, my Brother, and all the World, must acknowledge that <hi>Byblis</hi> is not to blame; but that since she does what doing she disapproves, and solicites a Vice, the very thought of which strikes her with Horror, it is demonstrably evident that her Passion is supernatural; and is not actuated by her own Will, but some more sublime, some eternal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which Mortals in vain resist.</p>

                  <l>To Fair in Tumbril jogg'd together:</l>
                  <l>They were not thus to <hi>Smithfield</hi> jumbled,</l>

                  <l>No, story tells us that the Carter</l>
                  <l>Went with design all three to barter.</l>
                  <l>The Pig scream'd out, as he were just</l>
                  <l>By <hi>Talgol</hi> going to be trus'd,</l>
                  <l>Tore all their Ears and his own Throat;</l>

Two very quiet harmless wretches,</l>
                  <l>Astonish'd at <hi>Don Porker</hi>'s screiches;</l>
                  <l>Wonder'd from whence should come his fear,</l>
                  <l>For they perceiv'd no danger near.</l>
                  <l>Then says the Carter, what a Murrain</l>
                  <l>Ails thee? what makes thre keep this stir in</l>
                  <l>Such civil company as thou'rt in?</l>
                  <l>Do thy two Comrades make this din?</l>
                  <l>What a meek person is that Wether!</l>
                  <l>And how demure the Goat! has either</l>
                  <l>Open'd his mouth once? no I warrant</l>
                  <l>They are both wiser. They are errant</l>
                  <l>Dolts, says the Pig, both stark stone blind;</l>
                  <l>Could they but see, like me, the Wind,</l>
                  <l>Sheeps-head would set up such a larum,</l>
                  <l>As would, were twenty Wolves here, scare 'um:</l>
                  <l>And that grave Booby with the Beard,</l>
                  <l>Would further than my self be heard.</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Talgol</hi>'s wheeson scraping whittle</l>

They're lean, you'll say, and I'm mistaken:</l>
                  <l>But how shall I man save my Bacon?</l>
                  <l>Whom Wastcoateer has made a Fat Pig,</l>

                  <l>May the Jade choak with the first gobbet.</l>
                  <l>Thus did the Pig his point maintain</l>
                  <l>With subtile argument, but vain:</l>
                  <l>Nor griefs, nor fears, change fates decrees,</l>
                  <l>Then he's most wise who least foresees.</l>

                  <l>The present with a dauntless mind enjoy:</l>
                  <l>What wretched Fool would his own bliss destroy!</l>
                  <l>Who lives in apprehension urges Fate;</l>
                  <l>Too soon 'twill come, and he'll repent too late.</l>

Better to hope for what we most desire,</l>
                  <l>Than vainly into future ills inquire.</l>

                  <l>Who ne're inquires but when he can't refuse.</l>
                  <l>For as when Fate would undiscover'd lye,</l>
                  <l>What it designs no Mortal can descry;</l>
                  <l>So when it pleases to be understood,</l>
                  <l>Mankind cannot be ignorant if it wou'd.</l>
                  <l>Urg'd on by Destiny we headlong go,</l>
                  <l>Forc'd to seek that which most we fear to know.</l>
                  <l>But ah! how curst is he whom that decree,</l>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Have here sent you inclos'd, what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd you by the last Post, and I think my self oblig'd to give you some account of it. In the late Appendix to the new <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servator,</hi> I find the Author reasonably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the corruption of History by the <hi>French,</hi> and giving a very reasonable guess, how false the History of this Age (as far as it is writ by them) is like to come out in the next. And particularly what Mounsieur <hi>Pelisson</hi>'s History of the present King of <hi>France</hi> is like to be, which he is now writing by that King's own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Monsieur <hi>Boileau,</hi> who writ the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd, has at least as great a share in that History as Monsieur <hi>Pelisson:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have in the enclos'd, in the which he has very artfully inserted a Panegyrick
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95995:69"/>
of his Prince, a pattern of what his part of the History will be. For having flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his Master in this small Panegyrick, we have all the reason in the world to believe That he will flatter him too in his History. And that he has flatter'd him here, you will plainly find; not only by exaggerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are in some measure to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to an Orator; but in affirming things which are directly contrary to the truth. Such are those two remarkable passages of the French King's offering Peace to the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e Confederacy, for the general good of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi> (which not so much as a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who has common Sense, believes) and of his Bombarding <hi>Genoa,</hi> only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of its Insolency and of its Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which every man who has heard the Story of Mr. <hi>Valdryon,</hi> must laugh at. Now since it is to be presum'd, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Boileau</hi> will flatter him in his History, because it is plain that he has flatter'd him in his Panegyrick; What are we to expect from Monsieur <hi>Pelisson,</hi> whose sincerity is by no means so much talk'd of as the other's?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95995:70"/>
I thought to have concluded here: but it comes into my mind to make two reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Panegyrical part of the enclos'd. The first is this, that since Monsieur <hi>Boileau,</hi> who is in the main a man of sincerity, and a lover of truth; could not but flatter <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth when he commended him: we may conclude that it is impossible to give him a general commendation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery. For, where a Satyrick Poet paints what other man must not daub? The second Reflection is this, that since this Panegyrick is scarce to be supported, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the most admirable genius of the Author, which shines throughout it; and an art to which nothing can be added (remember that I speak of the Original) and beyond which nothing can be desir'd; you may easily conclude how extreamly fulsome the rest of the Panegyricks upon <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth must needs be, whose Authors fall infinitely short of <hi>Boileau</hi>'s, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Genius, or Art, or Virtue.</p>

               <p>THE Honour this day conferr'd upon me is some thing so great, so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so little expected; and so many several sorts of reasons ought to have for ever excluded me from it, that at this very moment in which I return my acknowledgements, I am doubtful if I ought to believe it. Is it then possible, can it be true, Gentlemen, that you have in effect judg'd me worthy to be admitted into this illustrious Society; whose famous Establishment does no less honour to the memory of Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> than all the rest of the numerous wonders of his matchless Ministry? And what must be the thoughts of that great man? What must be the thoughts of that wise Chancellour, who after him enjoy'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95995:71"/>
the Dignity of your Protectorship; and after whom it was your opinion, that none but your King had right to be your Protector? What must be their thoughts, Gentlemen, if they should behold me this day, becoming a part of this Glorious Body, the object of their eternal care and esteem; and into which by the Laws, which they have establish'd; by the Maxims which they have maintain'd, no one ought to be receiv'd, who is not of a spotless Merit, an extraordinary Wit, and comparable even to you? But farther, whom do I succeed in the place which you are pleas'd to afford me here? <note n="*" place="margin">Monsieur de Besons</note> Is it not a Man who is equally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> renown'd for his great Employments, and his profound Capacity? Is it not a Magistrate who fill'd one of the foremost Seats in the Council; and who in so many important Occasions has been Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by his Prince, with his strictest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: A Magistrate, no less Wise than Experienc'd, watchful, laborious; and with whom the more I compare my self, the less Proportion I find.</p>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:95995:71"/>
I know very well, Gentlemen (and who can be ignorant of it,) that in the choice which you make of men who are proper to supply the vacancies of your learned Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, you have no regard either to Place or to Dignity: That Politeness, Learning, and an acquaintance with all the more gentle Arts, have always usher'd in naked Merit to you, and that you do not believe it to be unbecoming of you, to substitute in the room of the highest Magistrate, of the most exalted Minister, some famous Poet, or some Writer, whom his Works have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Illustrious; and who has very often no other. Dignity, than that which his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert has given him upon <hi>Parnassus,</hi> But if you barely consider me as a man of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what can I offer you that may be worthy of the favour, with which you have been pleas'd to honour me? Is it a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Collection of Poetry, successful rather by a happy temerity and a dexterous imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Ancients, than by the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its thoughts, or the richness of its expressions? Is it a translation that falls so
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95995:72"/>
far short of the great Master-pieces with which you every day supply us; and in the which you so gloriously revive; <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydidis, Xonophon, Taoitus,</hi> and all the rest of the renown'd Heroes of the most learn'd Antiquity? No, Gentlemen, you are too well acquainted with the just value of things, to recompence at a rate so high, such low Productions as mine, and to offer me voluntarily upon so slight a foundation, an Honour, which the knowledge of my want of Merit, has discouragid me still from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</p>
               <p>What can be the reason then, which in my behalf has so happily influenc'd you upon this occasion? I begin to make some discovery of it, and I dare engage that I shall not make you blush in exposing it. The goodness which the greatest Prince in the World has shown in employing me, together with one of the first of your illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Writers, to make one Collection of the infinite number of his Immortal Actions; the permission which he has given me to do this, has supply'd all my defects with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95995:72"/>
Yes, Gentlemen, what ever just reasons ought to have excluded me for ever from your Academy; you believed that you could not with justice suffer, that a man who is destin'd to speak of such mighty things, should be depriv'd of the utility of your Lessons, or instructed in any other School than in yours. And by this, you have clearly shown, that when it is to serve your August Protector; whatever consideration might otherwise restrain you, your Zeal will not suffer you to cast your eyes upon any thing but the interest of your Master's Glory.</p>
               <p>Yet suffer me, Gentlemen, to undeceive you, if you believe that that great Prince, at the time when he granted that favour to me, believ'd that he should meet within me a Writer, who was able to sustain in the least, by the Beauty of Style, or by the magnificent Pomp of Expression, the Grandeur of his Exploits. No, Gentlemen, it belongs to you, and to Pens like yours, to shew the World such Master-pieces; and he never conceiv'd so advantageous a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95995:73"/>
thought of me. But as every thing that he has done in his Reign is Wonderful, is Prodigious, he did not think it would be amiss that in the midst of so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd Writers, who with emulation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe his Actions in all their Splendour, and with all the Ornaments of the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest Eloquence; a man without artifice, and accus'd rather of too much sincerity than of flattery, should contribute by his labour and by his advice, to set to show in a proper light, and in all the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the most natural Style; the truth of those Actions, which being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so little probable, have rather need to be faithfully related, than to be strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exaggerated.</p>
               <p>And indeed, Gentlemen, when Poets and Orators, and Historians who are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as daring as Poets or Orators, shall come to display upon so happy a Subject, all the bold strokes of their Art, all their force of Expression; when they shall say of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, more justly than was said of a famous Captain of old, that he

alone has atchiev'd more Exploit sthan other Princes have read; that he alone has taken more Towns, than other Monarchs have wish'd to take: When they shall assure us, that there is no Potentate upon the face of the Earth, no not the most Ambitious, who in the secret prayers that he puts up to Heaven, dares presume to Petition for so much Glory, for so much Prosperity as Heaven has freely grated this Prince: When they shall write that his Conduct is Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of Events; That Fortune dares not contradict his designs: When they shall paint him at the Head of his Armies, marching with Gigantick Strides, over great Rivers and highest Mountains; thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ring down Ramparts, rending hard Rocks, and tearing into ten thousand pieces every thing that resists his impetuous Shock: These expressions will doubtless appear great, rich, noble, adapted to the lofty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but at the same time that the World shall wonder at them, it will not think it self oblig'd to believe them, and the Truth may be easily disown'd or mistaken,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95995:74"/>
under the disguise of it pompous orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>But, when Writers without artifice, and who are contented faithfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late things; and with all the simplicity of Witnesses who depose, rather than of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians, who make a Narration, shall rightly set forth, all that has pass'd in <hi>France,</hi> ever since the famous Peace of the <hi>Pyrences;</hi> all that the King has done in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to re-establish Order, Discipline, Law: when they shall reckon up all the Provinces which he has added to his Kingdoms in succeeding Wars, all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, all the Victories which he has gain'd of his Enemies; <hi>Holland, Germany, Spain;</hi> all <hi>Europe</hi> too feeble all against him alone, a War that has been always fruitful in prosperity, and a more glorious Peace. When Pens that are sincere, I say, and a great deal more careful to write the Truth, than to make others admire them, shall rightly articulate all these Actions, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in their order of time, and attended with their real circumstances; who is it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95995:74"/>
that can then dissent from them, I do not say of our Neighbours, I do not say of our Allies; I say of our mortal Enemies? And tho' they shou'd be unwilling to acknowledge the truth of them, will not their dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd Forces, their States confin'd within stricter Bounds, their complaints, their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, their furies, their very invectives in spight of themselves convince them? Can they deny that in the very year in which I am speaking, this Prince being resolv'd to constrain them all to accept of a Peace which he had offer'd them for the good of Christendom; did all at once, and that at a time, when they had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd that he was intirely exhausted of Men and Money: that he did then, I say, all at once in the Low Countries, cause to start up as twere out of the ground two mighty Armies, each of them consisting of Forty Thousand Men; and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them abundant subsistance there, notwithstanding the scarcity of Forrage, and the excessive drought of the Season? Can they deny that whilst with one of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95995:75"/>
these Armies, he caus'd his Lieutenants to Besiege <hi>Luxembourgh,</hi> himself with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, keeping as it were block'd all the Towns of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Hainault;</hi> That he did by this most admirable Conduct, or rather by a kind of Enchantment, like that of the Head so renown'd in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Fables, whose aspect transform'd the beholders to Stones; render the <hi>Spaniards</hi> unmov'd spectators of the taking of that important place, in the which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd their utmost refuge. That by a no less admirable effect of the same prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enchantment, that obstinate Enemy to his Glory, that industrious contriver of Wars and Confederacies, who had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd so long to stir up all <hi>Europe</hi> against him, found himself, if I may use the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, disabled and impotent, tyed up on every side, and reduc'd to the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vengeance of dispersing Libels; of sending forth Cries and Reproaches. Our very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, give me leave to repeat it, can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all this? Must not they confess that at the time when these wonders were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95995:75"/>
in the Low Countries, our Fleet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Mediteranean,</hi> after having forc'd <hi>Algiers</hi> to be a Suppliant for Peace; Caus'd <hi>Genoa</hi> to feel, by an example that will be eternally dreadful, the just chastisement of its Insolence and of its Persidiousness; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying under the ruines of Palaces and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Houses that proud City, more easie to be Destroy'd than be Humbled? No, without doubt, our Enemies dare not give the lye to such known truths, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they shall see them writ with that simple and natural Air, &amp; with that character of sincerity and probability, with which whate're my defects are, I do not absolutely despair to be able at least in part to supply the History.</p>
               <p>But since this very simplicity, all enemy as it is to Ostentation and Pageantry, has yet its Art, its Method, its Beauties; from whence can I better derive that Art, and those Beauties, than from the source of all delicacies, this fam'd Academy, which has kept possession, for so many years, of all the Treasures, of all the Riches, of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95995:76"/>
our Tongue? These, Gentlemen, are the things which I am in hopes to find among you, this is what I come to study with you; this is what I come to learn of you. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if by my assiduity in frequenting you, by my address in bringing you to speak of these matters, I can engage you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal nothing of all your most secret skill, from me. Your skill to render Nature decent and chast at the very time when she is most Alluring; and to make the Colours and Paint of Art, appear to be the genuine Beauties of Nature. Thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py! if by my respects and by my sincere submissions, I can perfectly convince you of the extream acknowledgement, which I shall make all my life time for the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Honour you have done me.</p>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Renard</hi> the wind of him had got,</l>

                  <l>Thus he accosts him, Noble Sir,</l>
                  <l>You do, or may I never stir,</l>
                  <l>Excell each two and four Legg'd Creature,</l>

                  <l>And sure to such a Shape as thine,</l>
                  <l>The Gods have giv'n a voice Divine.</l>
                  <l>Oh! could I hear that charming voice,</l>
                  <l>How should I, Noble Sir, Rejoyce.</l>
                  <l>Thus like the Dog, that's sly and pickled,</l>
                  <l>Renard the Crow cajol'd and tickled.</l>
                  <l>Behold the issue, whilst the Crow,</l>

                  <l>The Crow, tho late, with shame and trouble,</l>

                  <l>GRoss Flattery only can by Fools be born:</l>

                  <l>Now tho self-love as vain by praise is won,</l>

                  <l>They love the bait, and can't suspect the Hook.</l>
                  <l>Renard knew whom he prais'd, when he made choice,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>ISgrim had all the Winter far'd</l>
                  <l>So very ill, his looks Men scar'd.</l>
                  <l>He had (poor Dog!) got an evil habit,</l>
                  <l>Of going to Bed with the Devil a bit;</l>
                  <l>So that he had contracted a meen,</l>
                  <l>Which truly represented Famine.</l>
                  <l>A filthy Figure, rude and gruff,</l>
                  <l>As hungry Bullies who lye rough.</l>
                  <l>Whilst free from Pinching and from Danger,</l>
                  <l>The Cattle lay at Rack and Manger.</l>
                  <l>When Winter quarters they forsook,</l>
                  <l>And to Encamp, the Field they took;</l>
                  <l>Hight Isgrim spy'd a sleek plump Steed,</l>
                  <l>Who with that appetite did feed,</l>
                  <l>One would have sworn, that his fresh Sallad</l>
                  <l>Was not distastful to his Palate.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:95995:78"/>
At sight of Steed that's one huge bit of Fat,</l>
                  <l>Hight Isgrim's heart for joy went pit a pat.</l>
                  <l>Ah Rogue! have I found thee? how happy</l>
                  <l>Would Isgrim be, if he could but nab thee?</l>
                  <l>But I had rather now by half,</l>
                  <l>Thou wert a Mutton or a Calf.</l>
                  <l>Then could I truss thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up as readily,</l>
                  <l>As I could after eat thee greedily.</l>
                  <l>But thou art such a damn'd great Beast,</l>
                  <l>That I must plot before I feast.</l>
                  <l>Come let us plot then, pray why not?</l>
                  <l>Sure duller Dogs than I can plot.</l>
                  <l>Then Isgrim puts on Phyz of Gravity,</l>
                  <l>Phyz, that agrees with deeds of pravity;</l>
                  <l>As does with Satan Phyz of Hag.</l>
                  <l>Then Isgrim thus accosts the Nag:</l>

                  <l>I speak to your Worship in this fashion,</l>
                  <l>Because I've of your Case compassion.</l>

                  <l>Thus foully like your Worship feed,</l>
                  <l>Betokens great indisposition,</l>
                  <l>And calls for a severe Physician.</l>

                  <l>Will gratis cure your Worship's ailing.</l>
                  <l>Palfrey gave Isgrim such a cross leer,</l>
                  <l>As Horse at's Oats does roguish Ostler.</l>

                  <l>With roguish treacherous intention,</l>
                  <l>Wisely thought fit to use prevention:</l>

                  <l>The Villain with a smiling Face,</l>

Isgrim might have been quick enouff,</l>
                  <l>To have escap'd the Steed's Rebuff:</l>
                  <l>If the grave Doctor had not been</l>
                  <l>Too careful to maintain his meen;</l>
                  <l>And too much taken up to heed</l>
                  <l>The motion or design of Steed.</l>
                  <l>For all who with dissembled meen,</l>
                  <l>Fain what they are, not would be seen;</l>
                  <l>Possessing but the Forms alone,</l>
                  <l>And not the Powers of Gifts they own;</l>
                  <l>Have for that reason Forms affected;</l>
                  <l>The more, to pass the less suspcted.</l>
                  <l>(And therefore Hypocritick Wight</l>

                  <l>And when their thick and gross disguise</l>
                  <l>Has serv'd to hoodwink their own Eyes:</l>
                  <l>Like Children when themselves they blind,</l>
                  <l>They' have thought no others could them find.</l>

As is apparent by our Fable:</l>
                  <l>For Isgrim neither Learn'd nor able,</l>
                  <l>Imagin'd he might fine for Sense,</l>
                  <l>Out of his stock of Impudence,</l>
                  <l>And positive grave Impertinence.</l>
                  <l>And thought t'enjoy a Bliss that's double,</l>
                  <l>The priviledge on't, without the trouble.</l>
                  <l>But he o'reacted so his part,</l>
                  <l>That he got nothing by't, but smart.</l>
                  <l>Which shew'd him a confounded Sott,</l>
                  <l>When he imagin'd he could Plot;</l>
                  <l>Because he could a Mutton fegue:</l>
                  <l>They're Brains, not Teeth that serve t'intregue.</l>
                  <l>And there's requir'd much more skill in,</l>
                  <l>A speculative than practick Villain.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Beware by him, and meddle not,</l>

               <head>Some Moral Reflections concerning Vanity, Written upon the occasion of Burlesquing the Fable of the <hi>Ass</hi> and the <hi>Lyon.</hi>
               </head>
               <lg>
                  <l>THO vanity in all we do not see,</l>
                  <l>Yet a Vice 'tis from which no mortal's free.</l>
                  <l>For Heaven with soveraign Wisdom did ordain,</l>
                  <l>The thing it made so wretched, should be vain.</l>
                  <l>The happiest has of misery such a share,</l>
                  <l>As without Vanity he could not bear.</l>
                  <l>But that into content our minds can cheat,</l>
                  <l>Pleas'd to be wretched, whilst they dream they're great.</l>
                  <l>Virtue to that, and Learning too we owe,</l>
                  <l>For from our Pride our goodliest actions flow,</l>
                  <l>And all that curious searching minds can know.</l>
                  <l>For when we watch the live-long night to pore,</l>
                  <l>And tedious Volumes are content t' explore:</l>
                  <l>

Tis not to know our duty and do well,</l>
                  <l>Tis with aspiring thoughts and hope to excell.</l>
                  <l>By Vanity we know our selves; who'd dare</l>
                  <l>To look within, if Vanity were not there?</l>
                  <l>For all the rest so gloomy is and sad,</l>
                  <l>The ghastly fight would make the wisest mad.</l>
                  <l>But Vanity makes gay the ghastly sight,</l>
                  <l>(As <hi>Cynthia</hi> guilds the dusky face of Night,)</l>
                  <l>By its false light, a man his faults o'resees,</l>
                  <l>Or it such Colours gives them that they please.</l>
                  <l>Since we're oblig'd to't then, and to't ally'd,</l>
                  <l>Why do we hate it still, and still deride?</l>
                  <l>Indeed we hate it, when 'tis seen abroad;</l>
                  <l>At home 'tis constantly caress'd and claw'd,</l>
                  <l>The Vanity which is by others shown,</l>
                  <l>We therefore hate, because it shocks our own,</l>
                  <l>We would be upper-most, which they who boast</l>
                  <l>Seem not t' allow; themselves esteeming most.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:95995:91"/>
To Sift them then, we're angrily inclin'd</l>
                  <l>To weigh their Virtues, and their faults to find:</l>
                  <l>Whilst all our Pride grows furious in our mind,</l>
                  <l>Which till their faults are shown, is ne're appeas'd;</l>
                  <l>But fancying we're above them then, we're eas'd.</l>
                  <l>Therefore the Wise, who would their Faults conceal,</l>
                  <l>Never themselves their Merit will reveal.</l>
                  <l>Praise, tho their due, they never care to claim,</l>
                  <l>But by their Modesty advance their Fame.</l>
                  <l>Praise claim'd our vanity will not pay, they know,</l>
                  <l>Which of it self profusely 'twill bestow.</l>
                  <l>For when we celebrate anothers praise,</l>
                  <l>'Tis not his Glory, but our own to raise,</l>
                  <l>Provok'd and push'd t't by an itching lust,</l>
                  <l>To show how Sensible and Just.</l>
                  <l>Great Wits extreamly vain are sometimes found;</l>
                  <l>They with fermenting Choler much abound:</l>
                  <l>Thransported by whose rage they can't controul</l>

                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:95995:91"/>
For they must own, who most admire great Wits,</l>
                  <l>Tho still ingenious, they're but wise by fits.</l>
                  <l>Ev'n them when vain, as Fools, we must despise;</l>
                  <l>As we count Fools, as far as modest, wise.</l>
                  <l>But Fools nere modest are but by Complexion,</l>
                  <l>They're vain and noisie Rogues still by Election;</l>
                  <l>For modesty by choice implies profound reflection.</l>
                  <l>Nature, who acts by admirable rules;</l>
                  <l>Wisdom with vanity supplies in Fools.</l>
                  <l>As she the Wise, (who mad with pride would grow,</l>
                  <l>Could they know others and themselves not know.)</l>

                  <l>Those Fools, who if they could their inside spy,</l>
                  <l>At the sad view, would strait despair and dye;</l>
                  <l>Those she to make them drag dull Life can cheat,</l>

As empty Bodies most are puff'd with wind;</l>
                  <l>So vanity most swells an empty Mind.</l>
                  <l>From a Fools inside breaks with filthy sound,</l>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Do not question but that you have for this month expected a Letter from me, and that perhaps with a little impatience: Since this is a time which may afford va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of News, of which who must not be now desirous? But all the time I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> I had so much Sickness, that that might well supersede any obligation I lay under. For let a promise be never so bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never so much a Debt; who could take care of paying so trifling a one, when a most severe and importunate Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, Nature, was calling for hers. Nor now when at length that excuse is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, are you like to receive such a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as perhaps might be most welcome to you in this Conjuncture. For if I should send you the truth in disguise, perhaps you might not discover her. And is this a time to expose her naked to the World:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95995:105"/>
When her nakedness which is only the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of her Innocence, by many would be mistaken for Lewdness, and by more for Barbarity. I will then say nothing of the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> nor ours, tho I could find much to say of them both. For I now converse with a People who are as full of Talk as they are Inquisitive. But since I am taking my leave of that People, I will confine my Discourse to them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin, I will use plain dealing with you, (a thing which they never did yet with any one) and tell you that I mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate them. Yet neither shall my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nor acquir'd Antipathy suborn me to say any thing false of them. I will do like a Painter, who will draw the true resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Face that is most provoking. But then I must give you this Caution, that what I have to say, tho it be true in some measure of all of them; yet it is chiefly to be consin'd to the middle sort of the Nation. For besides that I have most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with them, as a Stranger must of necessity be suppos'd to do, the Genius
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95995:105"/>
of a Nation most plainly appears in the middle sort of its People. For great Education, which attends high Birth, or high Fortune, very often improves or corrupts or sophisticates Nature, whilst in those of the middle State she remains unmixed and unalter'd. These then I have found in the first place excessively vain. Every Man is here a <hi>Narcissus,</hi> and in the flattering glass of his own false imagination is eternally gazing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, or at least upon what he takes for himself. For in this their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are different, for as that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Boy took himself for another, these merry Fools take something else for themselves. For nothing in Nature is more unlike than the Picture which a <hi>Frenchman</hi> draws of himself. It would be needless to insist longer on this. For they have so long made sport for their neighbouring Nations, by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and absurd commendations of their own, that to endeavour to bring proofs of their Vanity, would be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95995:106"/>
more ridiculous than that. Now this is certain, that he who abounds in Vanity can want no affectation. For affectation is nothing but a fruitless at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to counterfeit and falsisie Nature, when a Man impotently endeavours to appear what he really is not, or what he is incapable of being. Nature grows impatient, and struggles to be freed from the constraint that is put upon her, and in the strife there appear'd something so odious that all who are lovers of her, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hate that person who endeavours so rudely to force her. Now Nature in man is various. She is Gay in one, and Froward in another: She is Delicate in a third, in a fourth she is Gross; and there is not a Man in a Million whom Heaven made fit for all things: yet how many are there, alas! who by senseless Self-love intoxicated, believe themselves fit for all things, and will be offering at all things. Now such have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and will be always affected. And such are the people with whom I have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95995:106"/>
lately convers'd; and I have more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly remark'd in some of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Gentlemen, that in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to shew their admiration mingled with a gentle Passion, they are guilty of affectations so monstrous, that an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Fop</hi> is not capable of them. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary effect of their vanity is their assurance, or in our Language, their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence. For modesty is nothing but the fear of displeasing, when a man believes or at least, suspects that he is defective; and it naturally includes in it a mistrust of our selves, and an esteem of others; which is the reason that renders it love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all, when ever it is joyn'd with good qualities. For it flatters and sooths our Self-love, of which no Man can wholly divest himself; by assuring us that we are esteem'd and preferr'd. Now how can any one have this fear of displeasing, who imagines himself all Perfection, and who swell'd with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95995:107"/>
venom of Pride, like the Toad in the Fable, believes himself greater than those with whose greatness he holds not the least proportion. The <hi>French</hi> then are affected and impudent, which are but the necessary effects of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Vice, their Vanity. But then have they one very good quality, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the same vanity. And that is their extraordinary civility to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For they are civil to us, not for our satisfaction, but their own; not as they imagine it a duty, but an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment. 'Tis to please himself that a <hi>Frenchman</hi> is officious to me, and 'tis to honour himself that he bows to others. I am pretty confident that I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiy'd here. For I have found by some observation, and some thinking, That there is little good Nature amongst them, For they will deceive or betray you at the very same time they oblige you. Thus have I giv'n you an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect account of such of their qualities,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95995:107"/>
as are most conspicuous in them. There are some which lye more hidden. But I have said enough to tire my Self and You.</p>

               <p>I Have here sent you a Journal of my Journey from <hi>Lyons</hi> hither, in which you will find that account of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which you so earnestly desired of me, before I came out of <hi>England.</hi> I have taken no notice of the Towns in <hi>Savoy;</hi> nor so much as the Rock of <hi>Montmelian,</hi> but have confin'd my self to a Subject which you seem'd to affect so much.</p>
               <p>On the nineteenth of <hi>October,</hi> we set out from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and came that night to <hi>Venpellier,</hi> thro a fair Plain, which was sometimes Arable, and sometimes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and bounded with Rows of Hills at that just distance, as gave tho not a large, an agreeable Prospect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 20. We came by Noon thro the same Plain, which grew to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Marsh to a Bourg, call'd <hi>Tour Du Pin.</hi> From thence, after Dinner, we continued our way, thro whole
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95995:108"/>
Groves of Walnut and Chestnut. Trees to <hi>Pont Beauvoisin,</hi> being the Bridge that separates <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. We entred into <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Morning, and past over Mount <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guebellette.</hi> The ascent was the more easie, because it wound about the Mountain. But as soon as we had conquer'd one half of it, the unusual heighth in which we found our selves, the impending Rock that hung over us, the dreadful Depth of the Precipice, and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that roar'd at the bottom, gave us such a view as was altogether new and amazing. On the other side of that Torrent, was a Mountain that equall'd ours, about the distance of thirty Yards from us. Its craggy Clifts, which we half discern'd, thro the misty gloom of the Clouds that surrounded them, sometimes gave us a horrid Prospect. And sometimes its face appear'd Smooth and Beautiful as the most even and fruitful Vallies. So different from themselves were the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of it: In the very same place
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95995:109"/>
Nature was seen Severe and Wanton. In the mean time we walk'd upon the very brink, in a litteral sense, of Destruction; one Stumble, and both Life and Carcass had been at once destroy'd. The sense of all this produc'd different motions in me, <hi>viz.</hi> a delightful Horrour, a terrible Joy, and at the same time, that I was infinitely, pleas'd I trembled.</p>
               <p>From thence we went thro a pleasant Valley bounded with Mountains, whose high but yet verdant Tops seem'd at once to forbid and invite Men. After we had march'd for a League thro the Plain, we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at the place which they call <hi>La Cave;</hi> where the late Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Year Seventy, struck out a Passage thro a rocky Mountain that had always before been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible: Performing that by the force of Gun-powder, which Thunder-bolts or Earthquakes could scarce have effected. This Passage is a quarter of an English Mile, made with incredible labour, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of four Millions of Livers. At the Entrance into it is the following pompous Inscription.

There craggy Rocks look'd hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid to the Eye, and Hills appeard on every side of so stupendous an heighth, that the Company was divided at a distance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they should believe them to be sunny Clouds, or the Snowy tops of Mountains. Here appear'd a Hill with its top quite hid in black Clouds, and beyond that Hill, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove those Clouds some higher Mountain show'd its hoary Head. With this strange entertainment by the way, we came that Night to <hi>Montmelian.</hi>

On the 22. we set forward in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Mountains appear'd to grow still more Lofty. We din'd that day at <hi>Aigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle.</hi> In the Afternoon we proceeded on our way, sometimes thro the Plain, and sometimes on the side of the <hi>Alps;</hi> with which we were hemm'd in on all sides. We then began that day to have the additional diversion, of a Torrent that ran sometimes with fury beneath us, and of the noise of the Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades, or the down fall of Waters, which sometimes came tumbling a main from the Precipices. We lay that night at <hi>La Chambre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 23. The morning was very cold, which made us have dismal apprehensions of Mount <hi>Cenis,</hi> since we felt its influence so severely at so great a distance. We arriv'd by Noon at St. <hi>Michel.</hi> In the Afternoon we continued our Journey mostly upon the sides of the Mountains, which were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all cover'd with Pines, and sometimes cultivated, ev'n in places where one would swear the thing were impossible, for they were only not perpendicular. We lay that Night at <hi>Modanen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:95995:110"/>
                  <hi>Oct. 24. Modane</hi> is within a dozen Miles of Mount <hi>Cenis,</hi> and therefore the next morning we felt the Cold more severely. We went to Dinner at <hi>Laneburgh,</hi> situate at the foot of Mount <hi>Cenis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As soon as we had din'd, we sent our Horses about, and getting up upon Mules began to ascend the Mountain. I could not forbear looking back now and then to contemplate the Town and the Vale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath me. When I was arriv'd within a hundred Yards of the Top, I could still discern <hi>Laneburgh</hi> at the Bottom, distant Three tedious Miles from me. What an amazing distance? Think what an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion a place must make upon you, which you should see as far under you as 'tis from your House to <hi>Hampstead.</hi> And here I wish I had force to do right to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd Passage of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> 'Tis an easie thing to describe <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Naples</hi> to you, because you have seen something your self that holds at least some resemblance with them; but impossible to set a Mountain before your eyes, that is inaccessible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95995:111"/>
to the slght, and wearies the very Eye to Climb it. For when I tell you that we were arriv'd within a hundred yards of the Top: I mean only the Plain, thro which we afterwards pass'd, but there is another vast Mountain still upon that. If these Hills were first made with the World, as has been a long time thought, and Nature design'd them only as a Mound to inclose her Garden <hi>Italy:</hi> Then we may well say of her what some affirm of great Wits, that her, careless irregular and boldest Strokes are most admirable. For the <hi>Alpes</hi> are works which she seems to have design'd, and executed too in Fury. Yet she moves us less, where she studies to please us more. I am delighted, 'tis true at the prospect of Hills and Valleys, of flowry Meads, and murmuring Streams, yet it is a delight that is consistent with Reason, a delight that creates or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves Meditation. But transporting Pleasures follow'd the sight of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and what unusual transports think you were those, that were mingled with horrours,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95995:111"/>
and sometimes almost with despair? But if these Mountains were not a Creation, but form'd by universal Destruction, when the Arch with a mighty flaw dissolv'd and fell into the vast Abyss (which surely is the best opinion) then are these Ruines of the old World the greatest wonders of the New. For they are not only vast, but horrid, hideous, ghastly Ruins. After we had gallop'd a League over the Plain, and came at last to descend, to descend thro the very Bowels as it were of the Mountain, for we seem'd to be enclos'd on all sides: What an astonishing Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect was there? Ruins upon Ruins in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Heaps, and Heaven and Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. The uncouth Rocks that were above us, Rocks that were void of all form, but what they had receiv'd from Ruine; the frightful view of the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, and the foaming Waters that threw themselves headlong down them, made all such a Consort up for the Eye, as that sort of Musick does for the Ear, in which Horrour can be joyn'd with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.

I am afraid you will think that I have said too much. Yet if you had but seen what I have done, you would surely think that I have said too little. However Hyperboles might easily here be forgiven. The <hi>Alpes</hi> appear to be Nature's extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, and who should blush to be guilty of Extravagancies, in words that make mention of her's. But 'tis time to proceed. We descended in Chairs, the descent was four English Miles. We past thro <hi>Novalese,</hi> situate at the Foot of Mount <hi>Cenis</hi> on the side of <hi>Italy,</hi> and lay that Night at <hi>Suse.</hi> We din'd the next day at <hi>Villane,</hi> and thro a pleasant Valley came that Night to this place.</p>

               <p>TO perform the promise which I made you in my last, I venture to say something of the Ancient and Modern <hi>Italians,</hi> tho you do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that when you made that request to me, you put me upon a necessity of disobliging my Friend by a refusal, or exposing my self by treating of a Subject for which I am wholly unqualified. It is true, when I was at <hi>Lyons</hi> in compliance with your desire, I ventur'd to say something of the <hi>French.</hi> But besides that I had been longer in <hi>France</hi> than I have in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> lye so open, that a Man who will observe them, may as well venture to give their Character in a Months time, as he may in several years. For they who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessivly vain, take as much pains to show them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as a Stroler at a Fair does a Monster. 'Tis the constant business of their Lives to paint out their Virtues to you; nay, and their Defects which their Vanity mistakes for their Virtues. But the <hi>Italians</hi> are as reserv'd to Strangers as the <hi>French</hi> are open: and one would wonder how they who show much Flegm before they are very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, should be able afterwards, in so strange a manner, to animate Conversation. But to come to my business, 'tis wonderful you say, that the Modern <hi>Italians</hi> should appear so different from the Ancient, since they breath the same Air, and are nourish'd by the same Soil. For since the affinity
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95995:113"/>
is so near betwixt the Soul and the Body, and they work so strongly upon each other, you say it is but reasonable to believe that the Climate which helps to give the Body its Complexion, should help to give the Mind its Temper. Now since you have reason, you say, to suppose that the Climate of <hi>Italy</hi> is very near the same at this day, that it was two Thousand Years agoe, you cannot but wonder that the Modern <hi>Italians</hi> should appear so different from the Ancient. The <hi>French</hi> are the very same now that <hi>Caesar</hi> described them formerly, excepting that they are grown a more polish'd sort of Barbarians. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were fam'd for their Cruelty &amp; their Perfidiousness; and those two Vices are at present, inseparable from the Inhabitants of the Coasts of <hi>Barbary.</hi> But the <hi>Italians,</hi> you say, are at present renown'd for several extraordinary Vices, which were utterly unknown to the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> to whose Virtues the Modern are utterly Strangers.</p>
               <p>In answer to this, give me leave to tell you that you are mistaken in part of your Assertion. For the Vices which are to be found at this day in <hi>Italy,</hi> were the Vices of the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> Their Empire ow'd its Rise to the same Crimes which dissolv'd it, and there were proportionably as many Villains in the <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Romulus,</hi> as there are in that of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh. Consider the Factions of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> and the two Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats following, and you will find infinitely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of black Revenge than you can amongst Modern <hi>Italians.</hi> What can be more bloody than
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95995:113"/>
those times? Or more treacherous and base than those of <hi>Tiberius?</hi> 'Tis true from the time of the first Consuls, to the end of the <hi>Punick War,</hi> there flourish'd a continual Race of Heroes, with whom if you compare the Modern <hi>Italians,</hi> they seem to be Men of quite different frames, and Inhabitants of a different part of the World. A capacity to practise those glittering Virtues which the World so much admires, depends very much upon force of mind, which depends in some sort on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as that does in some sort on the Climate. But then is it certain that there is the very same force of mind requir'd to be prodigiously wicked, that is required to be heroically Virtuous. Weak people are but wicked by halves, but whenever we hear of high and enormous Crimes, we may conclude, that they proceed from a power of Soul and a reach of Thought, which are altogether extraordinary. So that the Modern <hi>Italians,</hi> who by your own confession are skill'd in all the ways of exquisite wickedness, come into the World with as much natural capacity to exert he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Virtue, as ever the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Force of Mind makes a Man capable of great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or of great Vices; but it determines him to neither. Education, Discipline and Accidents of Life constitute him either a great Philosopher, or an illustrious Libertine.</p>
               <p>As strongest bodies cannot be secure from Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in pestilential Seasons, so Minds that have most force are apt to be tainted by the Contagion of Epidemick Vices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:95995:114"/>
The two most glittering Virtues that shin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> were greatness of Mind and heroick Fortitude: 'Twas that greatness of Mind that made one of their Generals reject with disdain, the offer that was made him to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the most formidable Enemy to their State: whereas the modern <hi>Italians</hi> have at every turn recourse to Stilletto and Poyson, which are almost their only offensive Weapons.</p>
               <p>Do but compare the happy and flourishing state of the old Commonwealth, with the wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the modern <hi>Italians,</hi> and you will soon find the reason why the <hi>Romans</hi> were Brave and Honourable Enemies; and why the <hi>Italians</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent are base ones. For this is most certain, That no Man can basely offer violence to another without doing some to himself. From whence it follows that no Man will do it, unless in some measure he believes it necessary. No Man then will take a base revenge of another who believes that he can take an honourable one. No Man will ever have recourse to Treachery who is confident of prevailing by open force. Now great success most commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses great Thoughts, and inspires a noble Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which renders Men Brave and Magnanimous: whereas we frequently see that Men with their Fortunes and Liberties lose their very Spirits and Souls, according to the observation of the Comick Poet. <hi>Ut res nostrae sint, ita nos magni atque humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les sumus.</hi>
