            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have received your Letter, and with as much
<hi>care</hi> as you deſired, I have peruſed it; and
for your <hi>advice</hi> I returne my thanks to your
<hi>error,</hi> not your <hi>love:</hi> beleeving from that
<hi>Spring</hi> all your lines have been derived, and
that like People infected with the <hi>Plague,</hi>
your deſires have ſtill been to corrupt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
miſtake me not neither: I blame
not your <hi>Endeavours,</hi> in gaining all you
can to your Party, ſince it is <hi>multitude,</hi> not the <hi>juſtice</hi> of your cauſe
that muſt nurſe up that <hi>Birth,</hi> your <hi>Deceit</hi> hath begot upon the
<hi>Feares</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Routs</hi> (the
<hi>pillars</hi> of your new <hi>Modell)</hi> might the better be faſhioned, into
what formes were moſt convenient for your deſignes, it was
extreamly neceſſary, you ſhould take from them all the <hi>rules</hi> and
<hi>ſquares</hi> both of <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Government;</hi> and that you
have moſt fully and amply done, by a new way of pulling downe
the old <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſetting up of <hi>many,</hi> nay, <hi>any</hi> that might
ſerve either your <hi>ambition</hi> or your <hi>gaine:</hi> and like <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in
your new Government, when it could not be ſafe for you to <hi>erect
another,</hi> you <hi>adulterate</hi> the <hi>old;</hi> Certainly, if you ſeriouſly reflect, if
you review this act of <hi>corrupting Religion,</hi> with a recollected judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you cannot but find, that you have cleane miſtaken the way
you <hi>pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> though not that which you <hi>intend;</hi> for whoever yet
would ſo much Caſhiere his <hi>reaſon</hi> in things of the ſmalleſt moment,
as to leave a certain poſitive good, for an uncertaine accidentall one?
take heed; the ſame miſtake coſt the ſeduced <hi>Prophet</hi> his life: and if
you take the <hi>Maxime</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire,</hi> that the ſame <hi>caſes</hi> are
to be judged by the ſame <hi>reaſons,</hi> you have cauſe to feare, it may in
time prove your owne.</p>
            <p>But admit this <hi>Forme,</hi> this new <hi>Directory</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95496:3"/>
as pure as you would have the People beleeve it, or your ſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, and that ours were as great an abomination, as the <hi>forſaken
Tribes Idolatry</hi> was to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet give me leave to tell you, and from
Scripture, (from whence you ſay you borrow all your directions)
that from thence you are ſo farre from drawing any argument, that
can give you authority to <hi>plant</hi> your Religion by the <hi>Sword,</hi> that you
can hardly find any will allow the <hi>defence</hi> of it by Armes: Surely,
when I conſider theſe things, you muſt give me leave to beleeve,
you are much a <hi>Kinne</hi> to thoſe that followed our <hi>Saviour</hi> for the
<hi>loafes,</hi> and the relieving their neceſſities, rather then the <hi>love</hi> of
his <hi>Gospell,</hi> and like <hi>Demetrius's Crue,</hi> ſerve the <hi>Goddeſſe</hi> of your
owne ſetting up, becauſe it brings much gaine, much wealth to
your Cofers.</p>
            <p>And now that in ſilence I paſſe over the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of <hi>Biſhops,</hi>
both <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch,</hi> wonder not at all; it is but Conſonant, that to
<hi>Silver Deities,</hi> there be <hi>Leaden Prieſts;</hi> and therefore, you did well
to forbid the ſtanding by of ſuch <hi>Gameſters,</hi> as would quickly ſee
more then the <hi>Players:</hi> And becauſe the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>ruines</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> take this <hi>ſmall gloſſe</hi> upon
the <hi>defections,</hi> you have cauſed in that too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this I meet firſt with
the <hi>Power,</hi> by which you have erected all this <hi>Pile</hi> of <hi>deſolation;</hi>
and here I find <hi>Jacob</hi> in his Elder <hi>Brothers Clothes,</hi> for from the
<hi>King</hi> firſt that power iſſued, and by his <hi>Writs</hi> you were call'd, and
now <hi>ſurrepticiouſly</hi> like <hi>Prometheus</hi> you have ſtolne <hi>Fire</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to animate the fond Conceptions of your owne depraved wills,
and as if in this act you meant to give earneſt for all the evills you
meant to practice you have eaten through the bowells of your owne
Mother, devoured the Wombe that firſt diſcloſed you: Certainly,
when the <hi>King</hi> firſt Aſſembled you thither, as He intended not to
trench on your Priviledges, ſo He never meant, never beleeved ſo
ill on you, that you had the leaſt thought of wreſting His Power
from Him, <hi>(wreſting,</hi> ſo I tearme it) for I know of no act by which
He either lent or gave it away to you; and therefore you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
me, if with you I conſent not to beleeve your <hi>Power legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But admit His <hi>Majeſty</hi> for the good of the Kingdome entruſted
His <hi>Power</hi> with you; truly I think it was farre from <hi>Him</hi> to imagine,
you would have given it to the <hi>Scot,</hi> and make the <hi>repreſentative
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95496:3"/>
Body</hi> of the Kingdome, a <hi>Committee,</hi> to worke journey-worke for
them, who if things ſucceed according to their expectation, will be
ſo much your friends, as to allow you the ſame favour <hi>Polyphemus</hi>
did <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> and too late then you will begin to find with the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man,</hi>
you warmed the <hi>Snake,</hi> that ſhall <hi>hiſſe</hi> and <hi>ſting</hi> you, and
your Generation from your ſo long enjoy'd Poſſeſſions; which will
be ſome <hi>allay</hi> to my miſery, when I am undone by you to ſee you
periſh by your ſelves and them, <hi>Nec lex eſt juſtior ulla, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why extends not this <hi>Communion</hi> of Power to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as
well as <hi>Scot;</hi> who, if we confide in Proverbs, are as <hi>faithfull</hi> as they?
truly I'le anſwer for them, they were <hi>Starre-Crost,</hi> and miſtaking
the <hi>Sceane,</hi> entred in the <hi>Prologue.</hi> For had they ſtay'd but two <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes</hi>
longer, they might have <hi>Rebelled</hi> by <hi>Preſident</hi> and confirmed
it by <hi>Authority;</hi> but I paſſe over this with the obſervation of the
<hi>Poets. In quo quis peccat in eo punitur:</hi> you have ſtolne the <hi>Kings
Power</hi> from Him, and fooled both your owne and <hi>His</hi> to the <hi>Scot;</hi>
which every <hi>Engliſh</hi> man will find a greater breach of the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in joyning your ſelves to them,
and refuſing to receive any thing from the <hi>King,</hi> in which they are
not made your Partners, then that which you alleadge in the <hi>King</hi>
for a breach in naming the <hi>Common-Councell</hi> with you for a <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
for His <hi>Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my hopes at laſt are, that if this Power have any thing of the
<hi>Ingredients</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras's</hi> ſoule in it, it will <hi>tranſmigrate</hi> into the
firſt owner; And ſo leaving the <hi>right of Power,</hi> I come to ſurvey the
<hi>uſe</hi> of it; and here at the firſt fight I perceive the <hi>Gyants Club</hi> too
big for your <hi>hands;</hi> you can weild it to nothing but <hi>deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I remember at <hi>His</hi> departure from <hi>London,</hi> He left a <hi>City</hi>
more thronged with <hi>Wealth,</hi> then <hi>People,</hi> a <hi>Kingdome</hi> more flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
with <hi>good Lawes</hi> then any, but at <hi>His</hi> returne, I believe <hi>He</hi>
would be glad to find <hi>His talent</hi> wrapt up in a <hi>napkin:</hi> for in ſtead of
finding His <hi>Wealth</hi> increaſed, it is diminiſhed, His <hi>People</hi> ſlaine, and
the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>juſtice</hi> worn in a <hi>private ſheath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The <hi>Lawes</hi> which like
<hi>Land-markes,</hi> kept the <hi>Marriner,</hi> from a deſtroying <hi>Rocke,</hi> abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>in</hi> a word you have diſanul'd them all, and by the narroweſt
ſearch I can make, I cannot find any that you have either made or
kept, and in <hi>liew</hi> of theſe, you preſent us with an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> a thing
that like <hi>Jonas Gourd,</hi> is the off ſpring of a <hi>night,</hi> &amp; ſavours ſo much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95496:4"/>
of an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> that if it be not a <hi>prerogative</hi> beyond any
the <hi>King</hi> ever had, I know not what is; for I am ſure the <hi>Kings
Power</hi> before theſe times, without a due conviction of Law, could
take no mans Eſtate from him, and by the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> wee
had the ſame <hi>title</hi> to our <hi>Lands,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> had to <hi>His</hi> Crowne; but now
you have not only taken ours, but <hi>His</hi> too; you have <hi>diſinherited</hi> us,
<hi>diſinthroned</hi> Him. Yet in this Convulſion of the State, in this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſhufling of all together, our <hi>Liberties</hi> have ſcap'd at the eaſyeſt
rates; yet in them our <hi>plenty</hi> hath made us <hi>poore;</hi> and in being made
more <hi>free</hi> we are made more <hi>Slaves:</hi> for what is not lawfull now,
either to be done or ſaid? Witneſſe, your owne actions, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of ſo many <hi>Scandalous Seditious Pamphlets,</hi> that dayly infect
the ayre, and like the <hi>plagues of Aegypt</hi> are <hi>familiar</hi> even with the
<hi>Kings Chambers;</hi> Nay, that you might be ſure to make your <hi>little
finger heavier then the Kings Loynes,</hi> you have laid more Taxes on
the people in your five yeares uſurpation, then he had done in 17.
you have conſumed in this Warre more monyes, which you have
forced from the Subject, then have been (if my intelligence faile
not) disburſed almoſt by all the <hi>Kings of England</hi> ſince the <hi>Conqueſt,</hi>
and for the exaction of the <hi>twentieth,</hi> and the <hi>fifth part</hi> of every mans
Eſtate, I beleive you'l tire <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to finde the <hi>parallell,</hi> in the Raigns
of the moſt cruell Tyrants; and as if it were too <hi>light a Conqueſt</hi> to
overthrow our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> you endanger our <hi>Soules,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the names of <hi>Covenants,</hi> you impoſe ſuch <hi>Oathes,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi>
could (I am ſure did) never think on, and whatſoever you <hi>falſly</hi>
have imputed to the <hi>King,</hi> to make <hi>Him</hi> appeare odious to <hi>His</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
you have your ſelves really acted, and with a higher hand, then
ever the <hi>Extaſis</hi> of <hi>His</hi> wiſhes could tranſport Him to imagine; and
becauſe your <hi>Vices</hi> have been ſucceſſefull, you beleeve them <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;</hi>
and that you may ſtill deceive your ſelves, as well as others,
you turne the great end of the <hi>perspective</hi> upon all your actions, and
perpetually tell the world in all your <hi>Meſſages,</hi> of your deſires of
<hi>Peace.</hi>

            <p>Truly when I ſee thoſe, I need not wiſh <hi>Democritus</hi> from his
aſhes, every man that reads them is transformed into them; indeed I
cannot veiw them without a ſmile, eſpecially when (before there
was a Piſtoll charged for this Warre) I look upon all His Majeſties
Gracious Meſſages (I may rather call them <hi>Intreaties</hi> for <hi>Peace)</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95496:4"/>
ſent from <hi>Nottingham,</hi> from <hi>Yorke,</hi> theſe when it was begunne,
from <hi>Oxford</hi> and other places; thoſe often and preſent ſuings for
<hi>Peace</hi> ſtill denyed; you muſt pardon me, if I refuſe to be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and thinke you deſcended from thoſe that <hi>Cry, Peace, Peace,</hi>
when their preparations are warlike.</p>
            <p>Concerning your laſt Letters, His Majeſtie hath made ſo full an
Anſwer, that I ſhall ſay nothing, but certainly if you had not thought
<hi>your ſelves</hi> guilty of all the <hi>Blood</hi> that hath been ſhed in theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions,
and had not feared, that the <hi>unſeduced people</hi> would have
been of your opinion, you had not deſired the King to take it on
Him, and have raiſed a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which perhaps will not ſo eaſily
be <hi>allayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of all the <hi>Riddles</hi> which your <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> hath obtruded to us,
the pleaſanteſt is to think you ſhould fight all this while, for that
which when you have, you dare not accept; for your <hi>pretences</hi> in
the raiſing of your <hi>Armyes</hi> have been, to fetch the King from
His <hi>Evill Councellours,</hi> and yet when He offers to come, you refuſe
Him. Pray, though you force us from the <hi>goods</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> yet
deprive us not of the <hi>Faculties</hi> of our <hi>Soules,</hi> though you take our
<hi>Lands,</hi> leave us our <hi>underſtandings,</hi> though you make us <hi>Slaves,</hi> pray
make us not <hi>Fooles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word to ſumme up all, if this be <hi>your Religion,</hi> 'tis like the
poore <hi>Indians</hi> that worſhip the <hi>Divell,</hi> becauſe he ſhould not hurt
them, if this be <hi>your Obedience</hi> and <hi>Obeyſance</hi> to <hi>your King,</hi> I can
parallell it to none but <hi>Judas</hi> his, if this be <hi>your fighting</hi> to preſerve
Him, 'tis like the man that kill'd himſelfe out of a feare to <hi>dye;</hi> if this
be <hi>your vigilant wiſdome</hi> to make Him a glorious Prince, 'tis allied
to <hi>Solomons,</hi> in nothing but being <hi>Apocripha;</hi> if this be <hi>your mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the <hi>stich-fallen Lawes,</hi> 'tis like thoſe that repair'd <hi>Theſeus's ſhip</hi>
ſo long, 'till the firſt Fabrick was deſtroy'd; if this be the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging</hi>
our <hi>Liberties,</hi> 'tis like the man that to increaſe his Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond,
let the Sea into it: if theſe be <hi>your deſires for Peace,</hi> 'tis like
him that pray'd to <hi>Jupiter</hi> for that he would not have; if this be
<hi>your Care</hi> for the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> it's like <hi>Neros,</hi> that wiſhed,
<hi>Rome</hi> but <hi>one head,</hi> the eaſier to deſtroy it; if theſe be <hi>your affections
to your bleeding Country,</hi> you are like the <hi>hunted Ape,</hi> that expoſeth
the beloved <hi>Whelpe</hi> to relieve that death was due to her.</p>
            <p>To conclude, for I meant not to ſend you either a <hi>Disputation,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95496:5"/>
or a <hi>Volume</hi> miſtaken for a <hi>Letter;</hi> my <hi>beleefe</hi> is, The <hi>Sinnes</hi> of the
<hi>Nation</hi> have deſerved a <hi>Judgement,</hi> and <hi>your Rebellion</hi> hath payd it;
but my <hi>hopes</hi> are, when Gods Iudgements are paſt, he will burne
the Rods; In the meane time I can compare our Condition with
none ſo fitly as <hi>Aeſops frogs;</hi> we muſt cry and petition for a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
and <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath ſent us one, as devouring as their <hi>Stork.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I conſider all theſe things together, the Charitableſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
I can have of you, is to thinke that <hi>opportunity</hi> hath made you
worſe then you intended, and that partly like young <hi>Philoſophers</hi>
in approving <hi>one error,</hi> you have been led into a <hi>thouſand;</hi> and now
you muſt juſtifie and ſupport one ill act by another; if this be the
<hi>Cure,</hi> which at firſt you promiſed this <hi>Distemper'd State,</hi> 'tis worſe
then the <hi>Malady;</hi> and for my part I ſhall deſire my <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> againe;
I am ſure there is leſſe paine, leſſe trouble in it; and for your admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
I ſhall referre you to a Heathen</p>

               <l>Dominare tumidus, ſpiritus altos gere;</l>
               <l>Sequitur Superbos ultor à tergo Deus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Goe on proud men, till you have made the
Kingdome a deluge of Bloud; <hi>rule</hi> till you have
undone both your ſelves, and us; <hi>but</hi> remember
the <hi>God</hi> that hath <hi>Leaden Feet,</hi> hath <hi>Iron Hands;</hi>
and commonly <hi>he</hi> ſupplyes the <hi>ſlowneſſe</hi> of the one
with the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of the other, and alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
thoſe <hi>he</hi> goes not with, purſues thoſe with
