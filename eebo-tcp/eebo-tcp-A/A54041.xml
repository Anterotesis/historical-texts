            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Lord God of infinite goodneſs, who hath ever dearly loved Mankind, yet could never ſo appear to them ſince the tranſgreſſion, as to be owned by them, till the vail was taken from before their hearts. <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe of their anguiſh and bondage. When they were led out, they were ever and anon murmuring, and picking quarrels againſt him. <hi>Samuel</hi> they rejected (as the Lord laies to their charge) though they might excuſe themſelves, and ſay they had juſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt his ſons. <hi>Elijah,</hi> that mighty man of God, the great reſtorer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and pleader againſt <hi>Baal</hi> by fire, his life was ſought for. And though there be not a particular record of their uſage of the Prophets about thoſe dayes, yet in general he complains that they were all ſlain but himſelf, <hi>1 King. 19.10. Micaiah</hi> was ſmote on the cheek and jeered bp the falſe Prophet which ſmote him, and ſaid, which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to ſpeak unto thee? And he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be put in priſon, and fed with bread of affliction, and water of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was put in the dungeon, even to the danger of his life: and by thoſe few that were left, that ſeemed ſingly to enquire by him concerning the will of the Lord, (<hi>Jer. 42.2, 3.</hi>) diſdainfully reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>chap. 43.2.</hi> What ſhould I ſpend time in particular inſtances? What Prophet can I except? for though all their bad dealings with them, are not related in Scripture, yet Chriſt teſtifies that they did deal badly with them all, ſome of them they ſtoned, ſome of them they ſcourged in their Synagogues, ſome of them they killed and crucified, and others they perſecuted from City to City. Yea, ſaith <hi>Stephen,</hi> which of the Prophets have not your fathers perſecuted? and they have ſtain them which ſhewed before of the coming of the Juſt one. Ye make it ſuch a ſtrange thing, that if Chriſt had been a Prophet, ye ſhould not own him: why which of the Prophets was owned? ye have ſtill ſome exception or other againſt us, that we are not the Prophets of God; and againſt our meſſage, that it is not the mind of God. Ye take argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from one Prophets words, to oppoſe another Prophet with; and from one Prophets manner of coming, to oppoſe another Prophets man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of coming. If <hi>John</hi> come neither eating nor drinking, ye reject him for his auſtereneſs: if Chriſt come both eating and drinking, ye reject him for his liberty and freedome in the life. Now what is the reaſon of this? Chriſt himſelf gives the reaſon, <hi>Mat. 11.19. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is juſtified of her children.</hi> Ye are not the children of wiſdom,
<pb facs="tcp:45702:3"/>
ye are not begotten of the life, of the ſpirit of the Prophets, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie that ſpirit. Ye have got the Letter of the Prophets, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e are born of that; but ye are not born of the life, ye are not born of the wiſdome. And ſo, whoever comes forth in the ſame birth from the Letter with you, him ye can own: but if any Prophet come forth with that ſame ſpirit, him ye cannot own. He that is born after the fleſh, cannot but perſecute him that is born after the ſpirit: Jeruſalem was all along the perſecuter of the Prophets, from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>And is this nothing to you, O ye Profeſſors of this age? Search and ſee who have been the perſecuters among you, but they who have had the name of the Church and her Prophets? Who hath ſlain the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſlain the Witneſſes againſt her, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have ſlain the Witneſſes againſt them. About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe troubles, if a man were never ſo truly zealous, yet if he could not conform to the Common-prayer-book and Ceremonies, how was he perſecuted? A Non-conformiſt, a Separatiſt, a Browniſt, an Anabaptiſt (though owning the ſame Chriſt in his very heart and ſoul) yet becauſe his practiſe was a teſtimony againſt the falſe Church-worſhip of the common <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> muſt be hunted up and down to Courts, impriſoned, fixed, baniſhed. And to this day, the Lord can bring forth no birth of his Spirit, but the zealous Profeſſor hates, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles, and ſeeks to deſtroy. If the Lord lay any Law upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if it be not ſuitable to their apprehenſions from the Letter, how do they reproach, diſdain, revile, and endeavour to render ſuch odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Magiſtrates, and to the People!</p>
            <p>But why ſhould we wonder at theſe things? There is no new thing under the Sun. The ſtate of the world is juſt as it alwaies was. The power of Truth in every age, hath been ſtill oppoſed by thoſe who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Form. It were a wonder if it ſhould be otherwiſe. I ſhould much more, wonder, if the Teachers and Profeſſors of this age ſhould own. Truth, than that they fight againſt it and perſecute it. Well friends and brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and faithful to his Truth in the power of his might; bear the reproach, the afflictions of this age, the perſecutions of this your day: Verily your eyes ſhall ſee that there is a reward for the righteous, and your hearts ſhall be ſatisfied with it, when the children of the Kingdome (of this age, as well as of Chriſts, and all former ages) ſhall be ſhut out in utter darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>

            <head>Some Exceptions and Arguments of the <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt Chriſt's Appearance, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Jews were once the only outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible People of God, who were choſen by God for a peculiar People, who had the Promiſe of, and expected the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe faith and hope of Salvation was in him, yea, and at that very time they were looking for him; yet when he came, he was <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> to them, and they could by no means receive him. They were full of reaſonings, and doubts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings about it, but could never with all their wiſdom from the Letter, determine that that was he. Though he lived as never man lived, though he ſpake as never man ſpake, though he did what never man did; yet ſtill ſome exception or other they had from the Letter of the Scriptures, to which his manner of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his converſation, and his Doctrine did not ſuit in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo after many Diſputes and Debates, they at length deliver him up to death, as a Blaſphemer, a deceiver, a ſeducer of the People.</p>
            <p>Many Exceptions and Arguments they had againſt him, againſt his <hi>Deſcent,</hi> his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> his <hi>Practiſes,</hi> his <hi>Miracles,</hi> his <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c. which I ſhall refer to Heads, to make them more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They excepted <hi>at his deſcent and kindred. Is not this the Carpenters Son? Is not his Mother called Mary? and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> James, <hi>and</hi> Joſes, <hi>and</hi> Simon, <hi>and</hi> Judas? <hi>And his Siſters are they not all with us?</hi> Matt. 13.55, 56. (What this the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the great King of Glory, of whom all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have propheſied and ſpoke ſuch great things! ſurely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be.) <hi>And they were offended in him,</hi> verſ. 57. It was this made them they could not receive that heavenly Doctrine of his, which otherwiſe might have been life to them, when he taught them that he was <hi>the bread of Life that came down from heaven:</hi> but they murmured becauſe of it, and ſaid, <hi>Is not this Jeſus the ſon of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>whoſe Father and Mother we know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> How is it then that he ſaith, I came down from heaven,</hi> John 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1, 42. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, John 7.27. <hi>We know this man whence he is; but when Chriſt cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</hi> This was a cloſe Argument, and was raiſed up to eat out a deep impreſſion of his being the Chriſt, as may appear from the foregoing verſe. He ſpeaketh indeed boldly, and deep things, &amp;c. as if he were the Chriſt; but how can he be he, ſeeing it is known from whence he comes?</p>
            <p n="2">2. At his Country, or place of his Education and reſidence, which was <hi>Nazareth of Galilee. Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?</hi> John 1.46. <hi>Shall Chriſt come out of Galilee?</hi> John 7.41. <hi>Search and look; for out of Galilee ariſeth no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> verſe 52.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>At the time and ſeaſon of his Coming.</hi> He came (as to their ſenſe) before <hi>Elias.</hi> With this Argument they pinched the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as is ſignified in that Query of theirs to Chriſt, <hi>Why then ſay the Scribes that</hi> Elias <hi>muſt firſt come?</hi> Matt. 17.10 This could not but be a ſore Argument in the mouth of the Scribes, who might reaſon with the Diſciples on this wiſe: What poor, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſottiſh, deluded People are you, to own this man for your Maſter, and take him for the Meſſiah? <hi>Elias</hi> muſt firſt come, and reſtore all things. If this man preached never ſo heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and did never ſo many Miracles, yet if he pretend to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he can be but a Deceiver; for the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> comes not before <hi>Elias</hi>; and every one knows that <hi>Elias</hi> is not yet come, nor his work of reſtoring all things, ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His <hi>Doctrine</hi> adminiſtred abundance of offence to them, and they were continually ſtumbling at it. That heavenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine mentioned a little before, that he was <hi>the bread of life,</hi> they murmured at it, <hi>John</hi> 6.41. When he did but ſay, <hi>God was his father,</hi> they preſently flew out upon him, and ſaid he <hi>made himſelf equal with God, John</hi> 5.18. When he ſaid, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it up</hi>; they miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, and brought it forth as an argument againſt him at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45702:4"/>
the time of his ſuffering, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.61. And caſt it as a jear in his teeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.40. When he did but ſay to the man ſick of the palſie, <hi>Son thy ſins are forgiven thee</hi>; the Scribes and Phariſees preſently exclaimed againſt him, <hi>who is this which ſpeaketh blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies? who can forgive ſins, but God alone? Luke</hi> 5.21. and chap. 7.49. When he preached very powerfully againſt <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> the Phariſees <hi>derided him, Luke</hi> 16.14. Yea, when he did but preach a Parable or two about <hi>the Widdow of Sarepta, and Naaman the Syrian</hi> (it coming a little cloſe to their State) <hi>all they in the Synagogue were ſo filled with wrath, that they roſe up and thruſt him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the hill to caſt him down headlong, Luke</hi> 4.28, 29. At his ſaying that <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee his day, and he ſaw it, and was glad</hi>; the Jews replyed, <hi>Thou art not yet fifty years old, and haſt thou ſeen Abraham? John</hi> 8.57. How abſurd and impoſſible was this to them, that a man of not fifty years, ſhould ſay that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham (who lived ſo many ages before) ſaw his day; And inſtead of giving them an argument to demonſtrate it to them, he only returns them a more confident affirmation, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, before Abraham was I am; verſ.</hi> 58. which ſo enraged them, that they took up ſtones to caſt at him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 59. Now mark, the life ſpeaks what it ſees and knows, and ſo it gives forth its Teſtimony: the wiſe profeſſor not being in the life, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know or receive the teſtimony, but calls for arguments and damonſtrations to his wiſe eye, the life refuſeth to anſwer him, but inſtead thereof, only affirmeth the thing more ſtrongly &amp; confidently; this (being ſo far from that which he looks for and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to ſatisfie him) kindles diſdain and rage in him: and he looks upon the life, for this way of proceeding, as worthy to be ſtoned. What, when they ſhould lay before Chriſt a fair argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might plainly convince him by evident reaſon, that he could not ſee <hi>Abrahams</hi> day; and he inſtead of anſwering it, ſhould only bring forth a more confident affirmation. Would not mens wiſdome in this age, even hiſs at ſuch a thing? yet this was the way of the life then, in that day; and the life may at his pleaſure, take the ſame way again now, to offend the wiſe and knowing.</p>
            <p>When he ſpake of his being <hi>the good Shepheard,</hi> and of his <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life for the Sheep</hi> (and of the Hirelings fleeing in time of danger to ſave himſelf) <hi>John</hi> 10, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.12. &amp;c. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of the Jews ſaid, <hi>he hath a Devil, and is mad, why hear ye him?</hi> verſ. 20. Many of them that were then the people of God (the ſeparated people: for the Jews were a people ſeperated from the World, and ſtudied the Law, and obſerved the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Moſes</hi>) looked upon Chriſt, as a man not fit to be heard ſpeak, but as a mad man, as one that had a Devil, as one that might have great power of deceit from the Devil, to bewitch men from truth; <hi>why hear ye him?</hi> what good can ye expect from him? <hi>He hath a Devil, and is mad.</hi> O how deſperately will bold fleſh venture to judge of the life and power of God, when it hath got a little knowledge from the Scriptures, and a way of worſhip, duties, and ordinances!</p>
            <p>When he ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one, John</hi> 10.30. <hi>they took up ſtones again to ſtone him,</hi> verſ. 31. and made no queſtion but they did well in doing of it, as appears by their anſwer to his demand; for which of his good works they ſtoned him? They reply very confidently, <hi>for a good work we ſtone thee not, but for Blaſphemy, and becauſe thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelf God,</hi> verſ. 32, 33. And when he ſaid, <hi>If a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death, John</hi> 8.51. Then ſaid the Jews unto him, <hi>now we know that thou haſt a Devil. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead, who makeſt thou thy ſelf?</hi> verſ. 53. Were not <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Prophets holy men? had not they the ſayings of God? and did not they keep the ſayings of God? yet they are dead. Such a kind of ſpeech as this muſt needs be from the Devil. Now thou makeſt manifeſt from what Spirit thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>Now know we that thou haſt a Devil.</hi> And indeed how could the profeſſors of that age digeſt ſuch things, being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what appeared to them, to be certain truth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And there were many other things as hard to them, though the exceptions which might or did ariſe in their minds, are not particularly mentioned: as when he ſaith, <hi>I am the door of the Sheep. All that came before me are thieves and robbers, but the Sheep did not hear them, John</hi> 10.7, 8. How offenſive muſt this Doctrine needs have been to them, going carnally to underſtand and reaſon about it? What were all the Prophets and holy men before thee, thieves and robbers? did the truth never come, till thou broughtſt it? What became of our Fore-fathers in former ages? were they none of them Gods Sheep? did none of them find
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45702:5"/>
the door? for thou ſaiſt thou art <hi>the door,</hi> and thou haſt been but of late. And whereas thou ſaiſt, the Sheep did not hear them, that's utterly falſe: for they did hear <hi>Moſes,</hi> and they did hear the <hi>Prophets</hi>: and we have their writings, and will keep to them for all thee, let who will be thy Sheep. When he ſaid, that he <hi>came not to ſend peace but diviſion, Mat.</hi> 10.25. How readily might they reply, that his own mouth diſcovered him, not to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour, the peace-maker, but the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of diviſions, the cauſer of breaches in families; ſetting three againſt two, and two againſt three, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.51. When he ſaid, <hi>whoſoever committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin, John</hi> 8.34. Might not they well except againſt this, as condemning the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the righteous, and making null the way of ſacrifices which God had appointed for ſins committed at any time by his people, which could not but preſuppoſe their commiſſion of ſin? did not <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, David, Moſes,</hi> &amp; the reſt of the Prophets all commit ſin, and were they ſervants of ſin? He taught alſo, that <hi>the children of the Kingdom ſhould be caſt into utter darkneſs, Mat.</hi> 8.12. Oh how harſh would this ſound in the ears of the zealous profeſſing Jew, who was waiting and hoping for the Kingdome! So in his Doctrine there ſeemed many contradictions to the fleſhly underſtanding, for one while he ſaid, <hi>I Judge no man,</hi> for I came not to condemn the World: and yet was he not continually judging and condemning the Scribes, the Phariſees, the Prieſts, the Lawyers, and that whole generation of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors? So again he came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, to preach the Goſpel of peace: and yet another while he ſaith, he came not to ſend peace but a ſword, and to kindle a fire, and to ſet men at variance, &amp;c. Again, one while he ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> another time, <hi>my Father is greater than I</hi>; one while he bid men do as the Scribes and Phariſees, taught; another while he bid men beware of the Leaven, or Doctrine of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and Saduces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.12.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe ſhould I heap up any more inſtances? O thou that readeſt this, wait to know in thy ſelf the ear that cannot hear Chriſts Doctrin, and while thou condemneſt the Jews, do not run into the ſame error of unbelief and gain-ſaying, but wait to know the voice of Chriſt in this day, and to receive the ear that can hear it, for though thou ſhouldeſt be willing to hear, yet thou canſt not, till thy ear be opened. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45702:6"/>
could acknowledge Chriſt <hi>a teacher come from God,</hi> yet could not receive the doctrine of the new birth from him, <hi>John</hi> 3.4. and there were many things the diſciples themſelves were not able to bear, for when, at a certain time, he ſpake of <hi>giving his fleſh to eat,</hi> not only the Jews, <hi>John</hi> 6.52. but they alſo ſtumbled, <hi>ver.</hi> 61. and who is there among profeſſors, that can now bear it, or receive Chriſts own interpretation of it? who ſaith, that <hi>the fleſh</hi> (which they underſtood) <hi>profiteth nothing,</hi> but the fleſh which he meant was <hi>ſpirit and life,</hi> ver. 63.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>At his practiſes, and converſation, How is it that he eateth and drinketh, with Publicans and ſinners,</hi> Mark 2.16. <hi>Behold a gluttenous man, and a wine bibber, a friend of Publicans and ſinners,</hi> Luke 7.14. <hi>This man if he were a Prophet, would have known who, and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him; for ſhe is a ſinner,</hi> Luke 7.39. At the Publicans and ſinners drawing nigh to hear him, the Phariſees and Scribes were offended, and murmured ſaying, <hi>This man receiveth ſinners,</hi> and <hi>eateth with them,</hi> Luke 15.1, 2. and when he went to <hi>Zacheus</hi> houſe, <hi>they all murmured, ſaying, that he was gone to be Gueſt with a man that is a ſinner,</hi> Luke 19.7.</p>
            <p>Again, becauſe he healed on the Sabbath, and juſtified his diſciples in plucking of ears of corn on the Sabbath, <hi>they were filled with madneſs, and communed what they might do to him,</hi> Luke 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>and ver.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>and took counſell how they might deſtroy him,</hi> Mark 3.5, 6. Another time, the Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ſpake with indignation about it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.14. Yea, <hi>the Jews did perſecute Jeſus, and ſought to ſlay him becauſe he had healed a man, and bid him take up his bed and walkon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day,</hi> John 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 16. and ſome of them made it a ſtrong argument againſt him, <hi>this man is not of God, becauſe he keepeth not the Sabbath day,</hi> John 9.16. What come from God, and be a breaker of his Ordinances? Can theſe two ſtand together? Read and conſider, what more ſtrict Ordinance of God under the Law, than the Sabbath? What one Ordinance more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the honour and worſhip of God? Did not their whole religion and worſhip much depend upon it? How could this poſſibly but be a great offence to them in that Spirit, and Litteral Wiſdome from the Scriptures, wherein they ſtood? Yet Chriſt, in his fleſhly appearance, was Lord of the Sabbath; and in his ſpiritual appearance he doth not loſe his dominion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45702:6"/>Again they excepted againſt him, that he did not teach his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to faſt and pray as <hi>John</hi> did, Luke 5.33. but could ſuffer them to tranſgreſs the traditions of the Elders, Mat. 15.2. he was not ſtrict after the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> way of devotion, not ſtrict after <hi>Johns</hi> way neither; but againſt the traditions of the godly Elders of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, againſt ſanctifying of the Lords Sabbath (juſtifying his diſciples in plucking ears of corn thereon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their fore-fathers the Jews, were not ſo much as to gather Manna on that day) againſt faſting and prayer, for he juſtified his diſciples in that they did not faſt and pray as <hi>John</hi> did, ſaying, how could they while the bride-groom was with them? Mat. 9.15. and conſider which way the Jews (in the ſtate they ſtood) could underſtand ſuch an anſwer as this, to reſt ſaſtified therewith?</p>
            <p n="6">6. They excepted <hi>againſt his Miracles,</hi> partly becauſe he did them on the Sabbath day, <hi>John</hi> 9.16. whereupon they concluded he could not be of God (for if he had been of God, he would have obſerved the day which God commanded) &amp; if he wrought them not by the power of God, by whoſe power then muſt he work them? So they concluded, <hi>He caſteth out Devils, through the Prince of Devils,</hi> Mat. 9.34. <hi>he hath Belzebub,</hi> and <hi>by the Prince of Devils caſteth he out Devils,</hi> Mark. 3.32. and having thus concluded in themſelves, there was no ear open in them, to hear any thing that might be ſaid to the contrary. And again partly, becauſe he did not anſwer their wils, in giving them ſuch a ſign as they required: for this was ſtill their tone, <hi>Maſter, we would ſee a ſign from thee,</hi> Mat. 12.38. <hi>what ſign ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing that thou doſt theſe things?</hi> John 2.18. and they more particularly expreſs what ſign they would have, they would have <hi>a ſign from heaven,</hi> Luke 11.18. <hi>What ſign ſheweſt thou, that we may ſee and beleeve thee?</hi> John 6.30. We are ready to be convinced, we are ready to beleeve, If thou would give us ſufficient ground of beleiving in thee. As for all thy healing people, and caſting out Devils, Belzebub (the Prince of Devils) may furniſh thee with power) therewith, to deceive and bewitch us from the Law and Ordinances of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which we are ſure are of God) but ſhew us a ſign from heaven, or elſe blame us not for not leaving <hi>Moſes</hi> to run after thee.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They excepted <hi>at the Teſtimony, which the Spirit of God in him, gave concerning him.</hi> When he ſpake the inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which the ſpirit of God gave from within, ſaying, <hi>I am
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45702:7"/>
the light of the world, he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſhall have the light of life,</hi> John 8.13. they preſently cried out <hi>thou beareſt record of thy ſelf, thy record is not true,</hi> verſe 14. mark his anſwer, <hi>It is written in your law, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of two men is true, I am one that bear witneſs of my ſelf, and the Father that ſent me beareth witneſs of me,</hi> verſe 17.18. How would ſuch an anſwer paſs now in theſe dayes, though the ſame life ſhould ſpeak it? would not the wiſe profeſſors of this age even hoot at it? yet the thing is known at this day, even the life which the Father begets, and the Fathers teſtifying of it, and with it: and thou that readeſt this, mighteſt know it, couldeſt thou wait in the loſs of thine own life, (wiſdome, and knowledg) for it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They excepted <hi>againſt his diſciples and followers,</hi> which were women, Publicans and ſinners, the common people, yea the meaneſt, the pooreſt, and moſt Ignorant (in their account) who were fitteſt to be deluded and led away. <hi>Are ye alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees beleeved on him? but this people who knoweth not the law, are curſed,</hi> John 7.47, 48, 49. the common people, the ignorant people, the unſetled people, ſuch as know not the law, ſuch as underſtand not the Scriptures, they run after him, and cry him up: but which of the Setled ones, which of the truly Zealous ones, which of the Wiſe men in the knowledge of the Law and Prophets, which of the orthodox Scribes and Phariſees, who keep cloſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which of theſe beleeve in him? whom of them can he deceive? As for the heady people, who (for want of knowledge of the Scriptures) are ready to run after every new fangle, they are not worth the minding, they are <hi>accurſed,</hi> and therefore no marvel though God give them up to follow this deceiver, &amp; to cry up his new Light, and forſake the good old Light of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They excepted againſt him, that he did not rebuke his diſciples, and the multitude (ſpreading their garments, cutting down branches from the trees and ſtrowing them in the way) with the children that cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to him, as he rode on the Aſſe Colt to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but he rather juſtified them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.31. and <hi>Mat</hi> 21.15, 16. what a ridiculous, and vainglorious peice of pageantry would this ſeem to the fleſhly wiſe eye?</p>
            <p n="10">10. That he did not ſhew ſufficient authority for what he did.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45702:7"/>
               <hi>By what authority doſt thou theſe things? and who gave thee this authority,</hi> &amp;c. Mark 11.28. Thou takeſt upon thee great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the people of God, over their Teachers, yea over Gods Temple, Sabbath, and Ordinances; but wheres thy authority ſo to do? Shew us that, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="11">11. They excepted when he ſpoke of his ſufferings and death, <hi>We have heard in our Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever; and how ſaiſt thou, the Son of Man muſt be lift up? Who is the ſon of man?</hi> John 12.34. Sure he that is to be lift up, cannot be the Chriſt which is to abide for ever, and not to die: So that here (in one breath) thou haſt overthrown all that thou haſt been ſetting up by thy Preaching and Miracles. Now which way could they underſtand this thing? Nay the very Diſciples themſelves could not ſwallow it, but were ſtartled at it, and Chriſt was fain to hide it a long time from them. And yet if there be any thing held forth now in theſe dayes by the ſame ſpirit, (as concerning light and perfection, or other truths which are ſeen in the ſpirit) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men cannot apprehend them with their carnal underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make them agree with their carnal knowledge of the Scriptures, what liberty do they take to themſelves to ſpeak both againſt the truth it ſelf, and alſo againſt them who have ſeen theſe things in the ſpirit, and ſpeak them from the ſpirit? Now who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever becomes a Diſciple, muſt wait in the obedience to know the doctrine, and not think to enter with that wiſdome, and carnal reaſoning from Scriptures, which the Scribes and Phariſees, and Profeſſors of that age were ſhut out with.</p>
            <p>There were many other things which they could not but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt, as at his anſwers to their queſtions, to which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was ſilent and gave no anſwer at all. At other times, he anſwered not directly, but in Parables (and how offenſive is this to mans wiſdome, who requires a poſitive and direct anſwer?) And ſometimes his anſwers might ſeem quite from the thing, as <hi>John</hi> 12.34, 35.</p>
            <p>His not giving reſpect to perſons (for it was a known thing of him, that he regarded not mens perſons, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.16.) could not be very pleaſing to them, who loved greetings, and ſought honor one of another. He ſhewed not reſpect to <hi>Herod</hi> the King, (but ſpake contemptuouſly of him, as men would account it) <hi>Go ſaith he, and tell that Fox.</hi> He did not ſhew reſpect to the reverend and grave Doctors of the Law, nay nor to the High Prieſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45702:8"/>
Nay he did not ſhew reſpect to his own Diſciples, but ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> (when he mildly and affectionately deſired his death might be avoided) <hi>Get thee behind me Satan.</hi> How harſh and rough a reply might this ſeem? If <hi>Peter</hi> had erred, through his affection and tenderneſs to his Maſter, a meek ſpirit would gently have informed him; but to call him Devil, and ſay, get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me; what kind of ſpirit doth this favour of, would that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Jew ſay, who knoweth not the true meekneſs, but ſeeks after a fleſhly meekneſs, which is a ſervant to the fleſhly wiſdome and prudence, but not true born? Nay he did not ſpeak reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own Mother, (as mans ſpirit, by its rule of reſpect would judge and condemn him) but ſaid, Woman, what have I to do with thee? <hi>John</hi> 2.4. and in a manner denied all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.48.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, (to inſtance no more) at his harſh cenſures of all the Profeſſors of that age, (which obſerved the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> Statutes) with all their laborious and godly Teachers, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying none but himſelf, and what he taught, and a few of his followers. He told them that they had not the <hi>love of God in them,</hi> John 5.42. Did not this (think ye) ſeem to them a very harſh charge? And why not the love of God? becauſe they did not follow him, and his new Doctrine? yea, would they be ready to ſay, they did love God, and kept his Commandements, Sabbaths, and Ordinances, which he tranſgreſſed.</p>
            <p>He laid this alſo to their charge, that they did not believe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> John 5.46. What an unjuſt charge might this ſeem, when they were ſo zealous for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their very diſlike of him, and controverſie againſt him, was for the ſake of the Law and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>Moſes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another charge he laid to them was, that they were not the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or of God, but of the Devil, <hi>John</hi> 8. ver. 39, 42, 44. What a raſh cenſorious man might they account him thus to ſpeak of them, who were the human ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who were ſuch ſtrict obſervers of Gods Laws and Ordinances, (which is the property of his children) and ſuch enemies to the Devil, that they would not be drawn from the truths, and way of worſhip taught by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, no not by all the Miracles he could work?</p>
            <p>He called them <hi>a faithleſs and perverſe Generation,</hi> Ma 1 t. 17.17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45702:8"/>He told them that they did not <hi>know God,</hi> though they ſaid with confidence that he was their God, John 12.54, 55. How could they bear this? They had been ſtudying the law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and had a great ſtock of knowledge from thence, and were ſtrict and exact in worſhip (ſome of them, as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> might be <hi>according to the Law blameleſs</hi>) and now to be told they did not know God? Nay, he that aboundeth in knowledge, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and worſhip, yet being not in the life and pure Power of the Spirit, hath not one dram of the true knowledge.</p>
            <p>He told them that they ſhould <hi>dye in their ſins,</hi> John 8.21. (O hard word, and ſevere judgement!) And yet he had told them a little before that he judged no man, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. yea they did think themſelves exceedingly wronged by him, and thought that no man that had any thing of God in him could ſpeak ſuch things, but only one that was an enemy to the people of God, and led by the ſpirit of Satan. To this effect they expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>verſe</hi> 48. of that <hi>Chap. Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hath a Devil!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea when Chriſt charged them with <hi>going about to kill him,</hi> they ſeemed to themſelves ſo clear in their own conſciences, that they anſwered, <hi>thou haſt a Devil, who goes about to kill thee?</hi> John 7.29. how eaſily might they cloſeup the controverſie, and by this very thing conclude him to be a falſe Prophet? He ſayes we went about to till him, when (God knows) there was not ſuch a thing in our hearts. Can this man be a true Prophet? yet Chriſt knew the prefeſſing Jews to be the Murtherer, and in and for his Religion ſake ſtill ſeeking to ſlay him. And there is no ſuch murtherer of Chriſt (the life) upon the earth, as the zealous Profeſſor and worſhipper out of the life. He that is in the life cannot perſecute any man; he that is out of the life, cannot but perſecute him that is in the life. Hereby the true and falſe chriſtian may be diſcrened, by the weakeſt ſimple and ſingle eye.</p>
            <p>And then for their teachers and expounders of the law, how exceeding bitter did be ſeem againſt them? and how heavy things was he continually laying to their charge? He called them <hi>blind Guids, Hypocrites, painted Sepulchres, Graves which appears not,</hi> and pronounced woe upon woe againſt them. Read that one place, Mat. 23.33, <hi>Ye Serpents, ye Generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of Hell?</hi> What

ſpeak thus of our zealous Teachers, who ſtudy the Law, are ſtrict in practiſing of the Ordinances, and take ſuch pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtruct us in the mind of God, from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets? was ſuch a man as this fit to live? Nay and he does not ſhew a Goſpel ſpirit, mark how ſharp and bitter his words came from him (for indeed a ſharper ſpeech, with greater vehemency and indignation of ſpirit, can hardly be ſpoken) and they might ſeem to aggravate this ſharp condemnation of his, from his own confeſſion: he himſelf had confeſſed that they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair (now he might have ſhewn ſome honour to <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, and to their office, which was of God, and doubtleſs good) and not have gone about to make them thus odious in the eyes of the people. Nay he himſelf had bid men do as they ſaid, but in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. of that Chap. Now was it likely that ever men ſhould mind what they ſaid, or obſerve their doctrine, when he had thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them, <hi>as oppreſſors of the conſcience,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>as devourers of widdows houſes, and making long prayers in Hypocriſie,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>as making their proſelytes more the children of hell then themſelves,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>as neglecters of the weightier matters of the Law, Judgement, Mercy and Faith,</hi> ver. 2.3. <hi>as appearing righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to men, but full of Hypocriſie and iniquity,</hi> ver. 28. <hi>as of the ſame generation that killed the Prophets,</hi> ver. 31.32. <hi>as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

How could they obſerve what they taught without hearing them? and would Chriſt wiſh any to hear ſuch men as theſe? Yet for all this, without doubt they were not without their juſtifications againſt Chriſt in theſe reſpects, and alſo had their charges (on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand) ready againſt him. Now how did they ſhut up the Kingdome of Heaven againſt men? Did not they teach the Law, and direct men to the Ordinances of God, and open the Prophets words to them? was this ſhutting up the Kindome of heaven? And would not they ſuffer men to enter? Why, their work was to win people to their profeſſion, they would compaſs Sea and Land to make a proſelyte. How ſtifly might the Jews have pleaded againſt Chriſt, that he did ſlander their godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who were very painful and zealous in opening the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45702:9"/>
and teaching the way of God? nay he himſelf could not deny but they taught well: for he himſelf ſaith, <hi>whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do, Mat.</hi> 23.3. But mark now, that ye may underſtand the thing, it is thus. Any teaching, or expounding of Scriptures out of the life, ſhuts up the Kingdome: for the Life is the Kingdome: and words from the life yeild the ſavour of the Kingdome: but words out of it (though never ſo good and true) reach not to the life in another, but only build up a knowledge in the contrary wiſdome, and teach to hold the truth in the unrighteouſneſs, where Satans Kingdome ſtands, and where he hath the dominion over all that is brought thither. And ſo this kind of teaching and knowledg ſhuts up the door and way of life; and muſt be loſt, before the Kingdome can be found.</p>
            <p>They ſhut up the true Kingdome, but they opened another Kingdome, they opened the Kingdome another way, (which was in truth ſhutting of it,) and they had Diſciples and Children of the Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom they tickled with the hope of life, and fed with promiſes and comforts: but theſe the Lord would ſhut out. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and Weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but the Children of the Kingdome, ſhall be caſt out into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs, Mat.</hi> 8.11, 12. This is as true at this day, in this preſent diſpenſation, as it was then in that diſpenſation, though men make it a great accuſation againſt us, charging us that we ſay none are the people of God but our ſelves, and as if all were damned but we. Theſe are mens harſh and unſavory expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; we uſe not to ſpeak after this manner, but ſoberly open the ſtate of the thing, as it ſtands in the truth (and as it hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us, by him who is true, and cannot lie,) which is thus:</p>
            <p>That through which men are ſaved, is the diſpenſation of truth in their age. The meaſure of light, which God gives forth in every age; that is the means and proper way of Salvation in that age: and what ever men get, or profeſs of the knowledg of truth, declared in former ages, yet making uſe of that to withſtand the preſent diſpenſation of truth in their age, they cannot thereby be ſaved, but may thereby be hardened againſt that which ſhould ſave them. And this we are aſſured of from the Lord, that as the Jews could not be ſaved by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (making uſe of it in oppoſition to the ſhining of the light of God in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45702:10"/>
in their preſent ages) nor afterwards could be ſaved by magnifiing and obſerving both the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and their belief from thence of a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to come, (mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of theſe things to oppoſe that appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, which was the diſpenſation of their day then.) No more can any Profeſſors be ſaved now, by belief of a Chriſt come, or any thing which they can learn or practiſe from the Scriptures, making uſe thereof to oppoſe the diſpenſation of this day; which diſpenſation is the immediate and powerful breaking forth of the light of the Spitit, in the hearts of Gods people (who have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought, and in much ſorrow and perplexity of Spirit, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and waited for him) after this long dark night of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>There remain yet ſome other exceptions againſt him, about the time of his ſuffering death, with his hard uſage, which would not wholly be paſſed over.</p>
            <p>As firſt, his diſreſpective or irreverend anſwering of the high Prieſt, (as it ſeemed to them) when he asked him of his Doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. His anſwer was, that <hi>he ſpake openly in the World, not in ſecret, why askeſt thou me? ask them that heard me</hi>; whereupon one of the Officers ſtruck him, ſaying; <hi>Anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo</hi>? verſ. 22. The plainneſs and ſimplicity of the life (which bows to God, and cannot regard man in the tranſgreſſion) ſeems rude and unmannerly to the lofty Spirit of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His ſilence at the Teſtimonies brought againſt him, and to the high Prieſt when he queſtioned him, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.60, 61. Indeed either the ſpeaking or ſilence in the life, is offenſive to the carnal profeſſor, who knoweth not the Law of the life in this particular, but can either ſpeak or be ſilent according to his own will. This is the difference between the true and the falſe Chriſtian; The falſe Chriſtian, his knowledg and Religion ſtands in his own will, in his own underſtanding, (he ſpeaks in his own time) both which are crucified in him that is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When he did ſpeak the truth of himſelf, the high Prieſt <hi>rent his cloaths,</hi> and charged him with blaſphemy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.64. And thoſe that were by, fell in with the high Prieſt, and ſaid he was <hi>guilty of death,</hi> verſ. 66. Then they <hi>ſpet on his face and buffetted him, and ſmote him, and mocked him, and blindfolded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45702:10"/>
him, and ſtruck him on the face, bidding him propheſie, who ſmote him, Mat.</hi> 26.67, 68. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.63, 64.</p>
            <p>When they brought him to <hi>Pilate,</hi> they would have <hi>Pilate</hi> take it for granted that he was an evil doer, and worthy of death, for when <hi>Pilate</hi> asked for their accuſation againſt him, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>if he were not a Malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee, John</hi> 18.29, 30. <hi>Pilate</hi> refuſing ſo to proceed in judgment, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 31.) they begin to bring in their charges, <hi>we found this fellow perverting the Nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caeſar, ſaying, that he himſelf is Chriſt a King, Luke</hi> 23.2. <hi>Pilate</hi> examines him herein, but profeſſes he can find no fault in him at all, <hi>John</hi> 18.38. Then the chief Prieſts accuſed him of many other things, (<hi>Mark</hi> 15.3. and were more fierce, ſaying, <hi>he ſtirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jury, beginning from Galilee to this place.</hi> (This indeed was his great offence, he taught with the authority of the Spirit, and not as the Scribes.) Then <hi>Pilate</hi> ſent him to <hi>Herod</hi> (where the chief Prieſts and Scribes ſtood vehemently accuſing him) who queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him much, but he anſwered him nothing. And <hi>Herod, with his men of War, ſet him at naught, and mocked him, and aray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a gorgeous robe, and ſent him back to Pilate, Luke</hi> 23.9, 10, 11. <hi>Pilate</hi> profeſſed that he could not find him guilty of this ſecond charge neither of perverting the people, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. therefore chaſtiſing him, he would releaſe him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. But the people (by the perſwaſion of the chief Prieſts and Elders) cried all at once, <hi>Away with this man, and releaſe unto us Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> verſ. 18. but let him be crucified, <hi>crucifie him, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him,</hi> verſ. 21. &amp;c. Now when <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſcourged him, and the Souldiers had ſtripped him, and put on him a Scarlet Robe, and had put a Crown of platted Thornes on his head, and a Reed in his right hand, and had bowed the knee to him in <hi>Mockery,</hi> and ſpit on him, and ſmote him with a Reed, he brings him forth to them again, hoping this might appeaſe there malice, and they might be content to ſpare his being crucified. They tell him they have a Law, and by their Law he ought to dye, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God, <hi>John</hi> 19. verſ. 4. to 8. (ſee how they turn and wind every way to make the innocent an offender, and to make ſome Law, of one kind or other, take hold of him!) But when all their accuſations would not prevail with <hi>Pilate,</hi> but ſtill (from the ſenſe of his innocency)
<pb facs="tcp:45702:11"/>
he had a mind to releaſe him, they uſe another ſubtile artifice, telling him, <hi>if he let this man go, he was not Caeſars friend, John</hi> 19.12. This carries it with <hi>Pilate,</hi> now he diſputes no further, but delivers him up to their will, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.5.</p>
            <p>Now thou, who readeſt this, take heed of judging the Jews for all this wickedneſs, while the ſame nature is alive in thee, which did all this in them: for aſſuredly thou (in whom that nature, which did it in them, is not ſubdued) wouldſt have done the ſame thing, hadſt thou lived in thoſe dayes. Thou that diſdaineſt and perſecuteſt the appearance of Chriſt in this age, whuldſt have diſdained, &amp; have perſecuted his appearance in that age, do not deceive thy Soul.</p>
            <p>The Jews did as little think, that ever they ſhould have put a Prophet, or any good man to death (much leſs the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) as thou canſt: yea, they could blame their Fathers for killing the Prophets, and ſay; if they had lived in thoſe dayes, they would not have done it: and yet doſt thou not read what they did? The perſecuting Spirit was ever blind, and could in no age read its evil and bitter nature, and its enmity againſt the life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Be not thou blind in thy day (as they were in theirs) and an enemy under pretence of being a friend.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another exception or argument againſt him about the time of his ſuffering death, was, that he did not put forth his power to ſave himſelf from the croſs, <hi>he ſaved others, let him ſave himſelf,</hi> if he be Chriſt the choſen of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.35. Is it likely that this is the Son of God, and that he did ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by the power of God, and cannot now ſave himſelf from the croſs? This his ſuffering death on the Croſs did a little ſtumble ſome of the Diſciples (as may appear, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.20, 21.) and was enough to have overturned the faith (of any) which ſtood not in the Spirit, and in the power. The Souldiers alſo could mock and manage this argument againſt him, ſaying, <hi>If thou be the King of the Jews, ſave thy ſelf, Luke</hi> 23.37. And they that paſſed by, reviled him, wagging their heads and ſaying, <hi>Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple, and buildeſt it in three dayes, ſave thy ſelf; If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs, Mat.</hi> 27.39, 40. Likewiſe the chief Prieſts with the Scribes and Elders, mocked among themſelves, ſaying, <hi>he ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. Let Chriſt the King of Iſrael deſcend now from the Croſs, that we may ſee and believe, Mark.</hi> 15.31, 32. One of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45702:11"/>
Thieves alſo railed on him ſaying, <hi>If thou be the Chriſt ſave thy ſelf and us, Luke</hi> 23.39. And when he cryed out to his God, <hi>Eli, Eli,</hi> &amp;c. they derided him, <hi>This man calleth for Elias, let us ſee whether Elias will come to ſave him, Mat.</hi> 27.47, 49. And after he was dead, the chief Prieſts and Phariſees ſpake of him, as of a known deceiver, <hi>verſ.</hi> 63. And ſeem in a pious zeal for the Church, to take care that there be no further occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after his death, for the reviving and ſpreading of his deceit and errors, <hi>verſ.</hi> 64. Thus the holy one, the pure one, the juſt and true one, (in whoſe heart and mouth was no guile found) was numbred among tranſgreſſors, accounted a deceiver, and put to death as a blaſphemer by the zealous prieſts and profeſſors of that age, who were ſo confident of the righteouſneſs of their cauſe (on the behalf of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their Sabbaths, Temple, &amp;c.) againſt him, that when <hi>Pilate</hi> waſhed his hands as clear of his bloud, all the people anſwered and ſaid, <hi>his bloud be on us, and on our children, Mat.</hi> 27.25.</p>
            <p>Now let men conſider what the great exceptions are, which they have againſt the living appearance of Chriſt in his Spirit (now towards the cloſe of the apoſtacy) and againſt us his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, whom the Lord hath called forth to teſtifie to his name. Many exceptions men have againſt our <hi>Perſons,</hi> our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> our <hi>Practiſes,</hi> for <hi>want of miracles,</hi> &amp;c. Is this generation more wiſe, or juſt in their exceptions then the former was? Conſider the main ones a little.</p>
            <p>Their great exceptions againſt our <hi>Doctrine</hi> are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we preach up a light within, and that he that receiveth that light receiveth a perfect gift; and growing up in it, groweth up to perfection, which in this life (through faith and obedience to this light or perfect gift) may be attained, and the body of ſin put off, and the new man Chriſt put on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed we cannot but preach up the light within, and declare unto men how great things it hath done for us, even that which we could never by any means meet with, from any light without. And this is perfect, and tends to make perfect, carrying on its work daily. Now he that feels its virtue, cannot doubt of its power. He that ſeeth the body of ſin daily going off, cannot doubt but he may be ſtripped. Indeed if a man ſtrive againſt ſin in his own will, (and by his own gathered knowledg)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45702:12"/>
he cannot get much ground, and ſo it is hard for him to believe perfection. But he that feels unity with that which is perfect, cannot but acknowledg that it is able to perfect him, and in faith and patience is encouraged to hope and wait for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That we deny that Chriſt which dyed at Jeruſalem, and his imputed righteouſneſs, and ſet up an inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know no other Chriſt then that which dyed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> only we confeſs our cheif knowledg of him is in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And as Chriſt ſaid in the dayes of his fleſh, that the way to know his Father, was to know him; and that he that knew him, knew the father alſo. So we now witneſs, that the way to know Chriſt is to know the Spirit; and that he that knoweth the Spirit, knoweth Chriſt alſo, with whom Chriſt is one, and from whom he cannot be ſeperated. And as for <hi>imputed righteouſneſs,</hi> it is too pretious a thing to us for to be denyed by us. That which we deny is mens putting of it out of its place, applying it to them who are not in the true faith, and walk not in the true light: for in the true light (where the fellowſhip is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son) there alone the bloud cleanſeth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. and there alone the righteouſneſs is imputed to him, who is cleanſed by the bloud in the light, and not to him who knows it not. And as for <hi>inherent righteouſneſs,</hi> we meddle not with that word, but this we ſay; That our life exceedingly lies in feeling the righteouſneſs of Chriſt wrought, and revealed in us; and we wiſh men could come out of the reaſoning about it, into the feeling of the ſame thing with us: for then we are ſure they would not ſo ſharply, nor ſo long contend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That we deny the Ordinances and means of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny nothing that the Apoſtles or Chriſtians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly practiſed, nor do we deny any thing that any now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the light, and in the faith: but the ſetting up of ſuch things in the will, that we deny; or the imitating theſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the command of the Spirit, that we deny alſo. And this we teſtifie, that Antichriſt crept in here, and that they are his great cover to keep men from the life, and therefore warn men to mind the life, and to take heed they be not kept from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by the ſhadows, where Antichriſt lies lurcking to bewitch from the ſubſtance. And we are ſure that theſe in Antichriſts hands, are not the means of Salvation; but keep from the ſight
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45702:12"/>
of the holy City, where the life and Salvation is. And we read that the <hi>outward Court</hi> was given to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; who <hi>trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the holy City, Revel.</hi> 11.2. And we have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that while we our ſelves were crying up the outward Court, we did trample under foot the holy City, though we then knew it not.</p>
            <p>Their exceptions againſt our <hi>Perſons</hi> are, that we are <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, illiterate,</hi> and alſo <hi>unſetled Perſons</hi> (who have ſtill been ſeeking up and down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What Perſons are fitteſt for God to make uſe of, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the recovery of his People out of the Apoſtacy? Doth not God chuſe that which is weak, and mean, and contemptible, that his glory might the more appear? Is not this a more likely way for him to ſteal upon the World, then if he appeared in the wiſe and learned ones? And among whom is his appearing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected? among thoſe who are ſetled upon their lees in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy; or among thoſe who have mourned, panted, and ſought to come out of it, and could not be ſetled without his appearing to them, and fixing of their feet upon the Rock. But have we been unſetled, ſince God hath faſtned us on the living Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nay, here is no more going out, but he that abides faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, remains a pillar in the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>Men except likewiſe againſt our <hi>practiſes,</hi> as that we ſhew not <hi>reſpect to perſons,</hi> and that we are not <hi>ſtrict</hi> (after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) <hi>in duties,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have heard that voice, <hi>Fear God, and give Glory to him, Revel.</hi> 14.7. (not only as it is written there, but in Spirit:) and where the Lord is exalted, the glory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture falls: read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. how all falls in that day, that God alone might be exalted. And we cannot, in this mighty day of the Lord, any longer give to man that honour which he hath gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the fall, and which pleaſeth the fallen nature, and not that which is borne of God. And for <hi>duties,</hi> we have bewailed (in the ſight of the Lord) our former running into duties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Spirit: and we muſt confeſs we can only pray in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſing in the Spirit, wait in the Spirit, ſpeak in the Spirit (as that gives utterance) and not of our ſelves, or when we will, but as we feel life (ſtrength and power from on high) leading and aſſiſting us. And our religion conſiſts neither in willing nor run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but in waiting on the Spirit and power of the Lord, to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45702:13"/>
work all in us and for us. All theſe things we look upon to be our duty, and practiſe them.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe excepted againſt us, that we do not <hi>work Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We point to that which wrought all the outward Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles formerly, and which now worketh great inward Miracles in ſpirit: and we are ſure the ſame power (which we have received the Goſpel in) is of the ſame healing virtue. But that power worketh according to the purpoſe of its own will, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of man (yea though <hi>Paul</hi> had the gift of healing, yet he <hi>left Trophimus at Miletum ſick,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.20.) neither was the will or wiſdome of man ſatisfied in all thoſe Miracles which Chriſt and the Apoſtles wrought. It is enough for us to feel and live in the moving of the power, in which we rejoyce and are more ſatisfied (that by it our names are written in the Book of Life) then we could by any ſuch outward and viſible appearance and manifeſtation of it. But if we did work outward Miracles, yet if thou hadſt not an inward eye to ſee them with, thou wouldſt not be able to diſtinguiſh by what power they were wrought.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe ſhould I mention any more particulars? Is it not enough? O fear before the Lord, and do not loſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpenſation of life through miſtake (or becauſe ye cannot have things ſuited to your corrupt wills) but know the Goſpel, which is an inward diſpenſation, and doth not conſiſt in outward ſhadows, but in inward virtue, life and power: for <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Spirit.</hi> Come to wait for that, to feel that, to unite there; and then we ſhall not differ about that which is outward. But it is Antichriſts way (by the Magiſtrates power) to force an agreement about the outward, which deſtroyes that tenderneſs of conſcience which prefer vs the inward.</p>
            <p>And now let me put one Queſtion to you; Where is the deceit of the ages after Chriſt to be expected? Did the Jews deny <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets Writings, or Ordinances? nay were they not very zealous for theſe? and were not theſe their cover, under which they perſecuted Chriſt, and vented all their malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? So can it be expected now, that the Deceivers of this age ſhould deny the Apoſtles writings, or the practiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned? Or is it not rather to be expected, that under their crying up of theſe, they ſhould hide their enmity againſt the life? Search and ſee, hath not every after-age of Profeſſors took up the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45702:13"/>
words and practiſes of them who were perſecuted in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age, and under the profeſſion of thoſe words and practiſes, have hid their ſpirit of perſecution? There is a remnant only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Profeſſors to be ſaved, the generallity of them have ſtill been perſecuters, creeping into the form, getting that for a cover upon their backs, and then fighting againſt the life and power. O wait on the Lord in his fear, that ye may be found worthy to know the perſecuted truth on the one hand, and the perſecuting ſpirit on the other hand in this day of large profeſſion, and alſo of bitter perſecution!</p>
            <p>Now what might be the cauſe, or how could it come to paſs, that the zealous Worſhippers of that age ſhould thus err in their zeal, and be thus heady and raſh againſt him, whom they looked for to be their Saviour? How came they thus to <hi>err in viſion, and ſtumble in judgment</hi> in ſo weighty a matter? Shew unto us the cauſe, that we may ſee whether the ſame cauſe be not in us? for undoubtedly if it be, it will produce the ſame effect, and ſo we may ignorantly draw upon our heads the ſame heavy wrath in our day, that they did in their day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The cauſes were very many, I may mention ſome few of the principal ones, which if they be ſeen into and removed, (by that power which is able to do it) ſuch as are of a more inferiour influence, will not be able to ſtand.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One cauſe of their blind zeal, and bitterneſs againſt Chriſt, was, <hi>Their ignorance of the Scriptures, and of the power of God.</hi> If they had known the Scriptures in the true light, they could not but have known Chriſt, from whom the Scriptures were given forth; And if they had known the power of God, they could not but have known him who came in the power, yea who was the power. They had knowledge enough of both theſe one way, that is in the Letter; They knew the words of Scripture (they could make large expoſitions of them) they knew what was ſaid in Scripture concerning the power of God, but they knew not the thing it ſelf; and ſo turned againſt it, and made uſe of the words (which came from it, and teſtified of it) againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond cauſe of this their ſad miſcarriage in their zeal, was, <hi>Their putting the Law and Ordinancee, and Writings of the Prophets out of their proper place.</hi> They exceedingly magnified, and cryed them up, in that carnal way wherein they apprehended and practiſed them, but underſtood not the right end and uſe of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45702:14"/>
them. And by theſe means, practiſing the ſhadows in the carnal mind, they loſt the ſubſtance, which the proper uſe of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows was to have pointed them unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Their high conceits of the goodneſs of their ſtate in relation to God, and of the certainty of their knowledge of the truths of God from</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets.</hi> They were confident that they knew God aright, and that he was their father, and that they were his children and people. And ſo Chriſt appearing in a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrariety to theſe (notwithſtanding all his powerful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and miracles) they made no queſtion but they might boldly conclude him, not to be of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſts coming in a way that they looked not for him.</hi> They had concluded from the Scriptures, how Chriſt muſt appear, and he coming in a far different manner, they could not own him, but looked upon him as a Deceiver, one that pretended to be Chriſt, but was not like to what the Scripture ſaid of Chriſt. So what the Scripture ſaith of Chriſts ſecond coming, is hid as much from the carnal eye of profeſſors in this age, as what was ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his firſt coming, was hid from them in their age; and he will ſteal upon them as a Thief, at a time, and in a way, and after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they expect not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. (Which is the main one, and the cauſe of all the former) <hi>Becauſe they were from the light within,</hi> from the true light in their own hearts and conſciences. The light within is the great Ordinance of God, and the proper means to give the knowledge of him, (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) without which it was never received under any diſpenſation: for the light that ſhines abroad (or from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) can alone be known and received by the light that ſhines within. Chriſt himſelf opens this in a Parable; <hi>The light of the body</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the eye; if therefore thine eye be ſingle,</hi> (clear, without beams or moats) <hi>thy whole body ſhall be full of light,</hi> Mat. 6.22. But if that be evil, if that be dark, if that be cloſed by the God of the world, all <hi>Moſes</hi> words, all the Prophets words, yea all Chriſts and his Apoſtles words, cannot give thee light. Can I ſee the light of the Sun, Moon, or Stars, (or of any fire or candle) if I have not a natural eye, and if that natural eye be not open? So neither can I ſee the light of any diſpenſation of life, if I have not an eye within me open, wherewith to ſee it. So that that which gives me the ſight of the things of God, is the eye which God hath given me. By that may be read the eternal power and God-head
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45702:14"/>
in the creatures, in the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, in the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, as the ſpirit leads and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. Yea the ſame ſpirit that opened to theſe without Books, may again open to any of us without Books at his pleaſure, (and will not be limited to Books) and we then may read alſo as they did, even within in the ſpirit, and in the immediate life; but without this, can none of the things of God be read aright. Now the God of this world had blinded this eye in the Jews, yea they themſelves had <hi>ſtopped their ears, and cloſed their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. they would not ſee this way, they would not be converted and healed this way. They would keep up the knowledge, which they had gathered from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets without this eye; and with that they would ſee, or not at all.</p>
            <p>Thus being from the light within, they could not ſee the place of life within, where life is to be received: they could not ſee the wombe of wiſdom, which is within, and ſo could not enter into it, and be born again. And being not born of the wiſdome, how could they juſtifie the wiſdome? being not born of the light, how could they know or own Chriſt, whoſe coming and appearance was in the light? For that appearance of Chriſt the life, in that body of fleſh, could not be diſcerned by all mens wiſdome in the letter, (the Diſciples themſelves came not ſo to know it) but <hi>my Father which is in Heaven hath revealed it to you.</hi> And mark it, the Diſciples, who were illiterate and not ſo knowing of the Scriptures that were written of Chriſt, yet they knew Chriſt: and the Scribes and Phariſees, which were very skilful in the letter, could not know him. What was the reaſon? The reaſon lay in the difference of the eye, or light wherewith they looked: the one looked with an outward eye, the other with an inward eye. And a little inward light wil do that, which a great deal of outward light will not do. And this I can certainly affirm, that all the light that men can gather from the Scriptures, cannot give them the knowledge of Chriſt as he hath appeared in this age, nay nor as he hath appeared in any age ſince the daies of the Apoſtles: but a little true inward light will give the knowledge of this thing, and open thoſe Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly (in its ſeaſon) which all the Generations of wiſe and learned men have been controverting and diſputing about, in that wiſdome and ſearching ſpirit which is never to underſtand them. This then is the main and full reaſon of this deep error of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45702:15"/>
the Jews, and their deſperate ſplitting upon the rock, which would have ſaved them, <hi>They were begotten of the Letter which was given forth in former ages, but not of the life which was raiſed up in their age</hi>: and ſo they knew not how to turn to the light within, which alone was able to give them the true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the things of God.</p>
            <p>Now conſider theſe things well. O ye Profeſſors of this age, and take heed that ye do not fall after the ſame example of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear.</hi> Be not ſo confident of what you have gathered by your wiſdom for truth from the Scriptures, (after the manner that they were, of what they had gathered by their wiſdome) but fear leſt ye ſhould be miſtaken, as they were: and wait for the opening of that eye in you, which was ſhut in them, even the true eye, in the true Light, by the holy anointing, where there never was, nor can be any miſtake. The Jews fell <hi>by unbeleif</hi>; unbeleif of what? They beleeved the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they beleeved according to that knowledg they had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Scriptures: but they did not beleeve in the living word. They had a knowledge abiding in them, which they had gathered from the Scriptures, but they had not the living word abiding in them; and ſo their faith was but unbeleif: (for the living faith, ſtands in beleif of the living word in the heart, which the Scriptures direct to; without the knowledge of which, all knowledge of words is vain; and without faith in which, all faith is vain alſo) Now ſaith the Apoſtle to the Gentile-Chriſtians, <hi>Thou ſtandeſt by faith,</hi> Rom. 11.20. by what Faith? By Faith in that word in the heart, which they neglected and turned from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. for <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught them, after the Laws and Ordinances, about worſhip and ſacrifices, that the word that they were to obey and do (the word that could give them life, and make them obedient to all the commandements without) was in their heart and mouth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.14. and ſo the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> when they propoſed ſacrifices, and Oil, to pleaſe God with, he brings them to this which was given to them in common with mankind, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. for all Ordinances and Laws, and obſervations, and practiſes without, are but to bring to the life within, which is to be found again there, where it was loſt, and ſtill lies ſlain and hid (even in the feild, or houſe where it was loſt.) And he that ſeeks abroad, never finds it; but when the candle is lighted in his own houſe, and he ſearches narrowly in the feild in his own
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45702:15"/>
heart, and the eternal eye begins to open in him, then he cries out, God was in this place, and I was not aware of it Ah how the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my bewiched me, to run from mountain to mountain, and from hill to hill, and hath hereby covered my eye from beholding the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords houſe, and from feeling the ſpring of my life, which I further and further ran from, all the while I was ſeeking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Therefore O ye Profeſſors, be not ſo conceited like the Jews, and running after them into their deſolation and miſery, but learn wiſdome by their fall! Do not you ſet up your Ordinances and Scriptures, after the manner that they ſet up theirs: for this is your Danger: for this I clearly, in the Light of the Lord, teſtifie to you: that if ye gather a knowledge and wiſdom from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scriptures, after the manner that they did, without knowledge of the word within, and without a light within from that word, ye loſe the living faith, ye are but dead branches, and all your knowledge of Scriptures, and practiſes, and Faith, and Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ye here hold and obſerve, are but for the fire; and the flames of eternal wrath, ſhall kindle more fiercely upon you becauſe of them, then upon the Jews: for ye ſtumble at the ſame ſtumbling ſtone, at which they ſtumbled and fell, and it will fall upon you alſo. And as you have more Scriptures, then they had, and the experience of their fall to warn you: ſo your deſtruction will be exceeding dreadful if ye neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, where of at this day there are ſo many living &amp; powerful witneſſes, as they are known and owned to be in the light of the Lord, though deſpiſed in your exalted and conceited wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Now to help any honeſt and ſingle hearts among you, over this great ſtumbling block of a light within, conſider theſe few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all the knowledge (all the true knowledge) that ever ye had of God was from a light within. I do not deny that ye might receive your knowledge through the Scriptures (and ſome warmth formerly in thoſe things which ye call Ordinances, and duties) but that whereby ye received the knowledge, was the light within, the eye that God ſecretly opened in your ſpirits. This was the way ye then came by it, though ye perhaps might feel the thing, but not know how ye came by it: even as a Babe may ſee truly, but doth not underſtand its own eye, or knows how it ſees.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45702:16"/>2. While this eye was kept open in you, your knowledge was true in its meaſure, and ſerviceable to you, and did draw you neerer to God, making ye truly tender, meek, ſweet, humble, patient, loving, gentle, and full of pretious breathings towards God, and after righteouſneſs. O how lovely were you to God in this ſtate! <hi>when Iſrael was a child, I loved him.</hi> God remembreth at this day the kindneſs of your youth, and is ſeeking after you, O why do ye ſo harden your hearts againſt him!</p>
            <p n="3">3. That wherever this eye is ſhut, the vertue of the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is loſt, and the ſweet fruits thereof wither. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the knowledg may be retained, yea, perhaps much increaſed, but the life is gone, and the pure ſweet Savouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (to God) vaniſhed. And if this eye were but a little open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again in you, your death and unſavourineſs might be ſoon ſeen and felt by you in all your knowledge, duties, ordinances, yea in your very graces and experiences. You have a faith ſtill, yea, but it wants the ſavour of your former faith: ye have ſome kind of love, gentleneſs, and meekneſs; yea, but it is but a thing formed by the fleſhly wiſdome <hi>and reaſoning,</hi> but not natural from the living ſpring, not ſuch as ye once felt, &amp;c. for the true and living eye being ſhut, that which is then beſt (or afterwards attained) is held but in the dead part, and ſerves but to feed death.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The great work and deſign of the enemy of your Souls, is not to ſteal away the bulk of your knowledg, or to draw you from ordinances, or duties, but to ſteal the life out of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. This I have experimented from my child-hood, I might ſtill have knowledg enough of any kind, but that which I wanted was life, and I was ſtill ſick under all the ſorts of knowledge that ever I met with, and under all ordinances and duties, for want of life. The Lord had given my ſoul a taſte of true life, whereby I became unſatisfied without it, and no manner of knowledge or enjoyment could take me up by the way: yea, when through extremity, I ſeemed willing to be content with any thing, yet ſtill my heart was ſick after that one thing, which alone could truly eaſe and ſatisfie it. Now if the enemy can but prevail here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to blind the inward eye, and ſteal away the life within, he hath enough. Then abound, as much as thou wilt, in knowledg, in zeal, in duties, in ordinances, in reading Scriptures, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45702:16"/>
meditating, &amp;c. thou art the ſurer his hereby, and ſo much the better ſervant to him: for how much the richer thou art in knowledge, experiences, hopes and aſſurance (without the life and power) ſo much the more acceptable, and honourable, and uſeful art thou in his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſee where ye are; Is the inward eye open in you? do ye know the light within? (ſurely he that ſees by a light within, can hardly ſpeak evil of it!) or hath the enemy, by ſome of his artifices, drawn a vail over that eye, wherewith ye once ſaw in ſome meaſure? O be not ſlight in a matter of ſo great weight! O pleaſe not your ſelves with the eye of the periſhing wiſdome, with deaths eye, and with deaths knowledge of Scriptures, and of the Son of God, which ſpeaks great words of the fame of true wiſdome, but is a ſtranger and enemy to the thing! O, life is pretious, eternal life is pretious. To have the word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the heart, and to feel the true light giving the true life, who can ſet a value on this! Ah do not looſe your Souls for a trifle, for a little ſuch knowledge of Scriptures as the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part can gather! (This I cannot but exceedingly deſpiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scriptures I truly honour, for their teſtimony of that whereby I live) if ye ſee not the way of life by the inward light (which alone can ſhew it) ye looſe your Souls. If the God of the World hath blinded that eye in you, what are all your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome and knowledg? What are all your hopes? and what will become of you? All theſe ſparks of your own kindling from Scripture, will not ſecure you from the bed of ſorrow. O ſeveral ſorts of profeſſors why will ye dye with the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? why will ye go down into the pit, among them that know not the Lord?</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay to this generation? The ſpiritually-wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth the ſtorm, and hideth himſelf; but the ſpiritually-foolliſh run on headily, and are puniſhed. The cloudes have long been gathering, but the ſick eye cannot diſcern the ſigns and ſeaſons of the times, and ſo becauſe judgment comes not as men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they grow hard, and wear off the the ſenſe, wherewith they were ſomewhat affected at the firſt threatning of it. But aſſuredly both judgment and mercy haſten, and they will come, and will not tarry.</p>
            <p>For the ſame Lord God Almighty, which confounded the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45702:17"/>
heathens Babel (when their ſins and vain confidence was ripe) which they built to prevent any future floud. For though they once had the true knowledg of God from an inward light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. yet they ſoon left that, <hi>not liking to retain God in their knowledge,</hi> verſ. 28. but running out into <hi>imaginations,</hi> and ſo building a <hi>Babel,</hi> whereby their fooliſh hearts became dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the light, which God had made to ſhine in them, which ſhewed what might be known of God unto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Yea the Lord God which overthrew the Jews Babel, which they had built from their knowledg of the Laws and ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Scriptures written to them (they running out into imaginations alſo) whereby they likewiſe thought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>the overflowing ſcourge</hi> from coming near them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.15.</p>
            <p>The ſame God will overthrow the Chriſtians <hi>Babel,</hi> which they have built from the Prophets and Apoſtles words, (by their own imaginations, and conceivings, in the high mindedneſs, out of the fear) whereby they think to eſcape the deluge of eternal wrath: (for their City alſo ſhall be <hi>thrown down with violence, and ſhall be found no more at all, Revel.</hi> 18.21.)
