            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief and Summary Narrative of the many Miſchiefs and Inconveniencies in former Times as well as of late Years, occaſioned by Naturalizing of Aliens.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Wiſdom of all Ages hath accounted it one of the greateſt acts of Prudence to cheriſh and incourage all ſuch perſons and things as have moſtly tended to the preſervation of the general Body of Men in an united, peaceable, and proſperous Eſtate; And as the natural Body is moſt at eaſe, and in the moſt calm and ſerene Eſtate, when diſcharged of thoſe ill humours which do ſurcharge and weaken nature: So alſo doth the Body Politick beſt flouriſh and thrive when diſcharged of Incroachments and Inroads made on the Native Liberties and Priviledges, by the Law of Nature due unto them. Hence is it that Princes in former Ages, have always taken care to make a diſtinction between natural born Subjects and Aliens of other Kingdoms, and have never incouraged, nor indeed tolerated them in any thing further than that which might directly, or collaterally be judged and eſteemed for the intereſt of their Natives. Neither were Aliens in any Age for any propoſed advantages favoured and eaſed in any thing; but Experience immediately diſcovered many greater Miſchiefs to attend. Some of which are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in an Act made for redreſſing thoſe Grievances, <hi>An.</hi> 1. <hi>Henrici Septimi cap.</hi> 2. and are hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>Firſt, and principally, The advancing Aliens in Riches and Honour, and impoveriſhing the Native Subjects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The exhauſting the Treaſure of the Nation, and remitting the ſame into Foreign Nations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The great hurt in impairing and leſſening the King and Queens Cuſtoms, the publick Revenue of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Merchants Aliens colour the Goods and Merchandizes of other Strangers (not Naturalized or made Denizons) and Export great and conſiderable ſubſtance in their Names.</p>
            <p>Herewith agree the Statutes of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. purſuant to the deſign of which Laws, few or no Aliens were Naturalized during the Reigns of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James.</hi> And how greatly the Trade and Wealth of the Nation were thereby increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed during the proſperous Reigns of the two latter of the ſaid Princes, none that are converſant in Hiſtory can be ignorant of. And then it was rare to hear of a Merchant that failed: So that the Clothing Trade was in great requeſt abroad: And the Clothiers and Country Farmers did much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Eſtates, by the punctual Payments that were made for thoſe Commodities, and the good price the ſame then bore.</p>
            <p>Beſides which Miſchiefs, experience hath diſcovered further inconveniencies, in admitting Aliens and Strangers to have and enjoy a free Trade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal Terms with their Majeſties Native Subjects. As</p>
            <p>That the Trade, by Commiſſion would be by Aliens taken out of the hands of their Majeſties Subjects, both at home and abroad, and the Engliſh Merchants would be underſold in the prices of their Commodities by Aliens, who can live more hardly, and at leſs Charges, in Lodgings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the King and Queens Subjects, to the diſcouragement of the Gentry, in training up their younger Sons in Trade, which was formerly eſteemed and proved a good Proviſion for them, and many arrived thereby to great Eſtates and preferment formerly, which few now do.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond rule in the Book of Rates, annexed to the Act of Tonnage and Poundage, Goods Imported, and again Exported by Engliſh in twelve Months, and Aliens in nine Months, draw back from their Majeſties half the Cuſtoms paid by them on the Importation, and in ſome Caſes more than half. And how much more of their Majeſties Treaſure will be exhauſted, by admitting Aliens to the ſame advantages of Trade with the Engliſh, by Naturalization in this very Caſe, may eaſily be computed; They being allowed three Months longer time to Export their Goods, and draw back half Cuſtom, than if they were not Naturalized they are allowed by the ſaid Act and Rule.</p>
            <p>By the Act of Tonnage and Poundage, Merchants Engliſh ſuſtaining loſs in their Goods Exported, by Enemies, Pirates, or periſhing in the Sea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> back the whole Cuſtom from his Majeſty, which prejudice their Majeſties will ſuſtain from Aliens Naturalized.</p>
            <p>By the Act of Navigation for the increaſe of Mariners and Shipping, It's provided, that ſundry Commodities, ſuch as Maſts, Timber Boards, Foreign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Pitch, Tarr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> imported in any other Ship or Veſſel than what is Engliſh built, or truly, and without fraud, belonging to the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and which is otherwiſe Navigated and Manned than the ſaid Act directs (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Maſter, and three fourths of the Mariners, not being Engliſh, ſhall be deemed Aliens Goods, and pay Cuſtoms, and City, Town, and Port-Duties, as the Goods of Aliens. Now if Aliens be Naturalized, the true intent of this Act is fruſtrated, the Mariners diſcouraged, and driven into Foreign Parts for a Livelyhood, and the building of Shipping (the ſtrength of the Nation) made of little or no advantage.</p>
            <p>The increaſing the Importation of Commodities, and thereby their Majeſties Cuſtoms, the only advantage propoſed by the Naturalizing Aliens, will in half a years time, at furtheſt, be fruſtrated; Inaſmuch as this Nation cannot conſume all the Commodities Imported, which will occaſion the price to fall, and ſo the importation by conſequence to ceaſe: for it's evident, that no Commodity bears a price, and turns to accompt, but the ſupplies are ſo conſiderable in three Months, that the ſame becomes a Drug.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſides all which it's evident, That Naturalization of Aliens hath been a great cauſe of our Diviſions in Religion. And Errors both in Doctrine and Diſcipline have thereby privily crept into the Church. And principally the Papiſts have by this project greatly ſtrengthened their hands, and thereby gained opportunities of ſpreading their Erroneous Doctrine boldly and barefaced.</p>
            <p>And moreover it's not to be forgotten, That even in <hi>Holland,</hi> where for reaſons inconſiſtent with the nature and conſtitution of this Kingdom, they have admitted Foreigners to a Free Trade with them; Yet even there a very conſiderable difference is made between Aliens and Natives: for Aliens pay there, upon Importation or Exportation of their Commodities, conſiderable Duties and Tolls to the City, Town and Port, where they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e their Goods, which are not paid by Natives.</p>
            <p rend="indent">The ſumme of all is, That it ſhould ſeem great Prudence for all Engliſh Subjects, for the benefit of themſelves and their Poſterity, to uſe all diſcreet and lawful means to prevent the future Naturalization of Aliens; Or if any hereafter ſhall for weighty Reaſons be Naturalized, that it may be under this Proviſo, <q rend="margQuotes">That they pay a greater Cuſtom to their Majeſties for the Goods and Merchandizes they ſhall Import or Export, than their Majeſties Subjects pay. And all City, Town, and Port Tolls and Duties payable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Aliens:</q> And hereby will the Proteſtant Religion be more likely kept pure and undefiled; The Cuſtoms (being the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Revenue of the Nation) increaſed; The Honour and Intereſt of the Engliſh and Native Merchants be preſerved and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; The younger Sons of the Engliſh Gentry preferred; and generally the good of all their Majeſties Subjects be advanced.</p>
