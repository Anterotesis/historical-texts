            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>No Parliament but the Old: OR, A NEVV-YEARS GIFT For the late Interrupted PARLIAMENT, Now Reſtored to the Exerciſe of their Truſt: Ovvned by the Army, Expected by the People, and performed by God. Wherein is ſhewed by divers Reaſons, That the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth can receive at preſent no good, but much detriment in the Fundamenral Liberties of the Nation, and the Good Old Cauſe, if any other PARLIAMENT ſit but the late interrupted PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p n="1">1. NO men in the Nation are equally engaged, or ſo higly concerned to carry on the Good Old Cauſe as the preſent Parliament, who were violently hindered from ſitting. They only are thoroughly engaged againſt Kingſhip, and the <hi>Stewarts</hi> Family: and it is extream weakneſſe to think they can do ortherwiſe then eſtabliſh the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo as to keep out the one and the other for ever, as much as in them ſhall lye. Whereas we ſee the pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, formerly called by theſe Officers of the Army were ſo little concerned in the Good Old Cauſe, that they Voted a Single Perſon and Houſe of Lords, and would have made Mr. <hi>Oliver Crumwell</hi> King, if he had thought ſit to accept of their kindneſs that time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This late interrupted Parliament, being the only true Parliament, and the only true Authority of the Nation, no other Parliament can be called or choſen, and if it be, it is <hi>de facto</hi> nul and void, and all that they ſhall do is invallid; for there can be but one Parliament in <hi>England:</hi> And the preſent Parliament is that Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which cannot be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but by its own conſent or Act.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This preſent Parliament, having been Legally called, and not by the Sword-men, is only Legally above their reach, and which they cannot diſturbe without high preſumption; whereas a Parliament called by their luſts and pleaſures, will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſubject to be turned out by their Luſts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o chooſe a Parliament at the revolted Officers appointment, and to own ſuch a Parliament, is deſtructive to our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; for in ſo doing, we acknowledge the Sword-men to be Supream, and to have Regal Authority to Call, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to diſſolve Parliaments, which they will do King-like, as ſoon as they have raiſed them Money, and ſerved their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ends, or refuſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſacred and to all Generations Venerable Authority of Parliaments, is ſo weakened by the force put upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Parliament to hinder their ſitting, that Parliamentary Authority will be for ever invallid, and unable to ſecure the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Nations; unleſſe it be vindicated by Readmiſſion of this preſent Parliament to Exerciſe of their juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; For theſe or any other ſtrong party will be upon all occaſions encouraged to endeavour to do the like.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All Legal and juſt Authority, being to be conveighed in a Legal way from perſons in Authority, there is no other way way to ſet any future Authority on foot in this Nation, but by the preſent Parliament, which was Legally called, and can le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally give Order for the calling of future Parliaments. If the revolted Officers ſhould be allowed to call Parliaments the Nation falls from the Government of the Laws, to be governed by the Sword, which how ſad a condition that muſt needs prove, let all ſober men judge. Yea, let the preſent ambitious Sword-men conſider, what will become of their Poſterity in ſuch a condition; for they have no aſſurance, that their Children and Childrens Children, ſhall be Sword-men; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are like to be vaſſals to the Arbitrary Wills and Laws of Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let the revolted Officers, and all their adherents, lay their hands upon their hearrs and ſeriouſly conſider, that if they ſhall at laſt ſee their errour, and before they are compelled (which will be no thanks to them) permit the Parliament to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the exerciſe of their juſt Authority; thus accident all and great good will redound to the Nation by their Miſcarriages (as the ſaving of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family did ariſe from the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph</hi>) that Parliamentary Authority, will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exceedingly eſtabliſhed and ſtrengthened. For the Generaticusto come | will the more admire, and honour the ſacred Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Majeſty of Parliamentary Aſſemblies; and all ambitious perſons how powerful ſoever, will fear and dread to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Authority, when it ſhall be recorded and reported that a King of <hi>England,</hi> otherwiſe a virtuous perſon, being ſeduced by evil Councel to make War againſt a Parliament, was vanquiſhed with all his great Forces, and a General of their Conquering Army, having through ambition, offered violence to the ſaid Parliament, he had no happineſs after, it but ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened his daies with cares, fears, and ſorrows; and his Son could not ſtand after him; and the Officers of his Army were fain to recall the ſame Parliament; and when, being ſeduced, they had again interrupted them, there was no way to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, but to readmit them again to the exercie of their Authority, and to tranſmit the ſame to ſucceeding Parliaments. This I ſay will be a great eſtabliſhment of Parlianentary Authority, and conſequently a great good, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally flowing from their Miſcarriages, if they will be yet ſo wiſe before it be too late, to lay it to heart, which God grant they may.</p>
            <p>And let all true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> that love the Libertie of this Common-wealth, themſelves and Poſterity; take heed how they neddle to chooſe Parliament men to ſit by power of the Sword &amp; conſequently to be ſubject to the Luſt of Sword-men; and how they contribute to the weakening of all Parliamentary Authority for the time to come, by hindring any waies the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this preſent Parliament, without which, we muſt for ever be Governed by the Sword, or reduced again under the Fimily of the <hi>Stewarts:</hi> and which will be the better condition of the two, God all Wiſe only can tell-</p>
