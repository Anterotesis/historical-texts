            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was for your sakes that I first set my thoughts on this ensuing Treatise; For, having lived and laboured so many years amongst you already, I cannot look to abide long with you, and therefore have thought it meet to do my endeavour, that you may be able, after my decease, to have those things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in remembrance which you have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and continually taught <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14.</note>: Divers of which you will meet with in the reading of this Book, whereof, because I am willing to give you a taste, I shall reckon them up unto you in that order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you shall find them hereafter handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> You know I have laboured much with you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for the reading of Scripture, and to train up your children to be able to read it; Let me now leave it with you, not only to set your Eyes upon this Word of God, but to set your Hearts unto it, and (as much as in you lies) to draw and win the hearts of those belonging to you to it; for it is <hi>your life, and their life</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:39273:3"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have taken much pains, (both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, and from house to house <note n="(c)" place="margin">Act. 20.20.</note>,) to teach you, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you, and perswade you to a reverent recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Lords Supper: And now shall desire you to keep in mind that which you often have been minded of, which is, that they who come to that Sacrament should be before God twice; the first time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, the second time, receiving: Neglect not to prepare for Sermons (especially on the Lords-Day) but double your preparation at Sacraments, because there is a double work to be done, in regard of the meeting of two distinct Ordinances, that is, the Word and Sacrament to be partaked in together. Wash your hearts, (as you do your Vessels every day), but scour them, and make them bright for the Lords use on Sabbath, and Sacrament-dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have heard (especially in late times, wherein the shameful and shameless misusing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, hath enforced them to plead for their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I say, you have heard) many things to move you to a due estimation of the Ministry; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I shall say no more here, but only this; Take heed of esteeming too much of such Teachers as are not lawfully called, or too little of such as are. If painful teaching be not continued unto you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you had it; If it be, do not despise it; If you cannot have it at home, be not content to be without it; look not one upon another, but where you see there is Corn, repair thither <note n="(d)" place="margin">Gen. 42.1.</note>. Better stir, then starve.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of our Lords Sabbath-day, very much hath been spoken to you; the holy observation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being the Seed-plot and support of all Piety. It is
<pb facs="tcp:39273:3"/>
not a day of idleness, but of spiritual action <note n="(e)" place="margin">

And you that have need to work for your Bodies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies all the six dayes, have the more need to lay all other work aside on the Sabbath-day, and to look after your souls; making it your great, and even your only work then, to labour, not after the food that perisheth, but the meat that endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life <note n="(f)" place="margin">Joh. 6.27.</note>. To be very diligent all the Week-dayes, and to idle out the Lords-day, is, to be good Husbands and bad Christians; and such bad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are never good Husbands, for they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done at last <note n="(g)" place="margin">Amos 8.5, 6, 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You have still seen that I have made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> your Children and Servants, one part of my work, of which I shall say but a word now, namely, that it is so hard a thing to get any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and sense of Religion into the heads and hearts of ancient people, that therein all may see, (and you that are Parents and Housholders should take notice of it) what a necessary thing it is, to begin betimes with those that are young, and to instruct them in that knowledge and fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Family-Prayer hath been often taught <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and sought amongst you; for, How can Housholders expect the protection and success of their persons and labours in the day, or the safe keeping of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their children, servants, and substance in the night, yea, comfort and welfare day or night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God? or, How can they look to enjoy God without Prayer? for, He will be sought by the House of <hi>Israel</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39273:4"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Repetition of Sermons amongst you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> hath been my continual custom; that the things pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely delivered might be better understood, better remembred, better settled in your hearts; and that the power thereof might be more and better expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in your lives (which, you know, hath been the usual Prayer before Repetition).</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Lastly, I have encouraged and excited you to the duty of Singing of Psalms; And of late, it hath been my manner, in publike, to give you a short Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Psalm, before the singing of it, that you might better understand and mind the matter contained in it.</p>
            <p>Now, all these things I do here recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and again s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t before you, because spiritual things, though delivered often to weak hearers, are not quickly understood, are hardly committed to memory, are soon forgotten, or mistaken; when a printed Paper may easily be looked upon, seriously thought upon, and by often recourse to it, a fruitful and more full use, may be made of it.</p>
            <p>And whatsoever the things I here communicate (and do, as it were, bequeath to you, as my dear children in the Lord) shall be found, in themselves; yet the relation of Pastor and People under which we stand (and which is now of forty and four years standing), hath (I trust) such an endearment in it, as to render what I have written more profitable to you, by being more acceptable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more helpful, by being more grateful, and by your looking upon it with an Eye of Love.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned the time of my abode among you, It shall not be tedious to me, nor wil it (I hope)
<pb facs="tcp:39273:4"/>
be grievous to you, to review, and run over, in a generality, what hath passed in it; And therein will be found, something to be observed and marked; something to be humbled for; and something to praise God for.</p>
            <p>That which I invite you to take notice of, may be reduced to two heads:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Lords casting my lot amongst you,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and calling me to you by a more then ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: for it was by the free, and (as far as I know) unsollicited naming of me to it by a Person of Honour <note n="(i)" place="margin">L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Elles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere.</hi>
               </note> in whose gift it was; and the news of it was sent unto me then, when (being a Student in <hi>Oxford</hi>) neither this, nor any other Ministerial charge, was by me, either sought or thought of; which I mention (and mind you of) the rather, because, though I have had divers earnest invitations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to other places of more publike imployment; yet Gods more then usual Call to this Place, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made me to fear to forsake it, and I have still found much inward satisfaction in forsaking all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleaving to this. For God is the wisest disposer of his Servants, and He knows best in what part of his Vineyard to place his Labourers. Yet I condemn not all removals (if they be not self-remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals), but set a mark upon special disposals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You may not pass over, without seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observation, another remarkable Providence which is, that whensoever I have been forced from you, God hath provided otherwise for you. Twice (you remember) I have been taken off;</p>
            <p n="1">1. By suspension for three years space, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I could not be resolved to read the Book
<pb facs="tcp:39273:5"/>
of Liberty for Sports on the Lords-day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the distractions of the late sad times of Civil War, about so many years more. Yet in both these separations from you, God ordered it so, that such were present with you in all the time of my absence and restraint, by whom you were diligently and profitably instructed; which, as it is to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the one side, to shew how God provides sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes in the necessitated absence of Pastors; so, on the other side, it concerns you, (unto whom this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit hath been vouchsafed) to take notice, that, though you have not still had the same Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet God hath not suffered you to want that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual husbandry, which, if it be lacking but for a time, Bryars and Thorns grow up, and the envious man suddenly sows his Tares. Remember how much you are bound to that God that hath not left you without a teaching Minister, and without Law <note n="(k)" place="margin">2 Chr. 15.3.</note>; how much you are bound to be thankful, who have had the heavenly Manna in the Wilderness of this World forty years, and upwards; how much you are bound to be fruitful, who have had dressers of the Lords Vineyards so many years to dig and dung, and by all means to seek for fruit <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luk. 13.7, 8, 9.</note>; and, lastly, how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable you will be, if the door of your hearts be not opened, at which Christ hath still stood knocking, four and forty years together.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I must not dissemble, that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is matter of humiliation for us on both parts: for, as on my own part I willingly acknowledge much weakness, and want of bestirring my self among you, with that care, courage, compassion, diligence, and resolution that belongs to a Pastor; so you, on the
<pb facs="tcp:39273:5"/>
other part, have cause to take to heart that unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, whereby, though there hath been precept upon precept, line upon line <note n="(m)" place="margin">Isa. 28, 10.</note>, yet so little is learned; Not but that I think, and hope that (for the generality) it will be found, that there is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Religion in this, then in divers other Congregations that consist of poor and unlearned people; but yet it is to be lamented, that divers know so little in comparison of what they should and might have known, and have much need of milk still, because of their unskilfulness in the Word of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note n="(n)" place="margin">Heb. 6.13.</note>. But, besides this want of knowledge, I may say, My God hath humbled me <note n="(o)" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.21.</note> among you, and given cause of bewailing the great want of the power and practise of godliness. I confess, you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me with a conformity to the Ordinances and the Exercises of Religion. The matter of grief is, that there hath not been, in some, that sobriety in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; in others, that diligence and laboriousness in their Callings; and in many, that Christian patience that there ought to have been, but in stead thereof, many angry, and unbrotherly contentions, which is observed to be the disease, and is indeed, the great sin <note n="(p)" place="margin">Eph. 4.31.</note> and dishonour of this place, albeit I grant, there have been, of late, more occasions then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it; And it's true also, that the Devil is very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to make them worst that are taught most: Hence it is, that it is not to be wondered at, neither is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the Profession thereof, to be worse thought of for it, if here, or otherwhere, where the Gospel is preached, there be breakings forth not only into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bitterness, (which yet is very bad, and a giving a place to the Devil <note n="(q)" place="margin">Eph. 4.27.</note>, who plays his pranks,
<pb facs="tcp:39273:6"/>
and works his will very much in a passionate heart) but also into far fouler evils, as swearing, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, drunkenness, uncleanness, going to Witches and Wisards, (which is a going to Hell for help, when people be under the hand of Heaven). These more hainous offences I only name to you, because I believe divers, that have been guilty of some of them, have truly repented, and am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hope that others that are yet faulty in any of them, (being convinced in their Consciences of the evil and danger of things so horrible, and forbearing them more then heretofore) will not only leave them altogether, but abhor them and themselves for them: Which I desire the Lord to give them grace to do before it be too late.</p>
            <p>I am weary of this sad work, and therefore shall add only this; It had been a happy thing (my Brethren) both to you and to me, if divers aged persons had (as I perswade my self some have) become young Christians, and grown so wise, as not only to live soberly and righteously (which makes them good Neighbours, but not good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians), but also to live godly, that is, to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, and to aim in all things at the glory of God; O how little is there of this in many that are going into their grave? Nay, in stead of this comfort in older people, I have often, with much grief, observed, that by sundry of the younger sort, who have given some good hopes, in the beginning of their time, of their doing well, by their appearing in Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Hearing, and Noting Sermons, and Reading something of Scripture at home, as they have been
<pb facs="tcp:39273:6"/>
call'd to it; yet afterwards being grown up, and come to discover their dispositions, reading Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath been laid aside, Catechising shaken off, Noting Sermons neglected, the vain fashions of the world followed; and so the upshot and conclusion is, the living of a dull worldly life, with little sense of Religion, and losing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God which they seemed to have, or which it was hoped they would have had. The Lord open the eyes of such; and, Blessed be God, there are divers young ones that are not such.</p>
            <p>After all this, I shall say, and may truly say with the Apostle, <hi>I write not these things to shame you,</hi> or as if I thought there were not the like (or greater) cause of complaint in other places; <hi>but</hi> I write them <hi>as to my beloved Sons</hi> and Daughters <hi>to warn you</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.14.</note>, and to stir up both my self and you, that it may be yet better, by our making the best use we can of the little, and uncertain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of time of our being together as Pastor and People.</p>
            <p>I gladly pass from this, (which is displeasing to me, but I thought needful for you to affect you with your estate, that you might never rest till you be in a good estate); And come now to the third, and more comfortable thing, which is matter of Praising God, whereof there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> much; and that, Not only because I hope, and know, that the great God, (without whom, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters can do nothing, are nothing <note n="(s)" place="margin">Joh. 15.5 2 Cor. 12.11.</note>,) hath been pleas'd to make my Ministry profitable to divers neighbouring Parishes (at my first coming
<pb facs="tcp:39273:7"/>
hither, less provided for)—but especially for the good effect of it among you of this Congregation; The same Lord of the Harvest that hath brought (I may say) laborious preaching into this place, (where there was so little so long time before), hath blessed it here also so far as that, I doubt not, divers are gone to Heaven that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it, and are going thither who now enjoy it; Not so many (God knows) as were to be wished, but so many, as that it sufficiently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God had a gracious work to do when he sent his Word hither, upon the souls of poor people in this place.</p>
            <p>I shall not here forget that which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I have said, and be a sign of the hearty entertainment of the Gospel, which is, That you did so generally, lovingly, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire my return unto you, after I had been for some longer time absent, and when I was much desired otherwhere; This new Invitation I took as a second Call, and a new encouragement to settle with you: and therefore forsaking all other, I have kept my self (or rather, God hath kept me) only unto you, to spend and be spent for you <note n="(t)" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.15.</note>.</p>
            <p>Here also, I do with comfort remember, your greater respect to the Lords-day, more knowledge of, and preparation for the Lords-Supper, then is to be found in every place where the Word hath been, together with some more reverence of the presence and service of God in the publike Assembly; you do not use to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the blessing (as divers that make it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb facs="tcp:39273:7"/>
but it is a very profane custom, to go away before the Blessing be pronounced) but abide the whole time of divine Service; <hi>Jacob</hi> said, <hi>I will not let thee go from me</hi> 
               <note n="(u)" place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note>. They do well, that say, and resolve, Lord, I will not go from thee, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou blesse me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongst, and above divers other things, there is great cause of blessing God for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in attending Gods Word and Ordinances in the late Erroneous and Congregation-scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, wherein so many Christians have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably and fearfully faln from the truth and wayes of God, from whom, I know you have not wanted tentations to depart with them (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretence of greater light, and more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) from that written Word of God, which they that leave, or cross and contemn, have no morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-light in them <note n="(x)" place="margin">Isa. 8.20.</note>, and with a reverend and unfained respect whereunto, the greatest godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and holiness is ever-joyned, for it is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to godliness <note n="(y)" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.3. Tit. 1.1.</note>, that is, which requires true godliness, and stirs up and brings men thereunto: But by such tentations many have departed. To that God be glory, who is able to keep you, and hath kept you from so falling, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
            <p>I have little more to say, O that I could take off some of that which I have said, that is, all former Complaints, by seeing that done at last, which hath not been done at first; I mean, by seeing those that have lien in ignorance, become at length, knowing Christians: those that have been worldly minded, spiritual Christians, those
<pb facs="tcp:39273:8"/>
that have been loose and given to drinking, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Christians; and those who have been only sober, truly godly Christians! O that they that are old, (too like <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that dreamed of entring into his Mothers womb again) might be so far awakened and enlightened, as to enter (as it were) into the womb of the Church <note n="(z)" place="margin">Isa. 66.7, 8.</note>, and know experimentally what the great mystery of Regeneration means by having Christ, through the travail of the Ministery formed in them <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> to the glory of God, the sealing of the Ministry, and the salvation of their pretious Souls in the day of Jesus Christ, unto which they do so much hasten, and for which they must prepare now, or perish then.</p>
            <p>And (to speak yet again) O that you that are younger, would make conscience of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring your Creator in the dayes of your youth <note n="(b)" place="margin">Eccl. 12 1.</note>, and make it your business to grow in grace as you grow in years, not being ever the elder, the lower, but the taller Christian! It's a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing when a young man grows in nothing but in height, or in hair, (O how that grows in these dissolute dayes!), or in strength, or in wit, without having the wit to grow in the knowledge and fear of God: I say, this is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and most dangerous thing; for young men may die as well as old; if the Tower of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi> fall, it kills the youngest on whom it falls, as well as the oldest <note n="(c)" place="margin">Luk 13.4.</note>. In those lead-mines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of you labour, how many younger and stronger men have perished on a sudden? Now, if they that dye (whether they be old or young)
<pb facs="tcp:39273:8"/>
do not live in Jesus while they live, how shall they die in Jesus <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Thess. 4.14.—17.</note> when they die? and then, how shall they live with him when they are dead? And, Is it your mind, that the Lord Jesus should be in one place and you (when you are dead, and may die to morrow) in another, and that a contrary place, He in glory, and you in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that for evermore? Beloved, I am perswaded better things of you, and pray for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things in you; even things that accompany Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; though (because I would have you to hear) I thus speak <note n="(e)" place="margin">Heb. 6.9.</note>.</p>
            <p>I shall speak but once more, and I hope they that hear worst will hear me; Are you sure there is an Heaven? Do you believe there is an Hell? Do you know the Soul is Immortal and never dieth as the Body doth? And are you further perswaded, that where this never-dying Soul lodgeth and lyeth the first night after your death, (whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her it be in Heaven or in Hell) there it and you must lodge for ever? I say, Do you think all these things to be true? Let me then beseech you to shew your selves Christians, or to shew your selves Men <note n="(f)" place="margin">Isa. 46.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>, and live not securely in that loose course, walk not stubbornly in that wide way, which will certainly bring to the worse place; but, on the contrary, Strive to enter in at the straight-gate, and go in that narrow way (though it be against the hair, I mean, your own corrupt and undoing hearts) by walking wherein, you shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly come at last to the better place, and possess that everlasting life, which is the gift of God, through Jesus Christ <note n="(g)" place="margin">Rom. 6.13.</note> our Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39273:9"/>For this purpose I have written these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directions and Admonitions, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Guides, or Goads <note n="(h)" place="margin">Eccl. 12.11.</note> you will have, unto that which is good, when I am gone; but the better you observe these and all other godly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, the more hope you may have to have more of them, mean-while I leave these with you: which, if you have not other helps, will be the more needful; and, if you have other helps, will make them the more useful.</p>
            <p>That I might be more profitable to you, I have endeavoured plainness; yet, I confess, there is not so much of it as I intended or desired: for all men have not that gift of making known their mind to others in a plain and familiar way; And, (besides that), something must be yielded to more ripe Readers; and, in divers things, the matter hath carryed me above the capacity of many of you; but the better use you make of that which you do understand, the sooner you will understand the rest; and you being acquainted so long with my way of teaching, and manner of speaking, may know and find out (better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) what my meaning is.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Remember, that what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour long since said to prove himself the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, is fulfilled to you, which is this, <hi>The poor have the Gospel preached to them</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:39273:9"/>
that are poor in spirit <note n="(k)" place="margin">Matth. 5.3.</note>, that (though they have lived honestly among their neighbours) see themselves undone without a Saviour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they have little or nothing else (or whether they have or no) make sure to have Him; labour you to be in the number of those that are thus spiritually poor, (as by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, many of you are outwardly low). It's a lamentable thing when they that have little in this world, shall have nothing in the world to come, not so much as a drop of water to cool their tongue in that place of torment <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luk. 16.24.</note>. That it may not be so with you, Let me beseech you to study your Souls, to esteem the words of Gods mouth (whether you read them, or hear them <note n="(m)" place="margin">2 Chr. 36.12.</note>,) more then your necessary food <note n="(n)" place="margin">Job 23.12.</note>; to account one thing necessary, which is to sit at Jesus feet, and hear his Word from those whom he sends to speak to you <note n="(o)" place="margin">Luk. 10.39, 41. <hi>with</hi> Luk. 10.16.</note>. This will not hinder you from labouring for your living, for the Word of Christ binds you to it <note n="(p)" place="margin">Eph. 4.28.</note>, but it's necessary to know there is a more necessary labour, that is, to know what God would have done first, and to do it after; For your assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance wherein, I desire you to make conscience of the holy Exercises of Religion which are here commended unto you, that so you may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for bringing forth the fruits of godliness in your whole conversation; Consider what I have said, and the Lord give you understanding in all things <note n="(q)" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.7.</note>, and so bless unto you these, and all other Instructions, that you may thrive in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, grow in grace, and persevere in faith and

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit, the ensuing Instructions were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely framed for my own Charge, yet finding them to grow under my hand to a more full Treatise then was at first in my thoughts, and that now they are like to come into many hands, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it needful to say something by way of Preface, that what I have written may be more useful to any that shall think fit to read it.</p>
            <p>That which I have to say, concerneth the matter hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the manner of writing.</p>
            <p>The matter is wholly practical, save that necessity hath compelled me for the establishing of practical Truths, to mixe here and there that which is something controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</p>
            <p>All (as you may see) is referred unto two heads, that is, <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>-duties; Of each sort there are four. I shall, before-hand, give you a tast of them all.</p>
            <p>The first, of the first sort, is the reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which may well be put in the first place, because the written Word, is not only the Foundation of our Faith <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eph. 2.20.</note>, and the well-spring of saving wisdom <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note>, but also
<pb facs="tcp:39273:11"/>
the ground of Godliness <note n="(c)" place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note>, the guide of Practise <note n="(d)" place="margin">Prov. 1.10, 11.</note>, and a divine Directory for the performance of every good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby not only the Minister and Man of God, but the People of God, the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God Almighty, are educated unto, and throughly furnished for, every good work <note n="(e)" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.17.</note>. For the Scriptures are composed, not as the writings of Heathens, for vain-glory, but for mens Salvation; and the Spirit of God hath written them in a plain language, that all may easily see what is said (at least, as far as sufficeth for the guiding of their faith and carriage, and the safety of their souls,) and that no simple men (as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaks <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Concione</hi> 3. <hi>De Lazaro.</hi>
               </note>,) might make this excuse that the Scriptures are hard: for though there be difficulties therein, to take down mens pride; yet there is enough so plain, that not only Gods workman <note n="(g)" place="margin">2 Ttm. 2.15.</note>, (that is, the Minister) but any workman may see the way to Heaven, if he have eyes to see it; for, to see, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires sight as well as light.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the next place, there is more particular Instructions given concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and that not without need; For where Salvation lies at the one end, and Damnation at the other, there's great need of Direction; that where we seek for the better of these, we may not find the worse.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Subject, I have been constrained unto a little further search, both to give an account of my own sollici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ousness about that Sacrament; and withall, by reason of the different perswasions of some learned and godly men, who I hope, will candidly interpret my Discourse, because I have endeavoured to speak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the sense of Scripture, the consentient judgement of the Church of God, and with declaration of due respect to those from whom I somewhat dissent.</p>
            <p>This Sacrament-doctrine I have, in the close, digested into Questions and Answers; not only because that way of teaching is most easie and familiar, but also to lend some assistance unto godly Christians for the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of those belonging to their charge for that great
<pb facs="tcp:39273:11"/>
Ordinance, by the instructing and catechising of them before-hand in those things which it concerns such as would be worthy Communicants to be acquainted with; what I have now published for this end, I have long since framed, and have still used in the visiting of the Families of those committed to my care, that they might come to the Sacrament with more knowledge and conscience: But that which I conceived fit for them, will not be, (I shall hope), unprofitable to others. How many wayes have painful Pastors used to acquaint the People of this Nation, with God and his Ordinances, and to work in them a reverent respect thereunto, some one way, and some another? But whether it be <hi>I or they</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.11.</note>, it's the same thing for substance, and (perhaps) some may think so well of this way as to receive some benefit by it, and then I have what I aim at in it.</p>
            <p>The third Chapter concerneth the Ministry, and may serve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> also as an help and incitement to a religious and profitable hearing of the Word, albeit I make not a distinct Head of that Argument; for neglect of serious hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ariseth from a low or no account of those that preach them: As the preaching of the Word by men formed out of the clay <note n="(i)" place="margin">Job 33.6.</note>, and called to that high office is Gods Ordinance for mans Salvation <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21. 2 Cor. 4.6, 7.</note>; so the holding of such in reputation is mans assistance for the receiving of the benefit of it, it being very unlikely that men should be guided and ruled by those whom they do not regard. As long as there was any hope of the Jews, the Preface to their profiting was this, They will <hi>reverence</hi> my Son <note n="(l)" place="margin">Mat. 21.37.</note>; and a base opinion of him, or his being without any honour among them, made him useless to them <note n="(m)" place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The thing much thought of in this part of the Treatise, was, and is, to help to reduce (if God please so far to bless poor endeavours) those many Christians, who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the distemper of the times (for I am more willing to fix it upon that, then to think that so dismal a thing as their departure is, should arise out of their own hearts), I say, who by reason of the distemper and tentation of the late

As for others, all I shall say, is this, that perhaps some right Church-government, or some grievous Church-chastisement, will at length, bring those Professors of Religion, and godliness toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom a vast and too-unlimited a liberty, (good both for doing and undoing, as men were right or light) hath set so far and fearfully asunder.</p>
            <p>It's more then time for me to hasten to the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> head, wherein I have treated of the Christian or Lords-day Sabbath purposely, but in order thereunto have
<pb facs="tcp:39273:12"/>
spoken something of the Sabbath in generall.</p>
            <p>The great difficulty that there is in this Argument, I do with all humility, and deep sense of my own weakness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and therefore desire not that any thing here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed should be received but according as by Scripture, and Scripture-reason, it shall be found confirmed. But withal, I must crave leave to put the Reader in mind, that to judge rightly of, to reverence, rellish and receive, this, and divers other practical Truths, (namely those mentioned in this Treatise), two things are very needful,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A due respect to the General Rules of Holiness laid down in the Word of God. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Principle of Grace in the Heart (for the natural man receiveth not spiritual things <note n="(u)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note>,) that so there may be a consenting and closing with the Reason of Scripture, and the wisdom of God in the generalities thereof. Let all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians therefore in the fear of God, and setting the Word of God before their eyes, indifferently and conscientiously consider those four things which I shall now propound, and present unto them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether it be not more for Gods glory, the preserving and perpetuating of Religion, and the interest and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the Souls of men, to have a set and intire day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to meet together in publike Worship for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, acknowledging, serving and enjoying of God, then it is to have no such day?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If such a day be granted, Whether it be not needful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and best, that it should be within that proportion of time, which God himself hath described and prescribed in the fourth Commandement, that is; Whether it must not be a weekly day, or whether it will serve as well (for the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ends) to have it left to men to lay out for their God, a day of their own devising, and within such a circuit of time as they think fit? If any will rest a matter of so great a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Ecclesiastical constitution, I wonder what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men may or will assume so much to themselves as to appoint a day in their own devised distance, and impose it to be observed on the whole Community of Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:39273:13"/>
And if there be not in all the Christian world the same set day, how will the honour of God be diminished, which by the meeting of all the people of God together, to do hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to him, at one and the same time, is so remarkably heightened?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. If there must be a weekly day of Gods own Institution, whether there be any other day of the week that can lay so good a claim to that sacred Institution, and that hath such a divine Character put upon it, as the first day of the week, on which our Saviour rested from all his work; and compleated the Redemption of Man-kind in his glorious Resurrection, on which our great Lord hath set his own Name, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture <note n="(x)" place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note>, wherein also the holy Observation thereof is presented in Christian meetings, and such acts and exercises as suit with the solemn time of Christians assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themselves together <note n="(y)" place="margin">Act. 20.7. &amp; 1 Cor. 16.1,</note>, And which is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to be an Apostolical Ptescription, and so amounts to a divine Institution <note n="(z)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.37.</note>?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. This day being divinely instituted, whether God will not be, that day, better served, and the spiritual profit of Christians better provided for, by making it an intire day of Rest holy to the Lord and to spiritual uses; or by mixing our work with Gods, and Play with Piety.</p>
            <p>Such things as these, (and more weighty communications of better Writers) being seriously considered, will, I doubt not, work on those who desire to walk with God, willingly and thankfully to sequester themselves from all other things to enjoy a blessed communion with their Lord every Lords-day, and one day in seaven to be (as it were) in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus of the first part of this little Tractate, and of the Christian duties therein contained.</p>
            <p>The Second part treateth of Family-duties.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I begin with Family-Catechising, an exercise exceeding needful &amp; useful, that they that are young may be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God betimes, and thereby, if they die sooner, may be fitter for his Kingdom, and fitter for his service, if they live longer. God would have all to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.4.</note>; but, as blind Pastors and
<pb facs="tcp:39273:13"/>
People, so blind Housholders and Housholds, fill hell <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat. 15.14.</note>; And mean-while make the World much worse then else it would be; For, Families are the original of all other greater Societies; and want of Religious Education there, is the cause why there are so few good servants; for how shal an ignorant Son or Daughter that hath no knowledge or conscience, be a good Servant? And why there are so few good Wives and Husbands; for how shall they be good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that were never bred up to be good asunder? Yea, is it not from hence, that there are so many less sound, or less godly Ministers, namely, because they have not been so trained up as young <hi>Timothy</hi> was, who from a child had known the holy Scriptures<note n="(c)" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note>? Its true, that sometimes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in the house, and yet not in the heart (at least, of most in the House) but, if it be in the heart, I am sure it will be in the house <note n="(d)" place="margin">Deut. 6.6, 7. Josh. 24 15. Act. 10.1, 2.</note>: Yea, (as there shall be occasion) in every house <note n="(e)" place="margin">Act. 20.20.</note>; for, the grace that is in a sincere and right heart, is like the oyntment of ones right hand, which bewrayeth it self <note n="(f)" place="margin">Prov. 27.16.</note>, being ever un-satisfied, unless it disperse and send abroad the sweet savour of the knowledge of Christ in every place <note n="(g)" place="margin">2 Cor. 2.14.</note>, especially, the Vicinity, but most of all the Family.</p>
            <p>I proceed from this, to the thing I principally aimed at, and indeed, only intended when I first set upon this work,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> namely, to set forward the Duty of Family-Prayer; For, though God will do much for the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and for every house in <hi>Israel,</hi> yet his Will is, to be sought that he may do it for them <note n="(h)" place="margin">Ezek. 36.37.</note>. Heaven is a rich storehouse, and we have a <hi>Joseph</hi> there that is willing to nourish us, lest we and our houshold, and all that we have come to poverty <note n="(i)" place="margin">Gen. 47.11.</note>; yet its necessary for us to go thither with our suits and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications (as the sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> went into <hi>Egypt</hi> with their sacks) that so opening our mouths wide, the Lord Jesus may fill them <note n="(k)" place="margin">Psal. 81.10.</note>. Ther's treasure enough in God's House for us and for our houses; but when God hath put a Key into our hand (that is, Prayer) to open the door, we must either turn the Key, or not expect the Treasure; men lust, and have not; labour, and have not; fight and scramble for the world,
<pb facs="tcp:39273:14"/>
and yet they have not (or have not in mercy, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.11.) because they ask not <note n="(l)" place="margin">Jam. 4.2.</note>. Now because some weak Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may say with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Behold, I cannot speak (I cannot pray) for I am a child <note n="(m)" place="margin">Jer. 1.6.</note>, therefore I thought it would be profitable for their help, and education (as it were) to the duty of Prayer, to put some Prayers into their hands (though it be God only that must put a spirit of Prayer into their hearts<note n="(n)" place="margin">Zech. 12.10.</note>.) This is a course that heretofore hath found acceptance, but now it needs an Apology, considering that in late times, Forms have been so much out of request, that God's external Ordinances and holy Institutions, of one kind and another, have passed and suffered reproach, and that with divers of better report heretofore (but None but God knows who are his <note n="(o)" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note>,) under the contemptible name of Forms of Religion, too low for Christians of the upper Form. Now, if any yet there be, that count themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ordinances, I must leave them, as far above my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions. But as for modest Christians, who, howsoever they may be somewhat doubtful about the use of Forms of Prayer, yet are teachable and capable of satisfaction, I shall endevour to give it them; And therefore I willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and would have both those of my own Charge, and other Christians to know) that such Forms are not so properly intended for grown and exercised Christians (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (they being humble) will know they may receive help, and improvement from them) but they are composed for young Beginners; and for them also, not to tie them up, but to train them up (as they use to do little Children) to go first by a Form, that leaving the form, which was a great help at first, they may go, at length, on their own legs, without leaning on such Supports.</p>
            <p>Blessed <hi>Bradford,</hi> that high and humble Martyr, when he was in Prison, wrote a prayer for his Mother that she might learn how to pray for him, and desired her to get it by heart, and to say it dayly; and he wrote another for all her house, to make use of in their Evening Prayer <note n="(p)" place="margin">

            <p>Unto which I add, that although poor and low, yea, the lowest, Christians may and should take more liberty in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb facs="tcp:39273:14"/>
between God and themselves, and not be afraid o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> backward to groan out their desires before the Lord; yet the assistance and supplies of Prayers made to their hands, is, for such, needful to enable them to appear before others, and to be their mouth in the duty of Prayer: I say, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that neither the service may be contemptible to those that be bad, nor unprofitable and tedious to those that be better. Briefly, <hi>Formes of Prayer</hi> (whereof there are many in Scripture<note n="(q)" place="margin">Numb. 6.23. Hos. 14 2, 1 Chron. 16.7. Luke 11.2. Mat. 26.44.</note>,) being framed according to Scripture, cannot be justly condemned; but I must add one thing more, and that is, that <hi>formal praying</hi> which idle Christians, by the abuse of forms, may soon fall into, can never be justified.</p>
            <p>The third Family-duty is Repetition of Sermons, which,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> being carefully done, is the preservative of a right Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for why are people ever learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never come to the knowledge of the truth, or are easily carryed from it but because they take Ministers words, without Ministers grounds? and so, when other Teachers bring them a new Doctrine, they like the last and the new Teacher, and sell the former and the old truth; whereas, if they did review what they hear, and (as the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note>,) search the Scriptures, quoted by Ministers, and so find by examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what they have heard, is founded on the Word of God, and upon the credit of a divine Testimony, they would not change their mindes (having grace in them) because it is impossible for God to change His; nor can any word come from Him that is not perfect, and of perpetual verity. This recalling and repeating of Sermons, and endevouring that the Houshold may see how they agree with Scripture, hath ever been the character of more Religious Families, and a great means to make all in it (especially if they be called to give account of what they have heard, and heard again) to profit in Religion; For, as he that repeateth a matter separateth very Friends <note n="(s)" place="margin">Prov. 17.9.</note>, to wit, because the repetition makes it fresh in memory, causeth a greater observation, and leaveth a greater impression; so he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth profitable matters, edifieth very Weaklings, and helpeth much the hearers, to understand, mark, and mind what hath been formerly delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39273:15"/>But whilest I thus persuade you to repetition, the saying of an excellent Servant of God <note n="(t)" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preston.</hi>
               </note> comes to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which is this in effect, that as Kine and Sheep return not to their owners, grass and hay, but, milk, and fleece, and flesh; so Sermons are not to be returned and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by reading notes, but Christians are to repeat them in their lives, by being sound in opinion, growing in grace, and godly in all their cariage.</p>
            <p>The last duty is, Singing of Psalms, to be used principally on our Lords Sabbath day <note n="(u)" place="margin">Psal. 92. title.</note>, but every other day, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; because every day hath its mercy, for which God is to be praised; or if it hath its affliction, in that also God is to be blessed <note n="(x)" place="margin">Job 1.21.</note>, and there are Psalms sutable to every affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction — to sanctifie it unto us by ministring matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction — and to bear up our spirits in it, by affording matter of Consolation. It is every day likewise, a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Exercise, because the Book of Psalms containeth in it abundant matter of heavenly meditation, and spiritual edification. And as it is both needful and profitable; so it is an exercise very pleasant, for it awakeneth the soul, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the spirits, cheareth up the heart, and generally revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth both the inward and the outward man Other duties are a Christians work, This is his holy recreation, begun here, and to be compleated in heaven. I cannot leave this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reciting what Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> (that hath done such eminent service to the Church of God) relateth of himself; it's this, <hi>When by the goodness of God, I hnd willingly forsaken my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and all that I had that I might freely serve Christ, it came to pass at my first entry into the publick assembly of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the company did sing this (that is, the</hi> 91) <hi>Psalm; by the singing whereof, as though I had heard God himself calling me particularly, I felt my self so comforted that I have kept it since that time most dearly-graven in my heart: and I may truly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness this before God, that I have received marvellous comfort by it, both in sickness and in sorrow, not only by meditating it when I was smitten with the Pestilence, and the same plague had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected my Family, even four times, but also in other most grievous tentations</hi> 
               <note n="(y)" place="margin">See this and more in <hi>Beza</hi> his argument of the 91 Psalm prefixed before his Paraphrase upon it.</note>. Let all profit by his experience, and observe their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39273:15"/>Thus have I given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Summary account of the matters handled in this Treatise: Concerning each of which, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desire the Reader to cast his eye upon the Margent, to search the Scriptures alleaged, and weigh the Reasons annexed: for I shall easily grant that a mans constitution is apt to insinuate it self into his meditation and discourse, perhaps too much (for in every constitution, as there is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or an help to vertue; so a danger also) and divers other things may lead a man aside before he is aware; Albeit therefore, I am not conscious to my self of offering any thing, but that which (as far as my understanding reacheth) is right, and do abhor to impose upon the consciences of men, which God alone can bind; yet, let the Reader, in the reading of mine, or any mans words else, set still before him the Word of God.</p>
            <p>The manner of Writing (which is the other thing I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) I have spoken somewhat to in the former Epistle. It is not so plain and perspicuous as (in regard of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of Christians) I intended, but the Babes of Christ will here find milk; that is, many things fitted to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and if there be any stronger meat, it will suit better with more mature Christians. All men know, or may know, that Ministers are necessitated to extend such abilities as God hath given them, to the utmost (which is hardly done without some obscurity) for the pleading of the causes of God: And that because, as flesh and bloud riseth up in arms, &amp; mustereth all its forces against the truth of God; so doth it also against the way of godliness; whereby, tho the adversaries thereof, cannot destroy it, yet they prevail so far as to darken it, and to cast so many mists before mens eyes, that it is not easie for the ordinary Traveller to discern the right way, nor for their Guides to clear it up unto them.</p>
            <p>However, I hope they that have good and honest hearts, will hereby receive some good; and from others, that write of the same things, they may receive more; and by humble and faithful Prayer to God, with diligent studying of his Word, most of all.</p>
            <p>I crave pardon for being so tedious in this Epistle, which
<pb facs="tcp:39273:16"/>
because it may serve, not only for an introduction, but as a Supplement also to that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have nothing now to do, but to leave with Christians this one necessary Admonition; that is, not to content themselves with those outward exercises of Religion that they shall here find urged, but to study, and by these helps, to strive after the power of Godliness.

            <p>The promoting of this Holiness is the purpose of this Treatise; which propoundeth, recommendeth, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for, divers such <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>-duties, as are the wayes and means appointed of God for the improving of godliness.</p>

            <p>I hope therefore that they that look after godliness (and in vain do they look for heaven who look not after it), will accept of these Helps; for, albeit I willingly grant, that some of these means of godliness may be used by those that are not truly godly (Hypocrisie being the Ape of Sincerity), yet I may boldly affirm (on the other side) that all that are truly good, will be afraid to omit <note n="(h)" place="margin">

                     <hi>First on Magistrates,</hi> For, this is the charge recorded in Scripture concerning the King, <hi>When he sitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, he shall write him a Copy of this Law, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites. And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the dayes of his life</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It's more wise to say, If a King must read the Law, whose imployments are so many and weighty; then I much more who may gain time better.</p>

Wheresoever a command is confirmed by a general reason that binds all, there the command it self hath a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral binding force, and reacheth as far as the reason doth. Now the reason of the Kings reading the Law is of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for this it is, <hi>That he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of the Law and the Statutes to do them; that his heart be not lift up above his brethren,</hi> (which though it concern Magistrates more then others, yet all have need enough to nourish humility, especially that are in any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place and order) —<hi>and that he turn not aside from the commandement to the right hand or the left</hi> 
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">Deut. 17.19, 20.</note>. These being the reasons why Kings are required to read Scripture, Who shall exempt himself from it? for, Are not all bound to fear the Lord? yea <hi>all the Inhabitants of the world are to stand in awe of him</hi> 
                     <note n="(d)" place="margin">Psal. 33.8.</note>. And doth not the Scripture require of all to <hi>walk in all the wayes that God hath commanded, without turning aside to the right hand or the left</hi> 
                     <note n="(e)" place="margin">Deut. 5.32, 33.</note>? What is spoken therefore to the King, doth, for the same common reasons, concern all; as, if a King be perswaded to eat and drink <hi>that he may have strength when he goeth on his way</hi> 
                     <note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Sam. 28.22.</note>, (as <hi>Saul</hi> sometimes was); no man sayes, That belongs to a King, and not to me, but every man for the same reason eats and drinks like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; This is put out of question, because there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command to <hi>gather men, women, and children, to hear the Law read</hi> upon the very same account that the King is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39273:20"/>
to read it, that is, <hi>that they might learn to fear God and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to do all the words of that Law</hi> 
                     <note n="(g)" place="margin">Deut. 31.11, 12, 13.</note>. It's true, that Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen have some greater cause, in regard of their greater tentations, to exercise themselves in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, as <hi>that their hearts may not be lift up</hi> 
                     <note n="(h)" place="margin">Deut. 17.20.</note>, (though God knows that divers of them who need it most, use it least, the more they have to answer for): but it no way followeth, that because a man that hath a great journey to go had need to eat more, (as <hi>Elijah</hi> had <note n="(i)" place="margin">1 King. 19.7.</note>,) that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may let eating and drinking alone that stayes at home.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may further be added, that a <hi>motive</hi> to perform a duty, if it be common to all,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 3.</note> is a good plain proof that the duty belongs to all and so it is here; for the King is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to read the Law and to observe it, by proposing to him this end, <hi>That he may prolong his dayes in his Kingdom, he, and his children in the midst of Israel</hi>

It is not said indeed, <hi>to the reading of Scripture</hi>: but though that be not expressed, yet that it is meant, appears by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, —<hi>to exhortation, to doctrine</hi>; that (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is the reading (principally at least) intended, which is helpful to a Minister for the two great parts of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, <hi>Exhortation and Doctrine</hi>: and what that is, we find by the Apostle writing to <hi>Titus,</hi> which applyeth it to the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word</hi>; and tells him, that that <hi>Word</hi> is to be <hi>held fast,</hi> (and therefore to be read) <hi>that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gain-sayers</hi>

                  <p>And for the New Testament, and Gospel-Word, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> counsel and command to Christians is, <hi>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Scriptures are written for the use of the whole Church; either for their use,<note place="margin">

                     <note n="(y)" place="margin">Hos. 8.12.</note>. God might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to make known his mind (as at first he did) by <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and delivering his Will by word of mouth from one to another, had it not been for this (as for one reason), that by writing, the Word of God might be more exposed to the veiw of Ministers and People, that both might read it, and so the better study it, and meditate upon it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Apostles write their Epistles to several Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if it were not the duty of Christians to whom they wrote to read them? Hence the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> (after he had written to the <hi>Ephesians</hi>) speaks thus, <hi>Whereby when ye read</hi> (which shews they were to read) <hi>ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ</hi> 
                     <note n="(z)" place="margin">Ephe. 3.4.</note>. Unto this purpose the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle otherwhere saith, <hi>When this Epistle is read among you, cause that it may be read also in the Church of the</hi> Laodiceans; and mark what follows, <hi>and that ye also read the Epistle from</hi> Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea <note n="(a)" place="margin">Col. 4.16.</note>.

Now if the Word so work upon the heart when it is read by others, why may not the same effect be wrought when a man reads it himself? yea, rather then; because he may read it over and over again, and hath more time to ponder upon it.

                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>Men that have their heads and hands full of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, may (perhaps) plead that they have no time to read Scripture,</hi>

                  <p>2. I answer, That although Christians will find it both profitable and needful to set apart certain times (and that (ordinarily) every day) for reading Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note> lest there be a loss of the duty for want of an appointed time to do it in; yet I shall not prescribe any particular time, nor how much of Scripture any should read at that time, (the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Scriptures into Chapters will help that way): but that which I press as necessary, is the thing it self, and that every Christian be a serious <hi>Reader of Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deny not, but some are so hurryed with the necessary occasions of their Calling, that it is not easie for them to have a time (perhaps in a whole day) to read a Chapter; I mean, to have a time <hi>at times,</hi> and on some days: but yet at other times they may, (and by enjoying a freer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) make themselves and their souls some recompen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e in regard of former omissions; which I advise them to do, and withal, wish them to remember, that it is (as hath been said) the mark of a blessed man to meditate in Gods Word day and night, and that <hi>David</hi> (that was still taken up with the persecutions of a King, (that is, of <hi>Saul</hi>) or with the imployments of a King, when he was King himself and a man of War also, yet was very much in the meditation of the Law of God, yea, it was his meditation <hi>all the day</hi> 
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ps. 119.97.</note>, that is, he took all occasions to exercise his thoughts in it; reading it (no doubt) as Kings were commanded to do, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19. and then reading it in his heart in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current meditations according to all opportunities. There is but one thing that hinders <hi>Davids</hi> imitation, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of so good an example, and that is, the want of <hi>Davids</hi> affection, which breathes and breaks out in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclamation, <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi> 
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">Ps. 119.97.</note>, and thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his <hi>meditation all the day:</hi> Love desires union, and longs

to be much with the thing loved. Gods great complaint is, <hi>I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a strange thing</hi> 
                     <note n="(d)" place="margin">Hos. 8 12.</note>. Divers now a dayes look strangely upon Scripture, their countenance (as it is said of <hi>Laban</hi> in regard of <hi>Jacob</hi>) is not towards it <hi>as it was yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and the day before</hi>

                     <hi>Answ. First,</hi> Our Saviour shews us, that a Servant that comes weary from work is call'd to wait upon his Master,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note> before he eat and drink himself, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.7, 8. and that may teach us, that we may not neglect the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our <hi>great Lord,</hi> though we come from the field weary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reading some part of Scripture is a work of another kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may be accounted a recreation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of hard bodily labour. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is also a time (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labour) of refreshing (in the use of the creatures) by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39273:27"/>
which nature may be so recovered as to be fitted for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He works very hard that will not read a Letter from his Friend, from his Prince, before he takes his rest. If any say, The case is not alike; for such Letters as come to our hand day by day, we have not seen before, and therefore we read them without delay, but having once perused them, we do not still read them; Now the <hi>Bible</hi> we read sometimes our selves, and we hear it read often, no need therefore to be ever reading it. To this I answer, that they that read the <hi>Book of God</hi> well, and they that read it most, will never make this objection: for they know by good experience, that the holy Scripture is so full and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomless, that every new reading of it (with reverence and lifting up their hearts to God, that he would <hi>open their eyes to see wonders out of his Word</hi> 
                     <note n="(z)" place="margin">Ps. 119.18.</note>,) I say, every such new reading of it, brings a new light into the understanding; a new heat into the heart and affections; and puts a new life into an holy life. As for those who know not this, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to the diligent and dutiful reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that they may at length know it. And they that look upon reading as the receiving of their food, will be ready to read often, as they receive often the same sort of food: The truth is, Mens fasting takes away their stomack; I mean, it is their <hi>not reading</hi> that makes them unwilling to read: for duties well performed bring in that delight which will make them still, and make them easily performed. <hi>To him that hath shall be given,</hi> Luk. 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Lay aside therefore (dear Christians) all carnal excuses, and do not use your <hi>Bible</hi> as you do your better clothes, that is, on the Lords-day, and then lay it aside till the next Lords-day; but look upon the <hi>words of Gods mouth</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> did, that is as upon, yea, <hi>esteeming them more, then your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary food</hi> 
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Job 23.12.</note>; and that will be a motive to you to use it as you do your food, to read ordinarily as you feed ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that is, twice a day, though something may arise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily to hinder the one or the other. I know there is a difference between Servants, and those that be Masters of their time; They that are at their own hand (as they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39273:28"/>
say) may take a time as they please; but they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of others, must do as they may; and yet they also, though they cannot <hi>take,</hi> yet should <hi>make</hi> a time, that is, make hard shift for a time to see what the <hi>Lord God</hi> sayes <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 85.8.</note>, and learn to be so provident as to place themselves there where the Governours, knowing the benefit of the Word themselves, will therefore give those that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the more liberty to look into it.</p>
                  <p>I shall conclude all that I have to say concerning this argument, with the adding of two Motives (which the times wherein we live may much mind us of) to this necessary duty of being well-read in Scripture; the one drawn from our doubtful condition (in this world and in this land) outwardly; the other from our dangerous condition spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these the Scripture it self points unto, giving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this as a reason why it is a blessed thing to read and hear and keep it, to wit, <hi>because the time is at hand</hi> 
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rev. 1.3.</note>, that is, times will come (and how near they be at any time none can tell) wherein there will be so great affliction, that they only will be found blessed persons, who have read, observed, and laid up Scripture-consolations: <hi>Vnless thy Law had been my delights</hi> (saith <hi>David), I should have perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my affliction</hi> 
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">Ps. 119.92.49, 50.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>later</hi> of these also the same Word of God layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, foretelling that <hi>in the last dayes</hi> (which were come then, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. and are come much more now) <hi>perilous times shall come</hi>

of neglecting to read, or of the negligent reading of, the Word of God; else would never so many Christians have run away from God and his Ordinances, as in these dayes they do. If any shall say, they be the <hi>Bible-bearers</hi> that are fallen away (for so some profane persons will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to scorn the Professors of Religion): To this I answer, That it is one thing to bear a <hi>Bible,</hi> another to read it with reverence, and to search it with diligence, and to pray (when they read) for the knowledge of Gods mind in it, with all humility and sense of their own weakness and unworthiness; It is such, and not every reading that will serve the turn.

               <p>I Now come to the second thing, that is, <hi>Plain Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a reverent and profitable receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may (perhaps) seem much to some, that I should be so sollicitous about this Ordinance; and therefore, for their satisfaction, and the confirmation of the duty of <hi>Sacrament-preparation,</hi> I shall give account of it in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> Preparation to the Lords Supper is to be stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it is very needful (and suitable to the care of the Church of God in ancient and purer times <note n="*" place="margin">There shall none be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, until such time as he can say the Catechism, and be confirmed; <hi>Rubrick</hi> after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the Catechism concerning Confirmation.</note>) that they who have not at all (as yet) received that Sacrament,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39273:30"/>
should give an account of their knowledge and faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receive it: for though a necessary, fundamental, and more remote right thereunto, be presupposed in their Baptism; yet, because they themselves were then uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making any promise and profession in their own persons; therefore their clear, full, and next right to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Lords Supper, ariseth from their declaration, with their own mouths, of their knowledge of, consent unto, and true purpose to perform what their Baptism bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them unto, or was then promised by others in their behalf. Without this (though I grant it may be in several wayes required and performed) how shall their fitness for this Ordinance we speak of, be discerned? or the Church (whereof they are Members, and with which they are to communicate) be so well satisfied? But in this, (it being learnedly and largely spoken to by others <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation: and Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                  </note>) I shall not need to move any further: This only I add, that for the help of the weaker sort of those of whom I here speak, to give a reason of their faith and fitness for the Lord Table; I have composed these ensuing Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2.</note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another reason may be taken from the weight that the Scripture lays on this work of Sacrament-preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28, 29, 30. Where may be noted <hi>first,</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Precept for Examination, <hi>Let a man examine, and so</hi> (and not otherwise) <hi>let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup</hi>; which shews that a special &amp; distinct Preparation is required for <hi>that Bread, and that Cup,</hi> that is, that distinct Ordinance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This command is charged upon the Conscience, by laying before the Unworthy Communicant, two heart-affecting and affrighting things. 1. On the one side, the greatest sin, and the most horrible guilt. <hi>For whosoever shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord.</hi> How high is that Lord? How dreadful therefore is that Guilt? 2. On the other side, there's the greatest danger, and saddest doom; <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords Body</hi>; that is, eternal damnation (without repentance), and temporal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39273:30"/>
judgement, though that be prevented: <hi>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</hi> Thus is that great Precept of Examination, before Sacrament-partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, environed (as it were) on both hands, that it may be more effectually guarded against all gain-sayers, urged on all Communicants, and observed by all Christians to strike into their hearts a reverence of that Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Here I do not deny, but there are the same things (for substance) set before us in regard of the <hi>hearing of the Word,</hi> whilest it is said, <hi>He that believeth not, shall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16.16. and he that heareth and <hi>lets it slip</hi> shall not escape, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. (and therefore People had need not only to hear, but to <hi>take heed how they hear,</hi> and prepare for it, <hi>Eccles</hi> 5.1.): But yet I do not find that so much is spoken (all at once), and so fully spoken, and so fearfully spoken concerning <hi>mis-hearing</hi> only, as concerning this <hi>mis-recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>; the reason whereof may be (as I humbly conceive) because in unworthy partaking of the Lords Supper there is a <hi>cumulative</hi> abuse or a double sin; that is, not only the Sacrament is abused, but that Word of God also is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned which makes it a Sacrament <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Accedat Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ad elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; fit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum.</hi>
                  </note>; as also because the Body and Bloud of Christ (though offered also in the Word, yet) are not in such a manner presented as in the Lords Supper, as will further appear in the next reason. Mean while (to close up this) Christians may consider, that when God is pleas'd to speak more plainly, precisely, distinctly, more fully and dreadfully; then he justly expects, that what he saith should affect us more, and be of more effect with us. Read <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.30. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.42, 43. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.41. to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A serious Preparation, proper to the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urged; because the same thing, that is, <hi>Christ</hi> with all his benefits is offered unto us in a different way in the Word and Sacrament, which makes it a distinct Ordinance, and so imposeth a peculiar preparation for it; which, I do not at all speak to set one Ordinance of God against another; or to lessen the reverence of the Word Preached (which is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39273:31"/>
that <hi>great</hi> Ordinance of God whereby men are converted and sayed) or to give way to an unprepared coming to the Word (which I fear is the fault of many, who seem to come with high reverence to the Sacrament): but what I say, is only to put Christians in mind, that every distinct Ordinance of God is to have its due and distinct respect, and therefore that there is some other and further good frame of heart to be endeavoured, when the Sacrament is to be received, then when the Word only is to be heard; and that because (that I may come to the matter I intend) Christ with all his benefits is offered in the Sacrament very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly or singularly, and very plainly and sensibly.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is a peculiar particularity, or particular dealing and distribution, in Sacrament-administration <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ta sigillatim communicantur, ac applicant ac restringunt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiones <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ad singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los legitimè u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In preaching we speak generally, yet comprehending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, but not singling them out; whereas in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament Christ is offered personally, that is, to particular persons, and is put as it were (Sacramentally) into every ones hand. Now when God deals with particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hand to hand, offering them so great a gift as Christ is <note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 4 10.</note>, there is therefore more reason of reverence, and of care that such a gift from such a giver, be not taken with unwashen hands and hearts. We find that when <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Esther</hi> were to appear personally before Kings, <hi>he shaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himself, and changed his rayment</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Gen. 41.14.</note>; and <hi>she put on her royal Apparel</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Esth. 5.1.</note>. And shall we make our personal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God without some special testimony of the low thoughts we have of our selves, and the high thoughts we have of Him? Well may it (then) be said, <hi>Offer it now to thy Governour</hi> 
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note>. When that poor woman, that was heal'd of her bloudy issue, was hid amongst a great company, it was well enough; but when she saw she was not hid, but singled out to look Jesus Christ in the face, then she <hi>came trembling and falling down before him</hi> 
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Luk. 8.47.</note>. Much cause have we to do the like, considering what we are; and what Christ is, from whose hands (as it were) though by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of mean men, we come (each of us) to take into our own hands things of so high a nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:39273:31"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Sacrament Christ is offered more plainly and sensibly then in the Word, though in the substance both Ordinances agree. Indeed in the sound of the Gospel Christ appears, and is set forth to the sense of hearing, by faithful Teachers very evidently, and as it were to the eye <note n="(g)" place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note>, but not properly to the eye as in the Sacrament: for when <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that Christ was set forth before their eyes, his meaning is only this, that Jesus Christ was clearly held forth to them by his Preaching, as that is which is set before mens eyes; which shews that things exposed to the eye are most evident and most ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; for it is the eye that (in a more special manner) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart <note n="(h)" place="margin">Lam. 3.31. <hi>Segniùs irritant animos demissa per aures, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>. Whence it is that <hi>Moses</hi> makes this a great argument to move the people to obedience, that he did not speak to them that had not <hi>seen,</hi> but to such as had <hi>seen the great acts of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 11.2.7. Now, God offering himself to us in the Sacrament in a more plain and familiar way, setting us (as it were) at his Table, and setting before our eyes all the good things of his House; this ministreth an argument of more abundant reverence: for, Whence was it that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> were commanded to <hi>put off their shoos from off their feet,</hi> Exod. 3.5. Josh. 5.15. but only because God shewed himself, and set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before their eyes in a more plain and perceptible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then at other times <note n="(i)" place="margin">

                  </note>? Unto which may be added that other command given to <hi>Moses</hi> when the Law was to be delivered, <hi>Go unto the People, and sanctifie them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes; for the third day the Lord will come down in the [sight] of all the People,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 19 10 11.

               <p>But before I let this pass, I have two things to subjoin, that I may not be mis-understood.</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:39273:32"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When I say, that Christ doth in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appear in the Sacrament to our senses <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For what's the Seal without the Writing? But as affixed to it, it is of much value. The pressing therefore of special Sacrament-preparation no way dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the Word, but rather heightens the estimation of it, inasmuch as the Sacrament is founded on it. And yet this dependance of the Sacrament on the Word hinders not the truth of that which <hi>Calvin</hi> affirms, (and confirms out of <hi>Austin</hi>), which is, that <hi>the Sacraments have this peculiar to them above the Word, that they do represent unto us to the life the promises of God, even as if they were pictured in a Table before our eyes</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When I plead for Sacrament-reverence, I am far from allowing any thing which (sheltering it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the head of an high estimation of this Ordinance) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from, or tendeth to, Superstition; or any way countenanceth, or cometh near unto, the idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Papists, wherewith they deifie and defile the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. All that I move for, is, a reverent carriage of the body, an aweful frame of heart, and a knowing and affectionate preparation, suited and fitted to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The judgment of the Church of God in all ages perswades to a special care and consideration about this Ordinance; scarce any Christian Church in the world in any age since Christ (as a learned man observes <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> Treatise of the Sacrament. <hi>Vid. Zepper. tractat. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentis. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Item Chemnitii Exam. de Praeparat. ad Eucharistiam. Item Cyprian. in Explicatione</hi> 4. <hi>petitionis Orationis Dominicae.</hi>
                  </note>) that hath not impaled it. In the ancient Church there
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39273:32"/>
was much strictness used, and such sent away, when the Communion was to be administred, who had committed notorious sins, and not sufficiently testified their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And when the Minister was about to reach out the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the people, he cryed with a lowd voyce, <hi>Holy things to holy persons.</hi> Accordingly our own Church, ever since the Reformation, hath provided that open and notorious livers should not presume to come to the Lords Table till their open declaring of their true repentance and amendment. And if malice and hatred were perceived to reign betwixt any persons, they were not to be suffered to partake of the Lords Table, till it was known they were reconciled <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the Communion.</note>. Thus it was formerly: and (of late) further care hath been taken for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sacrament-profanation, and that Jesus Christ might have wise and holy Guests at his Table, though Satan (the Arch-Enemy of Reformation) hath used all his art to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or frustrate such endeavours, whom we hope God will out-work in his good time.</p>
               <p>Now, howsoever the prescripts and practise of the most eminent men in the Church of God <note n="(n)" place="margin">

                  </note> be not a Rule to any man, yet they shew what the judgment of discretion was, about this Ordinance, in their time, which it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expected should so far prevail as to impose a <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> upon others that differ from them in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, especially, coming far short of their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> exceeds others in his holy zeal, and professeth, he will rather <hi>give up his soul (and life) then the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to any unworthily; and will rather suffer his own blood to be poured forth, then give up the most sacred Blood of Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to a worthy R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet I do not find, that the <hi>Church</hi> excludes such as he doth, that is, as accounting them (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently) the objects of Excommunication, but as not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them fit subjects (in that stare) for Sacrament-recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That clause therefore [as, <hi>ipso jure,</hi> excommunicate] would be a little further weighed; which (if I mistake not) the Author adds to keep intire his Tenet of free-admission to the Lords Supper, that is, of all that are Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; He was provident (therefore) in declaring those scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offenders (which he describes) to be excommunicate, that is, to be indeed, or in right, no Members <note n="(z)" place="margin">See <hi>pag.</hi> 81. the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note>, and so his free-admission of all Members will stand the better.</p>
               <p>But here I have these things to Reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the before-described notorious persons are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(notwithstanding) members, because not yet actually cast out; for, Was not the incestuous person, notwithstanding his horrible sin, and the common same thereof (when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.1.</note>,) I say, was not he yet a Member? How could he be put away and cast out, if he were not with in <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.12, 13.</note>?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. To punish him actually [<hi>de facto</hi>] as one not repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a member, who is excommunicate only [<hi>de jure</hi>], that is, is under such an offence as may be a cause of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and which hath a tendency in it to that censure, is not fair, but like punishing a Malefactor before a tryal; which the above-named Author <note n="(c)" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                  </note> wisely considering, gives this account of it, <hi>Even ignorant and profane, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and excommunicate [not only</hi> de jure, <hi>but</hi> de facto], <hi>have a right; for, that not keeping company with fornicators, covetous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 5.11 <hi>is intended no otherwise but upon a sentence, and judgement fore-going, afore which they might;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39273:34"/>
for its unreasonable, a punishment should be inflicted before a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is he that hath committed a notorious act before the Sacrament, excommunicate [<hi>de jure</hi>]: for it is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> just to put him under so dreadful a sentence, before tryal be made whether he will obstinately persist in his sin or no; which there is no time for, supposing the crime to be committed but a little before the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Now, if this be not justly fastened upon scandalous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, that they are presently excommunciate [<hi>de jure</hi>], then so much is yielded as that some Church-members may be secluded (at this or that time) from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: which serves to confirm what I intended to shew, which is, that it is agreed upon, on all hands, that there may be a restraint in Sacrament-admission, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Church-membership, in case of gross igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and notorious scandal: And that's all I aim at, it being not in my thoughts to press such a strictness as will hinder access to the Sacrament in its just extent; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repress such profuse concessions as tend to the abuse of that Ordinance, and the danger and discomfort both of Receivers and Admitters.</p>
               <p>I have enlarged thus far (much beyond my first purpose) partly to clear my way to that which followeth, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make tryal (being necessitated thereunto by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of this discourse) whether my weak thoughts might contribute any thing to a right sense in this much-debated argument.</p>
               <p>It's high time now to mind my intended business, which is to apply my self to those that are babes in Christ; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I shall offer in the most plain way, that is, in a way of Catechism, some Sacrament-instructions. And therein shall speak something more generally, to acquaint them with <hi>the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ</hi>

               <p>COnsidering the great dishonour that hath been poured upon Ministers of late, I mean, not only a rude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their Persons (such as there hath ever been by profane men) but a deliberate and studied contempt both of their Persons and their Calling: not only vomitted (as it was wont to be) out of the Tavern, or Alehouse; but vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Pulpit and Press, and that by men professing godliness; there will therefore be need enough (after I have spoken of the Word and Sacrament) to write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reduce and compose the mindes of Christians to that reverence that is due to the Lords Officers, who are by his appointment and authority to preach the Word, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister

               <p>For which purpose, my work shall be only to open and treat upon one Text of Scripture, which fully and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sets forth the honour due from the people of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ministry, and (in special) such as labour amongst them.</p>

               <p>In which words we have set down both <hi>Ministers office</hi> and <hi>Peoples duty.</hi> The Office of Ministers is described and set forth in three things.</p>

               <p n="3">3. They are <hi>to admonish</hi>; to wit, for the better speeding of their work, in the two former parts of their office, that is, Preaching and Ruling; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Teaching</hi> shews the <hi>right and the good way</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ruling</hi> chargeth and presseth upon People the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ, with presenting <note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.21.</note>, and inflicting (if there be a necessity of it) Church-censures <note n="(g)" place="margin">&amp; 5.5.</note>.

               <p>Of the Office of Ministers I shall say no more, but (to make the better way to peoples duty) must needs grant, that if a Minister perform not, takes no care to perform, makes no conscience of performing these parts of his office, then (though honour be alwayes due <hi>to his calling,</hi> yet) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himself of that honour which otherwise would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue and be due <hi>to his person</hi> in reference to that calling; for the honour is tied to the <hi>well-performing</hi> of the office: <hi>The Elders that rule well,</hi> are they that are <hi>worthy of double honour</hi> 
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17.</note>; There's a sad saying for bad Ministers, and that is, that they are <hi>made contemptible and base before all the people by the Lord of Hosts himself</hi>

               <p>I shall now somewhat more largely insist on the duty of people towards Ministers, which is 1. more general, <hi>viz. to know them.</hi> 2. More particular, so to know them as to <hi>esteem them very highly in love for their works sake.</hi>

                  <p>This is the great and the good reason of respecting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; Hence <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of <hi>Timothy,</hi> saith, <hi>He worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do; let no man therefore despise him</hi>

                  <p>This is the more considerable, because divers seem to esteem good Ministers much, when, as it is not from love, so neither is it for their works sake; For, It may be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For fear,</hi> and to comply with them when the times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and present Powers favour them; or when it is, some other way, dangerous to disdain them: so <hi>Haman</hi> did <hi>Mordecai</hi> the greatest honour <note n="(x)" place="margin">Esth. 6.11.</note>, for he durst do no other; so the Devils give Christ fair words, for fear of <hi>torment before the time</hi>; And that great testimony of the unclean spirit <note n="(y)" place="margin">Act. 16.17·</note> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before) might be given, either to make their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine the more suspected, because they had the Devils <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonial</hi>; or else to flatter with the Apostles, for fear they should marr his market, as they quickly did <note n="(z)" place="margin">Act. 16.18.</note>. Thus that third Captain <hi>fell upon his knees</hi> before the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> for fear of losing his own life, and the lives of the fifty with him <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 King. 1.13.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For their better grace,</hi> because some good Ministers of great parts, have a general fame, and are had in honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with the people: so that, if they favour them also, they shall be the better thought of. No marvel if many of the Pharisees came to <hi>John</hi>'s baptism, for <hi>Jerusalem and all Judea went out to him,</hi> Mat. 3.5, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Out of civility and courtesie</hi>; so men use to invite the Preacher to dinner (which is an argument of respect); and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thus <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee (none of the worst: it seems, nor of the best) desired Christ to eat with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.36.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Out of zeal to this or that Opinion,</hi> which makes men extol that Minister that maintains it.

Thus when there arose a dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion between the Pharisees and the Sadduces, <hi>Paul</hi> having

declared himself to be a Pharisee, the Scribes that were of the Pharisees part, arose, and took <hi>Pauls</hi> part <note n="(b)" place="margin">Act. 23.6, 7.</note>, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him as a man, to whom (haply) a Spirit or an Angel had spoken, and consequently, such a person as to whom if any offer violence, he shall be found to fight against God.

               <p>For this purpose I shall make choice of a portion of Scripture that fully declares the danger of profaning the Lords Holy-day; It is that which is written</p>

               </q>

                  </note>, I shall not (here) speak further of it, but hasten to a brief opening of the Scripture before recited; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it appeareth, that amongst other gross abuses, (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former and latter part of this Chapter) the Sabbath also was very provokingly profaned, and that in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self; (the Lords City); wherein the Temple was, (the Lords House); and wherein God himself so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided, that they <hi>hid their eyes from the Sabbath,</hi> in his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, and by the profanation thereof <hi>he was profaned among them,</hi> Ezek. 22.26.</p>
               <p>If any ask, How all this came to pass? <hi>Nehemiah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gives an account of it, when he saith, <hi>All this while was not I at Jerusalem,</hi> v. 6.

And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> being once come; Sabbath profanation is non-pluss'd, and overcome, <hi>They came no more on the Sabbath,</hi> v. 21. But, as when <hi>Moses</hi> was absent, the Calf was made; so <hi>Nehemiah</hi> going (after his first coming to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the building of the walls thereof) into <hi>Persia</hi> again, there were, in that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> many profanations crept in, which he, when he returneth, most zealously reformeth. In particular; when he <hi>saw</hi> in <hi>Judah</hi> the violation of the Sabbath, and that it was made a very <hi>Market-day,</hi> v. 15. his eyes affected his heart, and his zeal discovers it self.</p>

The <hi>solemnity</hi> of the day (for it's one of Gods <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn dayes,</hi> Psal. 81.5.) that the celebration thereof may be more fair and full by laying aside all work, and the whole Creation (as it were) to wait on the Creator, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 23.3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As in point of solemnity, so, <hi>In point of mercy,</hi> for the relief, refreshing and taking breath of the toiled crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after six dayes labour; which is said of God himself, after his work, but it is spoken after the manner of men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.17. <hi>On the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And especially, <hi>In point of Piety,</hi> for the sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day, in the holy services thereof; and that not without need: For, if we look to innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> albeit some question, Whether the Law of the Sabbath were given to him before the Fall; yet there's no cause to question, but that it would have been useful to him, though he had not faln: because he could not, at once, dress and keep the Garden, and have that compleat and indistracted communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, which it was easie for him to enjoy, in a time of rest and separation from all such earthly and hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal imployment.</p>
               <p>But now, man being faln, this Rest is of more absolute necessity, because both humane infirmity and corruption so compass and cleave to us, that we cannot with full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind be in Heaven and Earth both at once; that is, we cannot, at the same time, apply our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to matters of so different a nature and operation as heavenly and earthly things are, which apparently carry our hearts contrary wayes: whereof there needs not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof then the dayly experience we have of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our hearts, and the withdrawing of them from things spiritual, or, at least, the eclipsing of them, by the interposition of earthly things; which, if they be earthly thoughts, hinder spiritual thoughts, and disturb hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditations; if they be earthly words, they cool
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39273:56"/>
spiritual communications (a man cannot speak two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent languages both at once); and if they be earthly Actions, they weaken spiritual exercises, and thrust aside heavenly transactions.</p>
               <p>For this reason, Play also and Sports are forbidden: for God forbids not work for the <hi>thing,</hi> (He likes work better then play), but for the <hi>end</hi>; to wit, because it hinders the intire imploying of the day in holy things, which Play doth much more, because of a greater delight in it, and for that the heart is more taken up with it, and stollen (as the hearts of the men of <hi>Israel</hi> were by <hi>Absaloms</hi> kisses, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.5, 6.) from the son of <hi>David,</hi> the Lord of the Sabbath, by it.</p>
               <p>Now, Albeit there might be some rest (out of the fourth Commandement) appendant to the <hi>Jews</hi> day, and proper to them, as appertaining to their Education, (which, I conceive, it will be hard to find; that which is produced for it, being as probably answered as urged <note n="(a)" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bownd</hi> 1 Book p. 136. <hi>Cawdr.</hi> Part. 1. p. 86, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>:) yet all that rest which is enjoyned in the Commandement, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Sabbath-sanctification, belongeth to us as well as to them: for, As the observation of the Sabbath (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the fourth Commandement) being spiritual, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth the Law that requireth it to be both moral and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; so, with respect thereto, the bodily rest also becometh moral <note n="(b)" place="margin">Mr <hi>Crookes</hi> Characters, <hi>p.</hi> 552.</note>, and therefore a common and continuing thing to us as well as to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor need this rest seem tedious, if we consider what works God requireth and alloweth on the Sabbath-day; As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Works of Religion</hi>] Six dayes shalt thou labour, and do all [thy] work, saith the Commandment <note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. 20.9.</note>, but on the Sabbath-day, we may and must do <hi>Gods work.</hi> Hence, it's said, <hi>The Priests profane the Sabbath,</hi> that is, <hi>materially,</hi> by doing those works that would profane it, if God had not commanded them for his service: but being that he hath so done, those Priests <hi>are blameless</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Mat. 12.5.</note>, because those works, though servile in their nature, yet were sacred in their end and application. Such a work was the infirm mans car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his bed on the Sabbath when Christ had heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39273:56"/>
him <note n="(e)" place="margin">Joh. 5.8.</note>. The bearing of burthens, on that day, for worldly lucre, is one of the things that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here contends against; but that mans carrying his bed became a religious action, by being an appurtenance of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and an open declaration to all men (who on that day did more flock together), of the grace and power of God by which he was cured; under this head may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended those bodily provisions that are <hi>truly</hi> needful and helpful for our more able and vigorous performance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, or for the glory of God some other way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Works of necessity</hi>] to wit, real, not feigned; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and apparent, not possible only, and which may be or not be: To this we may refer the Disciples plucking and eating the ears of corn <note n="(f)" place="margin">Mar. 12.1, 2, 3, 4.</note>, whom Christ excuseth, because, at that time, they (as <hi>David</hi>) needed sustenance <note n="(g)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Discipulos excusat, quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am humanam opponit necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem quasi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precatricem.</hi> Tertul. advers. Marc. lib. 40.</note>. And add thereto the other plain instance of a Sheeps falling into a pit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.11. which they that so quarrel'd with our Saviour, made no scruple to pull out on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Works of mercy</hi>] as the healing of the woman bound by Satan, <hi>Lo eighten years,</hi> Luk. 13.15, 16. A Saviour so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful would not stand upon healing on the Sabbath day in a case so pitiful; for, <hi>The Sabbath is made for man,</hi> Mar. 2.27. that is, the rest of the Sabbath is to give place to mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; And though God propound to us his example of rest on the seventh day for our resting, yet we have his example of working also for mans benefit; for (saith Christ) <hi>my Father worketh hitherto</hi> 
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Joh. 5.17.</note>, (no Sabbath day excepted) to wit, in the preservation, government, and for the good of his Creatures.</p>
               <p>Thus of the first thing belonging to a Sabbath, to wit, <hi>rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The thing further and chiefly required, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is intended in this rest, is <hi>holiness,</hi> Remember the Sabbath day, <hi>to keep it holy</hi>; wherein is contained,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A reverent opinion of it</hi>] to wit, as the <hi>Lords holy and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:39273:57"/>
honourable day</hi> 
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Isa. 58.13.</note>, There will never be a good observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in our practise, without an estimation of it in our judgement. Men will not leave the world (with which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture closeth) nor close with God in those holy things which nature is opposite to, and in the best, too averse from; I say, they will not do this on a day (and that every week) which they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> care not for; on which they see no divine chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; and in the service whereof they expect no divine blessing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A dear affection to it] calling it a delight</hi> 
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">Isai. 58.13.</note>, and loving to be <hi>in the spirit</hi> on that day, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>An holy imploying of the rest</hi>] and bestowing of our selves in the duties belonging to such a day. This is well express'd, in those considerable Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> thus, <hi>The first day of the week, which is the Lords day, is wholly to be dedicated to the service of God; and therefore we are bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to rest from our common and daily business, and</hi> (mark what followeth) <hi>to bestow that leisure upon holy exercises both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Publike</hi> exercises are the principal; In reference to which publike worship especially, the Sabbath is (as I conceive), said to be a <hi>Sign,</hi> that is, an open de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>laration, <hi>Whose we are, and whom we serve,</hi> Jona. 1.9. Act. 27.23. For it doth not follow from the word [Sign] that the weekly Sabbath is a typical Ceremony: If it were so, then it should be a sin to observe a Sabbath now, since all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies end in Christ, in whom (notwithstanding) the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbath begins (as to the day) and by whom it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as it is a weekly day, (which the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement requireth) because he declareth that he came not <hi>to destroy the Law,</hi> but to <hi>fulfill it</hi> 
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note>. It is not therefore a ceremonial sign (any more then the signs in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39273:57"/>
are ceremonial) but rather a moral and real sign and demonstration how things stand between God and his people, which will further appear by looking more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where it is called a <hi>Sign,</hi> for thus the Prophet expresseth it, <hi>I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctifie them</hi> 
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">Ezek. 20.12.</note>, which words are also mentioned and applyed to the weekly Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. 15, 16, 17. When the Sabbath is said to be a <hi>sign,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is (as some do most probably expound it <note n="(q)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jun.</hi> &amp; <hi>Trem.</hi> in Exod. 31.13.</note>,) that it is a document or an instructing Sign, and that <hi>between</hi> God and his people [<hi>me and you</hi>] <note n="(r)" place="margin">Exod. 31.13.</note>, saith the Lord; it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and sheweth that which is common to us both, to wit, on my part, that I am your Creator and Sanctifier; on your part, that you are a people, by Me created and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; And that it is thus an instructing sign, appears by the words following, <hi>that ye may know</hi>; as if the Lord had said, Look on the Sabbath as a monument of the relation between me and you; I would have you know and observe it so to be. Upon a nearer view of the words, it will be found a teaching sign of these three lessons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>God is the Lord</hi> 
                  <note n="(s)" place="margin">Lev. 19.30. <hi>Ye shall keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, I am the Lord.</hi>
                  </note>, that is, that Lord who is the only true God, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10.) and that, because <hi>he hath made the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> v. 11, 12. Which the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sabbath, that is, resting a seventh day every week in relation to six dayes work, clearly holdeth forth; for it is in imitation of that God, who <hi>in six dayes made Heaven and Earth, and rested the seventh,</hi> who can be no other then the true God, and Lord of all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> lesson is, that this great Lord, is <hi>the God of his Church,</hi> or a God in Covenant with them: for thus the Lord speaks; <note n="(t)" place="margin">Ezek. 20.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Lord</hi> [your God] —<hi>Hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know</hi> (and learn this lesson) <hi>that I am your God</hi>; for, Why do they wait upon him a whole day, every week, but to shew that they own him as their God, and that they believe he owns them as his people? Hence the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, <hi>They sit before thee [as my people] and hear thy words</hi> 
                  <note n="(u)" place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note>.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:39273:58"/>The <hi>third</hi> lesson is, that <hi>he is the Lord that sanctifieth them;</hi> which may be understood two wayes;</p>

                  </note>, so as to enjoy the priviledg of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and so the Scripture speaks, <hi>Ye shall be holy to me, for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people that ye should be mine,</hi> Lev. 20.26. Exod. 33.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And also of an internal renovation, and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in spirit, and soul, and body,</hi> 1 Thess. 5, 23. by the Word preached on that day through the operation of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.32. &amp; 26.18. So that God hath not only made the Sabbath an holy day, but also make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men holy by his Ordinances, on that day (principally) dispensed.</p>
               <p>I have been the longer in this, because hereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what a necessity there is of a weekly Sabbath, as being a most signal Declaration and Representation of what God is in himself, that is, the maker of Heaven and Earth (his distinguishing character <note n="(y)" place="margin">Jer. 10.11, 12.</note>, and what he is to his Church, that is, a God in Covenant with them, and every way, a Sanctifier of them, and that's their distinguishing chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.16. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.19. Now (to return to the thing in hand) since the Sabbath becomes of this use, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the general and solemn meeting of Gods people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to Publike Service, (as Prayer, Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Preaching, administration of the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) therefore the rest and leisure we have on that day, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be bestowed in, and sanctified by, such duties; And therefore, the Sacrifices appointed for the Sabbath day were full double to those appointed for every day, <note n="(z)" place="margin">Num. 28.9.</note> for <hi>the Sabbath being a sign of more then ordinary favour from the Lord, he required greater testimonies of their thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sanctification</hi>

               <p>

Now, if this answer will hold, then may the like be said concerning the Sabbath day, that is, that the Sabbath night as well as other nights, is appointed of God for rest; but yet, if it so fall out, that we do not rest that night, or in any part of it wherein we do not rest, we are to remember, that it is a part of time belonging not to a working day, but to the Lords day, and therefore that it is to be used accordingly, that is, in one thing or other sutable to a Sabbath; and so, as that what we do in the light and in the night of such a day, may agree together: which shall be further opened in the ensuing Answers.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:39273:61"/>I have thus far enlarged in describing the Sabbath, out of a desire to establish the holy observation of the Lords day, which will best be discerned by that respect, reverence and observance that is due to the weekly Sabbath according to the fourth Commandement.</p>
               <p>Now, when we know what is meant by [Sabbath], and by the observation of it; it's easie to know what is meant by the <hi>profanation</hi> thereof (mentioned before); which is, the applying of it to common use as we do the other six dayes, when God hath set it a part for holy and heavenly imployments: see <hi>Act.</hi> 10.15.</p>
               <p>This profanation must needs be (as I have said) an evil thing, because it is a transgression of the moral Law of God <note n="(y)" place="margin">1 Joh. 3 4</note>, which Law, though it be short, yet the Precept concerning the Sabbath is full and large. If that law be holy, and just, and good <note n="(z)" place="margin">Rom 7.12. See <hi>Perkins Serm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Sabbath is a common, yet so great a sin; that where it reigns, in that Countrey, Congregation, Family, Man, or Woman, there is no fear of God, nor any true grace in them.</note>, then the profanation opposite to it must needs be evil: Hence the Lord himself said of old, when that which was commanded on the Sabbath was not obeyed, <hi>How long refuse ye to keep my Commandements and my Laws?</hi> Exod. 16.28. &amp; Ezek. 22.18. <hi>Thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned my Sabbath,</hi> is in the catalogue of their sins.</p>
               <p>But because there are two things about the Christian Sabbath much disputed; one, the divine institution and appointment of a Sabbath day in every week, for all ages, by vertue of the fourth Commandement; the other, the divine constitution, or Gods ordaining of that weekly day for a Sabbath which we now observe, that is, the first day of the week, commonly called the Lords day: I shall therefore endeavour (as I am able) to speak something, in way of resolution, to these two proposals, that so, Sabbath-doubts may not hinder Sabbath-duties. For the former of these I propound this question.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>How doth it appear that the Law of the Sabbath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                  <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fourth Commandement, continueth, and is in force in Gospel times, for the observing of one day in seven as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or day of holy rest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If it be not of any force, then we have not now a Decalogue, that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> there are not now in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39273:62"/>
time of the Gospel, Ten Commandements, but nine only.</p>
               <p>If it be said, <hi>That doth not follow, because something of that Commandement remains, and is in force for ever, to wit, that some time should be set a part for the publike worship of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer, That it is manifest to him that reads the fourth Commandement, that the thing required in it, is not <hi>a time at large</hi> (which the second Commandement, that prescribeth the Worship of God, supposeth; because nothing can be done, unless there be a time set apart for the doing of it) but that which is enjoyned, is <hi>a day</hi>; Nor is it a day at large, but <hi>a day in every week,</hi> for it is opposed to six working dayes; Nor is it a day in a week <hi>at large,</hi> but such a day as may challenge this title, <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> that is, it must be a day of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, When a Master saith to his servant, wait on me eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week in the day I appoint you, and lay before him great reason for it; If the servant should say, My Master looks for no more but that I should wait on him one time or other, it would be but a poor account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any of the ten Commandements be taken away, it must be taken away by Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note> that is, by his order, or by some declaration from him; But, he saith, he came not to <hi>take away, but to fulfil the Law</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note>. And to prove that, he instanceth in divers Precepts of the Moral Law, which he presseth in the greatest height of spiritual observation. Why should the fourth Commandement be taken away any more then the fifth? which yet the Apostle urgeth strongly upon children, and that from the moral and perpetual reason thereof, which though it be delivered in a <hi>Jewish</hi> phrase re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet for the substance of it, it concerns all men that live <hi>on the earth,</hi> Ephes. 6.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>There is this difference between the fourth and fifth Commandement:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>That Nature teacheth men to obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but to observe a Sabbath one day in seven, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In regard of a day of holy Rest in general,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> Nature is not silent; for it granteth a God; and that that God is to be worshipped; and therefore that a time must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be set a part for it; and that, a <hi>convenient</hi> time, and in such a distance, that we may neither neglect our God, nor our affairs; And, taking it for granted, that the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is known, that is, that God did make the world in six dayes, and rest the seventh; Nature hath a fair copy to write by, and a glorious example before it to work upon, and to take a light from, to work and to rest in such a proportion of time; I say, <hi>to rest,</hi> for Nature speaks out this fully, that the time consecrated to God must be a time of rest; because, we cannot serve God in holiness, and be about profane and common imployment, both at once.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we take in, to the light and principles of Nature,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note> the assistance of divine Revelation, then Nature will say all that needs to be said for a Sabbath, to wit, that it is fit God should appoint his own time for his own service, and therefore he in his Word having appointed a weekly time, such a time ought to be observed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Setting aside all the <hi>natural</hi> morality that may be pleaded for a weekly Sabbath,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3.</note> it sufficeth that the spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one day in seven in holy Rest, is enjoyned by the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> Law of God; for, why shall not the Law of the God of Nature (revealed from Gods mouth, or) written in the Word, bind as well, and as much as the Law of Nature writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart? especially considering that what is spoken or written by God (especially by his own finger, as the Ten Commandements were), is pure and incorrupt, as that is not which is written in mans heart, though it were so when it was first written. Yea, Why may we not say (in some respect) that it is worse to disobey a positive law, then a law of Nature? and that because, where Nature saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but God saith all; there's a greater tryal whether Gods Word, his naked Will, and Prerogative Royal, is of any weight with us or no; and in the despising of such a command, a greater indignity is offered to the Supream Law-giver; as if a Law of his mouth were not worth the

marking, unless Nature and Reason open their mouths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; unto which we may add, that he who disobeyeth a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive law, alwayes disobeyteh a natural, to wit, this, that it is meet and necessary, that God should have his will, and retain his soveraignty, which by transgressing a plain precept, wherein Nature can say nothing, is more violated. Hence, that first sin, in eating the forbidden fruit, for the forbearing whereof (being considered in it self) Nature had not what to say, did undo us all, there being thereupon, this charge drawn up against all mankind, in the first man, <hi>Hast thou eaten of the Tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat</hi>

If it be supposed, that the fourth Commandement enjoyneth the seventh day from the Creation (which I grant not, save only in that sense which I shall afterward express) yet, that hindereth not, but that it remaineth also firm, and in force for one day in seven, as well as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the fifth Commandement is a moral and perpetual reason, though it be delivered in a Jewish phrase, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, in the first place and in the form of words, the Jewish people, and therefore the Apostle (to extend the force of the reason to all places and persons thus explaineth it, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ephes. 6.3.</note>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:39273:63"/>
but it doth not command or institute any particular or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual day, save only in the generality, that is, as it falls under the general notion of being a day <hi>of Gods appointment</hi>; which day of Gods appointment was well known to the Jews, otherwhere, and before the fourth Commandement was delivered; and therefore it is spoken of in the sixteenth of <hi>Exodus</hi> as a known law <note n="(f)" place="margin">Exod. 16.29. <hi>The Lord [hath] given you the Sabbath,</hi> not doth [now] give.</note>, and <hi>the people on the sixth day gathered twice so much bread, two Omers for one man</hi>; when on other dayes they gathered but one, as being accustomed to observe the Sabbath <note n="(g)" place="margin">

And as the day the Jews observed and spent in holy rest, was known otherwise, and needed not to be expressed in the fourth Commandement; so also, the day that we Christians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, though it be not mentioned in that Commandement, yet is otherwise sufficiently made known to be the day that God hath ordained for his weekly Sabbath in Gospel-times, as shall appear hereafter.</p>

As, in like manner our first-day-Sabbath is grounded on the fourth Commandement, because it is that one of seven which God hath appointed to be observed since Christs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4.</note>4. I answer, (as before), that, otherwise then thus, the fourth Commandement requireth not any particular day; but that which it commandeth, is, (to come more closely to the question) <hi>one day in seven in relation to six working dayes,</hi> as the Commandement it self expresseth, saying, <hi>Six days shalt thou labour,—but the seventh is the Sabbath</hi>;—as if it had been said, Divide the week, and there being seven dayes in it, take thou the sixth, and give me the seventh, and namely, that seventh, which I appoint and give order for. And that the Commandement is thus to be interpreted, may appear both by the first words thereof, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy</hi>; (he saith not, the seventh day, but the Sabbath day): as also, by the last words, wherein it is said, <hi>the Lord blessed, and hallowed,</hi> (not the seventh day, but) <hi>the Sabbath day,</hi> which sheweth, that the main drift and intent of the Commandement, was not the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Jews seventh, or any other particular day, but of a weekly Sabbath, or of one day in every week: such as then was, or afterward was to be, specified, and declared of God to be his day of rest; yet such as may be called the seventh day, because it must be the seventh part of the weekly time.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note>Object. <hi>But it is said in the latter part of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brought in also as a reason to observe it, that</hi> God rested the seventh day, <hi>whence it is thus argued: That day is meant, in the body of the Commandement, as the day enjoyned to be the Sabbath or day of Rest, wherein God himself rested; But that was the seventh in order from the Creation; Therefore that's meant by [seventh day] in the body of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, in the whole Commandement, for God blessed and sanctified that day for the Sabbath whereon himself rested.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant that God rested <hi>that</hi> seventh day; and that he blessed and sanctified it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> but How? Not meerly

as that particular seventh, but <hi>as a Sabbath,</hi> for so (as it was but now said) the Commandement expresseth it <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>God rested the seventh, and blessed the Sabbath.</hi>
                  </note>; only the blessing and sanctification was, at first, fixed on the seventh from the Creation, because that was the day set a part to be the Lords Sabbath for that first age of the world.</p>
               <p>I grant also, that Gods resting is brought in as a reason of the Commandement. But then, the question is, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the force of that reason lyeth? To which I say, that it is not brought in as a reason of resting on that individual and precise day, wherein God rested, (save only under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and consideration, that it was the day at that time, and for that first world, appointed of God to be his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) For, it is not a cogent, or inforcing argument, We must rest one day in every week, and never work more then six, because God rested the last day of the week: but this is a strong and convincing reasoning, We must rest one day in seven perpetually, and work but six, because God, our great Lord and Maker, did only work six dayes, and make the remaining day (which was then the seventh in order) a Sabbath, holding forth that his example for our imitation.</p>
               <p>I shall say this over again in some other words, more fully to open my mind, and the matter in hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore express it thus, The argument drawn from Gods Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is not for the same day, that is, for that very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth (wherein He rested) <hi>determinately,</hi> as if it reached and extended it self to no other day in the week; but it is for [a] seventh, or for the day wherein God rested, as a seventh <hi>comparatively,</hi> that is, in relation to his six working dayes, and therefore they are compared together both in the body of the Commandement, where it is said, <hi>Six dayes shalt thou labour, but the seventh, is the Sabbath</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, in the conclusion, wherein it is not barely said, <hi>God rested the seventh day,</hi> but it is brought in with this, <hi>In six dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth,</hi> that is, <hi>ended his work</hi>

                  </note>. To conclude, the reason is not for that <hi>peculiar portion of time</hi> wherein God rested, as if God meant no more but to reason men into the observation of that seventh day (for then the fourth Commandement is gone, or else the Saturday-Sabbath is to be observed still): but it is for <hi>the proportion of time,</hi> that is, for a weekly day, or one day in a week; and for the portion and particular day, only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods appointment: which appointed time, to the Jews was Saturday; to us now, it is the Lords day.</p>

               <p>For the confirming of which, that the translation of the Sabbath from the Jewish day to the first day of the week, was by the Lord himself, or divine Authority, I thus argue:</p>

                  <p>Some men talk of an <hi>every-dayes Sabbath</hi>; but as to make every man a Magistrate, is to take away Magistracy; and to let every man be a Minister, is to take away the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39273:68"/>
so to make every day a Sabbath, is to say, No day shall be a Sabbath. They may call every day a Sabbath, because we are to rest and abstain from sin, every day; but herein they deceive themselves in that they do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that on the Sabbath day, we must not only abstain from sinful things (albeit then we should abhor them most); but, from those things that are not sinful on other dayes, but lawful and needful, and which, it is a sin not to look after, as the works of our ordinary Callings; for, look how a Subject that is called to wait on his Prince, is not only to leave his good Fellows, and that loose and vain company (which he ought alwayes to separate himself from) but also his Wife, Children, whole Family, and all his domestick affairs, which, out of this case, and when there is no such Call, it is his sin to be unnecessarily absent from, and his duty to abide with, and take care of; and so when our Lord calls us to wait on him a whole day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as he doth on the Lords day) all other things are, for that time, to be laid aside (save only those which our Lord alloweth us) though at other times lawful and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: When two good things are to be done, and both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, our reason will tell us, that it is necessary, for that time, to leave the less, and apply our selves to the greater: which being well considered, will amount to this, that it is necessary, that these earthly things should be for a convenient time, with-drawn from; that is, that there should be a weekly Sabbath, (for that's the most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time), to give up our selves intirely to those things that ought to be highest in our account; to wit, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and service of our God, and the salvation of our souls. It's a poor plea to say, <hi>I must needs go see my Ground</hi>; <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk. 14.18.</note>, (when God calls to his Supper) but it's a good pleading of necessity, to say, <hi>I must needs goe see my God,</hi> Psal. 63.2.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is more attended,</hi> because a Sabbath is a day of rest, and receding from worldly works, that we may better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selves to divine Worship.

And the truth is, that in the Sabbath all Religion is wrapt up; for God is eminently <hi>acknowledged, worshipped, professed and praised</hi> (as the three first Commandements require) upon that day; And all
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:39273:74"/>

But we may not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake here; for albeit it be supposed, that all Religion is spoken to, yet it doth not follow from thence, that the Sabbath day (in the setting forth whereof the Text is so full) is to be excluded; nay rather, it is thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter established. As when a Father takes order in his last <hi>Will,</hi> that his Son shall go to the University, his meaning is, that his Son shall be a Scholar: but (withall) his mind is, that he shall go to the University, because that's the way to make him a Scholar, and therefore he expresseth nothing but that, for that contains the other. So it is here.</p>
                     <p>We may observe, (casting our eye upon this whole chapter) that as in the former part of it, the Prophet shewed their Religion was not to be placed in <hi>fasting</hi>; so here he declareth that the observation of the Sabbath, is not to be placed in <hi>resting</hi> (to which the Jews used to ascribe so much) but in the spiritual sanctification of that rest, which (indeed) hath and ought to have an influence, and to extend its vertue, into our whole life, to make it the more holy: But now mark, that as the Prophet before, in his Doctrine of a Fast, and his disciplining of their Fast, did not exclude the day of their Fast (and the observation thereof); but saith plainly [<hi>In the day of your Fast,</hi> v. 3.] so neither doth he here, where he delivereth the doctrine of the Sabbath, shut out the <hi>day</hi> of the Sabbath, but only shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Rest and leisure of that day, is to be bestowed in spiritual things appertaining to the substance, and tending to the furtherance of true Religion.</p>

Some others may say, that if the Text to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the weekly Sabbath, yet it speaks to the Jews only, not to us; and of their day, not of ours: Unto which, it may suffice to say, that as the fourth Commandement belongs to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as to Jews, and the holy observation required there, belongs to us, in regard of our Sabbath, as well as to them, in regard of theirs; so in this Scripture,

and in the whole Scripture of the Old Testament, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thing is Spiritual and of an Evangelical nature, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to us as well as to them, and may upon just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts be more pressed on us then on them, because it is our happiness to have more means for, and therefore our duty to make further progress in, all things appertaining to godliness.

                     <p>However, it is a clear truth, that honour and estimation still followeth the fear of God, I say, that fear of God, which is learned, and still better learned, by Sabbath-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and Exercises <note n="(i)" place="margin">Psal. 34.11.

                     <p>And if we look on the state of things amongst our selves, it's easie to observe that they have not taken a good course, either for their comfort or honour: Unto one and another of whom, the Sabbath may say, <hi>Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord helped me</hi>

                  <p>The first in the Old Testament is, Deut. 6.6, 7. <hi>These words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart, And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt

                  <p>For the opening of this Scripture, and the awakening of Conscience to a due consideration of it, there comes to be considered in the first place, Who it is that speaks in it, even the Eternal God by his Servant <hi>Moses,</hi> that was faithful in all his house.

Deut. 6.8, 9.</note>; but it was, and is, a moral, and perpetual Precept, binding us in Gospel-times as well as them, and therefore the very same things that we read in this Text, we find also in the New-Testament: That is,</p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> for even children well grown up, (being not catechised before) are not like, at their first teaching, so to understand what is said to them, as to recite and repeat it, with due reverence. It may something help in this, that we find Christ himself instructing <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> in the mystery of Regeneration, when he was able to return him only this sorry and unbeseeming Answer, <hi>How can a man be born again when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mothers womb</hi> 
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 3.4.</note>? Yea, after that, we find our Saviour delivering a divine truth to those that were known to be his Disciples, and who still accompanyed him, and repeated themselves what he spake to them in

the very same words wherein he delivered it; and yet, when all was done, confessed they could not tell what he said <note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 16.16, 17, 18.</note>: yet we may not say, that by reason of that their ignorance they took that Name of God in vain, (which is imprinted on every Word of God, and so was on those words of Christ), I say, this was not a vain busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for in this way they understood the words of Christ at last, the meaning whereof they knew not at first.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That if we will consider of this rightly, we must set one thing against another;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1.</note> and then it will be found that the more they that are young, grow in years, the more they will surely grow in corruption, being left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out instruction; and thereby by how much they are more capable in regard of their natural understanding, by so much they will be less capable of any good thing through their grown corruption.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. I answer further, that, Parents may and should find out wayes to frame the spirits of their children to a greater reverence when they are catechised, then at other times, and in other things. Now it's true, that if they be very little, this must needs be less done; but yet it may still be in doing, and something may be done in it, because they understand, even then, what Parents say, or else they would not be capable of making them reasonable answers; And the more they grow up, the more will this holy reverence grow up with them and in them.</p>
                  <p>But to the main Objection propounded, I shall give a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Answer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note> which is this; Catechising is considered two wayes;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of the present action.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is an Introduction and Preparation to the future and further knowledge of God. Now, though little ones do not at first, so understand as to use with due reverence
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39273:88"/>
the Name and Things of God; yet it followeth not, that they take Gods Name in vain, because they repeat good things in order to, and for, the gaining of such a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of those holy things, as whereby after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they come to use them more reverently; And therein, the first use of them, (though not so reverent) hath a part, as being preparatory to it, and having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into it, and working, as a good means for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of it. As when Parents teach very little children their <hi>letters</hi> by signs, and certain pretty devised sayings and resemblances, which put their little ones in mind of them, this is not a vanity, but a way suited to their littleness, to make them learn them the sooner: so it is in this and the like cases; For, The first Rudiments are still to be taken and judged of, not in a way of separation from what follows after, but as a preparation to it, and being so taken, they are not vain, but material things, because they serve to very considerable ends.</p>
                  <p>This shall suffice for the Old-Testament.</p>
                  <p>The Precept, prescribing Catechising in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is laid down <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.4. in these words; <hi>And ye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the precept contained in these words there are two Branches;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Parents are warned, not to abuse their office, power, and authority by provoking their children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to neglect to make use of it in instructing their children; and both these are not without great reason mentioned: For in Parents there is not only Nature, and natural affection, but natural corruption, by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if they watch not well, it will be very incident unto them to be curious; yea, and furious with their children, that their own will may be fulfilled: There is need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say, <hi>Provoke not.</hi> And, on the other side, there is a danger of being too indulgent, and careless, to bring up children to such courses as are necessary for the knowing and doing of the will of God: Hence it is that there is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:39273:89"/>
as much, or much more need of the latter branch of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which is, <hi>But bring them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first word [<hi>But</hi>] serves well to joyn together the two branches of the Precept, or parts of the verse: for it holds fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th a cure of the Provocation spoken of in the former part; and a care of the Instruction prescribed in the latter part; Do not provoke, but instruct; yea, instruct, and you wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l not, or, at least, you shall not have cause, to provoke; for a well-instructed child is in Gods way to be an obedient child, and very tractable to the instructing Parents, so that there shall not be any occasion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking from him, or being provoked against him. A care of the duty in the latter part of the verse, will be a good prevention of the fault in the former part; for thy child knowing from thee Gods mind (O Christian Parent) will not (God blessing the instruction, of which the Precept to give it, giveth the hope); I say, he will not do contrary to thy mind, if thy mind agree with Gods mind.</p>
                  <p>After this connecting and conjoyning Particle, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Precept concerning childrens <hi>nurture,</hi> which Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, howsoever, in it self, it comprehends good and wholsom Instruction of every kind; yet the last words [<hi>of the Lord</hi>] fasten it on that religious nurture, and admonition, which is, of all other the principal, and of which it belongs to this place to speak.</p>
                  <p>Now whilest I come to the further opening of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, it may be noted that there are (in the <hi>Original</hi>) three words offered to our Observation, the explaining whereof will serve for a more full discerning of what is here prescribed.</p>
                  <p>The first word is, <hi>nourish or feed them</hi>

speaking to <hi>Timothy</hi> 
                     <note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.6.</note>, sets forth plainly in some other words, but to the same effect, calling it, a <hi>nourishing in the words of faith, and of good doctrine.</hi> But (besides this) <hi>Paul</hi> here goes to the bottom and beginning of all good nurture, which is Information, or an informing Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; The word signifies an Instilling, or putting a thing into the mind; And this infusing or dropping In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction into the Understanding of a Child, helps the Child to help the Father, and to carry on his own good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his own light, because his well-informed reason enableth him to see the necessity and benefit of it. The life and manners cannot be good, unless the mind be good <note n="(m)" place="margin">Act. 8.21. Tit. 1.15, 16.</note>; The mind cannot be good without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note n="(n)" place="margin">Prov. 19.2.</note>; Nor will Knowledge be had without Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admonishing <note n="(o)" place="margin">Act. 8.31.</note>. In that therefore, as in a Golden Mine, the riches of religious Education lyeth, and is laid up.</p>
                  <p>O that so plain and full a Precept might so convince the understandings, possess and press the hearts, of Christian Parents, as to prevail with them for the bringing up of their Children, not only in Arts and Sciences, to make them wise; nor only in mysteries of trading and worldly imployment, to make them rich; nor only in matters of morality and civil honesty, to make them vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but in mysteries of Religion, in the nurture and information of the Lord, to make them truly godly and happy.</p>
                  <p>I shall only add this, (which I touched a little before) which is, that though children only be named in the Text, yet this should not cause Housholders to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves discharged, if they Catechise their Children and never instruct other young ones that are a part of their Houshold: for, He that is the Master of the House, is the Father of the whole Family, and may speak to all the Youth in it, as <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Samuel</hi> 
                     <note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.6.</note>, whom he called his <hi>son,</hi> and accordingly should disperse knowledge among them that they may not live under his roof, care, and charge without some acquaintance with God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39273:91"/>
being bredd up to do some homage and service to Him. It would be a poor business for <hi>Mothers</hi> to say, We need not bring up our children in any good nurture, for the Scripture in the New-Testament, (that especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it) names only <hi>Fathers</hi>: No more will Fathers be excused, because none are named here to be instructed by them, but only their children. It's true, that under the notion of Fathers of children (of whose duty the Apostle here properly speaketh) they are called to Catechise their own children; but as they are Masters and Fathers of Families, a further care and charge lies upon them in regard of other young ones, and namely, of Servants under them, and with them.</p>
                  <p>Yet I do not say, That Housholders are bound to walk in the same way with those that are elder in the Family, as they do with their children; or to bestow the same time in instructing servants and children. It's true, that to appoint some day or dayes in a week, to examine and go on with servants, in some sound and plain Catechism, (as namely, the <hi>Assemblies short Catechism</hi>) is a godly Exercise, and a provident way to preserve the duty of Family-Instruction, and to make it the more minded: But, yet, if Housholders did but upon the Sabbath-day call those that be grown up to give account of the Sermons they hear; Chapters read in the Family on the week-days; And further, If having (as they ought) an eye upon their carriage, and seeing any neglect or fault in them, they did take them to task, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with them about it, reprove and admonish them, that for time to come they might amend it; and, then observe whether they do so or no; even this I say, (with some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the very first Principles of Religion in way of conference) might pass for that which we call (<hi>Catechising</hi>) that word in Scripture <note n="(q)" place="margin">Luk. 1.4. 1 Cor. 14.19. Gal. 6.6.</note>, being divers times applyed to a more general kind of Teaching; But, if such a concession as this, and yielding to any thing, be abused; if nothing be done in this duty, or nothing to purpose; then may one Servant and another (if it be possible for an uncatechised Servant to have so much grace), come and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:39273:92"/>
say seriously and sadly, (I say sadly, both in regard of themselves and the Houholder), <hi>Master, Carest thou not that we perish?</hi> And let the Master consider, how he will answer it.</p>
                  <p>Mean-while that I may return to the Text, as it stands clear for Parents Catechi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing, let it be (in the last place) observed, that Parents Instruction of their Children is of so great importance, that if they therein did their duty, then the work concerning Servants were already (in a good part) done; for they should deliver (in this way) to every Master a catechised Servant, and so the Master should have nothing to do, but to preserve and carry on that which is already brought to his hand. But, if for want of this godly care (O Christian Master), a catechized Servant be not brought to thee; let there be so much goodness in thee, and so much love to his soul, as that he may go a catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed-Servant from thee.</p>

I answer, If it be supposed, that they are left to the Ministry; yet, (being not catechized before) they are left to it unprepared for it; And I add further, What if they die before that time? then, they must die un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and that (I think) must needs be a sad death to the negligent Parents, and a dangerous death to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected child; whereas it is found by comfortable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that divers, very young, have dyed with very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, and some, with very rare, expressions of knowledge and godliness, attained by timely teaching.

their own not others children;) and have a larger and better opportunity to carry it on, by those frequent times they may allot to it, and those <hi>Parental</hi> wayes that are in their hands to promote it. Parents do something for their children when they put them forth to nurse, but they shall do better to nurse them up themselves with their own more kindly milk, and more natural attendance.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:39273:93"/>
are laid open to childrens understandings, and in some measure, laid in their hearts by their religious breeding: whereas, if a Minister be the first Teacher, the language of <hi>Canaan</hi> is so strange to a young Hearer, that (unless God work upon the heart, and bring in a light from Heaven into it) he hardly knows what to make of heavenly words or matter. Now, though godly Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not be savingly effectual without regenerating grace, yet this we may say of it, that children religiously bred up, are <hi>not far from the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> to wit, in comparison of others not so educated; for they can answer, <hi>more discteetly,</hi> Mark. 12.34.</p>

                     <note n="(d)" place="margin">Prov. 22.6.</note>; Not that it is ever so, but it is truly so, for the God of Truth hath said it; And something is gained by it, even in those that go quite from God at last, <hi>viz.</hi> that they do (for a time) very good offices for the people of God, and keep in an orderly way, as <hi>Joash</hi> did whilest <hi>Jehoiada</hi> instructed him, and trained him up in the wayes of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.2. Indeed, the Proverb of the prophane and godless world is, <hi>A young Saint and an old Devil</hi>; when they should say, (if they had any grace to say it), <hi>A young Saint, and an old Angel:</hi> for they that, by good education are planted in the Courts of the Lords House, <hi>bring forth fruit in old age,</hi> and even then <hi>they shall be fat and flourishing,</hi> Psal. 92.14.</p>
                  <p>By these things it may somewhat appear, that it is suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to religious reason as well as to Scripture, to urge those that have children and charges, to instruct them in the things of God in their tender and youthful time; But if there were no other argument, yet conscience might be hereunto moved and perswaded by the great unwillingness which we find in our evil natures to spend half an hour in Catechising; and the many devices that the Devil hath to divert it, when many half hours are wasted either in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or impertinencies; and yet we cannot but know (if Religion be of any value with us) that no time can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spent then that which is bestowed with young ones in bringing them up in <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>But that which I would more especially observe, is, that <hi>Paul</hi> (being sought by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to inform them about Mariage) doth not resolve them absolutely, and enjoyn them

For, what doth he say? or, what grounds doth he lay, but that Christians are not to enter into the Marryed estate,</p>

                  <p>Now, All these things are so sutable to the sense of Scripture, and to Reason also (enlightened by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) that if men will not be thus ruled, it shews, they are not willing God should rule them. It's true (indeed) that Ministers (now) are not infallible, nor to be compared with <hi>Paul</hi> (as an Apostle); but yet this may be inferred from <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of answering the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Questions, That any thing is binding truly, that is deduced from the <hi>generals</hi> of Scripture rightly; else could no use be made at

all (now) of general Scripture-truths (as to the deciding of particular cases); because no man (now) is infallible, and so men must be left to do what they list, in those things that are not particularly and punctually defined and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Word of God. And, How many such things are there? wherein, if we set aside the general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sayings and declarations of the Word, it will be hard for Ministers to know what to say? To mention some familiar Instances. We cannot tell Christian Women (particularly), what clothes they should wear, or how they should dress them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but we can tell them from God <note n="(n)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.9, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Perhaps that of <hi>Erasmus</hi> (in his Annotations on <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2.) might rightly compose the former difference; for he tells us, that the Christian Family; and any other that came to them and joyned themselves with them (as we find in the House of <hi>Mary,</hi> many gathered together Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.12.) are called by the name of <hi>Church</hi>; And then it will shew that it was then the use of Christians to perform religious duties in their Families, wherein they were glad to have others accompany them (as it is with godly Housholders at this day.)</p>

                  <p>From all this, it followeth, that calling on the Name of the Lord, is not only that which putteth a difference between the Church and Heathens <note n="(c)" place="margin">Jer. 10.25.</note>, and between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons converted and unconverted <note n="(d)" place="margin">Act. 9.11.

                  </p>
                  <p>In such ways as these, God calls upon us to call upon Him, together with our Family. Though it be not said in so many words, that every Christian Housholder is to pray with his Houshold, yet this is <hi>really</hi> said in Scripture, that they are to glorifie God in their Families; And, that they are to serve God in their Families, by performing that duty of Prayer wherein the whole service of God is held forth; And that they should bless their Housholds, and take the best course (which is the course of Prayer) with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to procure Gods blessing upon them <note n="(e)" place="margin">

As to the causes of the neglect, they are the more considerable, because the truth is, that this question, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Housholders ought to perform the duty of Prayer with those belonging unto them?</hi> will be most plainly answered by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the causes of the neglect, will (as I conceive) be found such as these;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In lower and poorer people, ignorance and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedness <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with Religion.

A Farm, a Wife, or a yoke of Oxen may be the next reason, but Atheism lies at the bottom; for let all men examine (namely when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford God a Prayer Morning and Evening,) whether this thought do not lodge in the heart of one and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; <hi>To go about my business will do me some good, but Praying in my Family will do me none, but only hinder me of so much time.</hi> Now this wicked thought, to wit, that all time is lost that is bestowed in the Service of God; and that they that pray not, do as well as they that do, I say,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39273:109"/>
this is down-right Atheism. The bottom-cause of not calling upon God, is, that, <hi>The Fool saith in his heart, There is no God.</hi> See for this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14.1, 4, 6. <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, let every man enter into his own heart, and consider, what comfort there can be in refraining Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-worship, and restraining Prayer on such reasons as these; which yet (upon sincere and serious consideration) will (no doubt) be found the ordinary Pul-backs from so good a duty.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> The duty of Prayer is to be performed every day:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whereof while I speak in general, it will have an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into, and (by parity of reason) argue for, Family-Prayer.</p>

Of Repetition of Sermons in Families.</head>
               <p>THe Repeating of Sermons, I shall endeavour to move Christians unto, (as I have done in other things before-mentioned) both by Scripture and Reason.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Grounds of Scripture for Sermon-Repetition.</head>
                  <p>The first Scripture I shall mention, is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.2, 6. where the Lord first commands <hi>Jeremy</hi> to write all the words which he had spoken from the days of <hi>Josiah</hi> unto that day; and thereupon, <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls <hi>Baruch</hi> to write them from his mouth, and then commands him to read what he had written in the ears of the people, that so they might be brought to serious repentance for the preventing of their ruine; which sheweth, that things preached by Ministers (as <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s Sermons were in the Temple), or Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons delivered from Ministers mouths (as these words were now from <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s mouth), being written and repeated, are of special use; and so may serve to recommend unto us both the <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>repeating</hi> of Sermons.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The <hi>writing</hi>; that being here prescribed, and being so needful, that what is preached, may be rightly and fully repeated. And therefore, though the repeating be that which I intend to perswade here, yet I shall speak something of and for the writing of Sermons, because that is of such use for the Repetition; and answer what is most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly objected against it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note>Object. <hi>Writing hindereth hearing, that is, hearing with such attention and affection, and giving up the whole man to it, as there may be, if Noting be laid aside, and hearing be the only work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note>Whereunto I answer, That as it is not in my thoughts to bind every one to Noting, so neither is it my mind and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:39273:112"/>
sense, that any should be taken off from hearing with the best advantage, (I say, with the best advantage, <hi>all things considered</hi>); for I look upon Hearing as a necessary duty, and a special part of our obedience, but upon Repeating as an Auxiliary Exercise, and a part of our beneficial assistance. Besides, that divers cannot write, and all that can write, are not so able and apr for writing of Sermons.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth this, prejudice and take off the present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is <hi>Repetition</hi>: for a diligent hearer may (if he please, and be so provident) write what he hears immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after he hath heard it, and so repeat it; or, if he write not at all, yet, being able to retain it in his memory, he may communicate it in Repetition, by that ability; as the words which the man of God had spoken to <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> against his Altar were told, and (we may say) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, by the sons of the old Prophet unto their Father, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.11. <note n="(a)" place="margin">And it is said <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.13. that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah declared unto the</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>all the words that he had heard.</hi>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>But here I shall offer (to prevent the neglect of so great an Help as Writing is) these Considerations, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let every man deal truly; for <hi>the heart is deceitful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> above all things</hi> 
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Jer. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.9.</note>, and whilest one pretends (or perhaps, intends) a better hearing; yet he may, through the secret workings of corruption, forbear noting, because he is loth to take the pains which noting requires; yea, (it's possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) because he is not willing to be noted to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-noter, that being a thing which some will look upon, as too low for higher and more considerable Persons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Repetition is here spoken of (in special) as it is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Family-edifying exercise, which if it be left to memory, useth to be as defective as the memory is slippery; or, (where there is less Zeal, and Piety is less pleasing) to be altogether omitted, and that by the omission of writing; which would both furnish the hearer for Repetition, and make it minded, and make it easie, and so make it more willingly undertaken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Writing shews an estimation of what we hear, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a resolution to preserve the remembrance of it; As when
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:39273:113"/>
                     <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would shew how he prized his cure, and that it was in his heart to preserve the memory of it, there was <hi>the writing of Hezekiah</hi>

                        <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.9. Men will not trust their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, but put them down.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As hearing without noting, may more stir up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; so noting with hearing more prevents distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which Satan, by the variety of objects, more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiseth and multiplyeth when the mind is not kept to the matter by the intention of the writer.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Though by hearing without writing, the heart may be more moved, yet writing so imprints there that which is heard as that it is not so soon removed; for writing hath with it a multiplyed thinking of, and running over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again (in the inward thoughts) that which is preached and heard, till it be written down, and so it sinks more deeply, and leaves in the heart a more lasting impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

The Sermon written may be read and reveiwed a month, or twelve months after; yea, it may remain for the use of others many years after we are dead. Hence the Scripture when it would express the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of things, and the way of that continuance, saith, <hi>This shall be written for the Generation to come,</hi> Psal. 102.18.<note n="(e)" place="margin">

I do not say, it will be thus, if Book after Book be fill'd with Notes, which few or none can read but the writer himself; but, thus it will be, if, what is written (for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) hastily, be after written out legibly, which, because leisure will not permit many to do (if we speak of copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out whole Sermons,) therefore I would advise Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to an easier and shorter course, and that is, when they have noted largely, to observe the whole, and then cull out, and write out fair the choisest passages <note n="(f)" place="margin">It was observed in the late (and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently hopeful) Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though so young, yet that she was so provident, as not only to write down every Sermon as it was presently delivered; but, at special times, to pick out the choysest Sentences, and transcribe them in a Book on purpose with her own Royal hand. <hi>John Bachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> Epistle Dedicatory to the <hi>Royal Bud</hi> of our English hopes, Princess <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> prefixed to his [<hi>Golden Sands</hi>].</note>, which may be

By this means, Posterity (when they are in Heaven) may reap the benefit of that which they heard delivered, and were so careful to lay up; yea, by writing out briefly profitable and acceptable words of all sorts, the surviving godly Reader will be a great gainer by things so useful, and be much refresh'd al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer two things,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. No man knows how soon Ministers may be shut up, (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> here was), that they cannot speak to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hearers. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hearers know not how soon they may be shut up, either by sickness or restraint, that they cannot come to Ministers, and therefore, it's wisdom to make use of the present liberty, in writing down, and laying up, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Instructions; that so, though intercourse with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters be interrupted or removed, yet their Sermons being (as they say) in black and white, their former intercourse with them, and hearing of them, may in this way, make some comfortable amends, and serve for a profitable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: whereas, if old Sermons be forgotten, and new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons cannot be gotten; Christians are like to be at a sad loss, yea, though there be printed Sermons to be had; for, howsoever they may be very profitable, yet they may not be so sutable to the times and their state as those which they have heard, and which (perhaps) were prepared at first with respect to their condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I answer, That in the course taken here, to write from the mouth of <hi>Jeremy</hi> what was to be read by <hi>Baruch,</hi>

and use, which was, that by reading the words written in the Ears of all <hi>Judah,</hi> they might thereby be moved to such Humiliation and Reformation, as that the evil they heard pronounced might not come upon them <note n="(g)" place="margin">Jer. 36.6.</note>: Now, Albeit, that occasion was a more special occasion, yet this end is a common end: which, whilest it lets us see that the writing and reading of Sermons preached, is a good means (yea, Gods means) to work the heart to goodness, it doth thereby perswade us to imitation, and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And this declareth the use of Noting Sermons, which is not to lay them up in Books, and there leave them; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat and communicate them to others: Indeed, it's true, that what was done here, was done by the Lords direction; and, what was read here, was read in the Lords House; But, there being no just cause to appropriate this course (for the substance of it) to any time or people, we have reason to say, that this Divine direction, at this time, casts an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and an approbation upon the same course (in the generallity) at all times; and Gods end in this Reading and Repeating in His House, justly mindes us of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that may be had from it in our own houses; I mean, according as the matter is which is preached, written, and repeated; for, it is not always of that kind that these
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:39273:114"/>
words here were; but, whatever sort of matter it be, this Writing and Repeating is a way to make it more familiar to us, and fruitful in us. Thus of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second Scripture</hi> that I shall mention, is (<hi>Col.</hi> 4.16.) where the Apostle ordereth first, that the Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le written to the <hi>Colossians</hi> should be <hi>read among them</hi>; And then that they should <hi>cause it to be read also in the Church of the Laodiceans</hi>; for, it was not written (as one saith) <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Musc.</hi> in loc.</note> to <hi>Colossians</hi> as <hi>Colossians,</hi> (for the substance of it) but to the <hi>Colossians</hi> as Christians, and so, it was for the use of Christians generally, albeit, there was (it's like) a special respect in it to other Churches in the same Countrey, and namely, that of <hi>Laodicea</hi>: which, it is conceived, laboured under the same spiritual diseases that the <hi>Colossians</hi> did, and sure were in danger of being taken with those Errours that are mentioned in the second Chapter of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</p>
                  <p>Now, as this Scripture makes much for the reading of Scripture; and for the communicating of holy Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by one Church to another: so (by the like reason, and for the same ends) it recommendeth also the impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the things of God, once delivered by Ministers (as this Epistle was by <hi>Paul</hi>) by one Christian to another; and that especially, where their Interest, Opportunity, and Charge lies most, which we know to be in their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Families.</p>
                  <p>Unto the two former Scriptures, I shall add one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sentence more, which though I intend not to insist upon, yet Ingenuity and Piety will make it helpful to this holy Exercise; The words are these, <hi>God hath spoken once, twice I have heard this</hi> 
                     <note n="(i)" place="margin">Psal. 62.11.</note>, which howsoever it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of our hearing twice, because God speaks to us twice <note n="(k)" place="margin">Job 33.14.</note>, yet it is also a good Interpretation, and very suitable to the words (as they are rendred in our Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vin</hi> (writing upon those words) reciteth; to wit, that, though God speak but once, yet, we should hear it twice; that is, revolve it, ponder it <note n="(l)" place="margin">Luk. 2.19.</note>, and make
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:39273:115"/>
our selves to hear it again and again; which will be aptly applyed to the matter in hand, if we say, that when God speaks once, that is, by his Minister in Preaching, then we are to hear twice; that is, (as by Meditation in our hearts, so also, by Repetition) wherein there is apparently a second hearing) in our houses.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of Scripture-Grounds for Family-Repetition.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to the <hi>Reasons</hi> that may be given of this labour of Love, and whereby the minds of godly persons may be confirmed in this practise of Piety.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, I shall lay down a General reason drawn from the manifold profit that ariseth from Sermon-Repetition; For thereby</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sermon is <hi>better understood</hi> by a second skan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note n="(m)" place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Better laid up in the heart,</hi> by harrowing after the first sowing, unto which Meditation and Repetition may be compared, whereby any thing harder is broken, and the seed sown is covered and kept safe.

Now the better impressions there be within, and the more the Word is wrought into the heart, the better expressions and the more holy fruit there will be without; for, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh</hi>; Matth. 12.34. And so the hand work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

                  <p>In the next place I shall make use of some more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reasons of Repetition, and that, both in regard of our selves, and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In regard of our selves,</hi> There are three things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Reviewing of Sermons, and spending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more of our time and thoughts upon them is an effectual means of growing up in a right knowledge of Religion; for, the abilities and studies of Ministers (especially their Scripture-studies) are much sum'd up in their Sermons, which (therefore) being first attentively heard, (which writing ties the hearer unto), and afterward more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately considered of, in the Repetition, do thereby pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the hearer in a good degree with the Ministers suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; besides that, he freeth himself also from that sad imputation of being <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth</hi> 
                     <note n="(q)" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.7.</note>. Hence it is, that the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeans</hi> were so careful of, and are so much commended for, not only an hearing <hi>with all readiness of mind,</hi> but also a taking up of what they had heard into their thoughts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>Searching the Scriptures whether those things were so</hi> 
                     <note n="(r)" place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note>; yea, Hence also Ministers themselves, do write and preach the same things again and again, because (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever tediousness there be in it in it self, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet) they are sure it is <hi>safe</hi> for their people <note n="(s)" place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note>, and a great Preservative against the Infection of Errour, which is so much against Christians safety and salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to be carefully considered and weighed, that faithful Ministers and provident Pastors speak to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <note n="(t)" place="margin">Ezek. 34.4.</note> of their people, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the disease of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was a backwardness in receiving the Faith; and so the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> to the disease of those to whom he wrote, which was, though they received and professed the Faith, yet to be careless of a godly life, and those good works wherein Faith (if it be not a dead Faith) is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:39273:116"/>
fruitful; upon this ground, I infer, that albeit there be many printed Sermons which Christians may very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly read (and ought so to do) yet, the matter of them is not like to be so proper to, and fitted for, their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual condition as the Sermons of their own Pastor, who (being such a one as he ought to be) is (like <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note n="(u)" place="margin">Eph. 6.22. Phil. 2.19. Coloss. 2.1, 2. 1 Thess. 3.5.</note>,) diligent to know their particular <hi>state,</hi> and constitution, and sollicitous to dispense and administer that Instruction which is most suitable thereunto.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. And every hearer should very seriously take this to heart, that he is to give a special account of the Sermons which himself heareth, as being therein more concerned and more charged, then in those that are preached to other hearers. As the great works of God should, in that very respect, move us the more, because our own eyes have seen them <note n="(x)" place="margin">Deut. 11.2, 7, 8. Judg. 2.7.</note>. So the Words of God also, because our own ears have heard them. A Kings charge in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects own hearing, works much for obedience <note n="(y)" place="margin">2 Sam. 18.12. <hi>For in our hearing the King charged</hi> —</note>, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>entations to the contrary. The Sermons preached to us, are our Talents which we are to trade withall, as those of whom it shall shortly be demanded what we have gained. Now every mans reason will tell him, that of that whereof he is to give a special account, it behoveth him to take and make a special ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which easily falleth into <hi>Noting, and Repetition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>In regard of others</hi> also, this course is very considerable, it being much for the spiritual good and growth of those who have not heard, to hear and have (though at second hand) the things heard by others. Hence godly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Christians have ever been careful of this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note n="(z)" place="margin">For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to speak to their Families out of Gods Word, is good; but to repeat what Ministers speak, is safe, and likelier to be free from mistake.</note>. As Bees bring what they have gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, home to their Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, so do good Hearers, to their House and Family; and, as they that go to the Market, bring with them bodily Provision for the rest of the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that have not been there, so doth a provident Hearer spiritual Provision; By which means, the same good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may arise which we find wrought upon the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> by what the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> testified unto them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:39273:116"/>
concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which was that <hi>many of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans believed on him for the saying of that woman</hi> 
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 4.39.</note>; that is, that was a good preparation and excitation to their after full and firm believing; of which they give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the woman, <hi>Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him our selves</hi> 
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ver. 42.</note>. Accordingly, Christians communicating and repeating in the ears of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the good Instructions they have heard and noted themselves, may stir up in others holy affections, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their hearts unto the Lord; but then, all comes to perfection and to a solid setting of the soul in frame by hearing in their own persons from the Ministers of Christ, that which hath been before repeated and testified to them by the hearing of others.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I doubt not, but divers have found by their experience, (I am sure, I have found it by my own) that Sermons have divers times come nearer the heart, and under more Observation in the Repetition then in the first Hearing. Not but that the Word preached by the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts, is the principal and highest means of Edification and Salvation; but yet, (besides, that every man sees more by a review then at first sight), God is pleased so far to shew his liking of the conscientious use of every Christian exercise and assistance, as to follow it with a sensible addition of spiritual profit; so that, the <hi>searching Hearer</hi> is the noble and the <hi>thriving Hearer</hi> 
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">Act. 17.11, 12.</note>. And to this experience I shall leave the religious Reader thereby to make up what might be further spoken, for the Confirmation, and Commendation of this godly Family Exercise <note n="(d)" place="margin">

No more should Christians be in this duty, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.16, 18.</p>
               <p>Thus for grounds of Scripture serving to set forward the service of Singing of Psalms. I come now, to Scripture-reasons confirming this duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is an Exercise making much for the glory of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God; That usual Preface, [<hi>Let us Sing to the glory of God such or such a Psalm</hi>] sheweth that to be the intent of Singing, and of those who seriously apply themselves to it: Besides, The thing it self, that is, the action of Singing speaks so much; because it is exercised about that matter which makes much for the glory of God, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Word of God, which setteth forth, to the praise of God,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It makes much for the spiritual benefit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> those who rightly and religiously perform it; Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, the ordinary Introduction to this duty hath been, [<hi>Let us Sing to the Praise of God, and our own Edification.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Particularly, It edifieth and assisteth three ways; For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is (as hath been shewed before out of Scripture)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a <hi>teaching</hi> Exercise; teaching and helping us,<note place="margin">Read the places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which it is more tedious to write out.</note> to know rightly; believe firmly; live holily; and pray wisely and effectually.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To know,</hi> because many of the Psalms are <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> wherein divine Doctrine, (as <hi>Moses</hi> saith in

I shall say first, Who can but be sad (in the want of Ordinances) that sings the 42. &amp; 84. <hi>Psalms?</hi> But I add also, Who can be dejectedly sad, even in that want, that sings (as he should) <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.6.7, 8? for therein <hi>David</hi> sheweth, that when he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and bereft of the Tabernacle-ministry <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Tremel. &amp; Jun. in</hi> Psal. 63, 7, 8, 9.</note>, yet, he had singular comfort in the thoughts of God, and of his Providence, and in following God with his Prayers <hi>on his Bed</hi>; and in those several stations, which in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile he was forced to betake himself unto. To go on, Who can be dismayed with a <hi>Doeg,</hi> that sings seriously the 52. <hi>Psalm?</hi> for, that Psalm shews, not only the malice, but the madness and misery of the dogged Enemies of Gods people; or, Who can be afraid (with a fear of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement) of an <hi>Absalom,</hi> that observes the third <hi>Psalm?</hi> yea, or of any Adversaries, that sings well the forty six, and seventy six, <hi>Psalms?</hi> Nay, (to go further), How can they that have grievously sinned, be altogether comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and give way to despairing thoughts, who sing (with <hi>David</hi>'s Penitent and faithful Spirit,) the one and fiftieth <hi>Psalm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, as the Scriptures generally <note n="(m)" place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note>, so the Psalms especially, serve for consolation, being filled with the afflictions, sorrows, and supports of the faithful Servants of God. And something it is for the honour and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of this Exercise, that when godly men refresh themselves with it, profane men are so grieved at it; they cannot well and with patience (at least, without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy) pass by the houses where they hear Singing of Psalms, much less go into them; for, the Mirth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations of Godliness are heavy to them as well as the Rules, especially to Persecutors; Singing of Psalms hath been still the pleasure of Martyrs (as it was to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> 
                  <note n="(n)" place="margin">Act. 16.25.</note> in Prison;) but their Tormenters were torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and used them the worse for it; yet, such
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39273:122"/>
was the comfort of that Exercise, that they would not leave it; And when forcible restraints were put upon them, yet their hearts were full of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is observable, that this duty is commended to Christians in way of exchange, or in opposition to the vain delights of Unregenerate men, or of themselves in their unregenerate estate <note n="(o)" place="margin">Eph. 5.18, 19. 1 Pet. 4.3.</note> whence ariseth this argument for it, that it is a distinguishing Exercise, putting a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Heathens and Christians, between sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual and spiritual men. Profane-spirited men sport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their excessive Cups, abusive Songs, carnal and vain Catches, wanton and unclean Mirth, and so make me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody to the Devil in their houses; when (on the contrary) it becomes (and is the manner of) Christians and godly Persons to converse one with another in holy Hymns, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with recreating themselves in their houses and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therein making melody to the Lord, in their hearts. I say [<hi>in their hearts</hi>]; for an Hypocrite may sing, and that with a very good will, (especially if he have a very good voyce), but his pleasure is in the action of singing rather then in the holy frame of his heart; and he makes melody to himself and those that like him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the Lord that looks at the inner man. So that this Exercise (taken with its qualifications) puts a difference between men pious and profane, sincere and hypocrites, and so is like the <hi>Rain-bow,</hi> a pleasant sight and a better sign; I say, such is singing Psalms, a sweet Exercise in it self, and as it is an act of godliness; and a better sign, if well acted, that is, of a godly pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now that these reasons may be of more weight, and this Exercise of more use, I would advise Christians to two things.</p>

                  </gap>, but seem to affect it rather. O how rare a thing is it in those that sing Psalms, not to delight (yea not to terminate their delight) in themselves, if there be a greater sweetness in their voyce, or if they excel in skill in that vocal Musick, when all the melody should be, to the Lord? But, (to speak of that which is most usual), How many content themselves with keeping tune, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:39273:123"/>
carrying on the Exercise with others in a formal way, without understanding the matter of the Psalm, when they should sing with understanding, or with seeking to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand; And, yet there is another fault (which the best (I think) are not free from, or, if they be, they may be well reckoned amongst the best) and that is, the not minding in their singing that which they do understand, or (at least) not keeping their hearts to it [still]; but contenting themselves to mark what they sing now and then, and to do that at times, and by starts, which they ought to do at all times whilest such holy services are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the thing they have in hand, is, the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>It is easily observed, that the Devil makes great gaps in duties by distractions, and in this more then in other Exercises, by the advantage he hath from the nature of the service: wherein they that are imployed do so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the tune, and mark the Singers, so please themselves with the outward and natural part of it, (if it be well performed,) and have such various and turbulent thoughts, (if there be any thing not decent in it,) that they are easily drawn from the substance of what they sing, their hearts are alienated from what their mouths utter; and so there is a failing in that main rule, which is, to make melody to the Lord <hi>in their hearts</hi> 
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">Eph. 5.19.</note>: when better it is, to be out of tune with the voyce, then out of frame, in the heart. It's necessary that the Eye and the Ear should be so far watched and disciplined, as that they may not draw away the mind from meditation on the matter of the Psalm; This meditation and heart-holding to the thing in hand, is of such use in praying and praising God, that both of them are expressed by the word <hi>meditation</hi>; Hence <hi>Isaac</hi> is said to go out to <hi>meditate in the field at Even-tide,</hi> or <hi>to pray</hi>

in those Prayers and Praises which we conceive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selves, that we may frame them the better; but we are also to be thoughtful in, and to attend unto, those that are already framed to our hand, especially out of Scripture, for which we have this rule given us, to <hi>set our hearts to all the words</hi> thereof <note n="(u)" place="margin">Deut. 32.46.</note>; whether we hear them, or read them, or sing them, still, that's the rule; and the rather to be observed in Singing, because the words spoken of in the fore-cited Scripture, are the words of <hi>Moses Song</hi>

               <p>But I must hasten; Were these things searched, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, what is amiss reformed, and this Exercise conformed to Scripture-rules, What sweetness would there be in it? How much would Knowledge, Holiness, and Comfort be improved by it? In a word, What strong arguments might Christians make for Singing, by making conscience how they sing? I confess, exactness in this duty is an hard work to the best, but would be an happy work to all, and is (in some measure) attainable by all.</p>
               <p>To conclude the whole; Let me beseech all serious Christians, to look upon Singing of Psalms, as the Soul-support of <hi>David,</hi> (the sweet Psalmist of <hi>Israel</hi>

               <p>After all, I shall put down those short Prayers, which I mentioned before, when I spake of the duty of Family-Prayer; but have thought it fittest to place them here, that the Treatise might not be interrupted; and that such as need them, might more easily find them: I say, such as need them, for they are framed only for the help of weak and well-minded Christians that would pray in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies if they knew how; And these Forms are put down, not to <hi>tie them,</hi> (as if they should use no other, or needed no more) but to <hi>teach them,</hi> that by this assistance they may set upon this duty, and do something in it, and by doing a little at first, may be able to do more after; and most, and best, at last.</p>
