            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> who were disobedient after the manner and likeness of those, that lived in the times of <hi>Noah.</hi> But against this Exposition I have these Two things to allege,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In General, That it is a sure Rule of the <hi>Schools,</hi> and ought to be followed in the explaining of <hi>Scripture, Scripturae verba proprie accipienda sunt, quando nihil inde absurdi sequitur</hi>; that the words of <hi>Scripture</hi> are to be taken properly, and according to their Literal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as they are vulgary understood, when nothing of absurdity, nothing that is disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Faith,</hi> or the <hi>common notices of Mankind,</hi> can follow from such a literal acception. And therefore to seek for <hi>Allegoryes</hi> in plain sense, and find out Mysteries, where none were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is neither safe, nor proper; for if a liberty be once indulged herein, what bounds can be set to a roving fancy, which loves to sport it self with pleasing <hi>Idaeas</hi> and <hi>Phantasms</hi> it self has raised? and men too are very favourable to the issue of their brain, those fine and nice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38363:13"/>
conjectures and interpretations, that owe their conception and being to a strong and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>imagination.</hi> And how much <hi>Religion</hi> has been prejudiced, and the truth of <hi>Scripture-story</hi> brought into question by this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this vein and humour of <hi>Allegorizing,</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> by his great Name and Learning brought into the Church, having borrowed it from <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> I wish there was no cause to complain, especially in this <hi>Age</hi> of ours, wherein every <hi>Pretender,</hi> out of an itch of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory to seem wiser then others, presently sets up for an <hi>Origenian,</hi> and vents his ill-grounded conjectures for proofs and demonstrations, and revives Old opinions, very <hi>uncertain,</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> and <hi>heretical,</hi> and justly condemned as such by the Zeal and Learning of former Ages, as the great <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as if Providence could not be justified without their admittance, nor the Articles of Faith and the Attributes of God Salved, unless we believe a <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of <hi>Souls, Genii</hi> living in the Air, and <hi>vehicles</hi> formed out of <hi>Aether</hi> by the <hi>Plastick</hi> life and virtue of the Soul after its departure out of the Body. But it is to be feared, that, while
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38363:14"/>
they follow <hi>Origen</hi> too close, even in his errors, and take up his way of interpreting some parts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> according to a pretended <hi>Cabbala</hi> and a <hi>mystick Theology</hi> fetched from <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> they have given occasion to <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>profane Persons</hi> to deny the Truth of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In special, That the <hi>Text</hi> does expresly refer, as was said before, to the times of <hi>Noah,</hi> and to those that lived in them; and therefore cannot be meant, as the learned <note n="†" place="margin">

               <hi>Peter,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Christ preached to the Spirits in prison, which were sometimes disobedient,</hi> should mean this preaching of his own and after Ages, who is so careful first to tell us of what persons he meant it of, and then is so express and punctual about the right timing of it? for the <hi>Spirits</hi> that were preached to, were disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient: but when? why, <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:38363:16"/>
as neither can the Notion of <hi>my Spirit</hi> for the <hi>Spirit, that I have breathed in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the ordinary and common accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>word</hi> for <hi>striving</hi> or <hi>contending</hi> is very applicable to the scope and design of the <hi>Text, And the Lord said, my Spirit shall not alwaies strive with man,</hi> I will no longer endure the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness and obstinacy of this evill and sinfull Generation, I will no longer bear with their Provocations, (and sure as long as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears, He may well be said to strive with man) but now am resolved to punish; for <hi>that he also is Flesh</hi>; that is, <hi>hath corrupted his waies,</hi> and has polluted himself by abominable acts of unclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years,</hi> so long time I will forbear, <hi>saith God,</hi> and no longer.

            <p n="1">I. A judgment denounced in the Threat, that <hi>his Spirit should not alwayes strive with man</hi>; Gods patience was provoked, and he expresses his resentments, and threatens Revenge.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The equity of the judgment in the reason of the Denuntiation, <hi>For that he also is Flesh,</hi> because of their fleshly lusts and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:38363:16"/>III. A mercifull forbearance of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned in the time alloted for their repentance, <hi>Yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years</hi>; not as if the life of man was to be shortned, and brought within the compass of this term of years; but that beyond this time God would not defer his vengeance, as it is excellently <hi>Paraphrased</hi> by the forementioned <hi>Onkelos,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>The space of one hundred and twenty years shall be given to them,</hi> to this end, <hi>that they may return and repent.</hi> God would not cut them off in their sins, but gave them space and time to repent, if they would make a right use of it.</p>
            <p>All which being so agreeable in themselves, and following so naturally one from the other, and suitable to the scope and design of the <hi>Text,</hi> and to the common and ordinary signification of the words, do sufficiently confirm and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie this interpretation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I come now in the Third place to fix upon the right meaning of the words, which you may take in this short and plain <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase</hi>; that <hi>Christ</hi> by his eternal Power and <hi>Godhead</hi> preached to the Generation of men
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38363:17"/>
immediately before the <hi>Floud,</hi> whose Souls are now shut up in <hi>Hell,</hi> upon the accompt of their disobedience and infidelity.</p>
            <p>All which may be clearly and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively made out from the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Christ</hi> is here meant, is evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all possibility of contradiction, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Him the discourse proceeds: He that once suffered for sins, the just one, that He might bring us to God, He that was put to death in the Flesh, but quickened by the Spirit, the same <hi>preached to the Spirits in Prison.</hi> Which plainly supposes, and proves too, his <hi>Godhead,</hi> in that He praeexisted long before his Incarnation. For <hi>operari sequitur esse,</hi> How could <hi>He</hi> be said to <hi>Preach,</hi> unless <hi>He were? Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am,</hi> said <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
               <hi>John,</hi> VIII. 58. Here in the <hi>Text,</hi> before <hi>Noah</hi> was, He is; yea, before the Foundations of the World were laid. S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
               <hi>John,</hi> I. 1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi>— in the beginning of the <hi>Creation,</hi> (for it is a plain allusion to <hi>Gen.</hi> I. 1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth</hi>) when as yet there was nothing made; (for <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> and so <hi>Hebr.</hi> I. 2. <hi>By

whom also he made the Worlds</hi>) the <hi>Word,</hi> the Son of <hi>God,</hi> the Second <hi>Person</hi> in the Sacred <hi>Trinity</hi> had his being and existence, and consequently is <hi>God Eternal. Rom.</hi> IX. 5. (speaking of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their <hi>Privileges,</hi> by reason of the Covenant God made with the <hi>Patriarchs) Whose are the Fathers, and of whom, as concerning the Flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</hi> A Text able to confound all the <hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>blasphemyes</hi> of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his <hi>Party,</hi> who deny the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and put them to an eternal silence, who very presumptuously reject the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> because they cannot fully comprehend them, as if the shallow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a man were to be the measure and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of <hi>divine Truth:</hi> when they can give no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory <hi>Accompts</hi> of the ordinary <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, much less of its secret operations, and least of all, of the Mysteries of <hi>Providence.</hi> And if this were a sufficient reason to deny the <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith, because They are above our capacity, They may as well deny the being of a God, because they cannot have <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive</hi> Notions of <hi>Infinity, Eternity, Omnipresence,</hi> and the like. But certainly we have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38363:18"/>
reason in the World to believe the Articles of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which are so plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi>; because whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God has been pleased to reveal is infallibly certain, and therefore, when proposed to me, I am bound to believe it, though I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>modus,</hi> how it is so. This for the <hi>Person, He went and preached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>means,</hi> by which <hi>Christ</hi> is said to Preach, by <hi>which Spirit,</hi> that is, by His <hi>eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> as was shewn in the beginning, and now shall be further proved. For by the same Spirit, by which <hi>Christ</hi> rose from the Dead, <hi>He preached to the Spirits in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> But <hi>Christ</hi> rose from the dead by virtue of his <hi>Godhead</hi> and <hi>divine Power. Rom.</hi> I. 4. <hi>Declared to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holiness by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi> Heb. IX. 14. <hi>How much more shall the bloud of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your Conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</hi> that is, How much more available, then the bloud of Bulls, and Goats, and Calves, and all the Sacrifices offered up under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> oeconomy, for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38363:18"/>
the cleansing from sin, and delivering from its Guilt and condemning Power, and in order to the serving of God acceptably, is the Bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> shed upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> who, after he had raised his Body out of the Grave by his <hi>divine Power,</hi> presented himself a <hi>perfect Mediator</hi> to God in our behalf?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Hell</hi> is meant by this <hi>Prison</hi> is very easy to conceive, having before proved it could not be meant of the <hi>Body,</hi> much less can it of the <hi>Grave,</hi> for the Soul at its departure takes a flight beyond the Grave and Regions of Death, and cannot be pent up in those Charnel houses under ground; nor does it <hi>sleep,</hi> as some have fondly dreamed, that is, remain in a state of dulness and inactivity, without any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or knowledge till the Resurrection, as we shall see anon, but goes to the place and state allotted for it according to its deserving. And the resemblance and comparison between <hi>Hell</hi> and a <hi>Prison</hi> is very fit and proper: When men are legally <hi>Imprisoned,</hi> it is either for their <hi>Crimes</hi> or for their <hi>Debts</hi>; Now evey un-repenting Sinner, that dyes in his Sins, hath broken the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> hath made assaults upon his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:38363:19"/>
and rebelled against Heaven, and by this means has contracted a guilt upon his Soul, which binds over to punishment, is a debtor to <hi>God,</hi> and has forfeited his Soul to <hi>Justice,</hi> and because He took no care to <hi>agree</hi> with God, who was become his <hi>Adversary,</hi> and impleaded him, <hi>While He was in the Way with him,</hi> did not in his <hi>life time</hi> compound for the Debt, and get the Bond Cancell'd, is justly cast into <hi>Hell</hi>: A Prison because</p>

            <p>It only remains to be satisfyed, How <hi>Christ</hi> can be said to preach to those that lived in the Old World? I Answer, That it must not be understood, as if <hi>Christ</hi> did actually preach and appear to the men of that <hi>Generation</hi>; (though some of the <hi>Antients</hi> have thought, that <hi>Christ</hi> did often appear to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in humane shape, as a <hi>Praeludium</hi> to his <hi>Incarnation</hi>; which Opinion I shall not now stay to examine) but that he did it by the <hi>Ministery</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> who is called 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> II. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>a Preacher of Righteousness</hi>; that is, <hi>He</hi> denounced the Judgements of God against them for their sins, fore-warned them of the danger and ruine They were bringing down upon their own Souls, and continually sounded in their ears an alarm of judgment, that would infallibly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, except they repented, and did by their unfeigned humiliations and amendment of life stop and prevent the Anger of God, which otherwise would break out upon them, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38363:21"/>
overwhelm them in an Universal Deluge. So that by the same divine Power, by which <hi>He</hi> preached in the <hi>Apostles</hi> after the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> who preached in his name, by virtue of that <hi>Commission</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> They received from Him (and upon this very accompt, He is said to <hi>come,</hi> (a <hi>Phrase</hi> like this in my Text) <hi>and preach peace</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Ch.

               <hi>Every mans Delegate or Messenger is as himself.</hi> As here upon Earth, the respect or affront that is done to an Ambassadour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively is done to the Person whom He represents; and the <hi>King</hi> is said in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary discourse to do that, that his <hi>Commissioned Minister</hi> does in his Name. Let none therefore be so vain as to say in their hearts, Had we lived in the times of <hi>Messiah,</hi> when he was upon Earth, Had we heard those powerfull Oracles of <hi>Truth</hi> drop from his sacred lips, Had we heard him Preaching to us the Great mysteries of <hi>God,</hi> how affected should we have been! What deep impressions would his Preaching have made upon our Souls! For <hi>Christ</hi> still Preaches from Heaven to you by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. He hath appointed several Orders, and hath setled a Sacred Ministery in his Church, and hath provided also for a constant succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Worlds end. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 20. <hi>We are Ambassadours for Christ, as though God,</hi> (Christ, the Son of God) <hi>did beseech you by us, we pray
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38363:22"/>
you in Christs stead, by ye reconciled to God.</hi> Every Sermon you hear is the voice of <hi>Christ</hi> speaking to you in his <hi>Minister</hi>: And let me add, As <hi>They that heard not Moses and the Prophets,</hi> would not have been perswaded, though one had arose from the Dead; so it may be feared, that those that are deaf to so many admonitions, to such continued and earnest entreaties, that they would repent, and lead better lives, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to continue in their sins, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frequent and often repeated importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods Ministers in his Name to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, would even reject the Preaching of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, if He were upon Earth. He hath left his <hi>Gospel</hi> among us, which is <hi>vox Scripta,</hi> his Word put into Writing, and to that he does require our faith, and our obedience, as much as if He was actually present. <hi>He</hi> Preached to the <hi>Old World</hi> by the <hi>Ministery</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> and still Preaches to us by the <hi>Ministery</hi> of his <hi>Word:</hi> Their disobedience to Him, for which They were thrust into that infernal <hi>Prison,</hi> consisted in this, That They contemptuously refused his mercy, which was offered to them, and disbelieved the Word which <hi>Noah</hi> Preached:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38363:22"/>
               <hi>and how shall we escape, if,</hi> amidst all those fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent invitations that are made us, <hi>we neglect so great Salvation</hi>?</p>
            <p>Thus I have removed the difficulties, and cleared the words with as much brevity as I could.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Propositions,</hi> which are deducible hence, are these Four, which I shall but briefly touch.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>God</hi> is graciously pleased to use all means to bring men to repentance, before He cuts them off by his Judgments. <hi>He went and preached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That the Souls of the disobedient are now shut up in <hi>Hell, He went and preached to the Spirits,</hi> that now are <hi>in Prison, which sometimes were disobedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That God, notwithstanding the daily and great <hi>Provocations</hi> of sinfull men, doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give them time and space to repent: <hi>The long suffering of God once waited in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That in the midst of the severest and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riblest Judgments, that befall the World, there is a mixture of mercy; or, That his Judgments are never so general, but he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38363:23"/>
spares some. In this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niversal Deluge,</hi> as it is justly called, <hi>few, that is, Eight Souls were saved by Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That God is graciously pleased to use all means to bring men to repentance, before he cuts them off by his Judgments: <hi>He went and Preached. God</hi> hath set up a light in every mans Soul to direct him in all his waies. <hi>Reason</hi> is given to him for a guide, and <hi>Natural Conscience</hi> tells him his duty, and how he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in all capacities whatsoever: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any institution or teaching, every one sees, by an innate internal light, the Essential and Fundamental differences of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evill,</hi> and none can pretend ignorance. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Micha,</hi> VI. 8.</note> 
               <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good,</hi> even by those deep impressions, he hath made upon thee, which can never be totally effaced; <hi>and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> And what is or can be more agreeable to nature, then for a man to do, as he would be done to, to be sociable, and kind, and loving to men of the same nature with himself, and to crouch and humble himself before his Maker, and adore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38363:23"/>
his Goodness, and his other divine Perfections? Yet so foolish, so vain, so inconsiderate a thing is <hi>Man,</hi> that he is wilfully forgetfull of his duty, that he throws off those restraints, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath laid upon him, breaks through all obligations of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> refuseth the conduct of his <hi>Reason,</hi> and gives himself over to the hurry of his <hi>Passions</hi> and foolish <hi>Lusts,</hi> and thus puts out his eyes to be lead by a blind guide, till he loseth himself in a maze of errour and vanity. But when we are thus lost to our selves, <hi>God</hi> will not leave us so: <hi>He</hi> is pleased to find us out, His <hi>Goodness</hi> still pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues us. He is unwilling to punish, till all his Methods are frustrated and disappointed and rendered ineffectual. Thus when the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Old World</hi> had forsaken <hi>God</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too, had <hi>corrupted their wayes,</hi> the whole course of their life, and <hi>given up themselves to work wickedness, and that with greediness</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, He inspires <hi>Noah</hi> and sends him among them to re-mind them of their duty, to shew them how much they had degenerated from their Nature, to rouse them out of their carnal security, by thundering Judgment in their ears,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38363:24"/>
and to bring them home, if possible, to himself. And after the same manner <hi>God</hi> proceeds with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s. He</hi> condescends to entreat and beseech us to accept of his mercy: He woes us by his loving kindness: He frights us by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>He doth not afflict willingly,</hi> nor <hi>grieve the Children of men</hi>; if he useth sharp Medicines, it is in order to our recovery, because gentle ones could not work the cure. 'Tis true, God will not <hi>force</hi> us to be happy against our wills, He will use no <hi>violence</hi> to our <hi>Faculties,</hi> He treats us as <hi>Rational</hi> Creatures. He invites, He threatens; He uses all Arguments to perswade and work upon us to repent, and accept of his mercy. So far is <hi>God</hi> from <hi>decreeing</hi> the eternal ruine of myriads of his Creatures, meerly to shew his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as some maintain to the great prejudice of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> that most love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attribute of a <hi>God,</hi> that He protests solemnly with an Oath (and sure <hi>God</hi> is to be believed upon his bare saying so, much more upon <hi>his</hi> so vehement asseveration) and He commands the <hi>Prophet</hi> to tell them so in his Name, <hi>Ezech.</hi> XXXIII. 11. <hi>As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the Wicked</hi>: To these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38363:24"/>
obedient and ungodly ones in the <hi>Text, Noah</hi> is sent, in hope that he might reclaim them. God puts the Question to us, and that most seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in the same verse, <hi>Why will you dye?</hi> Why will you so foolishly make your selves away? Why will you ruine your sleves for ever? When we are at the brink of the Pit, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering over the mouth of Hell, He calls to us to draw back our adventurous Feet, lest we tumble down the <hi>Precipice. Turn ye, turn ye, Why will ye dye?</hi> And as we value our own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal concern in another World, let us obey this Heavenly call, let us fly to his mercy, which he so freely offers to us now in the time of life, for hearafter it will be too late: The Justice of God will exact punishment on those hereafter, which refused his mercy here, and dyed in disobedience. Which brings me to</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second <hi>Proposition</hi>; That the Souls of the disobedient are now shut up in Hell. <hi>The Spirits that</hi> are now <hi>in Prison, which sometime were disobedient.</hi> I am not obliged by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Proposition</hi> to vindicate the <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the punishment of a Sinner with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torment; but only am hence briefly to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38363:25"/>
shew the groundlesness of their <hi>fancy,</hi> that so easily perswade themselves to the great damping and cooling the heats and ardors of devotion, and to the making men suspicious and mistrustfull of its ever being awakened out of such a long and stupid <hi>Lethargy,</hi> that the Soul <hi>sleeps</hi> during the interval between death and the Resurrection, that it enters the same Grave with the Body, without any reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive knowledge or expectation of the last Day, that, in a manner, it is dead for a time, and as sensless as the Body that is dissolved into its first Principles; as if when freed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangled from Flesh, it was confined to, and shut up in the Grave, there to sleep out some Thousands of years, if the Goodness of God shall reprieve the World for so long a space, void of all perception, and without exerting any vital operation: A conceipt as wild as the <hi>Poets,</hi> concerning the stupifying Waters of <hi>Lethe,</hi> which they fancied to drown and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the sense and memory of things done here upon Earth.</p>
            <p>But not now to allege the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> XII. 7. <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 43. <hi>Act.</hi> I. 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> V. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> I. 23. and many others.</note> several Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> that assert the contrary, and that it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38363:25"/>
was the cheif design of our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Parable of the <hi>Rich man</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to assure us of the survival of the Soul after its Emigration, either in a state of bliss or woe, nor to lay before you the <hi>Physical</hi> Arguments, that might be fetched from the Nature of the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul, and the independency of its Operations, I shall only urge at present this Moral Consideration.</p>
            <p>The Soul, we know, in some of its nobler flights soars far above the Earth, and seems oftentimes, not only in its raptures and exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, but ordinary contemplations, to have no intercourse with the Body; and when raised and advanced by Grace and Holiness, grows weary of its confinement, and with furious and impatient desires and longings gasps and pants after a more close and immediate enjoyment of the Divine Presence, breathing out, <hi>When shall I come and appear before God!</hi> While the disobedient and the ungodly, that have made their Souls drudges and slaves to the brutal Part, to procure for their Lusts, and forced them to comply with their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and their humours, and have abused all
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38363:26"/>
their faculties contrary to the end and design of the Creatour, when they come to dye, then begin to have too quick a sense, that there is something within them, that will prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, that will pass beyond the Grave, and in all its flittings and wandrings will never be able to shake off the horror of that guilt, which it contracted here upon Earth. These general sentiments, these hopes and fears, that attend the innocent and guilty at such times, when they have the least reason to flatter or abuse themselves, and when They are the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest to make the most impartial judgments, seem to me (if there were no express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or other Argument to induce or compel my belief) conviction enough, that the Soul immediately knows its eternal Doom upon its first entry on a new Stage: and that it is very absurd and irrational to doubt of or deny the possibility of a <hi>Souls existing separately,</hi> because we cannot fully comprehend the manner of it, or solve all the difficulties, that some mens <hi>Curiosity</hi> and <hi>Scepticism</hi> have raised with convincing <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> and evidence no less than <hi>Mathematical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:38363:26"/>3. That God notwithsanding mens daily and great Provocations oftentimes vouchsafes to them time and space to repent: <hi>The long suffering of God once waited in the days of</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing.</hi> How much and how greatly God was provoked by their sins, before He threatened them with his Judgments, you may read in the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis.</hi> Wickedness had overspread the Face of the whole <hi>Earth</hi>: There was a General <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi> amongst men: They had forgot <hi>God</hi> that made them: They had thrown off all fear of his <hi>Name:</hi> They gave up themselves to their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and <hi>their own hearts desire:</hi> Their <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>imaginations</hi> were set upon evill and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: They were guilty of <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>beastly</hi> lusts, and of all manner of <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>violence:</hi> So great was their <hi>Wickedness,</hi> that it troubled and <hi>grieved God</hi> at the <hi>very heart, that he had made man.</hi> Well, God sends <hi>Noab</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: But do they hearken to the voice of the <hi>Prophet?</hi> Hath his Preaching any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon their lives?

In this Universal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge few, that is, <hi>Eight Souls were saved by Water.</hi> Where I might observe.</p>

respect of those vast multitudes that perisht, <hi>wherein few,</hi> that is, <hi>Eight Souls were saved by Water.</hi> The History of which Judgment was recorded and taken notice of by <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, being derived down to them by a general and uninterrupted tradition, though not so clear in all particularities, by reason of some mixtures and additions of their own, and the beliefe of it was retained among them, notwithstanding their ignorance in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and their superinduced Barbarism. But on this I must not now enlarge, only in general as to the Proposition, I shall explain it by the History of the Text, and confirm it by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instance.</p>
            <p>God had often forewarned these Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Old World of his Judgments, but they continued careless and unmindfull: S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi>

unbelieving and secure as ever, till the <hi>very day,</hi> whereon the Flood-gates and Sluces of Heaven were opened, and Rivers of Water were poured out of the Skie, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great Abyss were broken up, and then they were forced to mix Tears with their Wine; their rich and costly Dainties, wherewith they had corrupted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged Nature, turned into Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; their Excesses and their Wantonness and their caresses into loathing and horrour and confusion; they exchanged their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Songs and Triumphs into shrieks and howlings; doubly overwhelmed, with the Waves, and with grief as swelling and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous.

We all profess to believe, that Christ will come to judge both the quick and the dead, and we have had frequent Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Alarms of his Coming. How doth it concern us to prepare for that Day, wherein we and all the Generations of men, that ever were or ever shall be, must stand before his

Throne, and not delay our repentance one moment, lest Death surprise us on a suddain, and as Death leaves us, Judgment will find us; but secure an Interest in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and make him our Advocate, who is to be our Judge: And then happy shall we be at that day amidst the noyse of the perishing World; and as <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family were saved in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Deluge, as the Text says, <gap reason="foreign">
