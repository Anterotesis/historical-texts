            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Shall begin firſt with Mr. <hi>Lillies,</hi> grounded on that (as he ſaid) of Mother <hi>Shiptons,</hi> but was not hers but <hi>Ambroſe Merlins</hi> concerning <hi>London,</hi> Publiſhed in his <hi>Englands Prophetical Merlin, Anno</hi> 1642 <hi>page</hi> 91. the words are as followeth.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>What Lincoln was, and London is, That York ſhall be;</l>
               <l>The fairest City of the three.</l>
               <l>Brave <hi>London</hi> prays that day ſhe nere may ſee.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>On which he ſaith, <q>That <hi>London</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (by reaſon of the unlucky Poſition of Mars in her Sign, and being Cadent from Aries and <hi>Mercury</hi> his Diſpoſiter in Combuſt and in Detriment) ſhall indure many a hard ſhock, two plagues, (but from <hi>Mercuries</hi> being Combuſt, and in detriment he might, and its a wonder to mee why he did not ſay, that one of thoſe two Plagues might have been a fiery one, as indeed it proved to be) extream dammage in her Wealth, the loſs of many Valiant Citizens, but it ſhall be with Honour and to her perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown.—Nor ſhall any man yet alive ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the days Mother <hi>Shipton</hi> ſpake of concerning <hi>London</hi>; yet in time all Cities muſt have an end: But I rather think that about the year 1683. the City ſhall be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and then come to a final Cataſtrophe during the Revolution of that fifth Conjunction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So far Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> in that page, but its danger ſhall be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly declared anon.</p>
            <p>But by that fifth Conjunction is to be underſtood that of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the Fiery Triplicity, and in <hi>Leo,</hi> on the 20 day of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1682. which will be their fifth from that ſeventh great Conjunction of theirs <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. when they left the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and entred into the Fiery Trigon, on the 7 of <hi>December</hi> in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100707:3"/>
ſaid year, which kind of Conjunctions ſeldom or never hapned, (if Credit may be given to Hiſtory, Antiquity or Experience,) (as Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> ſaith,) but they were followed with great and ſtrange Changes in the World, both in Civil and Eccleſiaſtical States, and are as ſeldom accompanied with any propitious Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to <hi>England</hi> in general, or <hi>London</hi> in particular.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For at their firſt entrance into <hi>Aries,</hi> called by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> the fiery Trigon, which was their firſt Conjunction after the Creation, and was called their great Conjunction, and was before <hi>Enochs</hi> Tranſlation.</item>
               <item>2. Their Second before <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, and was followed with the ſad Univerſal Deluge, <hi>Nimrods</hi> uſurped Monarchy, and the building of <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Their third, before <hi>Moſes</hi> bringing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and the giving of the Law.</item>
               <item>4. Their fourth was alſo followed with erecting of the Empire of the <hi>Medes.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. Their Fifth with that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Incarnation of Chriſt, and Publiſhing the Goſpel to the Jews.</item>
               <item>6. Their Sixth with the Tranſlation of the ſaid Empire to the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. And their Seventh great, yea and greateſt, being their Sabbatical Conjunction, was <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. which was followed, firſt, with the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a Mother to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, at which time was a great Plague in <hi>London.</hi> And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The raiſing the Monarchy of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Family of the <hi>Stewarts</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and could a more memorable change happen in this part of the World, then for a <hi>Scotch</hi> King to become King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> without blows, conſidering the Antipathy between both Nations? And was not this a raiſing of a new Monarchy, and a great one too, of which <hi>James</hi> the ſixth of <hi>Scotland</hi> was the firſt King, and our King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond was and is the firſt King of the ſaid Race, born in it, and to it, and conſequently a proper Native of it, God grant he may live long to enjoy it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And here we are to take Notice, That theſe ſaid ſeven Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the two ſuperior Planets are all the great Conjunctions that have been ſince the Creation; or that will be in ſome Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of years, if ever any more be at all, of which Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100707:3"/>
with many more, the Sabbatical one being now already paſt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they come to paſs above once in eight hundred years.-And further, that there have been but fifteen more in all of thoſe two Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, ſince the Creation, as appears by <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Table of all the Conjunctions that have been of all the Plannets ſince, as aforeſaid, of which ſaid Table the Author hath a Copy now extant of Mr. <hi>Lillies</hi> Tranſcribing.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Which ſaid 15 Conjunctions paſt; with the next to come this next <hi>October,</hi> are called leſſer, or minor Conjunctions.</item>
               <item>2. But the next Conjunction that followed that of 1603. was that which came to paſs in ſeven degrees of <hi>Leo,</hi> in the ſame Trigon, <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. and was followed firſt with King <hi>James</hi> his death, and then with that Plague of which was ſaid to dye above 50 thouſand People in <hi>London Anno</hi> 1625.</item>
               <item>3. Their third Conjunction fell out to be <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. in which ſaid year began our inteſtine War between King and Parliament, which laſted more or leſs with ſome Intermiſſions until 1652. in which year or the next we had a dull Saturnine Comet, on Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation whereof, Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> writ a ſecond Prediction, for matter and form as followeth.</item>
            </list>
            <lg>
               <l>In the Year of Eighty Three,</l>
               <l>Great Changes there will be.</l>
               <l>In <hi>England,</hi>—But</l>
               <l>Long ere that time poor Merlin ſleeps,</l>
               <l>In his Grave ſecure; ſad <hi>England</hi> weeps.</l>
               <l>Leaves he no Heir, unhappy man,</l>
               <l>That this obſcure Riddle—can</l>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfold?—No.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But more remarkable was that which followed their fourth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in <hi>Sagitarius,</hi> and fiery Trigon, <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. when all the Planets met in that houſe as at a general Rendezvouz to conſult the effecting the heavenly decrees, and was followed, firſt, with three great Comets, in leſs then Seven Months ſpace, and then ſecondly with the greateſt Peſtilential Plague that ever <hi>London</hi> knew, to the Deſtruction of near an hundred thouſand People, thereby leaving many houſes deſolate of the Inhabitants, Anno 1665. and then with that dreadful fire which Conſumed moſt of the City and as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100707:4"/>
much of the Suburbs, as it left of the City, thereby leaving more Inhabitants deſtitute of houſes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. by all which we may obſerve, that the Effects of theſe laſt Conjunctions were ſpeedy and ſevere, though not of any long Continuance.</p>
            <p>But what manner of Effects have already or may yet precede this now ſo near approaching on, a very few years may probably determin; and for as much as the former were, as aforeſaid, what may we expect otherwiſe then that this coming of the ſame or the like cauſe, ſhould produce the like Effects, unleſs God of his great Mercys be pleaſed to prevent the ſame.</p>
            <p>3. Mr. <hi>Lillies</hi> third Prediction, ſaying, <hi>page</hi> 25. of the ſame Book, <hi>I judge that privately by Lies, Treacheries, fained and diſſembled Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Embaſſadors, and by the Policies of a Jeſuitical Faction, all over Europe, the true Proteſtant Religion will be infinitely diſtreſſed, and the heavenly intentions Impedited; and all thoſe Countreys profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Proteſtantiſme exceedingly moleſted by ſo great a Compact of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and falſe hearted Traytors lurking in the Cloſſets and Boſoms of Princes, that many ſhall think that Popery ſhall return to its old Seat in every Countrey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Having thus given the Nation in general, and the City in particular, a Proſpect of ſome of the dangers predicted againſt them, and in poſſibility may be brought upon them, and by whom, and about what time (<hi>viz.</hi>) Soon after the Celebration of that Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſpoken of by Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> and is already preceded as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by a reſtraint put upon Liberty of Conſcience in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things, contrary to ſome Engagements paſt to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and procured at the Requeſt and Solicitation of ſuch men as peradventure are of no Religion themſelves, or at the beſt, ſuch a Religion, whoſe Principle is to conclude (Papiſt-like) with <hi>Nulla Fides,</hi> otherwiſe it had never been deſired, but we may thank the firſt Parliament for that. A ſecond precedent is a Mercurial War managed with Tongue and Pen, apt Weapons for ſuch a Warfare.</p>
            <p>Which is in all the Nation proclaimed by thoſe diſtinguiſhing Nicknames of <hi>Whiggs</hi> and <hi>Tories</hi> obſcenely and provokingly put upon the Adherents to the two adverſe Parties in the quarrel; <hi>id est,</hi> the Proteſtants and Papiſts, juſt as it was before the War began between the late King and Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. when called Cavaliers and Round-Heads.</p>
            <p>A Third is, ſome apparent dangers which the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100707:5"/>
does now labour under, which may be part of the danger Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> ſaid the City ſhould be in about 1683.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of their Charter, called for by the King with a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> and as ſome think is in danger of being loſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is their Priviledges aſſaulted by their preſent Lord Mayor, who (as his Lordſhip thinks) has drank the Commons out of their Priviledge of Electing two Sheriffs. The third is their Religion in common with the reſt of the Nation, and hath been and ſtill is deſignedly aſſaulted by its common Enemies the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>But the fourth, laſt, and greateſt, and worſt danger, preceding the foreſaid Conjunction, is the Miſerable Diviſions the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general is fallen into, and labours under, making themſelves two diſtinct parties, in abſolute Oppoſition againſt each other, of which kind of danger it may be feared, that there is but little hope to eſcape from, unleſs the Lord ſend help ſome other way then is yet thought of. Therefore let's yet conſider Chriſts Words, A City divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand. The preſent Condition, we now ſtand Labouring under, may probably be the matter, Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> ſaid that the Heavens and Stars were preparing for Eighty three.</p>
            <p>This is it that the Popiſh Prieſts, Jeſuits, and other Papiſts longed for ever ſince they miſcarryed in their Deſign <hi>Anno</hi> 1678. and is the Product of what the Addreſſors from the North to Weſt deſired at the firſt, and what ſome Gentlemen near home Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo often for ſince, and which ſome of the Miniſtry, Magiſtracy, and People of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do ſo violently proſecute againſt the Diſſenters abroad, and which the Papiſts, Atheiſts and Debauchees of the Nation, do now rejoice in, and hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Proteſtant Religion, Laws, and Government by, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, together with Popery with its ill Circumſtances, or for avoiding thereof, a War, with its doubtful events, we ſhould pray to God to deliver us from. Which War I mention the rather, becauſe Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> in his Almanacks for 77 and 81. ſaith, <hi>That the breach of Juſt Priviledges, Antient Cuſtomes, and Long-Enjoyed-Rights, will Animate the generality in ſome Nation to a ſtrong and Sturdy Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For preventing of all which, that God may bleſs King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, with Life to the height of old Age, ſhall be the dayly Prayers of this Author.</p>
