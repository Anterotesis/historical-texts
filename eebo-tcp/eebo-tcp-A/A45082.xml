            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O have undertaken a work of this nature, was once as little in my thoughts as (the occasion of it), the sad distraction of my Nation. But as they say of him that was born dumb, that he burst into speech against those he saw ready to murther his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; even so, the past and feared desolations of my native Country, come with such pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing horror upon my soul, that neither my general dumbness and insufficiency in all things else, nor the particular difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this, can keep my natural affection in longer silence: that is, from endeavouring to warn posterity to avoid the like inconvenience for the future; by discovery of both rise and cure of that which is introductive thereof; namely, disrespect and contempt of the present Soveraign power.</p>
            <p>For they shall finde it plain, that from the time that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects shall be taught and permitted rudely to press within those secret vails of Authority, which their wiser Progenitors had set up for its support and defense, that, their ignorance not letting them see throughly the cause of these different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects given to Superiors more then others, they shall (like <hi>Cham</hi>) no sooner see, then despise their fathers nakedness.</p>
            <p>And as with them it fareth, that, through remoteness and want of reading, know of their King no otherwise then by report, (as of someting of Power, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above that
<pb facs="tcp:55976:3"/>
which is incident to ordinary men) to apprehend him to be some other thing then man also, even so, when ambitious men, finding Authority oppose them, have for the peoples engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laid open to publike view, <q>That he is but as other men are, and it may be worse too, that this power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he hath above the people, he had it but from them and for them; </q>They then begin to be so much ashamed of their old ignorance, and so much taken with this new insinuating lesson, that their industry and practise thereupon is not to be wondred at.</p>
            <p>And as themselves are now pleased with these Schollies, as matters of high discovery, so each one is ready to stretch his fancy therein, and in a kinde of pride we all take to seem more wise then ordinary, these discourses are told and enlarged to his yet loyal neighbour, with no little glory of his new illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. He looks on himself in his past ignorance, and on others not yet apprehensive of so much light, but as little Children, admiring those Babies which themselves had drest up. For he comes now to think all those Prerogatives, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Ceremonies given to Majesty, nay Majesty it self, to be but a sort of Pageantry and shew to please the ignorant sort with. And as <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> were sometimes made terrible, that, as in their names and right, others might be the more superstitiously cozened by those that attended them, so to no other end, (as they suppose) was all this obedience and expence by some Polititians and Courtiers called for, as of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this one, but that themselves, under colour of his name and Authority, might make their private uses thereof.</p>
            <p>Whenas, by these and the like practises, the sinews and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Government and Authority shall be let loose and dissolved: and men once precipitated in a course of stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and insubjection, all those usual Arguments and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses made of that respect which is to Monarchy it self due, and how it was not an office and power of yesterdays devising, but had the confirmation of Antiquity and Law, or the like, will all of them, prove ineffectual to give a stop to these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Even because most of the writers of this kinde, to win readier belief, did still argue under the same supposition of derivation of power from the people, and so to Princes by Paction; by force vvhereof they thought they might defend
<pb facs="tcp:55976:3"/>
him and his Authority, as in Justice, against any violent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious attempt: whence it proved, that want of building on the true and sure ground made their labour unsuccessful: and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of conviction, did (for the most part) but prompt with farther Arguments (upon the same foundation) to encrease &amp; perfect that structure they had already begun. And although they again did strengthen their Arguments from the particular Laws and usages of the kingdom it self, yet not diving deeper into the ground thereof, and shewing that what is there done is but upon the general reason of Government and good of Obedience, common to it with all places else, the success was little.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For the people being once confident, that power came al from them, it must be supposed by them intrusted for their good, and that when they saw it otherwise they might reassume it: for else, say they, it was a dry Right without a remedy. What if their Progenitors, for their folly or cowardise herein, had been punished with deserved slavery? they would make use of the blessed opportunity to recover their native freedom, with the same resolution &amp; courage that others had oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it before. And as for Law, the interpretation thereof was not in the King, but them: as was the Legislative power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. That the sin of Rebellion was falsly imputed to them, they were the supreme power, and above Kings: the whole people cannot rebel against the Prince, more then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er against the less.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this case, since Antiquity cannot be taken upon her bare word, but that the reason why it was so formerly done, must be also given unto men now, there is no remedy but to let them see how that which hath been herein formerly appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was for, and will prove (if observed) the onely general good: by which means people seeing their obedience to be their benefit, as well as their duty, cannot I conceive but more readily follow it.</p>
            <p>So that now, being forced to dig even to the very root of Government, which could have no subsistance but by Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor that again without a Deity; this drew us on, in the first place, to make some proof and discourse thereof: and of that work of Creation, to which Providence necessarily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, as Gods way of Government in all things besides, was
<pb facs="tcp:55976:4"/>
needful in some things to be here also treated of: not onely as having man himself so considerable a part of it, but as partly imitable in the Government of Kingdoms also. For as the Laws and Rules of Nature are but for the establishment and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Creatures in general, so those for Peace and Unity in Kingdoms, are for men in particular; those are to make and keep all Creatures in their species serviceable one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, these to do the like between man and man.</p>
            <p>Then being to consider men as linked in society, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient I should first search out what mans natural end and aim apart was, before I discoursed of the other; These I have treated of under two sorts of Pleasure, one of Sence, in degree common to him with other sensitives, the other of Honor, his intellectual pleasure; and in a manner proper to him above them all. Then, although I concluded politick happiness or aim under two kindes, that of Peace, and that of Plenty; yet of the first of these, and how it may be best attained, my present undertaking is onely intended. For as life exceeds, nay is (indeed) the subject of all other temporal enjoyments, so peace in holy Scripture is usually taken as inclusive of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessings. To this end, I first shew how most of Gods Precepts, and particularly those of the Decalogue, aim at Peace, by their express directions, and by strict and often Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to obedience. Afterwards I shew the politick way of effecting it; namely Unity, and by mens submitting their differing desires amongst themselves, unto the definitive sentence of one. This is first shewed in the less Government of a Family to one Master, and next in a Kingdom to one So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; all which are the Arguments of the first book.</p>
            <p>After these just forms of Government, I shall speak of its contrary, Anarchy, or breach of Unity; and that as well in its birth and strugling condition, called Faction and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in its setled condition (of counterseit Unity) in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocraties and Democraties. And because encouragements to Sedition and Rebellion have been taken from the deceivable notions of <hi>Liberty, Tyranny, Slavery, Property, Law and Justice, Publike good, Trust and Paction, Councellors and Magistrates, &amp;c.</hi> my next attempt is to declare and examine them, and those Arguments drawn from them, according to their several Chapters and Titles; being not otherwise definitve, then to
<pb facs="tcp:55976:4"/>
that purpose. Then I speak of the right of Dominion, as it stands founded on natural example and practise; to satisfie some scruples, and to prevent such objections as might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> arise thereabout: and these I make the subject of the second book.</p>
            <p>The third Book is wholly spent in stating the case of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Obedience according to Precepts and directions drawn from Religion. Under which Title, as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make Obedience appear Duty by Conscience as well as Reason, so I would not have it expected I should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any methodical delivery of the body of Divinity, or make any farther in road thereinto, then what may serve to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold &amp; direct the building it self. Even to shew how that which is originally, and was by God mostly intended and given as a tye to humane preservation and peace, through interest and ignorance, may be, and is, in these latter days, too often made destructive thereof; by such as, under one pretence or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are <hi>despising of Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignity</hi> and Government, the most necessary means for procuring it: and are everywhere so ready <hi>to kill men,</hi> in a mistaken zeal of doing God good service.</p>
            <p>And although that Treatise be distinguished into Chapters, as intending to have had my Arguments and discourses (for the Readers and mine own better help and case) enclosed and directed by some method, yet being therein to make use of many Texts of Scripture which, besides the purpose they were exprsly brought in for, did contain also farther evidence in the proof of many assertions delivered in several discourses fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, It cannot therefore be expected that I should be always true and proper to those titles. Yet, if I shall be found in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Tautologies and Repetitions, I shall acknowledge them to be things as probably to be expected from my weakness, as I hope they are pardonable through my strength of zeal to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle publike good by agreement: on whose behalf, I have ever conceived it better to erre in saying too much, then too little.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I am not ignorant of the prevalence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition it self, especially in a popular Address; where preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and contrary belief hath grown more from itreration and pressur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Doctrine, then weight of Reason. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I have purposely interwoven my Discourses with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
<pb facs="tcp:55976:5"/>
to encourage men to read, notwithstanding such general prepossession, so have I caused the same assertions many times to enter the Stage anew, in a dress suitable to the present scaene. For many truths may be insinuated by degrees, which preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or ignorance would not suffer to enter all at once. By which means I may also (happily) light on the instruction of some, who, like impatient spirits, not able to fit out the whole Play, may yet be won to the relishing of the main Plot, by those Reasons which the Preface, or that part they light on should afford. For although it may well be expected at the hands of that Architect, that is to erect a building with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber already framed, that he not onely observe exact method in the raising and setling the same: but also that those pins which he shall make use of for joyning and fastening his work, may be both for number so certain, and also for place so setled, that they are not to be removed: Yet can it not be presumed that he that fells those Trees whereof these Tymbers and pins were made, or he that cleaves a knotted log, should be so regular and determinate in his strokes: but must be forced to make of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten use of the same wedges again; according as he shall finde those knots and stonds of his work (occasionally) to lye in his way. He also that undertakes to compleat and adorn any building whose foundation is sound and good, hath most of his skill depending upon the sightliness of his work. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that is to rip up the whole Fabrick, for amendment of the groundwork &amp; taking away of some decayed principles, must expect his commendation from ingenuous, strict, and more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious inquiry; and not from the eye of the present beholder.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that I may have something of Ethical foundations, as well as Oeconomical and Political, I have, in my fourth and last book, considered each man in his inclinations apart; to see if any Government may be found to keep him in order without fear or constraint. In which many things not very pertinent hereto are put in, to give light unto some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses foregoing, and to entertain the Reader with some va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, after so long a discourse in a confined Argument. Which being many of them but as snacht pieces from other studies (where the gradations of Nature had been more Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally examined towards some such discoveries as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to mans happy life, as he stood naturally and unsubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
<pb facs="tcp:55976:5"/>
considered so) I have here put them down to serve as helps to the composing of those differences which have all this while been a hinderance unto them. Being in good hope, (from that fair progress towards a right settlement in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and equal way way of justice which already appears) to be in a short time restored to an ability for proficience in those more Mechannick essays, which the avarice and injustice of some particular persons hath hitherto deprived me of. In the mean time as in many other of my afflictions I have found the good hand of Providence turning all things for the best, and bringing good out of evil, so do I now with greater comfort submit to this diversion: as foreseeing that if I had not upon these unhappy occasions, been brought to discourse of the sins and remedies of uncharitableness and disobedience (the usual consequents of plenty and pleasure) I should then, it is like, have been so taken up with mens more general and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and sensible contents arising by the other, as to have rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inconsiderate and silent of these mischiefs which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments in this kinde might produce.</p>
            <p>In these and other speculations and discourses, as I may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally say, that I am neither Thief nor prisoner to the Text or Tenet of any man, so do I desire to be understood, that I was not hereunto induced through arrogance or affected sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity: but the small proficience in Arts towards mans use, and the daily failing of publick peace and agreement, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those Rules and Maxims hitherto delivered, together with the diversity of opinions concerning them, causeed me, for a while, to lay aside all Authority but that of Scripture or Reason; to see what a new disquition from these would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, In any of which, if too great zeal to the Cause and end in hand have led me into error, and to deviate and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend these my propounded warrants, I do here profess to be ingenuously ready to acknowledge my self a debtor to any sober and reasonable conviction. In the mean time I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that some mens interest should lead them to clamour and outcry, on my more severe dissections made towards the cure of publick <hi>Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 6.14.</note> which have been by others but <hi>slightly healed</hi> and skinned over.</p>
            <p>But, as many Land discoveries had not been, had not some more daring travellers adventured beyond the road of common
<pb facs="tcp:55976:6"/>
belief and opinion, so, to the increase of knowledge, a latitude of enquiry and judgement must be allowed: although it may, in some things, thwart the ordinary current of tradition. For I finde that Truth and Knowledge have not a greater and more common enemy then fear of reproach: that is, whilst writers, through fear of contradiction, strive to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the sense of such as they hold of greatest reputation for ability in that whereof they treat, they leave but where they begun; and proceed with such wariness to themselves, that it makes them forget the errand they go about; which is the farther infirmation and benefit of others.</p>
            <p>In my following Discourse; as I undertake to cleer things from the sinister constructions which ambitious heads have heretofore given, so, I doubt not, but I shall be by many therein construed, and my Arguments prejudiced, as if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Court or a Kings parasite: and an a better to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Tyrannical Government. But because they that are so, do it in hope of reward from those they flatter, and my self not having any encouragement therein from the present fortune or affection of any now, I know not why any should think me less indulgent to my self and posterity, as consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this common relation, then others to theirs: so as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy so much labour to court and countenance our common misery. For could it ever have entred into a steady thought to have enthralled whole mankinde (as they stand separated amongst us in Kingdoms), to no other end then to advance (here and there) a single person to dignity, in comparison of whom, thousands of themselves were, and might ordinarily be presumed superior in merit.</p>
            <p>And I must confess, I was my self a great while pleased with the seeming reasonableness of such like common maxims; how unfit it was that all should be subject to the arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of any one, and much attentive I was to all those fine inventions and contrivances for his constraint herein: but, when I saw that Soveraingnty must at last be somewhere, and that to divide it, if it might be, was not to lessen, but to encrease its yoak; when I saw that Covernment, a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must be Arbitrary, I then concluded that the burthen of one Tyrant (if it must be so), was easier then that of many.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of the natural sweetness of Liberty, not
<pb facs="tcp:55976:6"/>
in man onely, but in all things that have life and sense. For to what end these, if when, by them, I am made perceptible of a benefit to my self, I shall at the will of another be deprived: and but rendred the more miserable, by being desirous.</p>
            <p>It were (no doubt) a happy estate, (could a man tell how to fancy it without utter extirpation of Nature), if there were sufficient of things created, not onely to satisfie the use, but to satiate the most greedy appetite of each thing living; in such sort, that each one might not covet any thing enjoyed by his equal, or of others above him. It were then again neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, for compleating universal content, that each one had, over each, and every one, such full and absolute Dominion, that he could not by any aversion of Power or Will in them be restrained.</p>
            <p>Seem these things as large, and as impossible for performance as they will, yet appetite, as appetite, cannot otherwise stint it self; but the desire for enjoyment &amp; possession of power over all things and persons, is as natural as over any one. Creatures below us have their appetites but few, so that, in injoying what they seek, they are but seldom, and then not lasting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers of one another, But, as for man, there is not, from the greatest to the lowest, any that desireth not the increase of his power: and he that, like <hi>Alexander,</hi> should command all, would not yet rest, both from wishing more worlds to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and (it is like) had he been entred among the Gods, would have strove for command there also.</p>
            <p>Look we to things again, how shall we think what is within the verge of humane reach should now pease all men, when all of it formerly could not please one? For so, our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themselves must encroach on the propriety of Deity, in desiring <hi>to know good and evil.</hi> And think we yet that the poorest creature living would not be immortal, if the flaming sword of impossibility kept him not off. But now, as nature hath bordered us by her Law of irresistability, so that age, sickness, infirmities, with all their attendants, are not by any attempt or insurrection of ours against her avoidable, even so I could wish that some way might be had to prevent mens ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings against one another. Yet then, since some must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to others, what course can we fancy to make them subject and not subject; that is, that their obedience shall be their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?
<pb facs="tcp:55976:7"/>
shall we wish that every man had his desires in all things so moderated, that having, or not having, or his having, or anothers having, were alike contentible? then indeed, would no subjection be needful, to keep of mutual injury through interfering desires. But yet some kinde of guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there must be, to provide food and things necessary to cram down these appetite-less innocents: lest their reward of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving others should turn to their own destruction. But if we cannot fancy desiring and not desiring equal, but must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge appetites the wheels of the soul, then is there no way left, but to admit of degrees of command amongst men themselves; for our orderly enjoying those stocks of blessings by God afforded us; and to keep us at unity, and from the common destruction of one another.</p>
            <p>To this end, God placeth man at first in a state of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one head: so that (no doubt) had <hi>Adam</hi> lived, he had been (as natural Father, so) King of all mankinde. But his death being sentenced, left brethren (as in equality) should contend, this power of one mans command over another was the established due of birthright: for else, we cannot think it personally indulged to <hi>Cain,</hi> over one so much better then himself. By this course, if observed, men should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in due quiet and subjection, until the numerousness of the several subject families might make the common head of them assume another Title. And therefore we find that where God promiseth to any person a great encrease of race and posterity, he promiseth withal, as a compleating of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that Kings should be born of them. But after such time as Ambition, Covetousness, Revenge, and the like, began so to prevail amongst men, that neither Gods Precepts, nor fellow-feeling of the miseries of rebellion, could keep them in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; how just is it with God, to make our own stubbornness our punishments? So that, if we impartially look amongst all those desolations of Nations, they are but the issues of their own Civil wars and contentions: which had their first rise from popular discontent and insurrection.</p>
            <p>An Argument more popular and pleasing I know it had been, to have extolled such Kings as measured their power by Justice and their Laws: but I, being not now to write to Kings, but to subjects, and in what concerned them in order to
<pb facs="tcp:55976:7"/>
peace, shall respit that till the Kings part in order to Peace and Prenty shall be treated of. Therefore writing to such onely, I chose to prefer their certain benefit by obedience, before Discourses that should flatter them to their ruine, by insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating unto them a power they can never make use of, without the mischief of disagreement and Civil war. For there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, a vulgar and popular flattery, as well as there is a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which is personal: and this is (doubtless) the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous of the two, as having more to seduce. The which kinde of insinuation is but too apparent in many writers of this kinde: wherein, men considering that those that are to be their Readers, (and from whom they expect encouragement and applause) are such as stand interessed in the relation of subjects, they do thereupon deal with them in their discourses of freedom, power, or the like, as those do that tell black wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they are fair; that is, to be wholly respective to those their own private interects and designs to be by this courtship gained, and not at all to the truth of things themselves; or to the benefit of those they pretend to instruct; whom they do really abuse by this their unfriendly information.</p>
            <p>As for example; whensoever this unhappy controversie between Prerogative on the one hand, and Liberty on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shall, for decision, be by both King and people referred to Law (for no Kings nor no people do professedly decline them) who then shall be the Judge? shall the King? No, he is a party and to be ruled by them. Well then, we will suppose the Subjects no parties, nor to be ruled by them, but to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and (perchance) make and alter them as they shall finde cause. what shall follow, but that they thereupon divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Factions again? some putting the power into I know not what and how many Magistrates; and some into such and such Representatives; all of them as far from truth, as differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one another. But as, in either case, they set the Law above the King, so they set the Subject above the Law; dealing in the one as preposterously as the other.</p>
            <p>But, in this, as in all other cases, the natural tie of self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and respect doth so blinde and byass us in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practise, that we will bring in as reasonable and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticale in the Kingdom and Commonwealth, what we think highly unfit to be exercised towards our selves in our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
<pb facs="tcp:55976:8"/>
that is, not onely to think it lawful and convenient that more then one should be there governing at once, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our selves may happily be one of that number; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we are always ready to entertain and practise all rules of restraint, whereby, under colour of Divine or Humane Law, all that live under him as Subjects, may make themselves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when they please; upon allegation that the Laws and rules of Justice and Reason, are to be in the first place obeyed. Whereas, if the children or servants of our own Family, should in our Government and Commands demean themselves with like stubbornness, either by disputing the soleness or arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our power in general, or by scrupling their obedience to each command in particular, until they finde it by God or their Prince Authorized, how would we then cry out against this sin of disobedience in them? when as yet we think it but duty in us, that the Obedience we owe to our King, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Country, should be answered with such demurrers: pride and prejudice always equally prepossessing us to bring down and level all power that is above; as well as to subject and keep under that which is already below. But say men what they will, Obedience as obedience must be implicite: and he that, in any command of lawful Authority, obeys no farther then he findes reason so to do, obeys but himself, and not another.</p>
            <p>And yet are Princes and Governors the less to wonder at this stubborn inquisitivenes in subject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, since it is no other then what hath been, and is daily offered to God himself: in prying into the reasonableness and morality of his Laws and Justice; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from our first Parents to this very hour. A thing of well known advantage to that proto-Rebel, whereby <hi>to rule in the Children of disobedience.</hi> For if once we come so far to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, as to believe the reasons of Gods Actions and Councels are apparent to ours, his will (as of course) must be submitted to ours also. Therefore, as then it was, <hi>hath God said you shal not eat</hi>; so, every day still it is, such and such Commands and Laws, are but for such and such ends; and, whether those ends were expressed by Cod or no, every man is ready, according to his own interpretation, to obey, or not obey; or so far, and no farther; even to a perpetual distraction in Religion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of one another, where a supreme definitive sentence is not kept up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55976:8"/>And as we usually thus search into his Councels, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Laws, so set we up models of equity of our own, for measuring his Justice. Insomuch as, upon every extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and remarkable event, how peremptory are we to assign this, or this for a cause? each one judging his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of right and wrong, as the onely necessary pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns for Gods proceedings and intentions herein. Which, whilest they shall differ so much one from another, and can be but one true, (if any be) <hi>must they not charge God foolishly</hi>? For example, amongst us, that have now felt in so high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure his deserved hand, those that are of the Romish opinion, say, <q>This late revolt is in Justice for our Kings deserting his Obedience to that See; and our particular Schisms, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our grand Schism from them: and the more particular pressure thereof, lighting on the Nobility and Gentry, are the punishments of their ingrossing the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Patrimony; which, like the coal from the Altar, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most consumed their nests.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These, looking upon this kingdom as the head and pillar of Protestantism, say, <q>That as Reformation of Religion was first set up by our Princes, out of State designs of alteration of Government, and of being independent on the power of <hi>Rome</hi>; so are they now but justly punished, with the same pretensions by their own Subjects; who, in their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, (they presume) have as great Authority to interpret Scripture against their Civil Governors now, as formerly against their spiritual head. And they farther say, That as to gain strength and general assistance from the Laity, was the onely reason we first made the Scriptures vulgar and common, that under the obliegingness of so high a favor, (whereby their abilities seemed to be flattered to an equal pitch with the Clergy), they might be gained to that side, that therefore our present requital, from popular wresting these Scriptures again to publik disturbance amongst our selves, is but just also.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Others, that are from them in opinion most contrary, so are their reasons also. <q>They tell you that Popery and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were here too much, and too long countenanced and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted: they tell you that the Clergy were yet too high and powerful, and their maintenance too great and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb facs="tcp:55976:9"/>
that things have thus happened, because the true sense of Scriptures and thorough Reformation from <hi>Rome,</hi> were too little regarded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Others, that (it may be) regard neither of those extreams, (but look on things as polititians) will tell you, <q>That the assistance of the <hi>Scots</hi> formerly against their Queen, the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Dutch and Rocheller against their Kings, were the just causes of insurrection now: and they will tell you also, that the beheading of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to the like fatal blow:</q> Believing it a Vice against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prudence, for Princes, out of consideration of any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to one another, to do that which should be destructive to all; as well as it is a sin against Religion, neglecting the rule of <hi>Do as thou wouldst be done unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which, and many more instances which might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of like nature, being first bewitched with our Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and then idolizing our own justice to be the same with Gods, we do cause Rebellion to creep on us <hi>as the sin of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and stubbornness as Idolatry</hi>; That is, we will then onely begin to serve God and obey his Laws, when we have first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted them to serve our own turns; which is (in effect) never to obey them more. Whereas, that more remarkable token of Obedience, that was to <hi>Abraham imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> was in fact seeming as contradictory to justice and goodness, (so far as humane ability could reach) as it was to the stream of his own particular affection.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am not more in love with those four let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that spell <hi>King,</hi> then with the rest of the Alphabet. And could I see probable hope, how that thirst of governing might be satisfied to general liking and agreement, by that sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which each subject should, by this means, have over the common vassal, the King, I should have rest contented with my share therein; and have rather given encouragement to this so common a benefit (where first all of us should have had our contents by being real governor of this one, and then that one contented (again) with the titles, formalities, and shews of his Government also) then have made my self subject to so much labour and censure. But as, in all works that are to be done, there must be the worker, the work, and the instruments whereby he brings it to pass, (the which, in order to the work,
<pb facs="tcp:55976:9"/>
must be at the workmans appointment and choice); so, in this work of Polity and Government, the commanding are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the commanded the work; and the Law, Magistracy, Councellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the instruments for effecting it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince or people shall be workmen I will not here say; onely thus much is evident, that Laws, Magistrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be at the choice and dispose of such as rule, and also above the ruled: as holding necessarily a middle term, to unite and agree them in the work it self.</p>
            <p>If (as considering how things are now practised, and the many opinions to the contrary) I shall be by any hastily condemned of ungrounded novelty, for that not contenting my self in the modest and equal way of commending Monarchy above other Governments I have quite cast Aristocraty and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty out of the right number, and reckoned of them but as Anarchies: I shall entreat them to consider, that I onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to look into Government and its forms, as they stand authorized in Scripture or Reason; and not as they stood in humane device or practise: and therefore, I hold my self no further blamable then failing hereof. For unto my strictest enquiry, there could not be found one Text, amongst those we call Canonical, countenancing and mentioning any other form: not so much as one word of the power of People, or Nobility, Parliaments, Senate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the restless wits of men have since devised, as in derogation to the other.</p>
            <p>Nay, when God means to express himself by titles of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er common to men, it is either of King, or Father, which, as the greater and lesser Monarchs, have alone divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to command over mens persons. And I believe all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men will confess, that as onely God expresly appointed this form, so nature also, at least at first in her golden age, and whilst she was at the best: insomuch as, for some thousands of yeers, it is by all concluded there, was no one sort of people otherwise governed then by Kings. And therefore, by that same rule of strangeness and wonder where with others may behold my Positions in condemning, I may behold theirs, in approving them: even that a sort of men there should be, that pretending their utmost and onely subjection to Gods word, should yet contemn the power of Kings so often and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly warranted thereby, (as given from God the Fountain of
<pb facs="tcp:55976:10"/>
power) and on the contrary, settle it on such devised Orders and Degrees, as neither for number, or office, had direct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Example from thence.</p>
            <p>But it is usual with the opposers of Monarchy to take their advantage against the evidence of Texts of this kinde, as in Civil matters, men are wont to do against those they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with about any property or title. For if they know the letter and plain sense of the Law run on the side of him they oppose, they then finde no such ready way for his defeat, as to entitle the King or some eminent superior thereunto. Even so shall we finde Kings now adays used in the interpretation of many of those places of Scripture which make so plainly on their side; that is, when the power and perpetuity of this Office is anywhere set forth, they then would have the whole sense and scope thereof to imply Christ himself, and not this his immediate Deputy.</p>
            <p>By which kinde of proceeding, they do (by fact) evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove themselves guilty of that pride and arrogance they would reprehend in another: and that it is not Christs honor that is hereby sought, otherwise then in order to their own. For since they do allow him to have his deputed Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, for declaration and execution of his Will, will it not therefore follow, that the greater the honor and power of this person thus substituted is, by so much will the honor of Christ whom he doth herein represent be encreased? It is not therefore to be believed, that subjects of any sort would have thus justled with their Prince for precedence and going next to Christ, had they not more considered their own honors to be thereby gained, then his to be thereby lost.</p>
            <p>But as the light of Scripture shines undeniably cleer every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where on the face of Monarchy, so doth it in record and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise also: And therefore we shall finde, that when God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears for the setling the first moral Laws for men to live by, there was not, nor had not been in the world, any but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical government setled. When again, the <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> Christ himself appears, (as the old im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posters in Oracles became silent, so) all Republikes and States had hid their heads under one Monarchy or another. And that which may be observable in other stories is, that the Greeks themselves, who, in restless wits, were the ring leaders
<pb facs="tcp:55976:10"/>
in Doctrines and Examples for all these Civil alterations, as well as (in a manner) for all heresies in Religion, and upon no other ground then with an affected pride to express their power and freedom in both, above the rest of the world, (who in regard of themselves they stiled barbarous), are at this day, and so have long continued, the examples of highest sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and oppression in both kindes.</p>
            <p>Besides these high Authorities and Examples, that so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare for Monarchy alone, I could never tell how to settle my Reason on any other foundation: being unable to fancy how Soveraignty could have been divided without divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Obedience; how unity could proceed from plurality; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d how Peace could be amongst Subjects, when the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers themselves must be still in danger of variance with one another. And farther, I could by no means conceive but that (proportionably) as one man could not serve two Masters with equal duty and respect; so, on the other side, that many Masters could not command or govern one or many servants, with equal power and affection. And therefore, laying down for my ground, that as death was the worst of evils to a man as a man, and so also, that Civil war was the worst of evils to men as sociable, it was reason I should seclude these inventions as failing of that main end of Government, and reckon them (at best) but plausible pretenders thereunto.</p>
            <p>And the same reason I must also give, for declining that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed way of founding Government and Authority on Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, while Prince and People are hereby put to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual question what these Pactions were, as in a thing of no more evidence, it must needs happen, there will be produced, instead of Peace and Agreement, a perpetual ground to inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine dissention and rebellion.</p>
            <p>In the survey of all which, or any thing else delivered, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shall make objections of inconveniencies in that degree of arbitrariness I have assigned unto Princes, I desire to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as not thinking any Government can be by men in this life exercised, where no mischiefs shall sometimes happen: but, leaving that hope till we come to the government of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if the inconveniences hence probably arising proceed not from the form but the persons, if they be such as are not onely to that, but much more to others incident, and if after, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb facs="tcp:55976:11"/>
side all, it stil appears that this form is onely of divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and example, and, so also, more naturally and necessarily procuring peace, the end of Government, then any other, I shall then confess I have arrived at the end of my whole la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: which was to settle publike peace and good by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Authority; without reflection on the private benefit of any person therein likely to bear sway.</p>
            <p>But being to write in an age, wherein all men stand, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided under that different sense of loyalty which <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> once wittily observed in his two followers, <hi>Ephestion</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi> (namely that one loved <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other the <hi>King</hi>) but also, being to write in a Nation, wherein Monarchy it self stands wholly approved or rejected, as the persons therein likely to rule, are differently considered as friends or enemies, I cannot therefore but expect that, from these so different and contrary interests of others, these my writings themselves should also be obnoxious to as contrary censures: that is, of having reflected too much or too little, towards the praise or dispraise of that person, whom they, according to their several engagements, would have had more openly commended or disproved. Whereas I, who, from sense of the calamities of our civil broils, had been drawn to be of <hi>Craterus</hi> opinion, as the best remedie I could devise, thought it neither proper nor reasonable to deliver my self in any <hi>Ephestion like</hi> expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or to appear as Foe or Advocate to any man: but to set down and handle the whole Argument as a Christian Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, in a general Treatise and Discourse of government, according to Doctrines or Examples drawn from Scripture or Reason, without reflection or censure of any one Nation in particular: as will easily, I hope, appear by that which follows.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the observation of the dependance of one thing upon another (as of its Original and Cause) we must come at last to fix on such a cause as is to all things Supreme and Independent: For to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed infinitely we cannot, but shall lose our selves as in a circle, whose ends will be as hardly brought to meet in our conceit, as it is to imagine the most remote cause, and most remote effect, to joyn by immediate touch.</p>
               <p>Observe we again, That no Operation or Effect, could ever have been produced in regular and orderly manner, unless the direction thereof had (first or last) proceeded from a voluntary Agent: So that, when we find the Superiour Bodies, Elements, and other Creatures void of sense and will (by their constant endeavours) either pointing to any end at all, or such other ends as have respect and benefit beyond themselves, they must be concluded but as Passive Agents in both cases: and the latter respect (especially weighed) will at last bring us to pitch upon one Agent or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of such universal power, and concern in all things, as to be the true Creator and Director of them all: One, I say; for should each Element by it self, or should the will of more then one be the Guider of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and Effects, would it not follow that this Procession of chance, or different aim and will must necessarily set Nature sometimes at a stand, for want of sufficient power and direction what course to follow, or (as it were by a kinde of Civil War) make her endeavours so distracted and weak, that nothing but dissolution and confusion could follow?</p>
               <p>From all which we may conclude both a Deity, and the unity thereof;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55976:14"/>
and that (as a free Agent) no operation could have proceeded from him without an end, whereby, (as by an immutable Law) the effects and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of other Creatures, stand directed and limited unto certain ends and bounds, which otherwise would not proceed at all; or else do it infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, or destructively to one another.</p>
               <p>And upon the same reason of having the vertues and endeavours of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Agents and Elements thus stinted and directed, it will follow, that as there must be such original Elements, as might have fitness to answer thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Laws and Rules of Providence; so, this pre-existent matter could not be equally eternal with Deity, but must be at first created by the same hand it is now guided: for should they not, or should there have been no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, but a perpetual pre-existence of Elements (before they had by the Rules of Providence their vertues and abilities harmoniously directed) they must, by their irregular courses, have been the destruction of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As therefore, in the first case, to skip and balk the more immediate and instrumental causes of things, and fasten them as immediate upon God the Supreme (after the usual way of the ignorant) were so to confound and jumble Causes and Effects, that there should not in nature be any certain Production at all, because if the Supreme Cause should be an immediate cause to the most remote effect, then, in order backward, that remotest ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect must be a cause to that which was his immediate cause before, and so on; or else what was the immediate effect to the Supreme before, will now (by its removal therefrom (and coming to be as immediate cause to the most remote effect) want a cause for its own Production) so, in this latter case, the like would befal, if (through want of good and true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the dependance and reason of effects and causes, till we come to the Supreme Cause or Reason) we should fasten the Productions of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or first matter on Chance: for, if they be constant and uniform, how shall Chance own or lay claim to them?</p>
               <p>Again, to make them Co-eternal with Deity, is to deny his Eternity, or their dependance on him, who must precede the Chaos, in time, as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain must precede the Endowment and Regulation of the qualities of the Elements themselves, in time also. For so, fire was before heat, as the cause is before the effect; which, had it been Eternal, and the qualites of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto annexed without limit (which must have been had it been from it self only) what would have become of the race all things else in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conflagration? which now, keeping its degrees, and being confined within such and such subjects and bounds by a Superiour Power, is a great and necessary help to their Production; That, and all things else, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeying the Law of their Maker; from whom, as from a most wise, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and Bountiful Creator, nothing but works and operations suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are to be expected.</p>

               <p>AS therefore the perfection of this Worlds Maker doth sufficiently argue the perfection of the work; so doth the perfection of the work as justly plead for continuance. Continue it could not by any other Power then that whereby it was founded; yet, as before, no want in God, or merit elsewhere (but a natural propension to extend and express his own goodness and beneficence) caused a Creation: So in the course of Preservation and Government (that stood thereunto necessary as to an end) God was yet at liberty and free in the way and manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it: that is, whether to proceed by more express and personal exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his will, or else to operate by natural Rules and Laws: And so far it is from abating the just esteem of the Act of Providence, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that of Creation, because God doth not in this (as there) so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately work; as (on the contrary) the very imposition of Natures Law, and the Endowment of creatures of all sorts with such Instincts and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as in the prosecution and exercise thereof, they shall be continually able to keep up both the common and their private preservations, argues, by how much the means is the weaker, the greater to be the strength of him that enabled and appointed it.</p>
               <p>But then, as every thing became hereby positively good, so, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the impression of Divine favour, and similitude of the workman im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the work, a comparative degree of Perfection and Goodness did arise; and consequently, the greater care for their preservation may be seen to have been taken. For to have made all creatures, Men or Angels, had not only overthrown that beauty and goodness arising by the universal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; but, inasmuch as the Perfection of those creatures stands chiefly in comparison of things below them, (for in regard of God they are all base and poor,) these lower Perfections being taken off, see we not how the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection aimed at, in respect of that higher, must have necessarily ceased also? Whereas now, they of themselves keep it by comparison, and those inferior creatures, by their several uses to the preservation of the whole world, of one another, and of man in particular, have therein also their distinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perfection and Goodness. So that each creature having nothing but what he had thus received, it follows, that what is now in them, was in him as in its original before; their limited receipts, in all kinds, only differing them from him in Almightiness.</p>
               <p>The first impression or communication of Divine Resemblance, was that of Entity or Positive existence; and this, necessarily entring with Creation it self to be more or less imparted, all creatures stood yet differenced, and beneath their Maker in point of eternity and degree of continuance. But that which was Personally denyed, by the mortality and decay of Individuals, is by another way, to wit, by Propagation (in a sort) made good. Amongst others, Man, as bearing the most universal and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est resemblance in the attributes of his Maker; so hath he (above other
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55976:15"/>
creatures) a nearer stamp of Eternity conferred on him: insomuch as, by the benefit of Resurrection, he stands exempted from that rule of total decay, wherein (with the whole world it self) other things are inevitably involved.</p>
               <p>Come we more neerly to observe all creatures in their natural operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how they are all directed to mutual preservation by the wise and well set Rules of Providence; Inanimates necessarily, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of life voluntarily, pursuing those actions that lead most directly thereunto. See we not the elements (and other things wanting life) by their constant observation of Natures Law, to preserve themselves and creatures of life; to whose use, as being more noble, they seem in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly intent and directed? In these heavenly bodies we may easily discern this Rule of Providence, in their constant Preservation and ours, although the means by which it is done, be as far removed from our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as they are from our sight: but their correspondence and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in this work of universal Preservation, we have reason to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and admire; for by means of their several vertues and influences it is, that the ambient ayr is continually enabled to hatch and nourish all sorts of creatures, which the earth and water (as the common Wombs and Parents of things) do afford in such variety.</p>
               <p>And in these lower Elements also, see we not how regular and constant they are in the course of common Preservation, and maintenance of the degrees of Creation and Providence? For, rather then a Vacuum shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be to destroy Creation, the ayr will not only admit degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension and compression in its self; but the water and earth will yield to transmutation of part of their own bodies thereinto: whereby, taking up more room, they afford sufficient supply, to avoid non-entity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. Mark we not how, by their endowments of dense and rare, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and lighter, they are constantly able to keep their ranks and places in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Centre: And thereby orderly to obey the Laws of Nature in Production and Maintenance of other Creatures? So that when water soaks into the earth, or remains below it (as in the Sea, Ponds, Rivers, &amp;c.) it is not to displace the earth, which, by means of this compactness, is kept on heaps and hills, from taking that his proper room it self, but to remove so much ayr as was there before, into a more natural and higher station. And truly, the knowledge of weight and levity, and how to put nature to struggle in endeavouring a Vacuum, and altering the natural consistencies of bodies, is the mother of all natural motions, and mechanical opera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Come we yet to consider the species and race of creatures more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and how they are all made apt to receive and bestow the vertues and bounties of Nature for the good of themselves and others. How ready and constant supplies find Plants and Vegetables from the earth? And, as if they knew their individual Preservations were not valuable to that of their Race, see we not how they spend their whole endeavours in the growth and security of their seed? And till they come to the ability to propagate, we call them in no kinde perfect; as, on the other side, when this ability is once over, their decay is as apparent. To what purpose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ve those good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blossoms, Leaves, Fruits and Flowers, but to mellow and defend the Seed? To what purpose the Stem and Boughs, but to reach out this Seed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55976:15"/>
to receive growth and ripeness, from the influences of Superiour bodies, and to remove them from the injuries of things beneath? the seed being now ripe and fallen, Natures care seems removed from the Plant, who now (as if her work were done) doth droop and wither; and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the perpetuite by her course of succession, usually makes the leaves of the Plants (by their fall) a covering to the seed; till the fitted earth hath afforded it some fastness and receipt.</p>
               <p>Mark we lastly Creatures of life and sense being by that means capable of Pleasure and Pain, and we shall finde them hereby (as by Reward and Punishment) stirr'd up most to avoid or execute those actions that have directest tendencies to their subsistence and preservation; that action that tends to the more universal Preservation of the Species, having greater delight annexed to it then that of food that maintains the individual on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that, Creation is but Providence begun, as Providence is but Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation compleat; and, however Creation did precede Providence in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, yet doth Providence that in dignity, as being the end and aym thereof; even as that again is excelled by its end also, which the glory of God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of particular or self Providence.</head>
               <p>AS the Preservation of the several Races and Kindes of Creatures was unto the continuance and supply of the whole Creation neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: So again, to the Preservation of each Species, the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Individuals was necessary also; and that (consequently) there should be appetites implanted in them leading thereunto: For although some lower sort of creatures have no individual Perfections at all to seek, but, as parts of a greater mass (being parcels of earth, water, stone, mettals, &amp;c.) have (with things of like kindes) their welfares by Nature readily furnished: yet creatures of life, (which thereupon come to be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,) must have this appetite of Self-good and Preservation, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on it with such degrees of intention, as to aim at the utmost Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in its power, without such sense of duty elsewhere as might cause it to intermit its proper care, and (it may be) in its divided endeavour, be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of the good of both.</p>
               <p>For to think there could be separate subsistences, and yet depend on forreign Preservation only, were impossible: because if <hi>Thomas</hi> his being should depend on <hi>Johns, Johns</hi> must again depent on <hi>Williams,</hi> and so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, till one Person had all dependencies; which should not then be many, but one man. Or should they reciprocally change, and the reason and will that <hi>Thomas</hi> now hath, be in <hi>William,</hi> and so <hi>Williams</hi> in <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>John:</hi> how should either know the others wants, and consequently provide for his good and safety?</p>
               <p>And therefore, this endowment of separate-sense, will, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55976:16"/>
whereby each particular is enabled to provide and have regard unto it self apart, makes it manifest that the maintenance of Creatures (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said) was necessary to be kept up by this appetite of self-seeking and following a private end and soveraign good respective to it self only. For although the many mischiefs (hereafter to be spoken of) arose from hence, yet (on the other side) was it the fountain of all the good they had: inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as good men we cannot be, except we be men, and well-being must presuppose being; which had herein its necessary foundation. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain necessary, in maintenance of that variety of Creation, and of that Oeconomy and rule of Providence God had appointed. For should all creatures have passively and unwittingly followed impulsive directions, as inanimates do their Instincts and Properties, this had been to overthrow Sense, Reason, and Will, as things useless, and to forbid the Almighties goodness, (in some resemblance to himself) to make creatures sensible of felicity; and thereupon, lessening our benefit, so should it abate his praise and thanks. And further, it would stint the race of Creatures, from coming above that of Vegetables.</p>

Or should (again) all creatures have had sense, and an end apart of their own to follow, this must have put a great stop to those many affordments and offices, which inanimates now supply to sensitives, as seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng made wholly for them. For so (for example) should the Sun, the Earth, the Water, &amp;c. have had private and self-desires, would not the good of both vegetives and sensitives be interrupted, and many times fore-slowed? And so also, if vegetives should have had life, and (thereupon) sense of those many sufferings which the continual imployments of men and other sensitives put them unto, both for food and otherwise; would it not, on the other hand, have been inconsistent with the goodness of God to have thus inevitably tyed his Creatures to perpetual torment and affliction, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their equals in nature (for so to sensitives they must have been if they had been sensitives also;) and, on the other hand, would not the knowledge and sense of these h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rms have made them shrink and decline that readiness wherewith they now stand serviceable? Whereas now, by this appetite and ability of self-preservation, prosecuted in some willingly, and in others not, they keep up their several Species; and are thereby enabled in the variety and order appointed them, severally to set forth the praise of their Maker.</p>
               <p>Upon this it follows, that although the act of Generation, (which tends to specifical Preservation,) be in each creature hotlier pursued then any that reacheth to individual conservation onely; yet it is done and maintained out of self-respect; either in sensitives voluntarily, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto allured by the greatness of pleasure, which is their private end; or in inanimates necessarily, where Self-Preservation, (their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral end) is by natural instinct so closely involved therein that the whole Perfection of the thing it self dependeth thereupon. And so far are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures herein from intending any thing beyond themselves, or shewing spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical aim, that their endeavours stint themselves to the individuals of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55976:16"/>
their own race: it being done in so high a degree of Propriety, as, having therein (as it were) transplanted their whole strength, it obtains (by this transmigration) a kinde of Identity.</p>
               <p>In pursuit of this appetite of Philautia, we may observe Plants and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables to follow their individual Preservations so greedily, that they are ready to rob of growth and nourishment all within the verge of their own activity, even of their own kind; nay each single fruit, grain, or berry of the same Plant will do the like to his fellow; and by too covetous engrossing the common sap, leave many of the same stock to pine and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And so again creatures of sense, having life and motion, and a greater desire and ability to attain (then them) the objects of their use and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>light, are ready, with all kinde of violence, to enter possession, without due consideration of their fellows like desires and wants. Upon this ground de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all those conflicts for mastery amongst beasts, which reach many times to mutual slaughter; the most harmless creatures exercising this force in some kinde, or time, or other.</p>
               <p>But, above all, man, being a Creature of most divine resemblance, and his Preservation of higher esteem, had this Philautia more strongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. For with inanimates he resembles him in positive existence or being, with creatures of life and sense in being capable of pleasure and content; but, above them all, he comes nearest (by much) in strength of reason and understanding. And as sensitives go beyond inanimates in enjoying the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Natures store, so have men, beyond them again, an appetite (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove comparison) both in the generality of desiring and the ability of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. Insomuch as, both in regard of their serviceableness and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the largeness of mans appetite to entertain and make use of them (as beforesaid) we may be called little worlds by our selves; having, in us, their vertues epitomized, as well as uses stinted: All things seeming but made for us, and no creature exempt and useless from our imployment, for benefit or pleasure. What can he wish? above him is an indulgent God, enduing him with appetites and reason, to desire and attain the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his content in abundant variety: Below him all creatures standing obedient, and thereunto serviceable.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of Government as it stands in Natural Reason: and of its reputed Original.</head>
               <p>IN this happy estate of innocent coveting and enjoying, we at first stood by the goodness of him that made the delight of all things ours, and ours his; until, ungratefully intermitting our acknowledgement and delight upwards, we forfeited our delight below, by breaking that command which should have been the pledge and type of both. Wherein (besides Ingratitude,) mans fault seemed Pride or Presumption; in aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to break the link of that Golden chain and rank of Subordination, wherein Nature had limited us; and so, balking our dependance on God, be as it were gods unto our selves,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>in the knowledge of good and evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now is it that the most ordinary and useful parts of our bodies come to be accompted nakedness or sin, which had we been content to enjoy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natural simplicity of our first state and the example of other creatures, we had continued innocent in their use; and other injuries done by self-seeking, being according to nature, and she being content with self-sufficency, she had therein been, as well our warrant as our spur. Whereas now, our unbridled lusts leading us beyond all bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and then, having those former innocent acts mingled with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate desires (and so with them taken upon our own scores) they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become sin also.</p>
               <p>From hence come we to be assaulted, from without, with the revolt of the creature, and, from within, by our own concupiscence, which proves now both our sin and our punishment. For whilst, in our greedy and hasty pursuits, Reason wants either ability, or time to consult of good or bad, our wo instead of our weal is many times embraced. Before, when we were content to follow the natural Laws of our kinde, we could do nothing ill; and now, trusting to our selves, we can do nothing well: And seeming not content with those miseries that singly assail us, our unsociable dispositions finding occasion to make others the objects of our malice and revenge, pull on our selves the like, or greater punishment then they did strive to inflict. And again, instead of those reciprocal helps (in our decay) which should have grown from consort-ship, our enterfering desires continually engage us to mutual prejudice.</p>
               <p>And then, when the whole store and variety of nature can hardly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the boundles appetite of one man: how should they content all? Whereas beasts (neither covetous of Propriety, nor relishing their price by difficulty) are content with the simple and ready food of grass or the like. They quietly and peaceably enjoy their loves and rest: and, after their own repasts, can without envy or dislike see the satisfaction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whereas man, in his unlimited appetite, seeking to engross the common revenue of Nature, and esteeming the content of others a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himself, in a restless covetousness, makes a dearth in plenty. For,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55976:17"/>
be himself never so throughly glutted, he yet grudges at the satisfaction of another; and would (at least) have it his bounty. It would trouble our Arithmetique to sum up the variety of our food, apparel, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, wherewith (not nature, but) the satisfaction of our inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires makes us perpetually industrious: and when all is done, it is not self-sufficiency that can please us; but we become as unsatiable for quantity as kinde.</p>
               <p>And further, since equal things cannot but have equal desire and claim; and since neither mens prerogatives amongst themselves, nor proprieties over other Creatures are by Nature distinguished; how should the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of one happen without the discontent of another? what's the issue of this discontent but strife and fighting? and of fighting but death? to the disturbance of Nature, and destruction of her chief Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Piece.</p>
               <p>The riches of the earth, that without labour sprang up, and satisfied the desires of our innocent Parents, must now only be the reward of our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; but who will till the field before he can be assured of the Crop? and if when Nature, out of her general regard, and intending the good of all, set no bounds or distinctions for the private possession of any, (but that all may lay equal claim to the soil and fruit,) why should any take more pains, when afterwards his propriety shall be but equal? and, as the issues of his labour, so himself, in defence thereof, but rendred a more probable prey to the next violent hand. To sum up all, consider on one side the variety of Nature and the Creatures, in objects for our use and delight; and on the other side, our proness to strife for their possession: or (for better instance) suppose all those things free again wherein men now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their unquestioned propriety, and Nature as loose to make equal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them to all: what but hatred, confusion, and destruction, could we imagine would follow, instead of our now peaceable agreement?</p>
               <p>Therefore supposing (as is usually done) mankinde to have at first lived in this confused condition, (wherein equality of persons and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods set every one against another, where while all things were all mens, no man had the enjoyment of any thing) and then, no doubt, this sense of the miseries arising by dissention, would be the chief motive to bring men to submit to Government, and think of some way of unity. For, partly out of remorse of the slaughter of others, and partly out of just fear that the like might befal themselves or friends, the occasions of their miseries would begin to be enquired; and withal, the likeliest means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and peace.</p>
               <p>And because quarrels had for the most part arisen about propriety, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety would be the chief thing which, by Laws and Rules amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they would go about to establish. In which doing, besides the abatement of strife, they foresaw a general positive benefit to ensue: for where before they found that what was every mans profit, was no mans care; and while all might reap, none would plough; or while the herd and fleece was common, the breed was neglected; fear of famine and other humane indigencies quickly taught them (with most reason) to expect the best return of publique utility and trust, where private hands might gain by managery; and to make the wheel of common, concentrique with that of private advantage. They quickly found that a small proportion, enjoyed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55976:18"/>
with security and peace, renders more content and encrease to the owner, then a larger which fear of disseisen makes unuseful. Therefore necessity (the mother of wisdom) having taught them to embrace peace and unity, reason farther taught this way unto it: namely, that (as the division of their wills and appetites had before made disturbance, so) the only means to acquit themselves thereof was to submit to some definitive sentence and determination in all controversies; hereby, many became one in this grand Politique body; and as in the natural, though the arms, legs, and all other parts, draw greedily for themselves apart that nourishment which is for common supply (and that with self-consideration only;) yet all of them keeping their natural order and rules, and relying on the affordment of such members as are of publike concern and trust, not only their single, but joynt preservations did follow. For the brain affords nerves, the heart arteries, the liver blood to all parts, as having the like interest in them all: and while each member is thus supplyed, according to the proportion which its oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy and service to the whole doth require, and that Geometrically eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath alike while they have enough, why should one repine at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For if (according to the old allusion) the hands or feet, alledging their greater pains and service, should ignorantly quarrel and envy the greater rest and supplies of other parts, and hereupon grow so stubborn as to refuse the directions of the common head, so far as to disable it and those publique useful members of heart, liver, &amp;c. from performing their offices, must it not follow, that the whole body thus perishing, the hands and feet must therewith perish also? For the whole body (subsisting by, and) being but collectively these members, each of their particular growth and good made that of the whole swell also: So in this Politique Body, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral benefits and advancements of particular members are made, by this union of will and application, to be the encrease of the publique.</p>
               <p>But it is (by the way) to be considered, that in submitting thus Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquely to have each private wil swayed by a publique, (which thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the only legal will or sentence,) it is not to be supposed that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of willing could be resigned: for that is impossible, and beyond our power, it being not capable so far to reflect on it self, as to will to be willing, or not willing in any thing: for (if so) such kinde of choice would proceed infinitely; nor could the actions necessary for preservation of each individual, have any setled, certain, and final sentence for direction or execution on its own behalf: but the effect of our wills (or the power to execute the same) is that we (promise, and) are to suspend, or deny, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to publique allowance.</p>
               <p>And, as not the faculty of willing, so not that of understanding and judging can be wholly left and silenced; because that also is to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and subsistence of each man as man, (that is in his separate and personal capacity) and to the constitution of will it self absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. But, because my private understanding (taking me distinctly for a single person) was for self-preservation only, I can from my self claim no right farther to use or apply it; but in such cases where Polity hath placed me in the relation of a subject and member of a Politique Body, united for common good, there it is reasonable that, as my particular good is unvaluable to that of the general, so my liberty and right of judging Publique benefits and expedients should be as unvaluable also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55976:18"/>And although in this course of Politique submission, men could not but expect decisions many times contrary to their private opinions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; yet, since this was the only way to common peace and safety, they thought it reasonable that a general good should be preferred before a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and as we in our Natural, so they in this Politique Body, were curing with mutilation or patience the impotencies and griefs of particular members, rather then the whole body (with all other Members,) should run into common hazard, and, while striving to shew partial affection to the grieved part only, the life and subsistence of all should be endangered. For as when life is taken from our natural body, it remains a body no longer but a carcase: so Politique bodies being berest of their life, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agreement and submission to Authority, continues no longer a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth but Anarchy.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we may observe that Monarchy was not only the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and useful form of Government, as having in it the most apparent unity: But also that this chief office was that of a Judge, being in all causes, and over all persons, supreme head and governor. Not that any single benefit, or the advancement or good of any one person was thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; because that otherwise, and without this relation, they were to be presumed but of equal merit. And so, if we shall diligently consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all those examples of more special and extraordinary favour and abilities bestowed by God Almighty in Holy Writ, we shall finde that the good of the whole, or some more considerable part of the people, was the end of those miraculous and personal endowments, and not single honor: it carrying too great a disagreement to Gods justice, and too plain a shew of partiality, that whole Societies and Orders of men should be to no other end abased but to the advancement and good of one. And to this end only were all those Prerogatives and Priviledges annexed to the persons of Princes, as (amongst others) that of irresistible power. For their chief end being the peace of the Kingdom, and ceasing of strife and slaughter; in the doing thereof it must be aswel in his power to decide (if equity shall so lead him,) on the fewer and weaker side, as on the more and stronger; and so much his Obligation of Protection must imply: Else, if the stronger should of it self (and notwithstanding such decision) have still power by force to atchieve their own desires, and refuse submission, to what end should Government be? for without it, the stronger side did before judge and prevail for it self; but now, all Power being resigned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a third determinate hand, it is no more of right in them but him: and the offer to reassume it, is the highest breach of Trust, and the Treason of all Treasons even the betraying of all Order and Government it self.</p>
               <p>By all which we may discern the Original reason of Government and power of one man over another; we may see why <hi>every soul should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers</hi>; and how <hi>all powers come to be of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13 1, &amp;c.</note> and why the resistance hereof, as the greatest crime, is to be punished with <hi>damnation.</hi> For, without submission to Government and Authority, what peace can be hoped for? and without peace, what temporal good can be expected? because, as the care of God in the preservation of all creatures in general, is called Providence; so, being applyed to mans particular, it is called Peace. A blessing of such utility, that, in Scripture,<note place="margin">Num, 25.12</note> we may observe all other blessings included therein, as the more worthy: so that in our <hi>prayer

               <head>CHAP. V. Of each Mans private End and Felicity</head>
               <p>WE before touched how the different Perfections of Creatures arose from the different neerness to Divine resemblance; and that the whole Creation took effect out of Gods intention to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his goodness, and reap thereby due praise and glory; and that this difference of participation and resemblance appeared most in man, as a creature most lively enabled both to the rellishing and enjoying this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and bounty, and withal of greatest engagement and ability to return due praise. We are now to consider, that as it would have seemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable in God, to expect praise from us for such things whose use and possession we could not at all apprehend or acquire: so to encrease this praise and thanks, it was necessary that the objects of our felicity, and our vigor in enjoying and possessing them, should be encreased also. And again, as for to have coveted and delighted in any by means of our affections, and then have wanted the benefit of reason and discourse to attain it, had been and abuse: so to imagine we should have ever put forth to the possession of any thing, the pleasure or benefit whereof we did no ways apprehend, were absurd; and therefore in this necessary conjunction, our reason and affections are heightned and helped by each other: yet Reason doth usually play the part of the Servant or Ministerial Officer to the attaining of what we apprehend as Pleasant: which Reason having assented unto on the behalf of the object, (out of which Pleasure is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) it is then called Good: or when on the behalf of the way and means to attain it, it is then called Vertue: especially if it overthrow not a greater Pleasure in others, to which end all Laws are framed Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, appointing punishments to keep off the seeking of such Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p>They that have hitherto defined mans felicity, have stinted it to such and such particular objects, wherein (for the most part guessing by the measure of their own rellishes and apprehensions) they themselves thought greatest happiness to consist; but we not making mans felicity narrower then the objects thereof will afford, (and reckoning small pleasures even to be parts thereof also) do not mean to contend in what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55976:19"/>
object or exercise this delight doth most consist, leaving it to ties proper and indisputable judge, each mans own appetite) but do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm mans end to be pleasure. At which, if any seem startled, as esteeming a difference should be put between that which is good and that which is pleasant, (and that goodness may be had where pleasure is not,) their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake ariseth from the observation that since many men and creatures take often delight in such things as procure them afterwards great harm and sorrow; and, on the other side, finding many things which are painful in the present possession to prove afterwards good; they seek (thereupon) to divide Good from Pleasant: Not duly considering that, besides God, no object can have in it self a positive or perfect degree of goodness; but it is in them comparative only, even according to that serviceableness they yield to other things, as for food, cloathing, or other use. Therefore the measure of good received from any thing, must be rated according to the rellish, entertainment and serviceableness it finds in the receiver, which must make it good, or not.</p>
               <p>For if by good we understand what is commodious and necessary for the preserving and perfecting our nature, without regard whether it be pleasant or not; see we not how they take away the use of sense and reason, and make the felicity of living Creatures not to exceed that of stones and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inanimates: for these have this felicity conferred on them with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er constancy and assurance then Sensitives; and, if such kind of passive or negative happiness could dignifie, would be more excellent of the two: Whereas they, having no apprehension, rellish, or delight in what they do, we may justly account them excelled by Creatures of sense: as they are again by man, surpassing them all in the variety and vigour of his enjoyments.</p>
               <p>As, for instance, in that intellectual pleasure of honour, wherein man seems so delighted as if he were a second Deity, they have either none, or small apprehension. Their ears are not capable of harmony, or the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of eloquence; nor their eyes delighted with Colours, Figures, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, &amp;c. They want also many varieties of tastes and smells which we possess. And, (in a word,) as man hath brain (the root of sense) in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quaintity then they, so also he exceeds them in the use and effects thereof: being more various and abundant in his desires, and more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and steady in his possession. All which will conclude, that goodness in Sensitives (as such) cannot be where pleasure is not; and that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is but another name for Pleasure, or (commonly,) the way our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son apprehends to it.</p>
               <p>For when for the health of my body I endure Physick, (or other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations which are troublesom and unpleasant) or, for the good of my soul, abstain from any thing pleasant, or undergo any task or pennance; see we not how that which is called good in both kindes, is but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it is the way to what is pleasant afterwards for the appetite fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pleasure as her general end, and preferring the greater to the less, by the help of reason finds, that in these and like cases, this end is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise attainable. For this lasting pleasure of health, doth far countervail the temporary sufferings of Physick; and the reward of heaven any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany punishment; and (in both cases) proves not the avoidance, but Pursuit of Pleasure. For, is any thing Pleasant to the taste for other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55976:20"/>
cause eschewed but out of fear of some other detriment? nor can we make an Athiest forbear his pleasure, when the terror of shame or the Law are off him: or the Glutton his appetite in any thing which fear of sickness forbids not. From the first instance, we may conclude this Maxim That slighter and less durable pain is to be suffered, rather then greater as if that of Physick, to that of Sickness and Death) and, in the other case, That greater pleasure is to be preferred to less, as well as some is better then none at all.</p>
               <p>Mark all we do, and it will be as feed to this harvest. We labour for money, not for it self, but because it is the sure and common Purchaser of things pleasurable. It is this natural thirst we pursue, even when in things we seem least to look that way: For, who are they that most deny themselves in the contents of this life, but such as have greatest hope of heaven hereafter, and the reward by God there promised? <hi>Having in his presence fullness of joy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 16 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and at his right hand pleasures for evermore.</hi> From all which, we may plainly see Pleasure to be our good or end, and only then to be avoided when it procures pain, or by its possession thrusts out a greater.</p>
               <p>The scandal and exceptions commonly taken against making pleasure our aim, is because some thinking pleasure to be only placed in our sense, common to us with beasts, they have thereupon thought it below mans dignity. But why so? since we have senses alike, should not their use be alike? And since, as we formerly proved, men by their senses be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more pleasure then other things, why should we think it done in vain? If to this, be added that of his intellect, minde and contemplation, what shall we think all these advantages to pleasure afforded him but in jest? and not rather conclude, that whatever delight, content or pleasure man is capable of, the same is truly his end. To think otherwise, were to tax God with cruelty and deceit; in fixing our desires to objects of our ruine, or hooking in our overthrow by this golden bait. For is it not by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite that all the pursuits of living Creatures are guided, insomuch as what is naturally and kind-like done, is also pleasurable; and whatever is harmful or destructive, is painful and irksom? Is not the food which preserves each individual take with delight; and that act that preserves the Species taken with more delight? because the more good is not what is most nourishing, of best rellish, and (on the contrary) what is worse; have beasts any other rule to feed them by then this? and are they not herein more infallible and happy then we, who (by way of Physick or Pride) making some unpleasant tastes familiar, do many times so adulterate our gusts, as wanting that truer guid, we come (through familiarity) to encline afterwards to both tastes alike, and then, wanting reason sufficient to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and know our own constitution, our sickness (instead of health) is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten procured? In which regard we may call Pleasure the natural Probat of good, or the aim of each sensitive individual (as such) by natures governor prudentially appointed, that thereby its own, and the general good and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of the whole might be preserved; and so Gods end and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might have a constant way of meeting; which left to be done by such means as their own understandings and fancies should contrive, they could never certainly nor uniformly do: For, should Creatures private ends be immediately the same with Gods, Reluctance, disobedience, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must follow: In as much as Sensitive agents, (with reservation of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55976:20"/>
specifical differences) could neither be universally endued with such sufficiency of understanding and comprehension, as throughly to discover what was truly tending to common Preservation, and the glory of God, (things in themselves the only chief good and end of all things;) nor could they again (in respect of will) be supposed, either generally, or equally one to another, so strongly and steadily inclined, (out of sense of vertue or piety) as to endeavour an end and good of more high or equal concern to others; as when now, led by the more proper, sensible, and pressing invitation, each one doth by constant following pleasure, its own end, more constantly and generally prosecute that which is Gods end also, his glory, arising by our contents and preservations.</p>
               <p>So that, in a word, place any creature in such a condition as to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with continual pleasure to the utmost degree which its kinde is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and who can doubt its felicity? It is true, he might take delight in such things as might be hurtful afterwards: but when this cometh to pass, the supposition is broken: for the pleasure is over, and pain is come instead thereof: unless we can imagine there can be harm without pain, as a sickness or disease which (having sense) we should not be sensible of. And, in this case, we fall upon the rule of comparison before mentioned; better forbear a present Pleasure, when a greater Pain is the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent thereof; and so again on the contrary: both ways concluding that the most lasting and highest pleasure is preferrable to that which is shorter and less: and therewithal, that pleasure is that we seek, and pain what we would avoid. For, if I take delight in such things or actions as bereave me of health, do they not thereby bereave me of Pleasure also, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the only necessary taste and subject thereof: and, on the contrary, possessing me with the pain of sickness or death? If again, I take such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all, or any the things of this life, as thereby to lose the more full and lasting pleasures of a future and better, and to be also in danger of torment: do I not again transgress the rules of comparison, and prefer a less pleasure to a greater, and a greater pain to a less? Is it any thing but the pleasures and joys of heaven that draws our wishes that way? for, if heaven and hell were to change conditions, and the torments of hell be in heaven, and the pleasures of heaven in hell, I would know if any would choose heaven, which now men do, as knowing that in a place of Gods continual presence (the Fountain and Authour of all good) the harm and torment of his Creature is not to be feared. Again, making good the object of our wills and appetites, and by good understanding eminency and beneficialness only, and not pleasure: how can the soveraign good of all men be the same, or they thought equally inclined to embrace it in respect of will? for since that kind of goodness must have mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and issue from the understanding, (as being properly the object thereof) how shall the end or soveraign good of wise men and fools be the same? No, they will plainly differ, both in degree and kinde: whereas now, by their joynt seeking pleasure, they differ not in regard of their end: For the Fool that fails either in the choice of the object, (whereout Pleasure was expected or fitness of the means to attain it, must be presumed to have as naturally and strongly coveted it as the wisest. So as not only the wisest and fools, but beasts and all Sensitives follow Pleasure as their common end: which, according to their utmost abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55976:21"/>
they necessarily covet, reason only making them differ in choice and pursuit. In which respect, although that addition to pleasure which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding must yield, from the contemplation of prudential choice or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery, may make wise mens pleasures more good; yet doth it not deny the other to be in degree good too, no more then the acknowledgement that full pleasure or acquiescence of mind, which is nowhere but in God to be had, as the only object that can fill both the Sensitive and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional appetite with full acquiescence as in its full and final object, doth deny every degree of pleasure and content to be in proportion good also.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of Honor.</head>
               <p>OUr discourse past was to prove mans end to be Pleasure; wherein we proceeded no further then in declaring that part of it which was not altogether proper to him as man, but as an individual Sensitive: But now, being to enter on the discourse of Society, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary we treat of the other part thereof, which is proper to him as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and intellectual agent, and doth arise from very Society it self; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as from company and converse with others, I come to affect and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to imitation; so again the desire to have my proficence therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, makes me for honor sake to affect Society and Company. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we may say that Honor, Estimation, Reputation, Pride, &amp;c. grow from without us, and do receive both their appearance and encrease through degrees of subordination: being (for the most part) the return of gratitude from Inferiours to Superiors. For, if all were equal, as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, outward honor or shame could not be, in comparison of one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now, as Superiors have high Power above those under them, so have they advantage of being pleasurable to them in their many senses; which because it cannot be from them adequately repaid in kind to him that hath but the sense of one person, therefore by the expressions of the Inferiors joy in possessing this benefit, he hath so lively a sense in his contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, that the joys of many come to be his. And hence is it, that it is a <hi>more blessed thing to give then to receive</hi>; and that not only in respect of God,<note place="margin">Acts 20.35.</note> who is the rewarder of charity, but also because there must be more joy in the pleasures of many, then one. Therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured must have two properties, Power and Goodness; answering two other relations in the honouring, Obedience and Gratitude. And yet Power seems but for Goodness sake; and when it is given by God or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is but in order to that. For as in God himself, the attribute of <hi>Optimus</hi> hath, by the consent of all People, been put before that of <hi>Maximus:</hi> so, in all offices of honor from him derived, Power is added but as a servant to that degree of beneficence wherein by their Places they are put to represent him, and act in his stead: after the same manner as the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55976:21"/>
means or instrument is in any thing a servant to the end. So that to make power alone the object of honor, is to make it the same with fear: and it is also to make it, not onely the same with obedience, but not to difference it, whether it be hearty or just, or not. For although to honor and to obey, do usually signifie the same, yet because the inferiour is alwayes in that kinde to honour his superiour, it is still with presupposition of the right and merit of the person commanding: else to obey the usurped power of a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although in a greater command, is not so much honour to him as it is to my Prince or father when I obey them in a less. And not so onely, but the several returns of our obedience, and acknowledgements to persons of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power are in degree more or less honourable in themselves, as the drift of that command is more or less meritorious. So that although some of the heathen, out of supposition of those many other benefits received, might, in complement or ignorance, forbear publickly to upbraid their own Gods with those scapes and faults acted by their power, yet doth the story of <hi>Pallas</hi> punishment of <hi>Arachne</hi> for pourtraying them, assure us that they thought meer power to be dishonourable when it had not goodness in design. Whereupon, it was their use to reverence and worship, as publike gods, those that had first been publike benefactors.</p>
               <p>Whilst a beneficial action is in intention and execution, it is merit; and when received it is duty: which do again differ in proportion, as the Courtesie and the freedom thereof do; that is, as the one is free and intentional in the gift, and as the other is so also in the return.</p>
               <p>When merit is assumed without sense of desert, it is pride, and when given without it, it is flattery: flattery being but the be-lying of our one sense to the honouring of another. And therefore, vulgar flattery is the basest, because they can be but little worthy: Whereas flatter God we cannot, because he deserves beyond any expression of ours.</p>
               <p>In this intercourse of obligation, between superiours and inferiors, a pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may seem implyed, and the benefit or courtesie to call for gratitude. If this gratitude come from a particular person, it is called thanks; if from many, applause; which when it is past present sense, and is a fruit of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is called honour.</p>
               <p>In the pleasure formerly spoken of, every mans own sense is judge; this is judged by the sense of others, for they had the benefit, and our pleasure is in the intellect; as being the reflex of theirs. And, as good and bad acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have the private testimony of the parties conscience, so have they also the publike attestation of the people, or those that receive them, called honor or shame.</p>
               <p>Without this way of being sensible of the pleasures of others, the rule of <hi>Do as thou wouldest be done unto,</hi> would not have its availe, for upholding the mutual benefit of one another in society. For since pleasure was our end, why should I labour the pleasure of others, if my self had no share therein? Therefore God, to provoke us to common preservation and good, imparts to us of this ability of being sensible of pleasure received by others: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as, for our individual preservation, he makes us apprehensive of pleasures proper to senses of our own, so hereby, for common preservation sake, he makes us sensible of the pleasures of others. When we assume this honour, and yet conscience consents not, it is (as aforesaid) pride. If we affect it to publike disturbance, it is ambition, vain-glory, &amp;c. Yet ambition seems to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55976:22"/>
regard the mark of it, to wit, publike imployment, but vain-glory and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause may rest in self-content.</p>
               <p>Honour arising from being beneficial to others, it must be more, as that is more true and general: and, being the reward that inferiors give to superiors, it is in the first place due to God, as obliging all creatures for all those pleasures they enjoy. Then, as it is to him onely due, so from him onely to be had; as being part of his right: and as from the abliest Judgeto value the deserts of others herein. For whilest it remaines in the peoples ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, it is like bullion: but when God or his Vicegerent have stampt it, the people know what quantity of respect or gratitude each honourable person must have. Else, as bullion, according to different esteems, would be valued by some more, by some less, (so that no use could be of it:) so honor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, without this coynage, would come at last to be quite deprived of its worth.</p>
               <p>They that placed mens felicity in good, vertue, and contemplation; might have regard to this intellectual pleasure: for if reason (through its confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the attainableness and lastingness of that object of pleasure which my appetite chooseth) hath made it good; the very use of this good, doth (through familiarity) insinuate it self, and so become pleasure also. So vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, that have political pleasure their end, or make way to their own, pleasure by promoting that of others; and contemplation, which hath pleasure of any kinde for its aime, do, from custome to attain pleasurable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, become the objects of pleasure themselves.</p>
               <p>This makes Religious and Civil duties to be performed with delight: no otherwise then as men used to hunting, do not onely place content in the end of it, namely the catching some creature for use or pleasure; but this very labour, exercise, and toile in catching it, comes to be pleasure it self: and the cry and barking of Dogs, comes to be like musick. Hence also it comes, that the covetous desire of riches, makes even those wayes to attain them to lose their usual relish of care and labour, and become content and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. According to the answer of a rich father, that being told (by way of reproof) of his sons whole delight in spending what with such great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction he had gotten; he answered, <q>He had more delight in getting, then his son could have in spending.</q> For pleasure that depends not on the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sense, but on the fancy, can have no judge but the fancy: and then, being made up of use and custome, pleasure must differ according thereunto: therefore that which is most honourable in estimation of others, is so with me. For as my sense cannot err in judging of things pleasurable to me, so cannot the opinion of others, in matters of opinion or knowledge of what themselves enjoy.</p>
               <p>So then, this estimation is either of things, or persons. As for things, all the rate they usually have, above necessary use, ariseth from hence: and they can be no otherwise rateable then by common esteem. But this common esteem arose at first from the particular esteem and use of them by persons of honor: which had also its encouragement from scarcity, whereby the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation might be more firme and entire. For as the honouring do (in outward regard) make and constitute the persons honourable; even so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the honourable persons make the honorable things.</p>
               <p>So that then, all pleasure may be comprehended under these two maine heads: that is, either pleasure of the sense, proper to the body; or of honour, proper to the minde. The last is the greater, and more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55976:22"/>
sought; as carrying with it the interpretation of vertue and merit, by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial actions to others; which the more communicable, the more good: and hath again degrees; according to the resentment of pleasure in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and according to the generality of that acknowledgement which gives it esteem. Whereas pleasure of sense, looking only at private satisfaction gives way to this; at least in publike competition hides it self: and is judged onely by the sense of the particular party, whether it be pleasure or no. Yet it seemeth that this pleasure of sense is more true, natural, and necessary. For first, the other, being founded but on opinion of others, hath not like evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to sense, which as more natural, is common to all men with other Sensitives: and is so necessary, that it is the promoter of all actions; nay of honor it self, if it be marked. For the reason why honor is had, or expected; is from knowledge, or opinion of something done beneficial to others; which benefit could not have been or perceived, but in such things as were pleasurably received elsewhere, even by testimony of sense. For so shall we finde the highest marks of honor, affixed to such as invented the means of mens living in greater security and delight: things which have respect to all.</p>
               <p>For should we make honor depending on it self onely, as of a race or stock (which we call Gentry) this is to countenance pride, and obstruct the way to vertue, by suffering such to assume honor, who will not go the way to it themselves; and do by possession of the reward, discourage such as would. Truly, to be of good parentage, is of great advantage and encouragement to vertue, but we see it ordinarily to fall out otherwise: and then, when the antiquity of Arms and true Discent, is all that can be bragged of, I would first ask, since these Arms are derived as from their Fathers, and so on from father to father, what assurance in such length of time, that no one of the Wives played not foul play? Which happening to any one, the advantage of blood is to all that follow. I will then again, (as in favour to their side) suppose those Arms they now bear, were not bought, or gotten by other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct course; but as a reward of some notable service to the Commonweal (or Prince, the life thereof,) were bestowed on their first Ancestor, to remain as in memory of this vertue to posterity. And then I shall ask, how they that come from his stock, and derive their honor as from him, can be more honorable then he; more then a stream, be greater then the fountain? If not, how is this usual brag of of antiquity? Again, if the fountain of their Gentry were the best man, though the first of his stock; they then plainly place true honor in vertue.</p>
               <p>It is therefore worthy notice, that since every thing is best preserved by the same means it was first begun, the best and onely way to keep up or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the reputation of their house, is in imitation, or increase of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors vertue: and native or hereditary honor, serves but as Ciphers in Arithmetick; that is, to add so much more honor or shame to all the parties actions, as his ranke gives him advantage of power above other men. Not but that honor is due to Nobility that have Offices by birth, as Dukes, Counts, &amp;c. for this being given to them by Kings, as to hereditary Officers in such places, which always make them publikely honorable (as having thereby power and designation of serving the Commonweal above others,) remains due to such. Else, the honor of a race is but nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: that is, absence of the shame of ignominious birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:55976:23"/>Whereupon it may appear, that honor is gained by advancing sensitive pleasure; and honor being the end, is more worthy then pleasure that is the means. For so usually, the forbearance of the parties own pleasure in private enjoyments, is made the way of getting and increasing honor. For if naturally and ordinarily, there were more pleasure or self-benefit, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the act whereout honor is sought, then in the contrary, what thanks or honor can be due? In which case, honor is plainly preferred to the sensitive pleasure of my particular. And honor (for the most part) is difficultly attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and the other is in custom varied. And on the other side, they that have this sensible pleasure, lose no honor thereby: and perhaps at another time, may gain honor by like means: so that neither then, did they prefer sensitive plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to honor, and now they plainly put honor before it. That is, they do on both hands prefer the gain of some honor, to the loss of some pleasure: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though none would prefer a continual torment to a continual shame. It faring in this case between the comparison of pleasure and honor, as between meat and mony: for although each man is ready to spare and abate of his diet to advance his estate, yet would none choose to be rather wholly deprived of the sure and natural way of sustentation by food, then of the artificial way of doing it by mony.</p>
               <p>So that, honor seems the onely reward to vertue. For as nature, by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive pleasure, stirs us up to beneficial things to our own behoofs, so the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick pleasure of honor, to what is good for others. For the pleasure or suffering of others, being not perceptible by my bodily sense, how should I else be provoked, if this politick sense of shame and reward had not been (as aforesaid) entertained? whereby, (still retaining my natural appetite of self-seeking) I covet, and promote mine own pleasure, by advancing that of others.</p>
               <p>And this appetite of honor seems natural also: for beasts and children have some sense thereof: but this is as far as they are sociable, and have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on. For though children, in their sports, make preheminence or honor their end, it is not till they come to some ripeness: but then, honor being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due where vertue or beneficial actions did precede; and children having no knowledge of them, how should honor be due to them? so that then it is not honor, but pride.</p>
               <p>And then, by the same rule, as none know good and vertue perfectly, it will fall out that all men are both comparatively honorable, or proud one to another: and that none but God can be truely honorable. For in men, honor is so far from being estranged from pride, that pride is its usual parent: &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable things and actions, please us but in reference to publication; which may be then termed ostentation. And so, it fareth also in matters of shame: for we blush not when faults are spoken of in such company, where we think they suspect us not guilty of them: nor blush we when we are alone, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately thinking on the same, or other things which we are guilty of: and again are ready to blush, though not guilty, if we think the present company su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and observe us as guilty.</p>
               <p>Honor being thus made the mark and reward of vertuous and beneficial actions, we need not wonder at the esteem of it amongst men: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the great strife amongst us, for the having all kinds of things plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable and beneficial in our power: insomuch, as the poorest vassal in the world cannot be so far destitute of this appetite, as not always to covet, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55976:23"/>sometimes to presume, he hath laid an obligation: whereby some honor, (at least in the lowest degree (thanks) seems to him due. And hence (on the other side) it is, that Soveraigns themselves, are so jealous of powers under them, to eclipse obligations. For honor being, in a manner, all that subjects can give him, he cannot but be herein very tender. And truely, man is in nothing brought neerer to resemble his Maker (whose glory and praise was the end of all he did) nor in any thing so truely differenced and exalted above beasts, (being in pleasure of sense ready to equal him) then in this appetite.</p>
               <p>But we must take heed of the extreams thereof, Pride and Ambition; that seek it without desert, or order: the one, as slothful, and the other, as restless, deserving it not. For as it is necessary only to Deity to be unlimited in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and consequently to have all obligations due; so, to other creatures this omnipotency being denyed, their merit in honor can but rise according to that limited power their species is naturally bounded with. So that for any to attempt to <hi>ascend, and be like the most High</hi> in power, will prove their weakness and fall: as to that first man it was, who would be like him in knowledge.</p>
               <p>As thus in nature and the course of providence, so in policy also, (where it is by Law and rule set down how each one shall be serviceable to another, and which doth limit a degree of obligation, by limiting their powers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ranks and callings) the same rule of moderation must take place. We may hereupon define true honor, to consist in the ful discharge of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial duties belonging to each mans rank or place. For, if he do assume till this be done, it is arrogance and pride; and, if he seek honor by gaining power beyond political limits, it is ambition. And hence it is, that ambition is one leading cause in all publike disturbance and rebellion. For so glorious a thing, it seems, to have power to lay general obligations, that finding it no otherwise attainable, but by seising on that power which now hinders; I am provoked to use all the means I can thereunto: and although the same good I now seek to do, be already done by others, yet my restless desire of estimation will not let me alone; till by engrossing all power, I shall be able to merit all obligation. And nothing in a Kingdom can be more dangerous then this affected popularity: for it puts all in disorder, by its unorderly proceeding in the search of honor. For (as beforesaid) all honor is Gods right, whether you take him as the universal Author of all benefits, or whether you take it as the onely thing inferiours (as such) have power to bestow: in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects it is to him in the first place due; as by way of gratitude for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, so by way of submission to his power, and therefore we shall finde, that, in Scripture phrase, to honor, and to obey, signifie usually the same.</p>
               <p>And, as to God primarily, so to others, according to the trust and charge he allows them (to be more or less publikely serviceable) honor (as derived from him) must be holden and acknowledged: so that whatever benefit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by our means receive, and do therefore acknowledge obligation, we must take heed we forget not (like <hi>Herod</hi>) the true Author of this power, in assuming it wholly to our selves.</p>
               <p>Amongst the persons by God trusted with charge for beneficial actions, the chief are Kings: for these, in their several Dominions, are, as (under him) fountains of power, so of honor also. For they, (in Gods stead) are the onely able and authorized Judges, of the reality and generallity of publike benefits: insomuch, as if receivers should be sole Judges, they (as parties)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55976:24"/>
would but regard their own satisfactions onely; and call that publike, which was but private benefit. For these are subject both to flatter and mistake: but he, having the publike in his peculiar trust, and looking on all with like interest, can, as the representative whole or common Sensory, best and most impartially judge of common utilities: and to him onely it must therefore belong to confer honor, and the marks thereof: for else, while ambitious and proud persons, were seeking and arrogating as they like, true honor would not be: and while people did, through continual strife and slaughter of one another, set up such as should be still undertaking their greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, they should lose (as in the Fable) their bone for a shadow.</p>
               <p>We must therefore (as before said) reckon honor as it is in the subjects or people, but as Bullion; of no use to them, nor to those that have it: and that the value of it must be according to the coynage of that Prince whose image and authority it bears.</p>
               <p>Hence we may observe, that in Republikes, and where Monarchies are not, setled honors are not neither. For there is onely applause, estimation, or the like momentany and uncertain shadows: because with them, honoring and honored are the same in degree; &amp; honor signifying pre-excellence, must needs be to none, when it is equal to all; or at least equally divided amongst so many. And then, how shall they confer on others, what they have not themselves?</p>
               <p>And, as upon this ground, honor can be onely in Monarchy, so must it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so follow (from what hath hitherto been spoken) that it must therein also flow from him to the people, and not from the people to him, as some would construe that maxime, That honor is in the honoring, and not in the honored. For since (as before noted) the honorable or beneficial act, must precede the honor or thanks thereof, as the cause must precede the effect; even so, the honorable person (which must again precede as the cause of that act) must also much more precede, and be the cause of the honor that follows thereupon.</p>
               <p>And in this respect, the subjects or people are so far from being originals of honor, that they can therein (at most) but carry the force of an Eccho, in the return and report of that voice or rate of honor which must come from above: to wit, from God, or such as from him have benefits to give. As for example,<note place="margin">1 King. 1.39.</note> when <hi>all the people said, God save King Solomon</hi>; as they could not be understood thereby radically and primarily to confer the Office and power it self, so neither to be fountains and originals of the honor then given: but the power and pleasure of <hi>David,</hi> testified by the presence of his own servants, and other attestations of his approbation and assent, must be looked upon as efficient causes of this honor; and the people but as subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient and instrumental therein. Even as also that honor which <hi>Mordecai</hi> received by being brought on horse back through the street of the City, was originally to be ascribed to <hi>Abasuerus</hi> that had commanded it to be so done to <hi>the man whom the King would honor:</hi> and,<note place="margin">Esther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.9.</note> in testimony that this honor was derived from, and authorized by him the fountain of honor, and that the people were but to be the reporters and publishers thereof, had also commanded him to be attended with some of his own royal retinue, and some ensigns of honor and estate proper to himself.</p>
               <p>And as thus, the honorable must precede the honoring in time: so must they in dignity too, as the cause doth the effect. For although (as to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55976:24"/>
present act wherein the cause and the effect stand as relatives) they are alike in time, and constitute equally one another, as all Relatives do, (so that one cannot (as to that relation) be set or substracted, without establishment or overthrow of the other:) yet, if we measure excellency by that power, vertue, and force, whereby any act is maintained between two relatives, we may well, in that regard, account the Agent before the Patient: even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was first, and more eminent in the action by which the relation was effected: as the father is before, and more excellent then the son, although (as to the relation it self,) he was not a father till he had a son.</p>
               <p>So in Monarchy, although there cannot be a King till there be Subjects, because (as they stand in the relation of governour and governed) one must constitute another; yet because, even in that very act of Government, the Monarch or King must (as the Agent) precede both in time and dignity any vertue or worth that can come from the subjects, he must be accounted ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the power thereto belonging; and not they, who can be onely pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; and that (at most) in proportion answerable to the power of him that rules. For if his power and force therein be never so little; yet cannot they in their relation of obedience exceed it: whereas they may very often be defective, in the ability of their performance of what he doth command. Whereupon, as the command must precede the execution, so must the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander precede the commanded, both in time and dignity; even so far, as to be the constitutive and efficient cause thereof; that is, as to the whole rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; although, in the single and separate acts, they may stand reciprocally and equally constituted.</p>
               <p>Nay, although, in respect of each single act, honor may be said to be in the honoring first, as the ball projected (for the rebound sake) must (as to that rebound) proceed from the place it was thrown against, before it can come to the projectors self; yet, because this rebound took beginning from the ability and intention of the projector, even as the honorable act did at first, from the honored person, we must therefore confess, the honored to be the original of the honor thence arising; and not they that are passive. For so far as the peoples honor shall proceed without, or beyond considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of approved desert, so far it is flattery, and not honor.</p>
               <p>And therefore, upon the same reason that the Creator may be said to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Creature, (even in that very work of Creation) although he were not (as to that relation) Creator till there were a Creature: and as again, the Father doth precede in time and dignity the son, (even in reference to that very constitution of sonship) although he were not a Father till he had a son: so (for conclusion) the Monarch and Governor, is so far from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his essential honor and power from the subjects and governed, as he may (on the otherside) be accounted constitutive of them; even in that very relation: and must (however) be acknowledged the Author of that honor that ariseth from the work it self: which, as it had issue according to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Agent, so must the power thereof be ascribed unto him; and so from him to God above, who is the fountain of all power and beneficial acts: and not to the people below; who are onely passive and receivers. Of whose farther care and power over us in this act of Government we shall next treate, by discoursing of his Laws sent amongst us, for conferring this honor on persons here below: whereby we might be enabled to prevent those inconveniences in Society which the private and unlimitted seeking our own ends, (hitherto spoken of) might else prodduce.</p>

               <head>CHAP VII. Of the Laws of God leading to Government.</head>
               <p>THe dignity of man above other Creatures we have heretofore in part touched; as also, why (thereupon) a greater care should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his preservation: and therefore, lest a matter of so high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern should be left unto so slender protection and guidance as that of his own reason, God himself hath furnished him with Precepts and Laws from above for his direction: Religion being nothing else but Gods supply of natures light for our good; or an expression of Gods love and Charity to us, by directing us how to be charitable one towards another.</p>
               <p>And, to divide the Law of Nature, from having the same end with that of Religion, is to divide the Author, and set him against himself. For although, to strengthen the observation of his Laws (in regard of his known power, and our necessary dependance upon him) he doth accept and call for our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance as a service to himself; yet, I see not how any can, without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his al-sufficiency, think Gods condition thereby any ways bettered. But in these performances, we are to consider that saying of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job, Can a man be profitable to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 22.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>as he that is wise may be profitable to himself: is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous, or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy way perfect?</hi> No, we must (with the most Religious King,) believe and confess, that <hi>our goodness extendeth not to him, but to the Saints that are on earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 16.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and such as excel in vertue:</hi> that is to say, to such as live in society with us: which sociable living is inclusive of all vertue. And although it is a Saint-like quality to be conversant in vertuous and benificent actions, and to be obedient unto the good Laws of God; yet is the good of keeping them their benefit onely whom we converse with on earth, and not directly his.<note place="margin">Job 38</note> And therefore Charity is the end of the Law, and also of those many other precepts set down in holy writ; as to diligent enquiry may easily appear: and the injuries to our neighbor, are reckoned in the Scriptures as sins against God. But to make things a little more plain by instance, we will make some observation upon the Decalogue it self:<note place="margin">Lev. 6.2, 3, &amp;c.</note> as the head and ground of the rest.</p>
               <p>The value and credit of all things, and particularly of Laws, must arise in our esteem, either as they are apprehended by our own reason available for our good; or else they must have the known testimony of such an Author, whose wisdom and love towards us may no ways be questioned. But, in this case, for one man (without farther authority) to impose upon another, with what reason shall he expect success? for being but my equal in nature, how shall I know him my superior in wisdom? Because (in respect of will) we being all equally enclined to seek good and avoid evil, and each one doing it to himself in the first place; I have (no doubt) in that regard, reason to prefer my own wish or inclination before that of others.</p>
               <p>And then also, although the will cannot fail in the constant choice of good, yet it being dependent on the guidance of the understanding, according to the strength or weakness thereof, it attains what is really so, or is beguiled
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55976:25"/>
with appearances: yet it will fall out, that these appearances shall have equal credit with that which is real and more beneficial. For, be the measure of my understanding never so small and weak, yet it being all I have, and in me the supream and onely judicatory; how shall I judge the insufficiency thereof? For, if we should have in us one understanding above another to be judge thereunto; we should again need another understanding, to give testimony and direction to that: nor could we herein come to any pause. And then farther, although error commonly happen for want of true indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and sufficient enquiry into the particulars, out of which our conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are, or ought to be framed; yet when education, or other prejudice hath so far forestalled my judgement, as already to fill and settle it; it is almost bootless for any then to perswade me to new enquiry: it being, but is as if you should wish me to believe, that my desire of my own good hath been so weak, that competent care and pains hath not been taken therein: or in effect to entreat me to believe, another loves it more then my self.</p>
               <p>Add to this, that since the general acknowledgement of mans excellency above other creatures, and of one man above another, is chiefly accounted in respect of understanding; therefore, for me to acknowledge any insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency herein, cannot be expected: as concluding too much to mine own shame. Whereupon, we may see how scornfully the name of Fool is taken, even by them that are most so: for first, how should he know it, and then how should he like it? And when men are heard to confess their insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in respect of others, it is for the most part fained, and in complement to them: thinking to commend and advance their sufficiency by their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Or if it be real, it is in such and such particulars, wherein themselves have not put forth with like endeavors; as our ready and common excuses for all sorts of failings may witness. Which is so far from acknowledging any comparative insufficiency, as my being confident, that if my self had bestowed equal pains, I should therein have excelled; it will argue my pride rather then submission. And even in practical arts and operations, where sense can be judge of present good and bad, how partial are we to conclude for our selves? Or when the effect makes it too apparent against us, we lay not the fault on want of inward sufficiency or understanding: but on some corporal, or external wants and impediments.</p>
               <p>All which doth plainly discover the difficulty, if not impossibility, of one mans submission to the guidance of another. And especially in matters of speculation, this stubborness doth arise: for so we finde in matters of Religion, which all men look upon with like interest and concern, and consequently concluding that they have therein taken the directest course; each on becomes so inflexible, that no re-examination will be admitted.</p>
               <p>And to come to our purpose, for making and entertaining of laws for all men to live by: if they be such as have that proportion and agreement with my reason, as it can discern their goodness, I shall then for their own, and not for their authors sake accept them. But what law can be so framed as to finde universal acceptance: or if some could, yet, so many as (for number and use) are fit for the goverment of whole nations in all kinds (amidst so great variety) what agreement can be hoped for in their receipt? Are not men usually in this case found rather inclinable to rules of their own invention, then obedient to the directions of others? Who till they are by some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55976:26"/>
natural power differenced, must be presumed in command but equal: and in that respect, want that authority which is unto all Law-makers requisite. And hence it is, that the most famous founders of Common weals, have still avouched a God for their Author.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, since the force of law, must depend on the authority of the Maker: and that, according to our belief of his sufficiency in himself, and interest in us, our obedience to his commands will proceed; it pleased our All-seeing God in the first Table to settle our reverence and attention to himself: <hi>He first tells us he is God, and that we must have none but him:</hi> for untill we be brought from the condition of Athiesm, what authority can precepts from Divinity have?<note place="margin">Exod. 20.2, 3.</note> or if other Deities, should have equal or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place in our esteem then him, our obedience to his commands would not proceed with due readiness.</p>
               <p>And secondly, <hi>By denying us the making of Images</hi> (the usual expression of other Deities) he doth remove a great bait to this alienation of minde,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.4.</note> both to them, and also the fear of placing our devotions on Creatures or second causes: whereby (in regard of their unworthiness to him) having his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and authority (by their means) lessened in our sight, our observance to his laws would necessarily fall.</p>
               <p>And as his credit should not be impaired by mingling, so neither by perjury nor by common and unnecessary discourse of him, as of a person of ordinary esteem: therefore thirdly, under the prohibition, <hi>Of taking of his name in vain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20.7.</note> our highest respect to his honour is challenged: upon which the more due observation of his laws will follow. And as this duty of reverential o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is in Scripture commonly known by the name of fear. So to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it, and draw on the peoples obedience the better, God in giving these fundamental Laws, appears more plainly and majestically, then ever before or since: himself then talking with them from heaven, <hi>That his fear might be before their faces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that they sin not</hi>: that is, break not his laws.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, knowing the weakness of our capacities, in conceit &amp; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of things so sublime; and that by practice and iteration, we are best wonn to approve &amp; keep these things in our mind; he appointed a seventh part of our time to be kept holy to that purpose. In which last command that seems most strictly enjoyned, yet we may observe him to point out, that the end of all laws was more ours then his service:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.8.</note> and therfore he indulgeth, not only the cure, and other necessary works for the good &amp; safety of men, but the pulling of an Ox or Ass out of the pit: our Saviour concluding in this command, as in behalf of all others,<note place="margin">Mark. 2.27.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God having thus given fit and sufficient rules, for fastning his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in our belief, he comes to those main precepts which establish our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and mutual peace: and begins with the foundation of society and government, to wit, obedience to superiours: and that under the notion of the most common and unquestionable relation of that kinde, which is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentall.<note place="margin">Exod. 20.12.</note> For should he have setled obedience under any other relation, it could not have been so universally known and binding: because all could not be wives, nor servants; so as the authorities of husbands and masters, might be universally inclusive. Nor could all yet be subjects; inasmuch as there were yet many Independent families, not grown so great, as that the Master should take on him the title of King: and particularly the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were yet such. It was therefore under this notion, the straightest and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55976:26"/>
most universal obligation to obedience, because none could be exempt: inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as having every one fathers and mothers of their own, they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as under the notion of an officer of power, also enjoyned to obedience to the publike father of their country. And therefore, the observation of this precept being so necessary, it is observed to be <hi>the first commandment with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>: and the end and benefit of it is plainly annexed,<note place="margin">Epes. 6.2. Exod. 10.12.</note> 
                  <hi>That our dayes may be long in the land.</hi> For if (slighting the honor and respect due to them and their commands) we trust to our private Rules and Wills for publike guidance, what will follow but civil discention, blood, and slaughter? which in the sixth and next command, he expresly forbids, saying,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> a crime so foul, that nothing but the life of the offender can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it.</p>
               <p>And then seventhly, To prevent occasions of quarrel and murther, most commonly arising about propriety; he, by saying,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi> removes it in the chief rise thereof, our wives and posterity. For to what other use (almost) labour we the possession of all other things, but to furnish and transmit unto them? but if my issue be not mine, or uncertain, with what heart shall I bestow labour for them? And then, if this parental love and care shall cease, shall not nature and providence want one of her maine supports: whilst these younglings, unable to provide for, or help themselves, are left in danger of perishing. Again, suppose them all brought up, yet when with the strength of body, the knowledge of their different be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettings doth come to appear; what will follow but scorns, derisions, and slaughters? Therefore, as marriage was to be a means to unite families one to another (and was therefore forbidden in the same kindred, as having this union already made) so doth the due observation of wedlock (especially on the womans part) unite each family in it self: and is the most excellent means to peace and agreement: Whereas, adultery administers occasions of quarrels of parents and families one with another, and of the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in it self. And therefore we finde, however tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, Having given us such commands as will cut off the chief branches of our quarrels, he now by saying, <hi>Thou shalt not covet,</hi> kills them in the root. For because I cannot commit external upon another,<note place="margin">Verse. 17.</note> but what I had first approved and contrived in my self: even so, if I had not first (by covetous desire) invaded my neighbours property in my thoughts, I should not have attempted his disseisin by act or force; which force will then occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion resistance, resistance quarrel, and quarrel death. And this death being against the whole course and rule of Gods providence; <hi>Multiply, increase,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and replenish the earth</hi>; and in the noblest race of his Creatures, man; we may see plain reason why God should be so careful in giving these and other Rules for our preservation: and why (to enforce those Rules the better) he should be so express and careful of his own honour and service, as their ground and foundation.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the Moral Law, and Old Testament look this way onely, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55976:27"/>
Gospel-Precepts (by comparing those cardinal vertues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and giving to Charity the precedence (as their end) do teach us the same thing also. For though Faith was enjoyned in the first place, it was not for its pre-excellence; but because, as my belief of Deity, or hope of Heaven stands in measure and degree, increased or remitted: so (in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) my practice in Precepts of Charity will follow. Which vertue of Charity, being the end thereof, and the true substance of al other Graces; they without it come to be reckoned but as <hi>sounding brass, and tinkling Cymballs.</hi> For as we before shewed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1.</note> that Gods glory is the end of all things, and of man more especially; so we must (according to the precepts and rules of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) take care of the life and welfare of our neighbor, as we tender in any sort the glory and service of God: And, to the end this peace and safety may be the better acquired, submit to the authority of such as have the soveraignty and command over us: which shall now be our next dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Master of the Family.</head>
               <p>THe discourses hitherto, have been to shew the end of Government, which is Peace; and the foundation of it, unity and subjection; and the tye and Authority for both, which is Religion. For without this, how could Nature have set one man above another? And if reason (groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on such agreement and consent as before supposed) should have done it, yet what Obligation for continuance, longer then the same reason of respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive good that set them up, should in the same measure make it reasonable for continuance? For the same natural tye of self-seeking, that caused men to submit at one time, would be as available and just, for them to take contrary course at another: nor could Contract or Paction be then in force, because a stronger Obligation then seeking our own, could not be had. Therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fear of an irresistable Power for punishing this breach was added, that first conceit of mine own particular benefit, which caused me to make my promise, would also warrant me (if I saw cause) to break it. Nor can fear of punishment, from those to whom I submitted; or fear of suffering my self by consequent or example from others, prevail otherwise, then as in my apprehension over-poyzing that benefit I expect: which, if yet by force, fraud, faction, or other practice, I can secure my self against, and avoid; the best course for my self, is the most justifiable. And, until a positive Law comes from God to state and make sin, sin there cannot be: but folly there may be, and is, if through neglect or weakness, I stray from Nature, and prefer anothers benefit to mine own, by any tye above self-consideration. For Man, considered in meer Nature, must be presumed as inculpable in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of his desires, and remove of obstacles, as all things else; though like them, it should extend to the death of the Oponent. For that which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the end, warrants the means; and except the difference be made else
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55976:27"/>
how, be they greater or less, they are equally allowable. And till Religion be, Conscience or fear of guilt, cannot be. Therefore we may see just cause, that God himself should come in with his Commands amongst us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn us so often to make him our onely fear: for Precepts or Religion, as they give us great light what to do in policy, so are they the onely strong Obligations to make it valid. Because from hence it comes to pass, that men considered in Nature as self-seekers onely, and thereby destructive to one another; are now by policy made to do the same still; and therewith to promote that good of others also: so that whilst it is impossible (without Natures subversion) but for individuals (as such) to minde their own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit onely; they have now, their hopes and fears (arising out of all things to be done or omitted in their power) so increased by promises and threats an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to divine Precepts; that the guidance of divine light, and not of our own, must be the choice of our reasonable Will. Therefore if I do injure or do not love my neighbour as my self, as God Commands, I do thereby not love my self as Nature enjoyns; and do, in committing sin against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, commit also folly against Reason; by so much injuring my self.</p>
               <p>And so again, for keeping Commerce and Society: <hi>He that sweareth to his neighbour and disappointeth him not, though it be to his hinderance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4.</note> shall have the greatest of rewards. And so further, for honoring and obeying of Parents and Princes, how many are the rewards and threats running that way? So that, should we not by natural Reason, be led to see and follow those our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, arising by obedience to those politick Governments; yet, out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural prudence; when such large good or evil, to fall on our particulars is annexed, we cannot without self-prejudice refuse. And therefore, being now come to set these Monarchies on their true foundations, we will speak more particularly of their Powers and Jurisdictions: beginning with the Father of the Family; who, in his less Territory is a little Prince, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Master of a greater Family.</p>
               <p>In the treating of this Oeconomical policy, it is not to be expected that I should in this place descend to particulars so far, as to set out the respective duties of all the Members of the Family one to another, more then I do in Kingdoms; but onely to set out the power of the Governor thereof, and the grounds of the others obedience: and that, upon the like grounds of Reason and Scripture as I do in the other. So that in the confirmation of the power of this Master, whereby Children and Servants <hi>were to obey in all things,</hi> we finde in holy Writ those many Precepts for perfect obedience:<note place="margin">Col. 3.20, 22.</note> and that <hi>Abraham</hi> had it as well in his power as duty, <hi>to command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and houshold, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do judgement and justice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> Where, by Judgement and Justice, we must suppose the Power of life and death meant and included: as other Nations have formerly granted it to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also. According to which power, formerly given, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5. we finde <hi>Judah</hi> sentencing his daughter-in-Law, to be burnt upon suspicion of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which he did, both as Father to his own Family, and also by the Prerogative of Elder Brother; as being every mans Brother in his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. By which power he afterwards again acquitted her, knowing himself <hi>to be the man</hi> involved in equal guilt: even as the adopted elder Brother <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> did afterwards upon like occasion. Therefore for <hi>Abraham</hi> to have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his son, was not to have exceeded his rightful power: for had it so been, God would not have commanded; and <hi>Abraham</hi> not knowing any intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diverting him, might have bogled at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:55976:28"/>But for more full explanation why one person and no more should have power in each Family (the reasons being the same) shall be discoursed in the title of Soveraignty, and other places of Government Monarchical. For this Dominion being scarce anywhere absolute in that relation, but all Families being included in other Soveraignties, the duties of those subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thereunto cannot be determined otherwise, then by saying they owe their obedience to him in all things, not prohibited by such as are superior unto them both.</p>
               <p>Against those that make the institution of the family, the eldest (as fitting best that ancient thinness of people) we shall not contend much: though we might instance in the Government of God himself; and that of <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel among the good, and of the devil (as Prince) among the bad: as also that <hi>Adam</hi> (before he had family) was by God made Monarch of all Creatures below; and of <hi>Eve</hi> also. But for answer to such as hold it barely natural, or at least more natural or reasonable then that of Kings; I shall first say, That if by most natural they mean that practice which is common to men and sensitives also, they shall finde the contrary in many instances. For when there is any association of Birds, Beasts, or Fishes, it is always under one remarkable Commander of that Flock, Herd, or Shoal. And as for that Government of Family, it is among none of them; nor can be: for except some sorts of Fowl, they have not their proper Females, and so must want the propriety of the young, whereby to make their family. And Fowl we see, as soon as their brood can flye, beat off them, and part with one another; all becoming strangers. And from the coupling and payring of the Fowle, we cannot conclude for marriage: unless therewith, we say, that the having more then one wife is unnatural.</p>
               <p>And then, for the natural subjection of the females, many kindes of them speak the contrary. Insomuch as the designation of number, and the power over Wives, is not natural and constant, but political and differing. And as for the Males equal care of the yong ones nurture (practised in some Fowl) it ariseth from his extraordinary assurance of propriety in the brood: for from the time of their first congression, to her hatching, he is never so absent from his Hen, as to endanger his jealousie. Yet all those Cocks that have more Hens then one, though there be no other Cock in the company to cause su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition, beat and hate the young. And then, as for the way of being a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant appropriate to one another in any sort, no Creature knows it.</p>
               <p>Come we now to men; we hear of Nations practising, and some men of reputation propounding the natural community of Wives, and so overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Families: both which do yet entertain Monarchy. The like we may say of the Amazons, who have no Families, and yet have Monarchy.</p>
               <p>But now, if by saying the Government of a Family under one head is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, they mean thereby reasonable, we agree; and that for the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and hereafter to be given; namely for unity of Government in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths: which Reasons are most of them so agreeing to both, that they shall not need recital. And truly, when I have impartially considered, how both of them have foundation from Divine Authority and political pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I can lay the mistake of this partiality onely to this; that such as write hereof, are usually themselves Fathers of Children, Masters of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or Husbands, or likely to be so; and then, to strengthen the duties of all those relations (as in order to themselves) we may finde good reason.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55976:28"/>
And therefore are not onely all those Texts of Scripture looking that way, taken in, without any to oppose them; but Nature is also brought as its first groundwork; so confidently, that one would think God Almighty might have spared his Precepts. But, on the other side. Kings are not themselves writers: and if they did (as in justification of their own Power, and subjects Duty) it would be called partiality; because so many have interest against him. And if any of the Subjects, out of Conscience of Truth, and for the subjects good too, (if they well considered it) write in defence of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and its power, (not onely such as have prejudice, by being under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forms, but) other subjects also, that have all of them their particular interests and hopes (by encrease of liberty) will accuse him of flattery. For a Monarch is a head above them, and so remains the object of continual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and trouble, as eclipsing them all: which if away, they in democratick equalities (if some of them be not more ambitious) might be all Monarchs; both absolute over their own families, and, as they could make faction over others also: whereas now, they of their family and others may appeale in case of oppression.</p>
               <p>Another prejudice against Monarchs is, for that their subjects being nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they must trust the guidance of them in many things to others: against whose pride (as knowing them to be but their fellow subjects) the repine is greater, then if the Prince (as the Master) should act himself: all whose miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages comes ever to be laid to the fault of the Government it self, by such as would be rid of it. Which unjust censures or revilings come again through secresie of offendors (amongst a multitude) or through multitude of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (as considered in themselves) to be unespied or unpunished by the Prince: whereas the paucity in the Family enables the Master to act by his own knowledge, and quickly to discover complaints: which you may well think, he will (for his credit sake) by power or craft smother: at least you may think, that if he do write or speak of the Masters duty, it shall not be in a language as to involve or tax himself.</p>
               <p>As thus in Government of persons, so in matter of propriety, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great prejudice arising to the Monarch above the Master of the Family: and that from the same inconvenience in number of subjects also. Which is, that the Master (in regard of his smaller charge) can hold all the distributions of his fortune, (that are alotted to the trust of sons or servants) so within the verge of his own knowledge and account, that he need not grant so high proprieties as the Prince must; whereby to cause grumbling, when any part shall be recalled.</p>
               <p>But however, their disagreement is but accidental: and that, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of number, or in regard of subjection. For the first respect (as aforesaid) may make them differ in their manner of exercise and managery of power, and in the latter they must differ in the measure: because Families are usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded under other Governments; and so the Master is tyed by the Laws of the same from exercising Arbitrary power. Yet they agree in institution: both of them having absolute power of Government from God. For the Prince by his Laws cannot be said to give the power of Master, but rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as he thinks good: because the whole Family, and each one in it, must be looked on as subjects to him, as well as the Master. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Families as now they stand under other Governments streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in power, may be called politick Governments for the education of children chiefly. And therefore why other Creatures have it not,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55976:29"/>
is because they are not onely less considerable, but also for that their young are so soon able to shift for themselves: which women could not throughly do between childe and childe, if this divine political institution of marriage, had not been to engage the man also. And yet, though marriage (or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the propriety of wives) and also their subjection be from Divine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive law, yet I finde not but the quantity of that subjection, and number of wives, is at the dispose of the higher power: and where none is, at the husbands.</p>
               <p>But let us go on, to examine the particulars of a Family, how they stand in nature. First, the foundation of the Family is in the wife. Now all say marriage is not natural: but that propriety of wives, was one of the first po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive precepts: when yet there was but one man and one woman; and they could not have choice. Now in nature, children are the mothers, as amongst all other Creatures, the young belong to the female, and to the male onely as having propriety in the female. If it be said man hath power na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural over the woman, as the male of other things hath over the female: this is indeed natural, for the stronger to rule the weaker, and not proper to the sex: for such females as are stronger then males (as in some Creatures it chanceth) rule them too: and for ought this imports, a strong wife may govern a weak husband, as the Nation of <hi>Amazons</hi> do practice. But what is this to the ruling of women in general; or to having of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wives?</p>
               <p>Now suppose the power of the father derive it self from having it over the wife, and so naturally governing as in her right; then the question will be, How long, and till what age this power shall last? And what Creatures example they will follow therein? If they say it is at the parents dispose: this is still indeed the arbitrary government of the stronger over the weaker: and unless they claim the just authority of Gods precepts, nature gives them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle other right.</p>
               <p>I but (you will say) the childe is bound to the father, in so high an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gratitude as he can never requite. But not bound to him (I hope) till he know him. Well, but suppose he is first to take his mothers word for that; then we are to suppose again, that as his mother hath (during his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy) natural power over him, so hath she (with her self) resigned this power to her husband. In this case, we must consider, that gratitude is a free and intended return for a benefit, which in the receivers apprehension was freely intended. For if the giver were not free from constraint else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in what he did, or else did it according to paction with the relative party; in the first case it obligeth not, and in the second but as other pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do. But if it be free, without indenting for return (such as we call a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity) then is the obliged as free in measuring and proportioning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as the obliger was in bestowing the benefits: and the Agents in both kinds must be reciprocally Judges. For although a courtesie (as in reference to the good of Society) may imply a secret paction for return, yet it differs much from a true paction. First in that pactions have their returns exprest: and next that a third superior party is called to see performance: but in gratituties, as the Donor could be alone judge of the benefit intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so the grateful of the measure of benefit received, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what return is most proportionable; both to his present power, and that receit also. And if you put it in the obligers power, to demand
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55976:29"/>
return according as he shall say his intentions were, you will at last leave no steady place, or measure for return or obligation at all.</p>
               <p>Children (while little) can neither apprehend benefit, nor make return: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you will say that the sport of the childe is return; as acceptance from the loved, is requital to the loving: for men are not alwayes traders in what they do; but the pleasure of doing is many times the cause of doing. If this be the case (as having parents provoked by the affection of propriety, and pleasure of doing) they lay no obligation beyond self respect: at least, until the childe be of such yeers, as to be able to discover and value truely the benefit received, his return cannot be expected: which can then onely be what he thinks good; except Gods positive precepts strengthen his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude beyond nature. But since this obligation of the childes is first placed for his generation, and then for his education, we will a little enquire into both, and will begin with that of generation.</p>
               <p>In this, man must be considered (like other males) as prompted by natural appetite, with no farther direct intention of laying an obligation on provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for continuance of his kinde, then when the like appetite, causing him to eat or sleep, he thinks expresly on preservation of his individual. And, if the behaviour of the males be well marked after this meeting, they will sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be found in any glorying or exulting humor, as confident of good done: but rather shame and reluctance. And again, what shall we think of those, that through poverty or other considerations, might be unwilling to have been the parents of children at all? So, for the woman or female again, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she (besides her share in generation) ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of her own substance imployed in nourishment of the young whilst it is within her (and passeth her time in bearing, not in pleasure, but mostly in affliction) yet, since nothing of it is voluntary, it remembers me of an undutiful, but pertinent answer of one (that was reproved as unnatural for slighting his mother) which was, <q>That she got him for her pleasure, and brought him forth for her ease.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But now you will say, that nurture and education after birth is voluntary, and so obligatory. And truely so say I too; because in nature (as to her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) it is in the mothers power to expose it if she will: yet it is not so in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for direct precept obligeth the parents to nurture and education of them, thereby proving the duty more positive then natural.</p>
               <p>And then, what shall we say of children as they are usually nursed else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? what shall their duty go to the nurse? No (you will say) the nurse is paid by the parent: if so, then (if this education and nurture be not done as a duty from the parent in respect of Gods precept) there lies an obligation but for so much as the cost is. But then againe, if an exposed, or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired infant, be adopted and taken in, and instead of being nourished for money, is (it may be) bought from the parent with money, to which parent lies the greater obligation?</p>
               <p>If any speak of the affection of parents to the young, this is strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the female, but not lasting enough to make a family of. But if the male have any thing hereof, it is increased as the conceit of his propriety is: For males of other Creatures use it not; because the female onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her brood: and men love their children, not as they are really so, but as they believe them so: wherein no revealing natural sympathy leads them, but opinion, which many times deceives them, as shall be more fully discoursed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55976:30"/>
in the title of property. But what is this to the natural duty of children to parents? Truely this affection runs so coldly upwards, and so differently, that if God, the Law, and the Parents authority kept them not in duty (when they were of equal power) they might naturally enough (if the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of other Creatures might be trusted) use force against any assault. For as each individual is by nature furnished (as aforesaid) with competent ability to preserve and maintain it self, therefore the youngling (that as yet wants strength and understanding so to do) is in natures account not fully separate from the individual of the female: but this being now effected, it is then by natural course to follow self-guidance, as the parent did before.</p>
               <p>And lastly, as for the power of a Master over his Servants; if they be hired, none will (I presume) doubt, but that it is political and pactional. Indeed the government over slaves is natural; depending on force: and here pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or political precepts meddle not: leaving them to the Lords dispose, in as high a degree of propriety, as any other goods.</p>
               <p>But now while we have been thus vindicating Monarchy, against such as would not have one in a Commonwealth to be as natural a government as that of one in a family, if any should think what hath hitherto been spoken, is to take off the reputation and authority of the Father or Master of the Family, or to weaken the obedience of any under him, they quite mistake our intent: for our aime is to strengthen it, that therewith the other (having the same end and foundation (and that more general and strong) might be therewith strengthened also. For as all power is from God, so all obedience must run in respect of his commands: either express to himself, or such as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated, and though he gave to Kings and Fathers, so large a portion of his power, as to enable them in their governments here to be assisting unto him in the course of humane providence, yet they are not to Idolize themselves; but to think, that since they are no otherwayes set up then by his authority, that therefore those under them are not subjected in that degree by nature, but by his precepts: for as all things should refer to his glory, so the neerer we come in our expressions of it, the better. Whereupon I conceive that the Master of a Family, challenging obedience by Gods direct and many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to that purpose given, is upon more warrantable ground, then relying on nature, and referring to God from thence, as at greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>And as this will be (if well considered) a stronger obligation to duty, for wives, children, servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so it will be therewithal more noble also, if when (as voluntary Agents) they may expect reward of their performances from God that enjoyned them, then if, out of innate brutish principles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with other Creatures, their reward went not higher then their direction. We therefore say, that the head of the family hath the true power of a Monarch in himself; and where he is out the jurisdiction of anothers So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity, is a Soveraign himself: and may judge, sentence, and execute (according to Gods and his own laws) wife, children, or servants, as truely as the greatest Prince. For as some Families may be greater then some king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, so the same person, at the same time, may be a Monarch or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and yet but head of one family: even as <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he might want unction, Coronation, or other Ceremonies to entitle him a King, yet had the same authority at home and force abroad, as had those other four victorious Kings, which he with his own military servants overcame.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55976:30"/>
Therefore we will now compare the power and exercise of this government to Monarchy, as hereafter we shall that of Monarchy to this.</p>
               <p>The father we will compare to the King; and so he is to have all those royal prerogatives (where he is absolute and independent) that enable a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in chief: namely the Office of supream Judge, with its attendants; the power of making and interpreting his own Laws, that is, to have aswell the power to instruct and direct what to do, as the sword of Justice, to punish those that shall do otherwise: and in all these cases to have the last appeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, if wife, children, or servants, or a faction of them, shall take upon them to decide controversies, or to make, interpret, or execute laws to that purpose (without, or beside him, and not allowing any their fellows of the family liberty to appeal to him as supream) the unity, peace, and government of that family is broken and lost. Then, as the Monarch makes Magistrates, so the Master hath power to appoint what Stewards, Bailiffs, Receivers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers he thinks good; without the leave of any of the same family. Then, as the King lets out the stock and wealth of his Kingdom in several properties for the good of the whole kingdome (that is, for encrease of the publike stock by private managery) so the Master entrusts the wife, children, or servants, as he sees occasion: taking of them (as the use of the family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) such proportions as he thinks fit: whether it be tenth, or twentieth part of the encrease; which answers the taxes in kingdomes. So lastly, hath he power over their liberties and personal services, for his own or the families occasions. But these, and other similitudes of jurisdiction, will be spoken of more largely under Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Some have thought that a family could not be rightly called so, under such a number of persons, that is five at least: and that in it, there must he all relations; that is, of wife, children and servants. They might also have aswel put down servants of all sorts, that is, slaves too, because most families in other Countries have them: but I, considering a family as to preservation of mankind by government, and not as to the encrease of it barely, say that the sole power of each family, as a family, belongs to the head thereof; and that in the relation of Master too. And I do farther conceive, that, as wife and children are commanded as members of the family where they are, so, if they dye or depart the family, the Master doth still remaine the head of the family, although he be now neither husband nor father: and that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be but over two servants, aswel as before: For although his power be not so extensive over few, yet it is as absolute. And the same is to be judged againe, though he have none but children, or none but wives: for though these may alter his relation to those under him; yet having sole power, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the full right of government as Master of the family: for, considering them in their general relation of governors and governed, though the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (from their differing relations that are under him) may differ in notion or title, yet the power is of God, and not from their relations, as inferiours.</p>
               <p>If the wife, before marriage (and being yet free) make paction for part of his power, yet she is so far from constituting the power belonging to his office, that he (when he shall judge it necessary) may reassume this for ought she (as of proper power) can hinder. The like may be said of children and servants; unto whom, by promise or without, he may suspend, or remit the execution of his power, as he shall judge fit: and yet cannot he be said to have derived power from them. Let us now proceed to resemble their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55976:31"/>
orders and relations, and then speak of the Anarchy or overthrow of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>The Master himself we have compared to the King, and now his Wife we will compare to the Order of Priesthood in the Kingdom: which is to be ruled more by love then fear, and yet is to be subject to the same head. The Children we may compare to the Nobility and Magistrates; who stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in degree between Monarch and people, or Master and Servants, serve as the Ministers and conveyers of Justice and protection downwards; and by their sole dependance of the good of the Monarch or Master, serve as Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks against any forcible attempt. The servants in the Family, do resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the other subjects in a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now this Government in a Family is changed through remisness or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Master, as is the Kingdom through the like in the King: for if he act onely by others, the acknowledgement will follow the power, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves through contempt, lose or hazard their Soveraignty. As, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be uxorious, then (as the undertaking Clergy can make Religious Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance stretch as far as they please, so) the Wife (as incident to Women) being grown proud of Government, will (as it were now her own right,) take all upon her to general discontent. But if he be indulgent, and trust his power to Children, then they, neglecting all above them (that is power, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Ecclesiastical) fall a trampling on all the Servants, as ambitious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in a Kingdom; till the Subjects be Rebels, or Slaves. And lastly, if (as making himself equal with his servants) he affect popularity too much, he thereby loseth his bulwarks of Nobility and Religion, things of no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem with them: and lies as a deserved prey, to his servants and subjects next violent attempt.</p>
               <p>Let us now see their likeness in their Anarchies. If (in the weakness or absence of the Master, or infancie of the heir) the power be exercised partly by the Wife, followed with one part of the servants; and by the Children, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with others of the Servants, (so that there is division by factions) Anarchy is begun. If the Wife prevail, as in title to her Husband, or as Protector to her son and heir, Monarchy is not in much danger; because she and the Clergy have great interest in the Crown. But if Master and heir dye in the contest, and the Children prevail and Govern joyntly, then it is one sort of setled Anarchy; which is Aristocracy. If the servants that took the part with the Masters Title prevail against the Children, or the Childrens insolence shall make the servants that followed them desert and joyn with others against them (so as to overcome them and rule themselves) then it is the other sort of Anarchy; namely Democracy: both which are (upon the same reason) as opposite to Government in a Family, as in a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But now, although there be more mutterings and repinings in each Family (that is against the exercise of the Government of the present Master there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) then is in a Monarchy, (having consideration to their proportionable numbers) yet to set up such standing Factions, or to prosecute them so far as to overthrow the form of Government thereof, cannot be in like manner subject to the Family as Kingdom: and this, because the Master or his heirs interest, is by Superiors Laws still upheld: and then, the Masters of all other Families having concern in the example, do so order things, that the Faction of one Family can never have force enough, to prevail (by president) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55976:31"/>
so many. Whereas in the Monarchy, (discontented parties having made a Faction so great as to overpower the appointed head therein) there is not another present superior fear to keep them from destructive proceedings: for other Monarchs will rather help it for gain to themselves; and other heads of Families will forward it, out of consideration of their share in Government, when this one is taken away.</p>
               <p>And none can doubt, but that Children and Servants are throughout as desirous, and covetous of the Fathers and Masters power and riches, as the factious Subjects are of these of a King: and would as assuredly make their associations to deprive him thereof, and also joyn in confederacy to enjoy them amongst themselves as the other do, if they had but equal hopes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, and of being unopposed. And could these of a Family secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their narrow bounds, against the Prince and his Laws, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance and intermedling of the Masters of other Families, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publikes can fortifie against other Monarchs: we should soon finde more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical Families then Kingdoms: I mean number for number.</p>
               <p>For since we all know that the Fathers estate is more often and with more covetousness sought then the Kings, if Fathers had nothing but their sons Consciences for their defence, as Kings have, they would often fall into worse fortune. But Monarchs wanting, first present undertakers of their common protection when their Offices are invaded, as the Prince is to the Fathers; and Monarchs again, being not unanimous and active in upholding each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rights, as Fathers are; it is no wonder, if we finde here and there an Anarchical Kingdom, even daring to profess themselves so; which Families do not. But, would Monarchs take the common interest to heart, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; and be as vigilant to preserve their neighbors power as others are to overthrow them; they would finde that it would be the steadiest course to maintain their own power at home: and that, when other Kingdoms could never have been known successful in enterprising their Kings subversion, their subjects would never undertake it; no more, then the Children or Servants of a Family dare for the like cause, attempt the like against their Father and Master: The main reason that Subjects usually have to desire such Change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of such or such a neighboring people, as have thriven therein: and so, making fortune and success the onely judge of right and wrong, they do proceed accordingly: all stories telling us, that until Anarchies came into the world, such a thing as limited Monarchy was not in being.</p>
               <p>Let us now again see their likeness in Rebellions, and its pretences. The Wife, if she be of greater spirit then to be confined in her proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, takes occasion from her Husbands remisness, or too great trust in her, to enlarge her power in the Family, and to encroach on her Husbands also. With these she lays Obligations, and raises dependances as to her self: and having now (as she believes) gotten strength to stand alone, or above her Husband, she becomes more insolent and open: Which if it shall awake him to curb by his just power, then comes she to spread through the Family the charge and power she hath. She saith, <q>That the power of the head of the Family, grew from the Family: for as the Family was in greatness or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so was the head thereof also: and therefore that they (as the fountains of power) might use the same to their just vindication from oppression. She saith, that as all kindes of good is increased by communication, so the good of the whole Family, is to be preferred in reason to the single good
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55976:32"/>
of any one; especially since (as the case now stands) that one seeks but his own hurt also, led and blinded with evil Counsel. In which case, necessity of self-preservation, will not onely justifie; but duty to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, requires the other members, to joyn in a course to force these from him, and take the charge of his person and Government themselves. She tells them, that a Family (as a Family) hath foundation on the Wife: and that (as without Religion (well instructed) there could be no firm obligation for subjects obedience; so) without a Wife no Children, no Family: and so no Master thereof. Besides (though truly she is loth to say so much her self, yet) her Husbands late disrespect and forwardness to cross her, makes her fear (as men are now easily enclined to heresie, so) he hath turned his affection to some other women: and therefore she would divorce her self from him; that so he might be as excommunicate in his Family. For, although it is true, that obedience is to be given to him by the Law of God, yet again it is as true, that he is to keep Gods Laws as well as we: if not,<note place="margin">Act. 5.29.</note> we must <hi>obey God rather then men.</hi> Nay, when he hath neglected his duty to his Family, in not providing for them (as this man hath done) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expressly saith, <hi>He is worse then an infidel.</hi> Now, whether it be not fit that one <hi>that hath denied the Faith,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But above all, through her Husbands often absence about other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and remitting the directive part of Government to her in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, she lays the greatest claim to make herself (as it were) Governor in chief; leaving to her Husband (as pertinent to him that hath none but the coercive part) the honor and authority only of a subservient officer: that is, to execute &amp; punish according to her determination and censure. No other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then as the popish and Presbyterian Clergy, upon advantage of their sole exercise in the Office of publike instruction, do come to believe at last, they are supreme and uncontrolable herein: and do thence infer, that as the body is to be subservient to the mind, so the Prince (or Civil Magistrate as they call him) ought with his coercive part of Government, to be reckoned but as subordinate, and Ministerial to what they in their spiritual capacities shall enjoyn.</p>
               <p>Not remembring, that all that external jurisdiction and power she exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e Family, is subordinate, and to be acknowledged as derived from his supreme headship; even as done by her as <hi>his</hi> Wife in <hi>his</hi> family, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that choice and designation he then made at the time he personally ordained her to be his Wife, and so consequently took her into this consort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and share of power. For although the positive power and honor belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her as a mother and Mistris of a family be to be derived from God onely, even from the sacramental efficacy of marriage and Ordination it self; yet since it cannot be imagined that the constitution of a less and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power was intended to be the overthrow of a greater, therefore should she have considered, that she is negatively in all things by him restrainable in the execution thereof. Nay more, in those things which she acts as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of the Family, over any but her own Children, she is to hold her self as well impowered as restrainable by him: although in respect of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (or honor rather) which her own children give her, she be not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any humane derivation therein, but is impowered as mother, both
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55976:32"/>
by the Laws of God and Nature; and that in chief, where no other head or Monarch is.</p>
               <p>With these and such like insinuations she may be supposed to win Children and others of the Family into a faction and association with her: by whose help she may be able to work her ends. For although women be (rather) more desirous of Government then men, yet they, wanting bodily strength, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to draw in others to their assistance, by setting up of their interests also. Thus Children shall be won in, by hope of some parity of power with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as Peerage among themselves; for, by the Text of <hi>Fathers provoke no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then, the Children, when they meet with an easie and indulgent Father, and one that hath never so much as said to <hi>them, why do you so?</hi> but hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to rule and sway over the servants as of their own right,<note place="margin">1 King. 1.6.</note> by his too great trust to them given; these (I say) are apt to forget, the joynt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interest they have in their Fathers support, and thereupon to be drawn into these insurrections. But when the Father shall now finde himself despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and shall discover that they (as contemning his Authority) are begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make factions amongst his servants, as seeking their own interest and ends; and thereupon would now begin to curb them, and it may be (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Solomons</hi> advice) put <hi>wise servants over these his sons that cause his shame</hi>;<q> how will they begin to cry out on their slavery,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.2.</note> when strangers and servants shall be made favorites? How ill natured is his own children, to his Peers? But it is no marvail (they tell the rest of the Family and people) that they are so used, for it is for their sakes, and onely because they have ever held up against such as would enslave them: for if they would flatter him in such a course, they might have preferment and favor enough. No, no, their Conscience and zeal to the publike, would not let them be of this Bed-chamber and Court-Junto: they are publike spirited, and all for the common liberty and good: and will maintain the Families, or peoples liberties and properties; and (above all) the true Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If the Father, finding his Wife more true, do particularly use her assistance or advice, Oh what scorn will they cast upon their mother. <q>What shall they be ruled by the distaff! Are women fit for such employment! What shall they be Priest-ridden! Let women (on Gods Name) spin, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their own maids: have they not Callings of their own?</q> As if there could not be a greater injury offered them, then to tell them that they must be subject to any other precepts of Religion, but what was of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.</p>
               <p>But all other clamorous maxims, come far short of those used by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary servants; being now left with none above them: the Children and Nobility being dead, or disheartned by long contention; and others now content, to joyn with them in their heady alterations. Now come they to conceive and cry out, <q>That since the main body of the Family or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom consists of the servants or subjects: that therefore their good and advice, should be most taken into concern. The Master had no other power over them, then what he had by paction; they (by that) made him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55976:33"/>
to be a Master: and since they entered thereinto but in order to their own good, why should they be hindered at any other mans pleasure for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? No, since they are now restored to their own just natural freedom again, they will not be subject to any sort of rule, but what shall be for their own good; yea, and at their own choice.</q> Which once resolved, what strange fancies and models of Government, do they at once contrive &amp; practise over one another? What a many of play-days will they make, till, under the notion of slavery, all necessary ways to sustain the Family be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected? How are the names of Tyranny, Slavery, Liberty, Freedom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tossed up and down like Tennis-balls? And, because their weakness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience cannot let them see what proportion of Liberty just Government will admit, they, for fear of want, are still crying out Liberty, Liberty: and as (amongst Children) there is a contest (by way of sport) for saying some word or sentence oftenest in a breath; so amongst them, these that in their Proposals of Government, can name and promise Liberty most, and can put the other political railing terms of Tyranny, Slavery, Oppression, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenest upon others, are concluded to have most infallibly found out the best Government for them to follow.</p>
               <p>In the passed discourse of the power of the Father and Master of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and of the subjection and obedience which those that are under them do owe; it will not (I hope) be expected, I should enter into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his duty again, in the government of them; or of things belonging to the Family; more then I shall afterwards, set forth the manner of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly administration: therefore (upon the reasons before given) leaving the Masters part towards his Family, to be treated of when I shall speak of the Kings towards his Subjects, what hath been said will (I conceive) be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to set forth the ground and right of the Masters power, so far as to estate the obedience of all under him: and the inferences thereupon, will I hope, prove pertinent (by their likeness) to encourage our subjection, and disprove our insurrection against Kings: to which end this Discourse was chiefly intended.</p>

               <p>BY what hath been delivered, both in explaining those many particular Laws from God himself, and those many Documents deduceable from the light of Nature for the establishment of Government, we cannot in reason now own its Original, or that power whereby it is made and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>My glory will I not give to another.</hi> For God, that hath <hi>all power belonging to him</hi> having resigned this Scepter into the hands of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>to set judgement in the earth, and cause the Isles to wait for his Law</hi>;<note place="margin">Isa. 42.4.</note> it is not for men to set up to themselves such <hi>Images</hi> of Authority as are of their own <hi>graving</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance: lest we be found resisting and opposing him in these his proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, <hi>of kingdom, power, and glory</hi>; even by refusing or opposing such Ministers and forms of Administration,<note place="margin">Matth. 6·13.</note> as are by him to this end appointed amongst us.</p>
               <p>Insomuch, that if any should think it of humane production, and argue, that because the good and preservation of the people was the cause of this power in Princes, that therefore these people must be the originals thereof also; they would by this assertion, rob God of his due. For, although they and their good are partly the final cause, yet are they so passive therein as it cannot be reasonably conceived, how they shall be able to act above, or upon that power they must suffer under: and their good again, being subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient and much inferior to a higher and better end, Gods glory, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that this, as the more worthy, must, upon the same ground prove the final cause also: and the other remain but as a means thereunto.</p>
               <p>And if the people be thus weak herein, what claim shall they lay to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient causes? How can they be brought to bestow what they had not? Or shall we think, that now, in corrupted Nature, men have farther power to order and govern themselves, then while it was pure? For even then, by right of Creation, Providence, and Protection, man, with other Creatures, stood subject; and had, in the very state of innocence, a Law to observe: and well had it been for him to have had more regard to this power: but now, lapsed and depraved as we are, our acknowledgement and subjection to this power and soveraignty will agree more, both with our benefit and duty, then before.</p>
               <p>Nor can we think, because our present distempers need, or call for this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power, that therefore we are the radical cause thereof: no more then the sick patient, can reckon himself the cause of cure, or of the Physicians skill. Whereupon, since power cannot own its original to impotency, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive it from its onely Author, namely God: and therefore the judgement
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55976:34"/>
which kings give, is by God owned as his; and he is called Gods Minister. If power were from the people,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 19.6. Rom. 13.4.</note> Democrity were the best form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Monarchy the worst, as farthest from its patern and original: but (on the contrary) we finde it on all hands confessed that Monarchy is best; as having in it most apparent unity, and coming neerest to its paterne and fountain, God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Again, supposing power at first from the multitude, it must be from each person, according to that Maxim <hi>quisque nascitur liber</hi>; and then, if all be free by birth (as each one must, or none must) how can the children of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors be bound to the compacts of their fathers, more then they were to theirs before: or why have they not power of alteration aswel as they? for if universal consent makes it, it is a thing which never was, nor never can be had; women, children, servants, and many people more (under one arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualification or other, made by such as bare sway) being secluded. And therefore, the persons of Electors decaying, and others of equal birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right daily succeeding (if general consent makes governors lawful) the question must be daily asked: Nay, if major Votes of these Electors, may, in equity pretend to binde the other, then no power can be of any continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance without new capitulation: because part of the old Major Voters will be still dying, and so a number of non-consenters now succeeding, they must be still asking consent anew, or else it may be doubted, that these new ones added to the old minor vote of non-consenters, may make the major num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and so make it to be no lawful government. And so farther, by this maxime, how can conquest or succession have any right? which it hath, by confession of all.</p>
               <p>Again, since rebellion is a resistance made by a less rightful power against a more (for so disobedience and stuborness comes to be called Rebellion against God;) why should we not call Kings rebels to the people (if his power be from them) aswel as call them rebels to him? acknowledging hereby all power of right in him.</p>
               <p>We may further finde that God, to express his own propriety in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the power of kingship, taketh often to him the title of King, as of the supream and high power amongst men, and never of any Aristocratick or Democratick compellation: sometimes putting it before, and above his own name of power; as if it were most highly emphatick to express the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal thereof: as when farther to set forth himself as <hi>a great God, he adds, and a great King above all Gods:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 95 3.</note> importing, that as he had made them <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohims</hi> to men, so would he still keep his own paramont right, in being a <hi>Melech</hi> over them. And so <hi>Moses,</hi> for a greater honor and grace is called King, as inferring none but such to have indubitable power to make Laws: for it is said, that <hi>Moses commanded in a Law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob; and he was King in Jesurun, when the people and tribes were gathered together:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 33.4, 5.</note> that is, he had power before, and not from their assemblies.</p>
               <p>And so againe, God, for the farther enabling and honoring of Kings, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives unto them of his own titles of kingdome, power, might, majesty, honor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he doth not to any, but these his own Lieutenants: whom in the <hi>Psalms</hi> he most particularly owns as his second self, and under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Gods (there given them) shews that their power must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegded from him onely:<note place="margin">Psalm. 82.6.</note> 
                  <hi>I have said ye are Gods, and all of you children
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55976:34"/>
of the most high.</hi> And as this his so saying, confers on them the stampe of his power, so keeps he to himself, the sole prerogative of being <hi>God of Gods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and great King above all Gods:</hi> for <hi>he judgeth among the Gods</hi>; to see if <hi>they deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the oppressor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 82.4.</note> And these texts of the 82 <hi>Psalm,</hi> are by our Saviour thought so clear, for proof (not onely of Kings derived power from God, but also) of their neer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of other his honorable attributes, that he makes it the only Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture argument, to prove the assumption of Divinity to himself warrantable: if <hi>he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, how say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, thou blasphemest; because I said I am the Son of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.35, 36.</note> Wherein he proves, that since Kings (being but adopted <hi>children of the most High</hi>) ought to be acknowledged Gods, how much more he, that (being expresly <hi>by the Father sanctified and sent into the world</hi>) might truely assume and say, <hi>I am the Son of God:</hi> and that he was eminently (above others) this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Son of God, he there attests his works: which, although the stronger proof, abolisheth not the strength of the proof of the Kings power; namely the <hi>word of God, the Scripture that cannot be broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for that exception, of Kings unlikeness to God in regard of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, <hi>But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 82.7.</note> it makes their resemblance of God in power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (while they live) yet more clear: as being thence to be concluded, as far above the ordinary sort of men (and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates also) in their life time, as now in death like unto them. And by that differencing those (there called Gods) from an inferior ranke of Princes, it must signifie that supream office of kingship onely: because on earth, Princes are under none else: And therefore is Monarchical government there acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the foundation of the earth: for (complaining of their present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice) it is said <hi>all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, so far are people or subjects from having any authority to confer these high places, or of having from God any rightful power over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they have it not wholly over themselves: so that no man can kill or destroy himself, but he is so far-forth culpable, as a transgressor of the Laws of God and nature. For as the measure of our good abearing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is from presumption of our good inclinations to our selves: if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by such self-injuries, how shall the damage of our neighbour be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? in whose, and our destruction, there will happen a diminution to Gods general property in mankinde, by loss of so many individuals. Upon which ground, we see that Kings as Gods Vicegerents, and under him proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their whole territories, must (for the enabling them in their account) have account given them for the life of each one of his subjects: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though destroyed by himself, is yet murther, and the party culpable, as <hi>Felo de se.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, <hi>There is no power but of God, and the powers that are, are ordained of him: he it is that taketh away kings and setteth up Kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.1. Dan. 2.47.</note> 
                  <hi>a God of Gods and Lord of Kings</hi> he is: and he himself by paramount right, <hi>beareth rule over the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whom he will.</hi> The which to deny, and to ascribe this gift and power to any earthly derivation,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.21.</note> is with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to have the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And <hi>Daniel</hi> farther tells <hi>Baltshazar, The most high God gave thy father a

kingdom, and majesty, and honor, and glory: and for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him: he put to death whom he would, and whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 18, 19.</note> all which (as it shews the original of power, so) being spoken of heathen kings, what can more directly point out the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of authority, necessarily belonging to that office, as derived from God, <hi>to whom all the kingdoms of the earth belong,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4.32.</note> and whose Lieutenants they are? Could the law of nature, or any other unknown prerogative of one man over another, have otherwise made the taking of mans life away other then murther; had not a power herein been thus gotten from God (who onely had it) to be exercised by his Vicegerent: to enable him (as before said) <hi>to put to death whom he would?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which general power of the sword of justice, we may find given to Kings, at the same time God gave over the immediate managery thereof himself: for so are we to understand the words,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.5.</note> 
                  <hi>at the hand of every mans brother will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the life of man:</hi> namely, to denote unto us that Officer, who is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the execution of this power. For although God will have mans blood now punished by man himself, yet it is not to be done by every one, but by such an one as should personate and represent every man, as being every mans brother: so that by the words <hi>hand,</hi> and <hi>brother</hi> (in the singular number) we are to understand that this power of life and death, is hereby put into the trust of this publike and general person, now the adopted elder brother un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and after the law; as it was in the natural elder brother before the law.</p>
               <p>And that this verse was not idlely added to the former, but to signifie this common person the King, will most plainly appear by comparing it with that description of Kingly office particularly given to the Jews: in which, this officer is there specified under that relation of brother three times, and under no notion else:<note place="margin">Deut. 17.15.</note> 
                  <hi>one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee, thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother:</hi> and againe it is there said,<note place="margin">Vers. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>that his heart be not lift up above his brethren.</hi> In which places, since the relation of brotherhood is so often used, and not any other word or relation (as of bidding them choose one of their own nation, country, kindred, religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) it must shew it to be a direct paraphrase on this place.</p>
               <p>And that which will yet most of all clear it, will be the observation that this first prediction, and appointment of Kingship by God all the world over, was upon the same occasion with this prophesie, and appointment of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by <hi>Moses</hi> amongst the Jews: because that in both places, the relation and notion of brother, is set down by occasion of the establishment of the like chief mark of their office, namely supream judicature. For as in this place this publike officer and judge, was appointed upon occasion of Gods first setting down positive laws for men to be governed by, so in this place of <hi>Moses</hi> it is set down after, and upon occasion of setling the power of supreme judicature <hi>between blood and blood,</hi> &amp;c. in one judge amongst that people.</p>
               <p>Some have thought the judiciary power, and the designation of magistracy, not to be set down till the sixth verse: and that in the most general terms of <hi>who so sheddeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.6.</note> &amp;c. But I conceive that verse, to contain a general recital of Gods care of humane preservation, by the vindicative prosecution of the causers of his death, whither man or beast: both which had been before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

spoken to. For that chap. containing expressions of Gods providence for man and beast, after their former destruction, we may note, that as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to eat blood was sacramentally delivered to teach men clemency and abstinence (in that their indulgence for dominion and food over beasts) so (on the other side) to shew us that God careth for men too, it is next added, <hi>and the blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every beast.</hi> By which words, since we cannot conceive how beasts should be otherwise (in that kind) respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to God, then by his Minister of justice amongst us, we must therefore conclude, the requiring hereof at the hand of every <hi>beast, and at the hand of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man,</hi> is to be made good by that judiciary authority <hi>of every mans bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> next following.

And this was well denoted, when God took part of <hi>Moses</hi> spirit to enable the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Ministers to exercise their functions: for, although God had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his own to give as yet unbestowed, yet, to shew the necessity of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance and subordination for establishment of government, he grants them portions onely of what had been entirely conferred on one before: that so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and unity might be preserved, by this <hi>unity of spirit and bond of peace</hi>; which would else be distracted by plurality of persons.</p>
               <p>And to this end, were these persons to be at <hi>Moses</hi> choice also: for <hi>the Lord said unto</hi> Moses, <hi>Gather unto me seventy men of the Elders of Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 11.16.</note> 
                  <hi>whom thou knowest to be Elders of the people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will come down and talk with thee, and will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burthen of the people with thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou bear it not thy self alone.</hi> Which places plainly shew, that although God, at <hi>Moses</hi> suit, did give others power to bear part of the burthen, yet is their manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution so ordered, as to minde them of subordination to the Monarch: and again, there is nothing of popular consent herein: All which would be well considered, by such as are so credulous of the soveraign power of the Sanhedrim.</p>
               <p>This delegation of power from God to Kings, was usually conferred under the name of Unction: for so saith <hi>Samuel</hi> in annointing <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>is it not because the Lord hath annointed thee to be Captain over his inheritance</hi>: plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, the power and office to be conferred with the unction: and that also as coming from God; <hi>the Lord hath annointed thee.</hi> And therefore, under this incommunicable and sacred title <hi>of Gods anointed,</hi> their protection is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by God more expresly owned, then of other persons.</p>
               <p>This unction or mark of power, is in the first place due and proper to Christ; thereupon called <hi>the Christ, or the annointed of God.</hi>

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55976:36"/>And as in acknowledgement of derivation of office and power from Christ, Kings (as anointed under him) do waer his cross on their Crowns: so by vertue of this Unction (as by a kinde of Sacrament) it is that their persons have ever been held so sacred, that none have ever yet found out a way, or dared to practice the annihilation of the stile it self of King, more then that of Father from the same persons that were really so: as in other officers set up by humane authority, is usually done, by way of degradation.</p>
               <p>The which amongst Christians, hath been chiefly confirmed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Davids</hi> usage towards <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> both of them his open and professed enemies: Against the first of which, although there might be high faults objected, and that against God also (who did thereupon by <hi>Samuel</hi> make so much known of his will of rejecting him, that the people could not be ignorant thereof) yet, because they wanted express warrant from God to be actors therein (as <hi>Jehu</hi> had) they durst not presume to <hi>lift up their hands against the Lords annointed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.23.</note> Nay <hi>David</hi> himself durst not do it; although his advantage by his overthrow, and his oportunity to do it were most apparant: and who also, had as high provocations from <hi>Saul,</hi> as might have tempted any ordinary humor of revenge: and had farther (beyond the pretence of any ordinary subject, or any order of them) as great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of insubjection as could be: because of his own Unction by Gods appointment, and from his knowdledge of <hi>Sauls</hi> rejection. Yet he, in proof of derivation of kingly Power from God only, findes nothing but express au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from that God that hath set them up, to be warrantable for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them down: they were the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> not the peoples: It was therefore his part, and much more is it the part of others now, to permit that powerful hand that brought this rod upon them, to have liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it in a way and time of his own. For how can they do it as subjects? and from whence should they derive insubjection?</p>
               <p>If then they be Gods anointed, the rightful power to govern according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, must be therewith conferred: or else the Unction were vaine, and in a mockery of God. If the politick corporation confer the power, let the charter and seal of Office that speaks it be produced: let us see the hands and seals of those that conferred this power, as also their Commissions and authorities for so doing; that we may be satisfied with the just derivation thereof. But now, as donations and assignations of humane interests, use to pass and be conferred from one party to another by such like wayes of conveyance and none else; so, this passing by anointing, it must shew it to be confessedly of a different nature. But to give a cleerer light to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and distinction of Divine Right and Authority in these things, we shall here take leave a little to digress.</p>
               <p>As to deny God Almighty to be the prime and supreme cause of all things, and of those vertues and abilities whereby each thing is effected, is perfect Atheism, so (on the other hand) to submit and fasten on him (as immediate Agent) those operations, which by the ordinary course of his Providence he hath appointed to be the productions of natural causes, doth as strongly argue ignorance: but if in those effects and productions which may to our sense be observed to come to pass by the interposition of such second Agents, as neither by any naturalness in themselves, nor observation of ours could be reasonably concluded the causes of them; in that case again, to deny divine power, and ascribe to Nature and second Agents what is above their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55976:36"/>
reach, is both Athiesm and folly too. To ascribe the hardening of the Clay to God Almighty, and not to the Sun or Fire, is to be foolishly derogatory to him: even as it is also, to deny him to be the cause of that heat and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Sun or Fire, whereby it came to pass. And no less then so it is, to ascribe to the vertue of the Clay, that Cure which our Saviour wrought on the blinde man: for neither any known naturalness in that Agent, nor obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the like elswhere, could reasonably warrant such presumption therein.</p>
               <p>As thus in Inanimates and the general course of Providence, there ought to be a discreet distinction made by us, in the setting down of what operations are immediately Divine, and what Natural; so much more, in those things which are wrought by Creatures reasonable; and where as well the Agent as Patient are voluntary, as in Matters of Government and instruction it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. In which respect, since there cannot be any natural Reason or Cause assigned, why the will of one should be efficatious to the Government of the will of another (as in it self) it must follow, that that constant course and setled way of so doing, must be attributed to Divine Authority only. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and setled way, I say: for that there may many humane contrivances be made, to introduce temporary subjection and agreement, which cannot lay claim to be of divine institution: and because again, although this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government be alone <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and so onely constant as to the way and form, yet (through humane frailty) it may many times fail in the measure and end of its efficacy.</p>
               <p>The Officers that are to claim their Functions and Authority as <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> are first the King or Monarch: who is from and under God himself, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished as well in causes Ecclesiastical as Civil, supreme Governor. And then Fathers, Masters, and Husbands: as Civil Governors. And then those of the Clergy, as spiritual guides and directors, under this their chief guide and director: unless it be where, and when this Master or Father of the Family is insubjected and independent: at which time he (being himself a supreme Monarch) hath (as Elder Brother) those Priest-like and Civil Offices of instruction and coertion, by the Law of God united in the same unsubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate person: even as amongst those great and more ancient Families it fared, before Nations came to be under kingship; or that the Priesthood was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Civil power.</p>
               <p>Nor doth matter of Reason alone (as already and hereafter to be shewed) prove the Authority of these Functions to be Divine, but the express pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts by God himself to that purpose given, do (beyond dispute) settle these Officers, and none else as of Divine right, <hi>immediately to them derived,</hi> for authorising them in their acts of Government and Power. By which words of <hi>immediately derived,</hi> we may know how to put a difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that Power and Authority which is exercised by Kings themselves, who hold of none but God above them, and that which others their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates perform: who, being ordained in their power by the Prince, cannot be said to hold their powers otherwise then as immediately received from him.</p>
               <p>But although (in this regard of subordination) it may be in some sense true, that the Priest and Master of the Family may be also said to derive their power from the King (where Kingship is) even because in the exercise thereof they may be by him directed or limited, yet is there a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55976:37"/>
to be put between them and Magistrates, in respect of claim to divine right in performance of their Functions. The Magistrate, as he is positively &amp; affirmatively impowred by the Prince, so is he also negatively under him in the execution thereof: the Priest and Master of the Family (on the other side) have all their positive power of instruction and jurisdiction from God alone derived: being negatively onely restrainable by the Monarch in the outward act and execution thereof: whereas, to the King himself it is alone peculiar, as to be by none but God affirmatively impowered, so to be by none but him negatively restrainable.</p>
               <p>But then again, although in each independent family, the offices of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and coercion be united in chief in the person of the same Master, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Authorities which those of the Priesthood and the Masters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies do severally execute (where they are not united) there is unto the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Priesthood a greater honor annexed (in respect of divine Claym and Authority) then to the other: and that not onely because instruction must be supposed to precede coercion in time and order, but also in dignity: in respect or the different dignities of those that are to be the objects of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; the Priestly Function presupposing always a more noble Object (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such an one as is indued with understanding and wit) whereas bare coerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can reach unto neither of them. And under the Gospel again, a farther addition of honor and divine Authority will arise, from the observation of that more spiritual charge and Function, they inwardly claim towards the promotion and exercise of Gods kingdom in our hearts: whereas amongst the Jews, the drift of the Priests instructions had for objects the outward acts and Ceremonies chiefly.</p>
               <p>In which regard of instruction and preaching the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity (taken as Gospel duties) they stand by means of special ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereto, not onely separately distinguished and enabled above other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power (as the persons to instruct and teach Gods will are distinct, and in that respect above those that are to obey) but also, whilst they meddle not with such things as have tendency to civil Peace and Duty, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subordinate to the Prince himself: nay above him too; as his spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and as having their efficacy, and holding their authority herein imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Christ, as his Ministers; and not of the political head of the Commonweal.</p>
               <p>The Father and Master of the family enter upon their authorities and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction according to natural course and equity, without personal designation and appointment from the Prince and his power, and are afterwards restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all things as he shall think good: but those of the Priesthood al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though they were by the laws and authority of the prince personally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to stand as Gods Ministers, yet are they (on the other side) as Gods immediate Ambassadors and prophets, subordinate to none. And this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel duty of preaching, besides publike prayers and administrations of the Sacraments, are to remaine as the proper duties of persons in holy orders, without exemption of the prince himself: For although to each prince (in order to peace and government) the chief and general care of instruction in the wayes of righteousness doth appertain, as it doth also in each family to the Master thereof, yet doth the office and efficacy of instruction in the mysteries of Gods inward kingdome depend on the authority of none but God himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:55976:37"/>But these things are to be understood of the Clergy in their spiritual Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions onely; and as they relate to one another as equally Gods Ministers: and not as they are differenced amongst themselves, in reference to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct proportion of external jurisdiction and power, alotted them for peace and order sake. For as in the first respect they are under none but God, so in the second, they are wholly subjected to the Prince: he being (as great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and overseer of the whole Church) to preside over the Bishops of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Diocesses thereof, upon the same Reason and divine Authority, that the Diocesan doth preside over the Parochial Minister. And upon the same ground that the Prince (as great and general Father and Master of the whole kingdom) doth preside in the Government of each Family, by means of that civil Magistracy which is exercised under him, in like manner doth he as head of the Church, preside over the whole Clergy in Ecclesiastical admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations; by means of this Episcopal jurisdiction, which is to be by him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected or restrained: of all which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Having thus far premised in the declaration and distinction of Officers and Functions of Divine right, for the better understanding the present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as well as many other discourses which will hereafter follow, where the same shall be farther proved by Scripture, I hope it will to all unprejudiced men appear, <q>That although God doth not now (as sometimes formerly) so immediately &amp; expresly operate in the unction and designation of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, or that there is not now any special Ordinances sent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Ministery of Angels or Prophets (as amongst the Jews some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it was) </q>yet can we not hence infer, that their power can now arise from nothing else amongst Christians, but the pactions and agreements of such and such politick Corporations: unless they will also say, that nothing is to be acknowledged as from God, but where himself or his express Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger is seen.</p>
               <p>But they should observe the difference of Gods pleasure, in the degrees of his manifestations to us under the Gospel, over it was to them of former times: and how that since <hi>God was manifest in the flesh,</hi> those former and more express extraordinary ways for setting up of Kings, have ceased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things. <hi>For God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son: whom he hath appointed heir of all things,</hi> by whom as God made the world, so doth <hi>he now uphold all things by the word of his power.</hi> A great part of which power, is that power of Kingship: whereby, as <hi>God hath committed all power to the son,</hi> so Christ again, being ascended on high (amongst other gifts he gave unto men) this of power of Government was one. And in Christs hand it shall alone continue, till the end of the world; at which time,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note> 
                  <hi>the son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him; that God might be all in all:</hi> that is, may personally and immediately again govern that <hi>new Heaven and new earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.13.</note> 
                  <hi>wherein dwelleth righteousness:</hi> whereas the iniquities and violence of men in this world, had by degrees caused him to make this his recess from appearing in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment himself, as we shall in brief declare.</p>
               <p>In the first age God appears as in person, and speaks by lively voice in the emergencies of mans directions; for so appears he to <hi>Adam</hi> in his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and although he hide himself for fear of guilt, yet his acknowledging <hi>to have heard his voice in the Garden,</hi> shews plainly he was used thereunto.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.</note> And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55976:38"/>
that this appearance was not streightned to Paradise, or good men alone, may appear by Gods Colloquy with <hi>Cain:</hi> who was not at all (we see) feared or startled at any unexpected strangeness, but answers very familiarly, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.9. Gen. 6.12. Gen. 6.5.</note> But at such time as <hi>all flesh had corrupted their way, and that God saw the immaginations of mans heart was evil, and that continually,</hi> he resolved <hi>his Spirit should no more strive with man:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> that is, he would not so immediately undertake his government here, whereby to be provoked to any other <hi>repenting that he made man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> a Creature so polluted, that he must be washed by a flood.</p>
               <p>After the flood, God begins to give standing directions for mans gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and submits the execution of them to man also: God will not long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er immediately reprove and punish (as in the case of <hi>Abel) but whosoever sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</hi> Which Precept, as we may not (as before noted) conceive given, that murther should be punished with murther; by leaving every person power to kill in revenge, as he saw cause; so, we may farther gather what was the Officer designed hereunto, by that blessing which God gave unto <hi>Abraham</hi> (the person he next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto) when he said, I will make Nations of thee, <hi>and Kings shall come out of thee.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After this promise, we shall finde that Gods next appearance to <hi>Abraham</hi> is by Angels, not by himself, as formerly to him and others he may be noted to have onely done: and in this way of manifestation, he ordinarily continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till <hi>Moses:</hi> after whom another sort of messengers succeeded of a lower allay, namely Prophets. The which as they served to give divine direction in that particular kingdom of the Jews (during its time of Theocrity) so did they cease at the coming of our Saviour, and calling of the Gentiles: for <hi>they prophesied but till John</hi>; who may be said to conclude these appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for direction in our Government, which should come from that person of the God-head that made the world, and to foreshew all power to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by that person that redeemed it; that is by Christ: by whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Precepts we were to be outwardly governed, as well as to be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided by those of the Holy Ghost: of which, more in the Discourse of Religion, as also of the surcease of miraculous appearances.</p>
               <p>Christ being thus become <hi>King of Kings,</hi> we are not to expect him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly putting in these his several Deputies; no more then while he is doing any thing else. It is enough that he hath left us his own, and his Apostles many Precepts for obedience unto them: which surely he would never have done, if such an office were not to have still continued. It is enough we <hi>have Moses and the Prophets</hi> setting forth this succession of kingship as Gods Vicegerents: if through stubbornness, <hi>We will not believe them, neither will we believe though one should rise from the dead.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Therefore, as Christ was to succeed his Father in his Regency of men here below, so doth he not alter the way and form of administration thereof by Kings formerly used: nor yet the substance and general scope of those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Precepts, by God given to that purpose: but leaving the one as well as the other to stand in force by his not repealing them, he may then be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed also to have made his recess from personal administration for our good, upon the same ground that God himself did before: to wit, that those fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetitions of impiety, oppression, and other sins which we hourly commit, might not be continually provoking divine Justice to our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>And so far should this delegation be from lessening Gods or Christs just power in our esteem, as it will upon due consideration increase it: for omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency should not be omnipotency, if potency of any kind were excluded. And therefore, as in the general course of Providence, his Almightiness is the more apparent, by enabling second causes and weak instruments to produce and execute effects proper to deity onely: so in this particular of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (by delegation) to authorise and enable others, which of themselves could otherwise claim neither power nor right herein, it doth, by conferring one another without diminution in himself, so far (by addition) imply an augmentation of power: inasmuch as self-ability (simply considered) is not so large, as when (unconfinedly all things), or any thing can be made susce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible of this strength. In which doing, the weakness of the instrument will also increase the reputation of the Agent, by having his <hi>strength made perfect and apparent in weakness:</hi> when from so low a degree,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12 9.</note> its honor and power shall be so advanced that it shall be (as it were a second deity) able to act things proper to deity onely; as in right of government: and that, without all just pretence of arrogating to themselves, or derogating from him.</p>
               <p>So that now, we ought rather to admire and magnifie the ways of Gods government amongst us, then by such reprobate and Athiestical Tenents, seek to dethrone him, and set up our selves in his stead. For if our Pactions and Associations here below, can once make us independent on him; what will they be, but Conjurations and Conspiracies against Heaven? and so (upon the matter) must he be subject to our apprehensions and appetites; and either in the way of government, operate as expresly and personally as in former times, or else, must we conclude it reasonable to deny his care, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest therein at all?</p>
               <p>As if, because God was onely known more immediately to create the first man, therefore, all now must owe their Creation to their Parents only; as not having in our sense any other cause of production, then the known way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, common to us with all other things. Or, because God doth not now rain Manna, Quails, or other things from Heaven, as to the Jews he sometimes did; but that the Sun, the Earth, and other Elements (together with mans industry) are the onely sensible immediate conveyers and causes of all our food and other benefits we enjoy, it is therefore reason that our ignorance in his ways of dispensation; should forthwith exclude our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his care and providence: and make the usual returns of thanks we give for such things, appear rather to proceed from complement then duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:55976:39"/>By this Doctrine, we may as well also conclude against mans right of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over other Creatures; because the first Dominion was immediately given to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> onely: when yet, (by priviledge of birth) we have right to inherit also whatsoever belonged to them as men: this being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and common, and not a personal prerogative onely. The like we must hold, of heirship to the government of a Family: not making its power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on the Will, or any consent to be derived from Wife, Children, or Servants; but he exercising and enjoying it as proper to the Office.</p>
               <p>And what were this Doctrine, but to overthrow and walk quite contrary to the Doctrine of Christianity? which constitutes, and commends Faith, where present sense is wanting: and in matters of divine doctrine or example pronounceth him happy <hi>that shall not see and yet believe.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Act. 19.2.</note> or, because there is now no such manifest breathings used, nor no persons of equal authority to Christ or his Apostles to confer ordination; must we say therefore, that that power, whereby Priests and Ministers exercise their spiritual Functions, is meerly humane; and from them onely received, that are immediate workers therein? What were this, but, as before we had thrust God out of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and superintendency of the state (by reckoning his Vicegerent as the peoples, so now) to interdict him any particular care or Authority of the Church also; by accounting his Ministers our own?</p>
               <p>But, in sum, this power of Kings, belongs to them as Kings: and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of these their Offices, it is that God owns the very Heathen, as servants and Deputies to himself:<note place="margin">Isa. 44.28, &amp; 45.1.&amp;c.</note> for so <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus,</hi> &amp;c. held and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised their Authorities, and yet had no special revelation or Ministery for their enthroning, as had <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>David</hi>; or different from other Princes. And (indeed) if this power came not by office, then are all hereditary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but usurpers; and falsly said, <hi>to reign in their fathers stead:</hi> for how could they reign without power, and have power without special ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? As for example, <hi>Solomon</hi> held his Kingdom from God, and by as good right as his Father; and that by force of his Office and Unction; although ministred but in the ordinary way, and at his Fathers command onely: he held it not from any paction of the people; who rather looked on <hi>Adoniah</hi> as the true heir, and accordingly joyned with him in rebellion.</p>
               <p>And if any think, that it was in regard of some special occasion, God was to employ <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> &amp;c. that they were thus particularly owned; this is not denyed; but the question is, whether that extraordinary power, or that ordinary one over their Subjects (common to them with other Princes) came by any extraordinary revelation or designation from Heaven? so, as both to enable their subjects to elect and appoint those individual persons, (without regard to their right otherwise) and then, those persons also to act and execute accordingly. But although nothing extraordinarily appeared, yet do these Kings confess their power from God:<note place="margin">Dan. 2.4,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and we finde it the custom for all Kings, to write themselves <hi>Dei Gratia</hi>; and acknowledge the holding their kingdoms and powers from God onely. To this purpose (amongst
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55976:39"/>
Christians especially) their Crowns, Scepters, Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>Emblems</hi> of power) are first offered, and then received from the Altar: by the last act acknowledging their power from God onely; by the other offering it to his glory and service, the main end of policy.</p>
               <p>And therefore, though <hi>Jephtah</hi> had an ordinary way of entrance to the Government, namely (by making Association) he was brought in by the faction and assistance of the <hi>Gileadites</hi>; yet is he reckoned sent of God, as well as <hi>Jerubaal, Bedan,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi>; who had extraordinary ministration, So that, although God do leave those intervenient actions of Succession, Election, Conquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the same ordinary event of Providence with other things in mens choice and dispose, (which may therefore (in a sort) be called a <hi>humane Creature)</hi> yet the collation of power is from him onely: no otherwise then in marriage, the Husbands power over the Wife depends of it self, and not on any resignation from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>And therefore, those that would wrest those words of <hi>humane Creature,</hi> to import that all kindes of Regiment and power which men exercise one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another, is but of humane Authority and institution, would make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle contrary to himself: for it is plain, that he, writing to the converted Jews (amongst other admonitions to good behavior) to observe this of submission to Authority, could not be imagined to have made that an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereunto, which should have been quite destructive thereof. For if the Argument had run thus, <q>You are to submit your selves to all such forms of Government as you shall be under; inasmuch as they being all but things of humane device, and having no power but what they (as a new sort of humane Creatures) had received from those many deities their own Subjects, it is therefore Reason that you should submit your selves unto them for <hi>the Lords sake,</hi> even because your selves, as setters of them up, have power above them.</q> No certainly, it is best to interpret <hi>humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (or <hi>Man</hi> in the general) to imply, and be put, by way of excellence, for <hi>man</hi> in particular: that is, for that supreme and eminent person in each Country, who, as the representer of all men therein, had Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand every <hi>humane creature</hi> in his jurisdiction. For we are to submit our selves to every <hi>Ordinance of man,</hi> thus vertually and collectively considered, and not to every Ordinance of every man else, that should take upon him to command us. Because this were to confound the persons submitting, with those to be submitted unto: and to make the injunction useless, if to be fulfilled by what we, as men, did enjoyn to our selves; or impossible, if bound to submit to every man besides.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we may conceive, that, by way of pre-occupation, those words of <hi>humane Creature,</hi> or <hi>humane Ordinance,</hi> are put in with that latitude by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Namely, the better to fasten their subjection, who (having had amongst themselves, the office and race of their Kings so expresly design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God himself,) might else have bogled at the submission to kingship elsewhere: as thinking them but of humane device and power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may interpret him, admonishing them (who were now to have their conversation <hi>honest amongst the Gentiles)</hi> to be subject to these <hi>higher powers,</hi> although no such express divine designation did so appear,<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> but that their offices &amp; powers might seem but of humane Creation. For they were to know, that those <hi>powers were of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13 1.</note> and that therefore they were to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55976:40"/>
themselves <hi>for the Lords sake,</hi> that was the Author of every just derived power.</p>
               <p>Which words for the <hi>Lords sake,</hi> as they may serve to explain the power to be of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> however humane device or custom be intervenient, so will they serve to restrain the generality of the object of our submission former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down, by conferring it onely on such as can claim it for the <hi>Lords sake:</hi> namely <hi>to Kings as supreme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>or to governors as sent of him:</hi> of which more hereafter.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.5.</note> So that then our <hi>submission one to another,</hi> shall be made good, by giving it to <hi>our Elders</hi>; or to such as from the Lord have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> even as also, the way to <hi>honor all men,</hi> (which would have seemed a strange as well as difficult precept) is in the same verse explained, by <hi>Honor the King.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> For by honoring him above other humane Creatures, and by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring others as he appoints,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7. 1 Pet. 2.17. Rom. 13, 7. 1 Pet. 2 17. Rom. 13.7.</note> I can onely rightly <hi>honor all men,</hi> and give <hi>every one their due.</hi> For as by <hi>fearing God</hi> above all, <hi>I give fear to whom fear</hi>; so by <hi>honoring the King,</hi> I give <hi>honor to whom honor?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that lastly, by this restriction of all humane Ordinance and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto <hi>Kings as supreme,</hi> we may note St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be explanatory of <hi>his brother Paul: who, in his Epistles, as he had many things hard to be understood, and which the unlearned and unstable did wrest to their own destruction</hi>; so this wresting, and the <hi>damnation</hi> or destruction thereupon following, was nowhere to be so much feared, as by interpreting that those <hi>higher Powers</hi> he appoints us to be subject unto, are but such as are indeed the lowest powers; being but such as are ordained of our selves: and not such as are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, rightfully derived powers from the true <hi>I am,</hi> or original Being himself: and so given by him to one Deacon or Minister here below, <hi>viz.</hi> to the King: to whom therefore we are to be subject <hi>for the Lords sake,</hi> that is, in acknowledgement of Gods power abiding in him, so far as to authorize him in this his Office.</p>
               <p>And therefore, it will now appear a most unreasonable supposition, that any should give what they never had: for from whom had the people this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Why should we confound, or substract their relation as subjects; and, instead of a capacity to be governed, think they had power of governing? Or, if they had, who was then the governed? For take away one relation, the other will also fall.</p>
               <p>Or, will you suppose in them a vain power, that should never be brought into act in them, as in the hands it was first put? Why should we think God so unnecessary in his dispensations? Is it not more agreeable with reason and truth, to put this power directly into the hands of the persons that should manage it, then by such long deviations, first to give it to the people, that the people may give it to the Prince, that the Prince may again give, and make use of it unto, and upon the people: and all to no other end, but by this reciprocal dependency, to be at last, both of them independent on the true Author of all power, which is God himself.</p>
               <p>But this opinion of the Prince his dependent power on the Peoples, grows usually from the observation men make, of the different powers which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have over their Subjects, in comparison of one another: as thereupon concluding, that if this power belong to the Office, and to Kings as Kings, and that from God (who is no respecter of persons, but gives to every man, and so to Kings, what is due and necessary for their callings) how comes one King to be less absolute then another? <q>Is it not (say they) from the different stipulations with their people, at their Coronations and Elections;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55976:40"/>
when by them, they are tyed to the observation of such Laws and Customs as do more or less streighten them?</q> By which means (changing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Argument about derivation of Kingly power it self, into the manner or measure of its execution) they think to obtain their conclusion. But the Question is not, whether the proprietors of any thing by the Law of God or Nature (not being particulary restrained) may suspend or dispose of part of their rights, or not; but it is, whether Princes be hereof proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or not.</p>
               <p>And they that think Princes are impowered from their subjects, have their mistake hereof, because from these obtrusions or Pactions they think them to have their power, when instead of giving they are but restrictions and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof: for so, upon good heed it wilbe found; and that these liberties of people, have arisen but from the grants of former Princes; and not Princes power from them: even thereby acknowledging, all power to spring from its proper root. So that, when people lay claim to any Priviledge, the Charter or Grant of such and such a Prince is alledged, as its ground and Authority: wherein they then being petitioners, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>il stiling themselves subjects, there is no more reason why the indulgence of former Princes, or Rebellion or Force of Subjects, should be of more avail to despoil Princes of their just power and Soveraignty, then for Wife or Children, in any Association of theirs (by way of Fact) to take on them the rights and power of Master of the Family.</p>
               <p>For although in different Countries and places, the Marital or Paternal power is more or less, and so also, Bishops, Pastors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in some places restrained more then in others (in Ordaining, Preaching, Baptizing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in jurisdiction and government) shall we therefore conclude, their Offices and Powers was not at first founded, and so to continue as from God; but is at the liberty of Wife, Children, or People, both how far, and whether it shall be so or no.</p>
               <p>And to come yet neerer, because they are usually esteemed the greatest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have greatest store of Subjects; it should be thence thought that their power was from people; because encreased according to their power, and number. What shall we then think of such as have power encreased from their wealth, from their Forts, Magazines, Arms, Navy; or by the valour and military discipline of their people? What is power therefore first in these things, and from them derived to Princes? doth the Artificer receive the power or skill belonging to him, as Artificer, from the instruments? can they make no difference between having power over, and receiving power from? What do Princes Treasures, Militia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> convene in their underi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Majesties; and freely elect also? have Military subjects double or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Votes, because they have more power? Nay, are not Princes to derive all their power from them, for they usually set them up and uphold them? nothing less reasonable.</p>
               <p>For, as that Father, that hath none but weak or indigent Children, is yet as much, and truely a Father, as he that hath rich and potent ones: even so, these additions do not constitute formally the power or office of any King or Monarch, but are onely accessory qualifications, to difference them in their comparative powers from one another. And therefore, although in the glory of such actions of Children or Subjects, that flow not formally from their relations as such, and do yet reach to the honoring of their Father or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55976:41"/>
Prince, it may be said, that honor is in the honoring, and not in the honored, (meaning that it is in the honoring first) yet can neither they, nor any subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Corelate (as heretofore noted) be truely said to be originals of any honor or power, formally in them, by vertue of that relation, wherein Father, Prince, or other Superiors stood to them as principle: but, on the other side, since they voluntarily entred not into these relations, nor had been Sons or Subjects, had not the intervenient acts of Generation, Conquest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made them such, it must follow, that what was the Author and Cause of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must be Author and Original of that Honor which is thereby caused: and may consequently, challenge the propriety and disposal thereof.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we may infer, that such Concessions of predecessors, are no more binding, then the presidents of an indulgent Parent, ought of right to take from the heir that power, which afterwards, as Father of a Family, shall come to be necessary and due unto him: but as forceable Entries, are in Law and Equity held invalid towards the disseisin of a true proprietor, the like must be held in these usurpations and encroachments on the Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as they, supposing power in the people, do thence infer, that as they are trusters, so, they are to re-assume as they think good: so, it now truly appearing that power is from the Soveraign, if he, or his predecessors, have indulged more then he findes, will now stand with publike good, he may rightfully reassume also.</p>
               <p>From all which premises we may conclude, Soveraignty to be a Power deputed from God to one person; for the Government of such or such a Kingdom or Society. From God I call it; because (as elsewhere shewed) all power is from him onely: and to one person it must be, because as the original of power affects unity in himself, so was he never found equally to distribute or entrust it otherways.</p>
               <p>If you will, you may call Soveraignty the puissance of any Society, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one person, for the attaining political ends. Where (by Puissance) is understood that natural Force, Vertue, Vigor, or Ability, which the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects had before to operate externally; which doth now come by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, as the sticks of a Faggot by the band, (according to the usual tale or allusion of the old man to his Children for Unity) to receive such aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of strength, as to accomplish and subdue those ends and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which divided, were not to be done: so that as without it, the Major part took on them (as the representative whole) uncontrolable power over the Minor, so the Prince being no more truely the whole, hath irresistable power also.</p>
               <p>By external operations, is meant the prosecution of such desires as may be of a forraign concern onely, or that have influence or respect beyond the party acting; for otherwise, my own will is still director. But, where loss or gain cannot be wholly centred in my self, rules of association do require, that application and direction be made and sought from the common center of a Commonwealth. Therefore although, in natural strength and bodily force, the Prince continue still but of equal ability to others, yet, through this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation (by submission) having more then all, he is of power to act against all opposition; according as reason and political good shall dictate. Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ends, or the good of association; is either that of Peace, or that of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the one made by submitting our own several powers of decision unto the determination of one uncontrolable Judge, the other by his distributing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55976:41"/>
(as from a Center again) to people (the circumference) the assurances of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, protection, &amp; other benefits, consistent with political utility &amp; justice.</p>
               <p>This vigor is not onely gotten by way of addition or accumulation, as when (for the removal of the strength or opposition of a powerful faction) he is assisted with the strength of others, but sometimes, by suspention of vigor in the subjects: whereby, his power comes to be more, by their having less: or, by their obedience, he grows able to command.</p>
               <p>If you will have a larger description, Soveraignty, which establisheth true policy, is an apparent, certain, and accessible union of irresistable power. Apparent and certain (I say) for else how shall littigant parties know where to make their addresses? accessible it must be also, both for the last appeals sake, or what else it shall choose to act by it self; otherwise its being is in vain: And thereupon, union it must have in it self; how else can it give to others? For, in this respect, it must be (as before said) like the Center in a circle; for there, as the singleness of the Center makes the union and meeting of the circumference, and consequently but one Circle; so two Centers, though never so like and neer, yet (having circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences drawn from them) will make two Circles. And further, as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gives being to the circumference, so the circumference to it again: for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this be drawn, the center is but a point; as untill the subjects be, the King is but as another man. And as, until this Center be fixed (whereby to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure equal distances on all hands) it will remaine an uncertain round, and not a Circle: so in policy, till the body of the people are fixed upon an unity (as upon a Center) they have no assurance of equal and certain proportions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves: but, as all lines are made of points, so, these individuals, striving to make up this Circle without a Center, or making two or more Centers, they will in the latter case, make two or more Circles or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales; and in the other (as wanting a common and perfect rule or measure) make it (like an unequal round or circumference) to consist of many irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and factions.</p>
               <p>And then again, as the Center of the earth hath in its union the vertue of the whole Globe, insomuch as the desire of approach of massy bodies (which we commonly call motion of gravity) is directed to it, and not to all or any part of the circumference besides; so, this union of property and power, must first be united in one Center of Soveraignty; that so, the whole force and vigour, resting now there (like as one foot of the compass must fix and make the Center before the other can make the Circle) subjects may be capable of an harmonious receit and direction from thence againe, by the strait lines of attraction and entercourse: which, as it will prove neerest their journeys end, namely the attaining political good (called peace &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) so will it also keep them, from justling or enterfering upon one another, in their addresses and desires; and thereby avoid political evil, which is civil war.</p>
               <p>For if any faction of the people, should grow to that greatness and teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to disanul soveraign command; then should soveraignty be no sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, nor political happiness at all attainable; the measure or way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto being thus lost or uncertain: no more, then if the force of union or attraction, should be greater or equal in any part of the earths circumference then in the Center, it could still keep its round figure; or indeed have any determinate figure at all: but, by this uncertain, or unequal direction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of massy bodies, some one part of the circumference unproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55976:42"/>
swelling, the Center must alter also: whereby, for want of setled place in that element, it should not be able to operate in due manner. So in States and Kingdomes, if they have not a common Center of desire and good, or have not the same so definite and certain, but that all or any parts of the people may take upon them, according to their separate appetites to judge and determine of good and bad, what equality or proportion can the whole have? for this differing and doubtful application, will not onely render it weak and disfigured, but also one part destructive to another.</p>
               <p>So that no government can be rightly called a Commonwealth, or one Commonwealth, where the supreme power and interest is not centred in one person. For, in Monarchy, as there is a personal, so is there a natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary union: when as in all Pollarchies, there is still a natural and necessary division of persons and interest, and only an accidental and contingent union, occasioned by some foraign fear. In which case, they may be supposed for a time strengthened and united by way of Antiperistasis only: Whereas the Monarch, having an unity in himself, must constantly remain so.</p>
               <p>As we have a pertinent simile of this agreggation of power, property, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Monarch, in that vision of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (wherein himself as <hi>that great goodly tree,</hi> is represented as the common author of protection and food for all sorts) even so we have a plain direction to this unity,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.22.</note> from God himself. For after that he had given command for making of Judges and Officers throughout all the tribes (by whose number the people might be supplied with means of decision) he then (to unite and Center them) saith, <hi>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgement, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroak and stroak, being matters of controversie within thy gates:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.8, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>then shalt thou rise and get thee to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt come unto the Priests and Levits</hi> (meaning for decision in matters of Religion) <hi>and unto the Judge that shall be in those dayes, and enquire, and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgement: and thou shalt do according to the sentence of judgement which they of that place which the Lord thy God shall choose, shall shew thee: and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thee, according to the sentence of law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgement which they shal tell thee thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, to the right hand or to the left, and the man that will do presumptously; and will not hearken unto the Priest that standeth to Minister before the Lord thy God, or unto the Judge: even that man shall dye, and thou shalt put away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil from</hi> Israel: <hi>and all the people shall hear and fear, and do no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we finde an express and direct injunction to obey the supreme defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sentence, aswell as a promise to constitute one: no pretence of our private judgements, can warrant us to decline from their sentence, to the right hand nor to the left. Marke we not, how many strong, and urgent commands here are, and how often pressed and repeated, for maintenance of this Soveraigne united power in the person of one Judge. For as all Israel was contained in the tribes, and every tribe united in its own Fathers and Elders, so, for common unity, and quieting their differences again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves (being there called <hi>Blood and blood, and between plea and plea</hi>) one common and uncontroleable Judge is to be set up and obeyed:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55976:42"/>
from whose sentence they are not to depart, under any pretence of law or equity to the contrary. For although the Law had been given to the whole people, yet are they not to interpret it, but <hi>to do according to the sentence of law which they shall teach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, under the notion of <hi>the Judge that shall be in those dayes,</hi> he is to be obeyed either actively or passively, however tyrannical or unjust his sentence may appear: because <hi>between plea and plea</hi> (or where law is on both sides pleaded) there the definitive sentence is to be enquired and obeyed from this supreme Judge onely: that is (as before said) either actively by prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting (according to their utmost devoire) all his lawful commands, or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, by enduring the penalty or punishment, in cases plainly against the Law of God. For as Gods Law, in regard he is the fountaine of power, and supreme Judge of all, ought in the first place to be obeyed; so, even in that very case, disobey the Magistrate they did not, inasmuch as, where obedience or penalty were both set before them as eligible, they might chuse either of them. But however, active resistance or rebellion (there called <hi>doing presumptuously and not hearkening</hi>) is neither in lawfull or unlawfull commands, (that is, <hi>neither on the right hand, nor on the left</hi>) to be tolerated; but to be punished (as so presumptuous an offence doth deserve) with no less then death; to the end that all Israel, (or the whole People) may <hi>fear, and do no more presumptuously</hi>; or attempt again to rebell.</p>
               <p>And, least it might yet be doubted what manner of person this should be that must have such great obedience, the next Verse (by way of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) shews the other Officer that should follow Judges: that <hi>when they should come unto the Land which the Lord God gave them, and should possess it, and dwell therein,</hi> they should both desire, and have a King set over them. And this, being a state of Government best befitting that Peace and Plenty they were then to enjoy, must needs be acknowledged given as an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment and increase of their other blessings: For under that notion God promiseth it to <hi>Abraham</hi> as aforesaid, <hi>That Kings should come out of him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.6.</note> and the like again he promiseth to <hi>Sarah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> 
                  <hi>That Kings of People should be of her</hi>: the like was promised to <hi>Jacob, Kings shall come out of thy Loins</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 35.11.</note> who again, as the next Father to the Tribes, gives it particularly to Judah; as an high blessing to be setled on him, in right of that primogeniture which his elder Brother had forfeited: namely, that this promised <hi>Scepter should not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Law-giver from between his feet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10,</note> 
                  <hi>till the Shiloh come.</hi> In which last Promise, under the notion of <hi>Lawgiver</hi> and of <hi>Scepter,</hi> in the singular number, we may well understand the Judge and King before mentioned.</p>
               <p>All which, would be well considered by those that fancy other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to that of Kings; or think that the Israelites might, at the time when they had full Possession of the Land, have chosen any other Government aswell. Not marking, that it was as expresly foretold they should have a King, as that they should possess the Land: for the words run in the future; <hi>When thou art come into the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a King over me, like as all the Nations that are about me.</hi> It is not said, <hi>If thou shalt say</hi>; no such conditionall, but an express duty or Prophecy: For the conjunction <hi>and</hi> here used, <hi>And shalt possess it, and dwell therein, and shalt say, &amp;c.</hi> makes all of them equally certain. And the Peoples fault in choosing a King afterwards, &amp; Gods
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55976:43"/>
punishment of giving him in his anger, we must impute to other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: as being done in a hasty humor of diffidence of Gods protection, who was then their King: that is, till then had governed in chief himself, and was to have his advice and consent asked, in all great and extraordinary occasions.</p>
               <p>During which time of more personal and immediate undertaking their protection, their suddain desire of alteration, was the same reproach to him, in his providence and care for their personal securities, as their murmuring for choice of food was formerly in the wilderness: for as then, Quailes, Manna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (things in themselves good, and to be acknowledged great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings) were given in anger; because unseasonably and distrustfully demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so now also, this promised blessing of kingship, because asked upon the fear of <hi>Nahash</hi> and the power of the Ammonites, was the occasion of Gods punishing them in the first person that should have it, in regard they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it in a way derogatory to him, as if distrusting his care or power in their preservation.</p>
               <p>It was unseasonable also, because they had not as yet the full possession of the land, and so no time as yet (according to <hi>Moses</hi> appointment) for asking of kingship from God. And that they were not as yet in full possession of the land, nor such a state of secure dwelling therein as could be called rest, appears (amongst other things) in that they had not as yet attempted the rooting out of <hi>Amaleck,</hi> which should have been done upon their first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling according to <hi>Moses</hi> words. It <hi>shall be, when the Lord thy God giveth thee rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of</hi> Amalek <hi>from under heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 25.19.</note> 
                  <hi>thou shalt not forget it:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neither had yet so possessed the land as to do this thing, therefore did God appoint that person to do it, which he had given them as King by way of anticipation, in answer to their hasty unseasonable peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And that this prediction of kingship was aswell mandatory as prophetick to this their time of future rest and enjoyment of the promised land, and so unseasonable as yet to be put in execution, will most plainly appear by the comparison of it with that prediction and appointment of setting up a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they should be in the like condition, for the establishment of Gods house, and of his deputy in that house, as the tokens of Glory and rest of the Nation: being to be accomplished together (as shall be more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hereafter) for it was plainly then foretold them, <hi>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 12.8.</note> Which being the very same expression as was used of them when <hi>there was no King in Israel</hi>; it must import, that then they should be under a higher restraint then before;<note place="margin">Judg. 17.6.</note> and that they should be confined both to one place of publike worship, and to one person of publike Judicature; then, and not till then. <hi>For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you, but when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit: and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 12.9, 10</note> 
                  <hi>so that ye dwell in safety</hi> (which they had not, nor did not at their election of <hi>Saul) then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall coohse to cause his name to dwell there.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> That is, more eminently to dwell there, in respect of the greater glory of this one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55976:43"/>
place, and this one deputy: so much more lively representing the unity and glory of him that thus miraculously procured their rest and safety therein.</p>
               <p>It savoured of ingratitude to <hi>Samuel</hi> also; who, now grown old in their service, they might have patiently attended to have let him honorably end his dayes in the government. And, besides that Gods granting it makes the having of a King lawful, they that then refused or slighted the Office (saying <hi>How shall this man save us</hi>) are called <hi>sons of Belial</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.27:</note> men without yoak, or rebels. And, we may farther conclude Gods decree for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Office, in that is was before promised as a dignity and reward to <hi>Samuel</hi> himself; <hi>that he should walk before Gods anointed for ever:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2 35.</note> which must express the Office of a King shortly to ensue (for Judges were not anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) even as it must also import, that it should be an honor for him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him.</p>
               <p>They that would urge this expression of <hi>they have not rejected thee, but me they have rejected,</hi> to import their direct abandoning Gods regency, as God, and not their desire onely of the change of the Function and Officer he had before deputed over them (and so think that now Princes had not their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from God as his Ministers, but were to derive it from the peoples pactions) should rather (methinks) have grounded their opinion on the Israelites for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer expression, at their election and submission to their first earthly governor in chief, <hi>Moses.</hi> For thereby, a refusal of God and Paction with <hi>Moses</hi> may be rather inferred: <hi>Speak thou with us and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, least we dye.</hi> Here,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.19:</note> the people are set down as expresly declining Gods immediate government, and as choosing, and treating with another for the exercise thereof: Whereas in this place they object nothing against Gods more immediate medling with them at all. And therefore this phrase of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me,</hi> is to be construed as in relation to their disobedience and rejecting of Gods commands onely; and not of his person, but as by consequence. In which way of interpretation, there are many places of Scripture that may warrant us, but none that can instance where the Jews, or any of the Gentile Churches or people, did either wholly, or at all so abandon Gods or Christs regency, as to choose or submit to any absolute or Independent Prince or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor; and not rather (as to Gods Deputy and Minister) think themselves obliged to obedience unto him aswel in conscience, as for fear of wrath and bare political respect.</p>
               <p>And if any think these expressions, <hi>I will set a King over me like,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>him thou shalt set over thee,</hi> &amp;c. do import that therefore their power is from the people; they may observe the people to come to <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>make a King over them:</hi> and although he delayed it, yet they,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.5.</note> knowing of no such power of themselves, come to him again: inasmuch as <hi>Samuel said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Israel, Behold I have hearkened unto your voice in all that you said unto me, and have made a King over you:</hi> and verse the 13 it is said,<note place="margin">1 Sam 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold the Lord hath set a King over you</hi>; as truely shewing whence his power came: for however (as aforesaid) circumstances made it evil, as good things may be evilly done, yet their having and desiring a King, were both from God.</p>
               <p>And that the Office was given to them as a blessing, may be farther noted from Gods speech to <hi>Samuel: To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be Captain over
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55976:44"/>
my people Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 9.16.</note> 
                  <hi>that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me:</hi> Which last words do plainly declare the intended end and benefit of this Kingly Function: and they may well prove Gods designation thereof, as the means; even as he had designed the end; the safety and good of his people. And as these words prove the constitution of the Office, and that in kindeness (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their hasty demand might make the person given as a punishment) even so the former part of the verse, <hi>Thou shalt anoint him to be Captain over my people,</hi> must shew both his supreme power, and from whence the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Officer was derived: that is, from God, not from the People.</p>
               <p>A farther proof that the desire of Kingship was not a fault in the Jews, is, that neither <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Stephen,</hi> nor any else, reckoning up the faults of that Nation committed from time to time against God, did account this for one.</p>
               <p>Nay this particular person and his power were from God, in such sort, that it was no more in their power to refuse, then to steal or murther, and yet be innocent:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 11.14.</note> and therefore we must interpret that which is called the <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the kingdom at Gilgal with him,</hi> and the Covenanting of the <hi>Israelites</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> to be nothing else but to shew to the people the person whom God had chosen; that they might continue in obedience to him and his stock. Whereupon, as this was necessary in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> because the first of their Families, so was it after left off in their Children; who still <hi>raigned in their stead:</hi> that is, in their right onely; according to Gods promise to <hi>David,</hi> to establish the Throne upon his seed for ever.</p>
               <p>And therefore (I hope) it was not in the peoples power (as in right of their paramount Soveraignty) to refuse this Family or take another: if it had, sure God did them great wrong, to settle it thus without their just consents. So that Gods not shewing them these Kings, till himself had determinately anointed and appointed them that Power and Office, shews he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Negative voice of Government to reside in them, but onely the duty of subjection: to which end, their Oaths and Promises of Alleageance were to be made before him, as is signified by the offering Sacrifice at <hi>Gilgal:</hi> of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>And as the fore-cited Prophecy and Direction of <hi>Moses,</hi> did plainly shew Kingship to follow this first setling the Jewish Nation in safety and honor; so, almost all the Prophesies of their restauration, do again run in the same manner. But, because we shall speak of some of the rest elsewhere, we will here onely speak of that set forth in these eight last Chapters of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> which is undeniably pregnant and express herein. There this Office of kingship is so particularly described, that the usual gloss of Antimonarchical men, in attributing to Christ that power and honor which in some places is given to Kings, finds no colorable shift in this place, because it is said, <hi>And my Prince</hi>;<note place="margin">Ezek. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>shall no more oppress my people.</hi> Which Oppression being not to be feared from Christ himself, and the admonition being in the plural number, it cannot be thought congruous for him: as, on the otherside, the assignation of a certain portion of Land for his maintenance; not to be alienated or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached by any of his servants, but to remain to his Children only, must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Kings, not Christ. And so must shew also, both the designation, and setled perpetuity of that Office: who, as the supreme Officer of power and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55976:44"/>
honor, is, in this recess of God, to retain the Image of his Authority, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as in his stead. As may most plainly appear, by that command of keeping the Eastgate for him only; saying, <hi>This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened: and no man shall enter by it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek: 44, 1, 2, 3</note> 
                  <hi>because the Lord the God of Israel hath entred by it: therefore it shall be shut: it is for the Prince, the Prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord: he shall enter by way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by way of the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can we by Prince understand chief Priest (as some would) because they neither had this power of Oppression: and also were distinguished from the Prince under the notion of the sons of <hi>Zadock</hi>;<note place="margin">chap. 48.11.</note> and so had Lands distinct assigned for their maintenance. And therefore again, although the Priests are there appointed to <hi>put difference between Holy and Prophane, and to judge in the Assemblies of God</hi>:<note place="margin">ch. 44 23, 24</note> they are still to be supposed as under the Prince herein: being presently appointed to be <hi>the sons of Zadock:</hi> which are to be presumed Loyal, as having been by the King put into that ministration for that very reason; when <hi>Abiathar,</hi> for joyning in rebellion with the rest of <hi>Israel,</hi> was by the King thrust out. So that the Priests here spoken of, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways set under the notion of <hi>sons of Zadock,</hi> it seemed needless to set down that, in this, or other things, they should be subordinate to the Prince: for this <hi>Zadock</hi> and his successors (representing the Evangelical Priesthood) were by Gods appointment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.35. <hi>to have a sure house built them,</hi> and to <hi>walk before Gods anointed for ever:</hi> the last words signifying at once,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.35.</note> the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of both Christian Kingship and Priesthood; as well as priestly subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, to succeed.</p>
               <p>And if we shall take these chapters as prophetick, to set forth the state and pattern of the Christian Church (as usually is done by Christians) and not as literall to the Jews onely (as they usually do) then, nothing can remain more luculent and cleer, then the divine direction hereof, for the perpetuity of this Office in the Christian Church: in order to other Prophecies else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentioned; of having <hi>Kings to be their nursing Fathers, and Queens their Nurses</hi>: and of the Churches having <hi>sons, whom they may set as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all Lands.</hi> Which Office, as it is undeniably therein appointed,<note place="margin">Isa, 49.23. Psal. 45.16.</note> so to make it farther appear to be prophesied, as necessary to compleat the Church in a state of perfection and happiness, we shall finde that it is to be shewed to the Jews as an unquestionable plot to that purpose; and to be promised them upon their good abbearance: saying, <hi>If they be ashamed of all they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and do them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 43 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By which we may finde, that in policies established <hi>according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in the Mount,</hi> Kingship and Priesthood must be: and that the one can be no more omitted then the other.</p>
               <p>How this Office of Kingship was ordained to accompany and compleat the flourishing estate of the Jewish Church, and to precede and be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in building the Temple, will be more fully discoursed hereafter: when we shall have occasion to speak of such places of Scripture, as contain a connexion of promises to that purpose; as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11, &amp;c. &amp; 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11, &amp;c. and other places. All of them plainly shewing, that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (or the Church) <hi>is</hi> (or ought to be) <hi>builded as a City that is compact together, or is at unity in it self:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Psal. 122 3.</note> hath an inward principle and ground-work of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Peace in it self, from this Divine appointment of one Governor to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55976:45"/>
preside therein: even by <hi>setting there the Thrones of judgement, the Thrones of the house of David:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> and not, as left to a plain way of dis-union and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by means of any poliarchical contrivance, to judge and govern without a <hi>Throne:</hi> whereby their Compaction or Union should not proceed from any naturalness in the form and means within, but from contingency and fear without.</p>
               <p>But because some Anti-Monarchical men do believe that it was no more lawful for the people to desire a King afterwards, then at that time, and are very urgent, that the words, <hi>I gave thee a King in mine Anger,</hi> should be interpreted as though the Office of Kingship were so given, (without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering also, <hi>that he was taken away in wrath,</hi> and so rightly construing the absence of the Office to be a greater punishment then the imposition) it is to be noted that these and many other expressions uttered in reference to <hi>Saul,</hi> had relation to him as a person hastily demanded, and so given as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and not as to one, on whom (and his posterity) the flowrishing estate of that Church was to be setled. For that promise we shall finde annexed to the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> (as before noted) of whose lynage also our Saviour was to come; whereas <hi>Saul,</hi> being a Benjamite, it could not be thought that he was the person to be setled herein. Nay, so much himself doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to <hi>Samuel,</hi> while <hi>Samuel</hi> is telling him of his Election. <hi>viz. Am not I a Benjamite of the smallest of the Tribes of Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 9.21.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then it may be asked, how we shall make good those expressions which <hi>Samuel</hi> used unto him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.13.</note> that <hi>God would have established his kingdom upon Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael for ever?</hi> Why, this might have been fulfilled by means of his lynage in a feminine line, matched into the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as was that match of <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David.</hi> But you will answer, that <hi>Michal</hi> was made childless for a fault of her own, and not other Fathers. It is true, she committed a fault to deserve this punishment, but it hinders not, but the same punishment was in pursuance of a former fault of the Family also: as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the due observation of these Stories, will also instruct us, how that the building of the Temple, (signifying the glory of the Church) and the settlement of Kingship and Priesthood, were all accomplished together: and how Kingship was the leader in this Chorus of happiness, as Gods chief Instrument for compleating of them.</p>

               <p>Nay this Office and power of kingship is so cleer in Scripture, that it is usual with the abetters of Polarchies now adays, to balk it in the plain sense thereof, and to hearken to <hi>Philo, Josephus,</hi> and I know not what Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Authors, to learn from them the Authority of the people, of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim, and such like Magistrates: not considering the interest and prejudice wherewith these men writ. For they, designing to bring their Writings and Nation into the more esteem amongst the learned persons of those times, and having so long lived, and been so well entertained, the first among the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the other amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> as to be affected with their humors and way of learning; they had the same reason to commend those other Forms, and to depress this Kingly Office and Power, as they had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thereby, their own writings and Country.</p>
               <p>And as in Kings all power is thus united, so he alone it is, that is the true Representative whole: and whose actions may binde the people, without their consent, but not theirs, without his. And so much is often by God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; making the good or ill of the King and Kingdom all one. Thus <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimilechs</hi> particular detaining of <hi>Sarai:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 20.9.</note> is by him apprehended as an evil threatning his whole kingdom: and we finde <hi>Sauls</hi> particular act against the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> punished with the peoples famine;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.1. 2 Sam. 24.15.</note> as <hi>Davids</hi> numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple afterward, was punished with their Pestilence. And in that whole story, we may observe the punishment or reward, the good or ill of the people, still to answer and be proportioned, with the Vertues or Vices of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and that, though the people did offer <hi>in the high places,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.33. 2 Chron. 21.14</note> or had not prepared their hearts <hi>to seek the God of their Fathers,</hi> or the like: yet if this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Representative person was upright before God, even for his sake, a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing did ensue: which is nowhere observed to be done in respect of any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects piety. And this may seem less strange, since we finde that <hi>Adam</hi> (being made Monarch of all Creatures) should have the violence of his race, imputed and charged on them; so, as to involve them in the same guilt and destruction by flood.</p>
               <p>Nor is this degree of power before spoken of, much more then what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was practised by <hi>Moses</hi> himself, according to the advice of his Father-in-Law; as we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.20. namely, to make Laws and Ordinances for them to live by, and where Law was already made by God, to reserve to himself the interpretation thereof, as also all appeals, and all difficult and important causes: and (for the better dispatch sake) to refer common cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to subordinate Judges. All which is again farther expressed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19, to the 18. where he owns the making Judges, and last appeal. Our of all which it may be found, that the most material marks of Soveraignty were in many of these temporary Judges: as the power of making some Laws, and interpreting them; the last appeal, and supreme decision of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: especially in <hi>Moses,</hi> because he was a King too (as formerly noted) and so made by God, and not by the people. And unto <hi>Ioshua</hi> next, as made by <hi>Moses:</hi> for on him by Gods appointment was he (<hi>by imposition of hands) to put some of his honor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 17.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that all the Congregation of Israel might be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:</hi> that is, that he, by receit of this justly derived power from God his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, might have full power to command them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55976:46"/>And therefore are they also called Kings; as in the inte-rregnum, (when there was no Judge) it is said,<note place="margin">Judg. 17.6.</note> 
                  <hi>there was no King in Israel:</hi> and yet was these Judges power inferior to that of Kings, coming after.</p>
               <p>This soveraign power of Kings, we may finde implyed in that answer of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people, <hi>of the manner,</hi> or power <hi>of a King:</hi> which, had it but been equal to that of their former Judges,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.11.</note> what needed it have been told the people? And they that will not have the things there set down to be in his power, but that he was to give account thereof, or that his actions were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troleable by any order or body of the people, do yet commit a greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity: for then, to what purpose should <hi>Samuel</hi> go about to fright the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a thing of no danger, and which was in their power to remedy? For so it follows,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that they should cry out in that day because of their King, and the Lord should not hear them:</hi> meaning, that they had none but God in that case to appeal to; by whose forbearance to hear them therein, they had no lawful remedy left them. For had his words imported no more terror to their understanding, but what they had right and power to remedy, they might have answered, <q>Nay, but we will have a King under us, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. No, he shall be onely King of the less number of the people, and their Representatives: but unto the major part or Vote; he shall be subject upon all occasions they shall think good: and so making our selves Soveraigns over our Soveraign, we shall prevent those threats: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by having (upon the matter) no King, we shall do but what unto every one seems good in his own eys.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And by the expression <hi>over thee,</hi> so often there used, must be meant over the whole people; being the same <hi>thee</hi> that should choose him: so that if his election were by the major part, or such as stood for them (as so it must be, or elese it could be no Election) his power must be above the major part or their Representatives: and as common relation bindes him to be King of the whole, that is, of major as well as minor, so must he be also over them both. And accordingly the practice of these Kings ran: for so <hi>David</hi> commands, and is obeyed by <hi>Joab,</hi> and the Rulers or Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people, in numbring of them; though themselves knew it to be unlawful, and that it would be a trespass or harm to <hi>Israel,</hi> or the whole people:<note place="margin">1 Chron 21.3</note> And although there were neither necessity nor countenance of Law for the deed, yet <hi>the Kings word prevailed against Joab and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 35. Job 9.11.</note> Whereby we may also note, that although the Scripture do sometimes (at least before Kings were) give this appellation of <hi>Elohim</hi> (or Judiciary power) to other persons in earthly power, or to inferior Magistrates, yet because (since that time) they are (or should be) under this greater Earthly <hi>Elohim</hi> (as <hi>sent of him</hi>) they never have this phrase given them; nor have they ever (like him) any of those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations proper to Christ given them, as <hi>of Messiah, Christ, or Anointed:</hi> or of <hi>Saviour:</hi> they being to Kings (his immediate Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents) in the first place due. And when they are any where given to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55976:46"/>
other persons, it is upon their receit of some extraordinary power from God: and if they have them in right of their Offices, then it may be observed to be ascribed to such Offices, which were anciently annexed to Monarchy (<hi>paterno jure</hi>) to wit Priesthood and Prophesie, as shall more fully appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>So that then you may see, the Office and Authority of a King is not separable from his person, nor is it lawful for people (after a kinde of idolatry) to pay obedience to any other kinde of resemblance: For so, at last, having (by these strange resemblances of Authority made in our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) blotted out the knowledge and fear of the true Object, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting his personal Will to be of force at all without the Authority of Law, and this Law of our interpreting also; we necessarily again fall into Anarchy: having no Will or Understanding but our own to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us.</p>
               <p>No, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> knew too well this kingly Prerogative, to be beguiled with the seeming shew of Authority in, or from the people: and followed not the example of <hi>Saul</hi> their Predecessor, to lose their power by complying, and submitting it to the Vote of the people: and therefore, it proved an unvaluable excuse which he made to <hi>Samuel,</hi> saying, <hi>I have sinned, for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.24.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy word: because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</hi> But he should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that he was set over the people, and not they over him: That, as it was one of his Prerogatives, <hi>to be for the people, to Godward,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> was, (or to have none above, or between God and him) so, there would an account by God be exposed from him onely; as being his next Vicegerent; and, as God on earth, entrusted with sufficient power. And if he had not had power over the people, how could God in justice punish him, for obedience to them that might command?</p>
               <p>Nor was this fear of the people a fained pretence; for if it had, <hi>Samuel</hi> would not have spared to tell him so. Therefore when these people took of the spoil, <hi>sheep,</hi> and <hi>oxen,</hi> and the chief of the things that should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the Lord, he might have withstood their major Vote by his denyal: and have told them as <hi>Samuel</hi> did him,<note place="margin">Verse 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Obedience is beter then sacrifice.</hi> For, as it was a vain imagination in him,<note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> to think that God would excuse his disobedience in this, through this pretence of doing him better service otherways; so it is also, from Subjects to Kings, when they withdraw their obedience upon like pretences. <hi>For rebellion is like the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness as idolatry:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.23.</note> whilst we stand bewitched with our own fancies of Gods will, and thereupon shew our disobedience to the Authority he appoints, we do by that example shake off obedience to all Law whatever: and whilst we do thus set up a will-worship of our own in the state, by denying any Authority in the will of the Soveraign, and by making nothing right or just but what shall be consonant to our own Reasons, do we not hereby lose the general and whole benefit of society which is gotten by obedience; and by relying again upon our own understandings and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of Law and Right, fall consequently into Anarchy?</p>
               <p>For not onely Soveraignty it self, but all kinde of Rule and power else, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not derive any other foundation of Authority then what is from above, as was well noted in our Saviours answer to <hi>Pilate</hi>: nor can these below them,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.11.</note> be in any respect so above them, as to give or refuse command. For when an unjust
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55976:47"/>
command is put upon us, and we appeal from one power to a higher: this is not done as out of any power of ours below, but by the power and permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the party above those we appeal from: subordinate persons being in no sort capable to be superior or insubjected, as of power from themselves. When the Master of a Family hath his Authority in any thing justly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, the power of so doing is not in Children or Servants, but from the Prince or Magistrate above, to whom the Master himself is subject: who else, if not restrained by Laws from the Prince his Superior, would have as absolute Soveraignty over his Family, as the Prince hath over the whole people: that is, in all things wherein he is not retrained by the Laws of God.</p>
               <p>And when it is affirmed that power is in the people, it would be known whether that word include the Magistrates also? if it do, where is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between governing and governed? and if it do not include them, then is the people above, and the Magistrate beneath: or else, according to truth, the Magistrate hath power to govern, and the people onely power (that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) to obey.</p>
               <p>For if this supreme indisputable Power of Kings had not been taken as a real and confessed truth, but that the people or their Major Vote should have in themselves the highest Soveraignty and Command, and he onely be as a titular thing to countenance their acts, then how should it be a <hi>wo to a Land when their king shall be a childe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 10.16.</note> that is, want ability to govern in his own personal capacity? No sure, that condition must by this rule render such Lands most happy; inasmuch as he having discretion enough to tell one, two, and three, and so to discover the Major Vote in his subjects assemblies, must be supposed to be still ready (without any thwarting presumption of his own understanding) to cry implicitly, <hi>So be it,</hi> to all that his subjects shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But if people in that condition be under a <hi>woe,</hi> it is because of their Prince his disability to judge and act in his own person: for surely, his resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Children in innocence cannot be a <hi>woe</hi>: it must follow, that the more the Prince is made a childe by his Subjects, and hath his power eclipsed, the more <hi>woe</hi> will that kingdom proportionably have.</p>
               <p>And they that yet think the whole, or major part of the people above the King, and not subject to his commands, let them consider (even) the power given to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> himself from God, <hi>to reign according to all his soul desired.</hi> Let them also (that think the generality,<note place="margin">1 King. 11.37.</note> or major part of the subjects cannot in case of resistance be called Rebels) again consider the censure God gave to the Representative whole body of the people, when they rejected <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and followed <hi>Ieroboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 10.19.</note> saying, <hi>And Israel rebelled against the house of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid unto this day:</hi> neither the major Vote of eleven Tribes to one, nor their pretention of oppression under <hi>Solomon,</hi> could excuse them of the guilt of this imputation: nay, although the action were but in pursuance of what was before appointed by God, in punishment of <hi>Solomon</hi> his Fathers fault. Which was the reason why <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was forbidden to take vengeance on these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, as his Grandfather <hi>David</hi> had before, on these major numbers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative bodies of the people, gathered against him in <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijahs</hi> rebellions: therefore is he, and the people with him, bidden <hi>to return to their houses.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 11.4.</note> Yet because the eleven Tribes had no direct warrant from him who alone is above Kings, this crime of rebellion is not to be wiped off, but on the contrary disavowed by God as concerning the fact it self: for it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55976:47"/>
there said, <hi>That the Priest and Levites, and all whose hearts were right set to serve God, returned from following Ieroboam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore that expression of all <hi>Israels</hi> coming to <hi>Sechem</hi> to make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King, must be understood, not as having power to elect another, but, as summoned by <hi>Rehoboams</hi> command to pass their fealties and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements to him, that was already in actual possession of his Father <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Throne: for so, we shall finde it noted, in the verse foregoing the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of this story; <hi>And Solomon slept with his Fathers, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 9 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> And so also, after this revolt did he continue reigning over Judah, without any mention of popular confirmation. For it seems those of Judah had acknowledged their Alleageances unto him already, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such dispute: which being ordinarily done to him and others, may seem the reason of the remarkable record of this denial.</p>
               <p>And we may yet more plainly see, what this phrase of the peoples making of Kings doth import, by the like expression used at the time of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements to <hi>Solomon</hi> his Father: for, although the people had no hand of Authority in it, but that as <hi>David made Solomon his son King over Israel,</hi> yet, <hi>David</hi> then summoning all the Princes of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 23.1.</note> 
                  <hi>the Priests and the Levites</hi> to take notice of this and other his directions about the Temple, and so concluding with a Sacrifice (as was usual at the peoples promise of Fealty and Alleageance) it is said, <hi>that they did eat and drink before the Lord with great gladness, and they made Solomon the son of David King the second time: and anointed him to be chief Governor to the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 29.22.</note> 
                  <hi>and Zadock to be Priest.</hi> Which words <hi>second time</hi> must relate to their first making of him:<note place="margin">1 King. 1.29.</note> when, being anointed King by <hi>Zadock</hi> at the command of <hi>David,</hi> all that the people did to the making of him, or conferring his power, was but (as in acknowledging him made already) with saying, <hi>God save King Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 1.39.</note> or the like: which, as it was fit for that ordinary rank of people assembled at his first making, so, in this solemn convention of the <hi>great ones, Princes,</hi> &amp;c. we may suppose some actual Fealty to pass unto this <hi>chief Governor unto the Lord</hi>; both when that Congregation did <hi>bow their heads and worship the Lord and the King</hi>; and also when it is said, <hi>all the Princes and the mighty men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.20. Verse 24.</note> 
                  <hi>and the sons likewise of King David submitted themselves unto Solomon the King:</hi> that is, acknowledged him their King; by such personal outward acts of homage, as were usual amongst that people: for so the word <hi>submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> doth bear in the original.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is likely, that at this time also they took their Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance, in other places implyed under the name of Covenants. Which Oaths are alluded unto in that precept of <hi>Solomon, My son, I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel thee to keep the Kings command,</hi>

                  <hi>and that in respect of the Oath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the expression of the peoples annointing of <hi>Solomon,</hi> used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to other Kings, it is not to be understood, as if they had right to confer the power belonging to Kingly Office on any: for they had it no more, then they had right to confer the power of Priestly Office. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Zadock</hi> being joyned in this their <hi>anointing,</hi> who it is well known was put in by <hi>Solomon</hi> before, shews that the phrase was but equivalent with acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edging. And that, because at <hi>Solomons</hi> first establishment, the greater part of the people were absent; as being sharers in <hi>Adonijahs</hi> Rebellion.

making (as to his personal election) whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> and other Kings, are to own their Thrones and power from God. And therefore it is said, <hi>That Solomon sat on the Throne of the Lord as King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all Israel obeyed him:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.23</note> obeyed him as in Gods Throne, and not in theirs. And that it is God onely that doth constitute the power of this Office, appears by that which follows, <hi>viz. The Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal Majesty, as had not been on any King before him.</hi>

               <p>But let us examine more neerly, those places that seem most to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain Soveraignty, as the last verse of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>That his heart be not lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up above his brethren:</hi> which may seem to imply that he had no absolute power over them. But it was not to forbid him any necessary power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, for punishment of vice, or maintenance of peace; nor of any external honor or jurisdiction above them, for then had the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice been useless; but as a caveat to humility: and that he should consider, that however he were thus advanced, it was more in relation to the good of the people, then his own: and that, since his supreme authority over them, was to make them happy by unity, and not him proud by preferment, he should therefore <hi>not have his heart lifted up above</hi> them, by nation <hi>his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and by nature his equals: but the consideration hereof, imprinting the sense of compassion and fellow-feeling in him, it might restraine all exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the exercise of this high power, so far, as not to insult or afflict beyond measure. And this is the cause, why succession of Princes, and continuance in the same stock, is so generally preferred before election: namely, that they are then sure to have one of their own nation, or brethren.</p>
               <p>Even so again, by forbidding him to multiply horses, or much silver <hi>and gold to himself</hi> (there also expressed) it was not simply to forbid him these things as unlawful; for the two next and greatest Kings of eminency (<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>) had them in great abundance without blame, but to give another like caveat against pride: that is, least presuming upon these advantages, he might be brought to forget God his strength, and think to keep under his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, more by the fear of tyranny, then the love of a brother: And also to admonish him, that he should not put his people to unnecessary charges, in supplying him beyond publike use. And to cleer this, by instance, in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying horses, we shall finde the prohibition point particularly towards <hi>Egypt</hi>: as a prophetick admonition against their leaning of the strength of that staffe, <hi>which should run into their hands</hi>: which was afterwards verified in <hi>Hosea</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who put vain trust in these Egyptian forces: and the 24 and 43 Chapters of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> are full of disswasions from this Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian confidence, and from returning again thither. And as that people were extreamly inclined to set their faces towards that place, so could not these admonitions but be very necessary for their King, both to keep them from so doing, and to forbear making <hi>flesh his arme himself.</hi> To which purpose <hi>Isaiah</hi> is very full;<note place="margin">Jer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> although he differed from others, yet, that the Law was the same, appears by the intent thereof there mentioned (common to him with the rest) namely, that <hi>He might learn to fear the Lord his God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and to keep the word of this law and statutes to do them.</hi> He is not bidden (you see) to be affraid of his People, Representative, or Collective: nor are they or any one earth, hereby au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised to look unto his performance of this law; or to resist or punish him, in case he transgress: the which is the thing in question; and not whether Kings are subject to God and his Laws or no: for none will deny but they are, and are also (for many considerations) more obliged to keep and press these laws then any of their subjects: As none (on the other side) will I hope say, that his subjects are to be to him in Gods stead, so as to judge and punish him, if he do not.</p>
               <p>But then it may be answered, that the people have a dry right without a remedy: <q>They have a right indeed to be free from oppression, but such an one as serves to no stead, since it may be taken from them at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of another.</q> What, shall we call an appeal to God no remedy? or shall we say there is no remedy or justice for subjects, but when and where themselves shall be judges and executioners in it? for if so, what use of this common judiciary power, when one part of the people may still have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to judge of another? It was the partiallity and injustice incident to this way of proceeding, that made it reasonable for people to subject themselves to a common umpire or judge: whose sentence should alwayes be taken as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Because else they did nothing; and are yet but in the same first state of Anarchy they were: For he that is not supreme in all causes and things, but onely such as the people shall assent unto, is not truely supreme in any thing: forasmuch as their judgement coming after his, as of power to confirme or disanull, they will still be without a supreme, and their Major vote allowing his affirmative, or rejecting his negative sentence, will at last conclude the whole definitive sentence to be come into their hands.</p>
               <p>No, if rulers of policy, peace, and government be maintained, the King onely (as aforesaid) can be supreme, and all other of his subjects can have but derivative powers; that is, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sent of him.</hi> The complaint of misusage must still run to the higher; the people cannot appeal to the people, when the King (their onely supreme Judge on earth) hath oppressed them. They have in this condition, none but God above him to appeal unto; he is the onely King of Kings, <hi>and to him onely</hi> (in this case) <hi>vengeance doth belong.</hi> All which was well intimated in <hi>Samuels</hi> reply, foreshewing that these oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions should irremediably happen sometimes: <hi>In that day shall ye cry unto the Lord, but he shall not hear you.</hi> So that then (after all these warnings and threats) the people chusing to submit to this government and power, it makes their resignation of power and trust to him to be implicite, and for better or worse. It makes it appear, that they had considered before hand of these things, as mischiefs that might sometimes befall them; the which patience and sufferance, not rebellion and resistance were to remedy. And so far were they from pretending, or desiring any caution against it, that their reply (<hi>Nay but me will have a King over us,</hi>

battailes</hi>) imports an acknowledgement of his unquestionable supremacy over them, and that aswell in Civil as Martial affairs; which is meant by judging them and fighting their battailes. And then, by their proposing herein <hi>to be like other Nations,</hi> whose Kings (it is well known) had at that time absolute Soveraignty, the condition of perfect subjection will be farther manifest.</p>
               <p>And again, in desiring a King in the place of Judges (who already had supreme authority as far as positive law went) must farther imply their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of an extraordinary obedience, to this new and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power. For when <hi>Samuel</hi> tells them that now God <hi>was their King</hi> (meaning that in all extraordinary and urgent occasions his advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was to be sought) and they notwithstanding this, chusing to have a King, it makes that absolute degree of submission yet more apparent, which was to be given to this high Officer, who should succeed in this Divine place of Authority: which, as it might subject them to many unavoidable mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries when evil Kings came, so, on the other hand, they might foresee much benefit to ensue when good ones came: as it proved shortly after, in the days of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, untill this latter age of the world, that men through vulgar and popular flattery, could be brought both to forget Gods precepts and their own reason, such Maximes and positions as are now frequent in the mouths of some seditious persons, would have been abandoned as undutiful, aswell as scorned as ridiculous. It would have sounded strange in their ears, to have heard men affirm, <q>That they had contrived a way of limitation for Kings; whereby he should yet have all power left him to do good unto his people, but none at all to hurt them:</q> and yet, such is our present aversion to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the hasty and inconsiderate swallowing down of such like Maxims for the limitation of Monarchical Power, hath been the cause of all our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like disturbances. All which right reason must say we are ever in danger of, whilst Soveraignty is not entire, and perfect in the person it ought to be.</p>
               <p>For what, shall he have such power of doing good, as it shall not be in the power of others to hinder it? if so, then (supposing him a voluntary Agent) you must also suppose, that (if he think fit) he hath power of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing it; and so doth ill, by not doing good. Or, if he work as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and necessary Agent, by the force and impulsion of another, then is the power of doing good, to be properly ascribed where this direction is: because the Ministerial Vertue or Power of the instrument, may be thereby implyed other wayes, or not at all.</p>
               <p>And so, if you make him to carry the same force in the work of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Carpenters chizel doth in all his work; then, how shall a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Agent be imagined such? or what is the difference of the Kings power, from that of the meanest subject; when he must do so as he is directed, and no otherwise? And so lastly, how can that be called good, which is done necessarily and unwillingly?</p>
               <p>But these things will be best seen by instance. The power of each kingdom is in the Militia: now, as he that hath power hereof, may benefit the kingdom by the invasion of another, or by defence of his own; and as he may use the same at home, in maintenance of laws and equity against opposers, so may he thereby do the contrary. Whereupon Reason and Experience tells
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55976:49"/>
us, how ridiculous this their device is. For since the Militia must be somwhere, and of absolute power, if it be not in one mans hand, it will be in more. What will they then be the neer? will they now set some in trust over these again? to the end, that as those were trusted above the King, to hinder him from doing wrong, so these again, shall have power to be over them, that they abuse not that their power, which they before had over the King? when will they have done setting of watchmen upon watchmen? and must they not be men still that they shall so entrust? In which respect being alike sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to transgress, will they not necessarily be more in danger of injury being now under the power of many, then they were before while under one?</p>
               <p>And truely, they that thus can fancy a possibility, of stating a person in such a condition, as he should alwayes have power to do good, must next contrive him such a will, as he shall be doing it also; or else this power is but vain: because he may do ill in forbearing it. And they again, that (on the other side) would take from him all power to do evil, and yet think he may be all this while a voluntary Agent, do in both respects, seem to me to condemn God Almighty of imprudence or injustice, in not governing all men in the world, as these would do some in kingdoms: That is, not knowing how thus to take from men the power of doing ill, without taking from them (thereby also) the power of doing well; but suffering sin thus need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly to raigne in the world.</p>
               <p>Out of what hath been hitherto spoken, we may gather the reason, both for the establishment of Monarchy, and also for annexing unto it those ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute degrees of Soveraignty; not to be wrested or alienated from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Prince by any of his subjects: who cannot, without overthrow of Monarchy, be such sharers or engrossers of the Soveraignty, as under pretence of bridling him from evil, <hi>To say unto him what dost thou</hi>? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath power by his Office to do <hi>whatsoever pleaseth him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 8.4 Verse 3.</note> To which end, we may also see the reason, why Oaths of obedience and subjection are by subjects taken, as for other ends, so, in case of resistance, to take their part against all others: The people being for this very subjection sake, called the subjects of such and such Kings. And this Oath, in regard it is made in Gods name and presence, and in regard it is the tye and obligation to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine policy and peace, and thereby humane preservation (the end of God also) it is called the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to Kings are we to give obedience, <hi>not onely for wrath, but for conscience sake:</hi>

The chief is (that so largely heretofore spoken of, namely) the sword of Justice, or the last appeal, aswel in Religious as Civil Causes: and is inseparable, and incommunicable.

                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.25.</note> which power to free, must suppose a power to impose.</p>
               <p>The next is to make Magistrates and state officers: for he having delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, and being the common Fountain and Center of power, their power must be but derivative and part of his. The next is, to make peace and war: all of them comprehended under those general terms of submission, mentioned in the Jews first election of their Kings: namely <hi>to judge them and fight their battailes.</hi> And,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.20.</note> as for the other more separable and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable markes; of receiving homage, coynage and valuing the mony, weights, and measures, to grant Letters of Mart; to have Crown and Scepter; to have titles, additions, and donations of honor; as they may be sometimes but complemental, so may they be comprehended under some of the more general and express markes before spoken: for if he have the last appeal, and be in all causes, and over all persons and estates in his dominions supream head and governor, it will follow, that he is so also in these.</p>
               <p>Although in the passed Treatise the name of King be only commonly used, yet what is spoken of him is to be applied unto Monarchy in general; under what other title of Emperor, Prince, Duke, Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so they be free and holding of God onely. For unto the Monarch, in right of his Office, and not to the name, is the Power and Soveraignty due: even as the head of the

family, is, in relation to his wife called husband, to his children father, to his servants Master, and yet is the same person: so, if a Duke or Lord (as those of <hi>Edom</hi> and the Philistins sometimes were) be absolute, their smalness of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory debars not their right to Monarchy; more then the Master of a less Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to be in his Office of government, as absolute as he that hath a greater. And the like may be said of a Soveraign Officer in a Commonwealth also, if he be supreme and not accountable to any one earth for his actions: as was that famous <hi>Cesar,</hi> and other the dictators in <hi>Rome.</hi> For whosoever hath the sole independent prerogative of <hi>Kan-ning,</hi> from which the word King is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, he is truely a King also; but so far as he hath not, his soveraignty, is so far defective, and Anarchy introduced: which shall be our next dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Anarchy.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hey that suppose the word to imply onely that state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men where no Government at all is exercised, will much to seek to finde out any instance or example for proof of their Assertion: or indeed, any possibility how it should at all come to pass. Therefore, that which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been spoken of the original of Government, in the fourth chapter of the precedent book, must be understood onely as supposing it to have its Reason in Nature, and that thereby it might have been known, although the same had been by no other light or positive Law found out and appointed: and not as determining that ever men were, or could be left by a careful God in such a confused condition, where, like a brood of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> wanting all manner of Breeding and Instruction, they should fall to the slaughter of one another; till their bleeding wounds, and not his Precepts or Providence, had taught them rules of Subjection. No, it would be too plain and great compliance with Athiesm to think Gods Omniscience in foreseeing, or his Goodness in preventing, so small or slack, as to leave man, a Creature upon whom (above all the rest) he had bestowed such workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and care, to the common hazard and condition of that which was meanest.</p>
               <p>Leaving therefore these fancies aside, that think men should (like swarms of Bees) be brought to choice of Policy without any foregone experience or knowledge of Government, we must make Government the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Anarchy. For so we finde, that while there were but two persons in the world, the woman, by special appointment, was to <hi>have her desires sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to her husbands, and he was to rule over her.</hi> And, as Wives,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note> so Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, were subject to the Father of the Family, in such sort, that no man, but, being either Head or Member of a Family, (by one rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or another) either had or yeilded subjection. And, even before Kings to finde an <hi>Ex Lex</hi> or person (like <hi>Caine</hi>) under no protection, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under no Government, was a vain attempt.</p>
               <p>And this prime or more natural Prerogative of Primo-geniture, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family, although it had not the name; yet it had the truth and reality of Monarchy: and that as well in the Authority as Unity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: as by that phrase,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>the father of the Moabites and Amonites to this day,</hi> may appear: which must signifie succcession of these Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, in right of the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that now, under the name of King, there is but a continuance and restitution of that ancient form, by change of the name from Pater <hi>Familiae,</hi> to <hi>Pater Patriae</hi>: importing a continuance of Power and Office, notwithstanding the encrease of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55976:53"/>
of Subjects. For the length of life that gave these Ancients advantage to see many Families peopled out of their own loyns, gave them also right of Government in chief.</p>
               <p>But this common Parent now dead, Pride, Covetousness, Ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> quickly clouded the respect due by birthright to the elder brother, who by the Law of God should <hi>rule over the other,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>and have their desires subject to him:</hi> and so, through stubbornness, did break that course which, if it had been observed, would have made Monarchy perpetual: but not being so, Anarchies succeed. For the divided Families, finde many occasions of controversie amongst themselves, which they, in their reputed equality of Jurisdiction, knew not how to determine: because, not submitting to that hereditary right (before spoken of) by the which <hi>Isaac</hi> had appointed <hi>Esau</hi> as servant to <hi>Jacob</hi> (as apprehending him the elder) and which <hi>Jacob</hi> also, for Peace-sake, gave to <hi>Judah</hi> amongst the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> (namely to be perpetual Law-giver) discord and dissention quickly broke in upon them. And this (no doubt) was the state of the old world before the flood; for we read not of any Monarchs; but that, as men began to multiply in the earth, so began they, for want of restraint, to be ruled onely by their own likings: which the heads of Tribes, for want of a common Head, exercising over one another as <hi>men of renown,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.11.</note> 
                  <hi>the whole earth came to be filled with violence.</hi> For although each Family had its Government within it self, and so all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one Government or other, yet, since there wanted a definitive sentence or Monarch to unite these Governors amongst themselves, they were in the true estate of Anarchy.</p>
               <p>But to <hi>Noah</hi> and his sons, that were to people the world afterwards, as these mischiefs were well known, so were they avoided. For after that the earth came to be so fully inhabited that now Families must interfere one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, and could not part peaceable as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> did, we finde them under Kings; as a necessary form for preservation of mankinde. Which blessed Government was ever accompanied with Gods promises of fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as before recited. But if, by accident, they were removed, these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in the sense of Antiquity, if without Kings, without Government also, and in the estate of Anarchy and confusion. And thereupon, we finde it threatned, <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.16. that before the overthrow of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel, the Land should be forsaken of both her Kings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And so much as will suffice to convince Anarchy to be absence of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, is in Holy Writ implyed, when, in the inter-regnum of the Judges, it is said,<note place="margin">Judges 17.6.</note> 
                  <hi>there was no King in Israel, but every man did that which was righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his own eyes.</hi> And yet were all men, at the same time, subject to the Fathers and chief of their Tribes; as appears by the act of the Danites: they had also the same Laws they had before for their direction. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was now no single judge, who might interpret and inforce this Law, and give direction and command in chief, it was reckoned a state of Anarchy.</p>
               <p>The like, at that time was imputed to the men of <hi>Laish</hi>; and made a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their easie destruction: <hi>for there was no Magistrate in the Land that might put them to shame in any thing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judges 18 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> Where, by Magistrate in the singular number, <hi>or heir of restraint</hi> (for so the original will bear) we may conceive their want of Monarchy was intended:<note place="margin">Prov 28 2.</note> for it was always esteemed as a <hi>wo to a Land when many were the Princes thereof.</hi> And indeed, is the punishment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55976:53"/>
of rebellion, for casting off the one first head, and so making many in their divided Factions and Tribes. And again, the state thereof is in the Text counted as preserved, by having one Prince: called there <hi>a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and knowledge.</hi> Meaning one of such capacity,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> as can act by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and not leave the kingdom to be governed by others, after Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick principles.</p>
               <p>They that think understanding and knowledge was here more pointed at then the unity of the person, will be then troubled to finde, why the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Princes should be disliked: since, in that respect, many understanding men must in quantity be more then one. And again, likely it was for one single person to want it, and almost impossible for a number of any greatness: whereupon it might, upon that supposition, have been set down, but by <hi>many men of understanding,</hi> &amp;c. But the truth is, the curse and malediction is in the word <hi>many</hi>; or else many understanding Princes might have been a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as well as one. But why this one Prince is here set down, on the other side, as <hi>a man of understanding,</hi> is because <hi>Princes that want understanding, are great oppressors:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov, 28.16.</note> and so could not be counted as the preservers of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Whereas we shall never finde the having of one Prince, as one, to be otherwise given then as a blessing: nor of many, as many, (and that in supreme Authority at once) to be otherwise given then as a punishment. It being for the inconvenience of being governed by Democratick prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in the interim of any Monarchs insufficiency, that makes the nonage and other disabilities of Princes come to be esteemed <hi>the Lands woe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 10.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For if, at all, the equal Government of Peers or People, either indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently amongst themselves, or as joyntly sharing therein with the King, had been good or commendable, then this nonage of the King, which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily produce it, should not have been reckoned as in it self <hi>a woe.</hi> But so we shall finde it undenyably to be accompted, if we look into the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Isa.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 3.4.</note> where God threatens the Jews to give them <hi>Children to be their Princes, and Babes to rule over them.</hi> And, in the next verse, tells the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential punishment that should follow the Anarchical rule of others in their names and rooms: <hi>viz. and the people shall be oppressed every one by another, and every one by his neighbor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> And there being want of power in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that should be the fountain of power and Government, it shall soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the inferior relations: so that <hi>the childe shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.</hi> But then,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> because these mischiefs had been by them observed to rise from want of Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power, <hi>a man shall take hold of his Brother of the house of his Father,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou hast cloathing, be thou our Ruler, and let this ruine be under thy hand.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6, <hi>&amp;c:</hi>
                  </note> But, because God had determined to punish them, they shall be herein denyed also.</p>
               <p>Which desolation, to follow the absence or inability of the Monarch, is again expressed in the twelfth verse, <hi>viz. as for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule ever them</hi>; under which notions <hi>of women and children</hi> oppressors, we are to conceive persons disabled in the execution of their Governments themselves, through personal disability, and want of power and judgement. For since, we cannot think women and children could do it most in their own persons, we must thereupon conceive their punishment &amp; oppression to arise from that divided, &amp; Aristocratick way of Government which the Nobility or others should act, by reason of this want of superior
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55976:54"/>
restraint. Whereupon, in the following verses, God, in the disability or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his Deputy, undertakes the cause of the oppressed himself: <hi>The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth up to judge the people: the Lord will enter into judgement with the ancient of his people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 13, 14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>and the Princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard, the spoile of the poor is in your houses: what mean you that you beat my people to pieces, and grinde the faces of the poor, saith the Lord of hosts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we look into the New-Testament, and the time of our Saviour, we shall finde, not onely this malediction actually removed from the world, by the presence of him that came <hi>not to destroy mens lives but to save them,</hi> but,<note place="margin">Luke 9.56.</note> it will also appear, that this error and absurdity of Polarchy was by that time so well known, that the fountain of truth makes the impossibility of its right in Government amongst men, to be the medium of his Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst admission of any equality in our subjection to God: for had it been true, that a man might have served more then one Master, his Argument had been nothing. And why he puts it in the notion of Master, and not of Prince, may be for that the Jews had not any Prince of their own at that time: nor was there any Polarchy elsewhere to make instance in, so as his Auditors might conceive how inconsistent plurality of Commanders is with that singleness which belongs to the duty of obedience. And therefore, although he instance in a Family, because to them best known, yet it propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably holds in all Governments: namely, that intireness of obedience can onely be from entireness of command. For else, I see not but a man may as well serve two or more Partners in a Family, as he may do Partners in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>But although our Saviour seem not to point against Polarchy expresly herein, yet St. <hi>James,</hi> that knew well his minde, and perceived the mystery of Antichristianism already working, doth it plainly; saying, <hi>My Brethren be not many Masters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</hi> Surely, he meant not by this word <hi>many,</hi> to forbid any man to be Master of his own Servants or Family: to which end, as he did allow more Families then one, so must he allow several Masters to them. Nor could he be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed generally to reprove Pride or any other Vice, as barely Vices.</p>
               <p>First, for that he, and others, used to name such crimes more plainly that all might know them: and next, for that such like Vices, being not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in any man at all, it had been more fit to have said be not any, then be not many. And therefore, I conceive the Master here meant, is that one publike supreme Commander, which is set over us: into which rank he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids any more then one to enter, when he saith, <hi>be not many.</hi> And, that his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was of these supreme Masters, will farther appear by the consequential guilt likely to follow in the great account of these publike Stewards, although rightfully undertaken; for <hi>in many things we offend all:</hi> that is, we have so many offences to answer for in our seperate and private callings already (in relation to things submitted to our own guidance) that we need not increase them by increase of our charge and trust.</p>
               <p>But, if any there be, that do yet doubt that these last alleadged Texts (prohibiting parity in command) do reach to Political or State Governors, because set down <hi>many Masters</hi> onely: or that the former alleadged <hi>woe</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> set down to attend the disability of the King, were not applyable to that disability which his subjects stubbornness did cause, as well as to that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55976:54"/>
which his natural incapacity did produce, let them here this wise man once again most plainly pronouncing them both: <hi>My son fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change: For their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity shall rise suddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both.</hi> The first verse expresly points out the onely Officer and person who, next unto God, we are to make the object of our highest obedience and fear: and the other, plainly sets forth the woe and ruine following, both to the seditious and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>They that would interpret the prohibition against sedition and change here set down, as also the fore-recited punishment of <hi>many Princes for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Land,</hi> not to import the admission of Polarchy in the place of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but the change of Princes one after another; do then (thereupon) confess, that all Lands and People that practise such seditious courses are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: inasmuch as fear and obedience to an evil King might else have been excepted; and subjects themselves allowed to change him <hi>for a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:</hi> without consideration that they were blessings or punishments sent and set over us by God onely.</p>
               <p>If it had been said, <hi>For the wickedness of a Land many are the evil Princes thereof,</hi> or, <hi>my son fear the present good King, and meddle not with them that would change him for another</hi>; then we might well indeed have thought, the words <hi>many, and change,</hi> to import succession. But then, why should not many Princes or men of understanding, ruling successively or at once, be set down as a blessing and preservative to a state, as well as one? For, if understanding make the blessing, as in it self, there will (as before noted) be more in this many, then in one. And lastly, what evasion will they finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the prohibition of <hi>many masters</hi>? What, must it intend suddain suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession too? and so tolerate <hi>many</hi> at once to be in equal command, either in the Family or elsewhere: in such sort, as we might <hi>serve God and Mammon</hi> both at once, but not presently one after another, so as to change <hi>Mammon</hi> to serve God?</p>
               <p>No certainly, the word <hi>many</hi> can admit of no such wresting; especially being put in the present Tense by <hi>are,</hi> it must plainly denote them to be such as are to be at the same time, and all at once; and not such as shall, or have been successively raigning, and so may come to be called many, in respect of those many ages and times wherein they reigned. For if so, how shall we do to state and compute any Lands Malediction, for want of a determinate present time wherein these <hi>many Princes</hi> might be said to raign, more then, then at another time? For if succession be unhappiness, then are all Lands so. It is not therefore to be doubted, but that <hi>Solomon</hi> intended Polarchy by <hi>many,</hi> as the plainest expression he could give thereof: having not learnt his wisdom from their Schools, where the notions of Aristocracies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies were invented.</p>
               <p>Or, if the word <hi>many</hi> should be thought importing that condition of any people wherein many competitors are at once striving for the Regality, so as to introduce Civil War, then is the malediction confessed to be want of Monarchy. For although it be the height of Polarchical mischief to be in actual Civil War, and in open Arms, yet it takes not off the cause thereof from being malediction too: which is that faction and siding, which must always be where many Governors are at once.</p>
               <p>But if any there be, who, from Gods permission of these Governments

to be in the world, do therefore think them lawful; and so are slow to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret any place of Scripture to make against them, there is no better way to discover their partiality to these forms above Monarchy, then by supposing the one to be put in the others stead; and so to think with themselves, if it had been said, <hi>For the wickedness of a Land one is the Prince thereof, but by many men of understanding the state thereof is preserved:</hi> and so also, <hi>My son fear God and this or that sort of Polarchy,</hi> &amp;c. whither they would not (thereupon) have more readily concluded against Monarchy, then now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Polarchy?</p>
               <p>And hence (as our Preface noted) we may observe that there is not in Scripture to be found the mention of any people without a King; nor can any other Record instance in any state of eminence, which oweth not its foundation to that form of policy. For it was after-times onely, that, as the inordinate lusts of men began more to abound, so sought they to be rid of restraint: and therefore by little and little strived to take wholly away, or clip the wings of Majesty: that under pretence of ruling by Law, and so interpreting and ruling those Laws by themselves, they might at last be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no rule at all. And now come Aristocracies and Democracies, being but Anarchies, and onely differing in number of Commanders from one another, to be called Governments lawful, against all Reason. For since po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical government must be onely where there is a distinct relation in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Governors and governed, here they are both the same, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that they are not to be known one from another, and so cannot be rightly called Governments.</p>
               <p>For Government is then onely, when the Governor, as Agent, and the governed, as Patient, stand reciprocally ready to operate towards the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors ends.</p>
               <p>Towards the Governors ends I say, for so far as the Patient or governed, hath design respective to it self in any thing, it cannot be called passive or subject, but active rather; and so no Government. And although Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be in degree more or less, in comparison of one government to another, as the vertue of Agency and Patibility stand in measure increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or remitted, yet doth the due execution of smaller commands make go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as the greater; and obedience to the smaller Prince is as truly constitutive of Government, as to the greatest; whilst his Subjects stand to their powers ready to receive and obey his Laws. For albeit that Government, being an active quality, ows its chief essence to the Governor, from whence it did at first proceed and take force, yet since this active qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not of force to act otherwise then as in the Patient, as its proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it cannot therefore be called government farther then that Correlate the Patient or Subject stands reciprocally fitted to admit the Governors power and impression. Fitted I say it must be hereunto, according to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as aforesaid, so as to work as the Agent or Governor shall see cause: which fitness doth then constitute Government to be and continue, even whilst there is no real execution according to the vertue thereof. For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be while this Agency is not outwardly exercised, but cannot at all be where the relations themselves are not distinctly and properly ready and kept up to act according to occasions.</p>
               <p>So that now, in the confused fabrick of these Polarchies, we can by no means finde true Government, as being so disabled to finde where to fixe and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55976:55"/>
place this active quality of governing, and the passive quality of governed. For we shall not onely finde it uncertain whether the people or their own Magistrates and Senate are Governors, because sometimes the people or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned are really taking on them to act their own wills as chief, but also (supposing the Government in the Senate) it will be still as hard so to fix it there, as to make it to be Government.</p>
               <p>For in that fancied equality which they have in power to one another, who shall be superior? and if the persons in the major Vote be Soveraigns, and the lesser Vote and the rest of the people Subjects, who shall then be Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns when these major voters come, by variety of occasions, to be many of them on the minor side? will not this render both relations, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it self thereupon founded, to be a thing unfixed and uncertain; or but Anarchy new-named? For the whole body cannot be Soveraigns, because the minor part must be still subject to the major: which major part again, having no personal or certain assurance it shall continue so, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment also may be so, or not so; and consequently, the same persons be Governors or not, as occasions shall lead them. Take then away, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle the relation of Governors, and that of governed will cease and be unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also.</p>
               <p>And whereas, again, Monarchies receive their main assurance from the mutual oaths between Governor and governed, where are the Oaths between State and people, as between Monarch and people? do they swear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Laws, or do the people swear to them Alleagiance? Or if God be omitted, as not seemly to call him in as party or witness to a mock Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so unlike his, then the trust must be supposed implicite from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to them; and so to pass with their election. Whereupon, since this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and trust is to the several and particular members, all alike, and equal, as they came to be chosen, how can some Members, under a minor Vote be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, without breach of that trust whereby they had equal power? Or was the trust to the whole joyntly (which is yet hard to be conceived since they must be elected personally and severally) how can a Major Vote ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>John, Will: Thomas,</hi> and it may be a hundred more of equal trust to themselves? To say they trusted a major is unconceiveable; because trust follows Election, and Election must have a personal and definite, and not a notional object: such as a Major Vote is; which must be always contingent and unfixed.</p>
               <p>And, if this major Vote have not its power from Election, how comes it to have it? or, how differs it from the tyranny of Anarchy, which is of all tyranny the worst? for every man is herein <hi>oppressed of his neighbour,</hi> and the weaker and fewer in continual vexation of the stronger and more in number: with this aggravation also, that herein they seem remediless;<note place="margin">Isa. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their many oppressors, (for so the major part must be) have the countenance of Justice for what they do. They that tell us, <q>that since it is requisite that all controversies should be ended, it is therefore fit that a major part should be taken as the whole: forasmuch as in few, or no cases u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal assent being to be expected, without this rule, no decision, or opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of the Assembly could be had.</q> But then, I pray, what necessity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your selves into such a condition of Government as must put you to this necessity? Indeed this collection of a major Vote is many times neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and good in Parliaments, and Assemblies in Monarchies; where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55976:56"/>
and opinions of the whole Council can no otherwise appear to the Prince, who for that cause assembled them: and where he himself, representing the whole people joyntly, shall in the determination, afterwards be on which side he pleaseth: and so leave none uninterressed, or unconsenting: Joyntly I say, for that in him onely, as being but one person, there can be an united and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral consent and representation. For, if that rule be true, that what is the concern of all should have the consent of all, how shall these Shires and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs that come now, as minor voters, to have their Representatives over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, be obliged to the determinations of a major Vote, not by them ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or entrusted, if by their joynt subordination to the Monarch, who did before give them power thus to elect, they stood not still obliged?</p>
               <p>So that, they that alleadge a major Vote ought of it self to prevail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is to be presumed that, in case of opposition, even by by strength it would so fall out, where is then their Government founded on pretended consent, if meer force must be the rule? For what think they shall become of Equity, which alone should take place, as having Reason and Wisdom for its guide? what doth Equity and Reason so abound, as that the major part of men in general, or of any Society in particular should be always the juster and wiser? if not, what do we but endanger to <hi>follow a multitude to do evil, and speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgement.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23.2.</note> For if the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor side must acquiesse, onely because it is the minor and weaker in number and power, what differs this from the Government of Beasts and Fishes: which prevail not by strength of Reason or Argument, but by force of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and number? Again, if the fewer must be always overborn and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who shall govern the other? Or, how can the major part be without subjection or government, and yet the whole State or Society be truely said to be governed? And while they shall pretend to determine the differences of the people, who shall have power to determine theirs? Will they set a major Vote upon a major Vote, or will they (as most usually) remain so many <hi>Ex Lex,</hi> or unbridled persons, in pursuit of their own Wills onely?</p>
               <p>In a word, in this fained Government or political Paction, how can Peace or Unity be expected, where it is not so much as designed in shew or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? For, whereas the submission of all in general to some kinde of coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive and superior power is in Government on all hands necessary, here the greater part are exempted and left at liberty. And where political order ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points an Union in the body, by means of an Union in the head, in Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy the head is made of many; and, by a monstrous deformity, made big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the body. And where again, in Monarchy the whole people are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Prince, and he to God (so that there remains but one personate Liberty as to the Laws of the Kingdom) here the greater part have no Laws to restrain them; but, according to the dictates of unbridled Nature good and bad, Justice and injustice; are at their own determination.</p>
               <p>Against which, it will be bootless to object that the good of the major part is in reason to be preferred to that of the fewer, for that none will deny, supposing it in things equally concerning them: but who shall judge of that, when, instead of one person, of common concern and interest in the whole people, one faction shall thus be still judging another, and so, reckoning themselves the whole State, endeavor the subversion of their opposites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conceit of publike detriment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:55976:56"/>But that which is most direct to shew this Government null or unlawful, is their want of Authority. For their deriving power from the people onely, must argue they s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill want it: because the people having it not themselves, they cannot (as elsewhere proved) give it to others. For how can the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple give power to the people, more then a man can be said to give power to himself? whereupon, these Polarchs, having no mission from God, or Authority from that rule of Government by him set down, how can they be but in their administrations tyrannical; and be in danger, when they put any man to death, to commit murther with the sword of Justice?</p>
               <p>And where again, it is alleadged, <q>That all power is founded in the Will, and that voluntary submission makes Authority lawful and tolerable; </q>these forms are but so in pretence, and carry on their executions by continual and irresistable terror and force, in regard of their number not to be withstood. Whereas the single Prince, can be obeyed but voluntarily; according as sense of Loyalty, Duty, or Love shall direct: and when, or so far as he shall use force, so as to be called tyranny or oppression, this must arise as he makes use of a major number or strength, and by the force of other men prevails against a minor part which he thinks fit to punish: but as King, or as one person in himself considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he can never be but voluntarily obeyed.</p>
               <p>For it is the gross vulgar mistake, that because there is in some Republikes freedom to elect Representatives allowed to the people by such as sway in the present domineering faction, that therefore they are also free and personally consenting in what these Representatives do. And under this flattering dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise popular Orators prevail: affirming, that as we singly cannot will to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy or harm our selves, so communities also cannot be supposed to injure themselves. <q>For although (say they) they should enact a Law of some universal damage, yet since their enacting of it must conclude this damage was to them insensible, they cannot therein be harmful to themselves in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or injurious to others in particular. Not harmful to themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon any experience thereof they may alter it; not injurious to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because, according to the foresaid supposition, each one being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, the Maxim of <hi>volenti non fit injuria</hi> acquits them thereof.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth, these formal Elections can never be general nor free: nor can the particular actings and Laws of Governors be any more stiled the voluntary actings of the governed, then any other arbitrary Authoriry (for such it must be, if it be any) can be called the voluntary act of such as must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey.</p>
               <p>But, when they say a Community cannot harm it self, the falacy lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Community. For they would have it comprehend in our conceits the whole people: as though each one should be still personally acting and consenting in all things concerning their own harm or benefit. It is true this community of Trustees and Representatives (who indeed usually make themselves signifie the whole Community) can never (as taking them to be of one minde and interest) hurt themselves irremediably: but why may they not, nay why must they not (as a separate body) have a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate interest from the people under them, and so joyn for enacting such things as may concern their power or riches in general? And why must they not again, as having several proprieties and seperate places of Honor and Power of their own to seek, (seperate from these of their fellow Senators) and divide amongst themselves likewise, and also divide the people, by siding to gain
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55976:57"/>
and joyn a major Vote to attain them? at which time (truely) those that are of that part of the Community which is on the minor and weaker side, will think and finde themselves harmed, although the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor community, taking on them to be the whole community, do not hurt it self.</p>
               <p>And whereas the preservation of Peace and Unity of Society, consists in the Unity of the definitive Sentence, here, through the many heads, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be: Or if, as to the definitive part, they say there may be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by collection of major Votes: It is true so indeed, that there is an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the major Vote to that purpose; but is there not another Union in the minor Vote also against the major? and then it will come to pass, that this Affirmative and Negative Unions (as contrary to one another) will make a plain disunion: and so, this supposed great head of the State be two heads at least; and consequently, this political body, being divided also, it cannot resemble the natural; which is therefore called individual.</p>
               <p>Nor can there be any firm Unity here expected; because the true cause and foundation thereof is wanting: in that they can never look on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proprieties, or theirs below them with equal concern and interest, as the Monarch doth to the generality of his Subjects. For he, having his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and profit arising from all in general and each one in particular, is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all alike: whereas they unite and agree but out of necessity. For at first, whilst they were yet rising, and were called factions, they were united in their several interest by hope of common gain, and now having attained it, they settle upon this confederacy through a common fear of losing it. So that hope chiefly unites Factions, and fear chiefly keeps them so, and settles Anarchies. Because, if their hope of gain, by overthrowing their own former Authority, had not exceeded their fear of so doing, they had not associated ar first; and so now if their common fear of loss from a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority did not exceed their present hopes of gaining from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would not so continue.</p>
               <p>And farther, if in States the major part be the whole; why have not the Magistrates and Decrees their derivative Power from them onely? If they be not the whole, as indeed no part can be the whole, (but that it is necessary for more fulness of power that the acts proceed in the name of the whole) how come the lesser and absent parties, which might perhaps together make the major, to be rightly brought in to authorise those actions that are not theirs, but done against their consents? So that, to make an Unity in this head or definitive sentence, since the whole body of them and each one severally was alike trusted, there must be first a full Union of consent amongst themselves: and then, no remedy but to serve them as the Cardinals in the Popes election, that is, to keep them immured without Light or Food till they agree. At which time, it may be, the minor side will be as likely to overcome the major by their gift of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, as the major would have before probably done them by force. But as this would make the Office of a Statesman little desired, so would it give causes a slow dispatch: and yet, till it be done, I see not how the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the major part can carry the sense of the whole, so as to make the whole and a part to be but the same thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:55976:57"/>Again, if acts must pass in the name of the whole, as the body intrusted; and in nature and reason more worthy then a part, why must not an appeal proceed so also? And since they which bring their causes thither, bring them to the whole assembly, until they have their unamous verdict, they have not what they came for: their trust to the whole being but in part satisfied. Nay, if things be well considered, they never or seldome have the major sence of the Senate neither; for to omit external force (which is wont to awe them) if there were such an equal number deducted from the major side as will answer those on the minor that disagreed from the major in opinon, there will be (many times) so inconsiderable a number of persons left to make the odds, that one would think it strange that three or four men should be held for, and represent the whole Senate. And yet it must so usually be with such, that instead of multitude of Councellors, would have multitude of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; whereupon all Publike debates come to be managed as in a kind of Lottery, which none knows the issue of, until the casting up of Votes be taken.</p>
               <p>For none can say that reason doth at all prevaile there, as of it self, but as swayed by heat of passion and contention: not by weight or number of arguments, but by noise or number of voices. And this, because in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the issue of the debate, the reasons or arguments given by either side are not left to be considered of by those that are to take the resolutions of the Senate or Parliament, but the greater number of persons on either side doth constantly of it self so prevaile, as it cannot be called the reasonable, but accidental or occasional result or determination of such or such a counsel. Which is only avoidable, where one person of power hath liberty to give his reasonable sentence and judgement therein: and that, according as he shall finde the force of the reasons given on either side to prevaile: and not to be any way tyed to the blind hazard of number. One person he must be, and that of power above them also. For if they be more, you shall fall into the same hazard again, of having their sentence and debate ended by meer force and number also. And if this one person have not sole power, but be obnoxious unto any; then terror from without, and not reason from within may again sway his determination.</p>
               <p>But it is answered, <q>That the major part is representatively the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as the whole Senate is representatively the whole people.</q> But how (I pray) can this be brought to pass? how can a shaddow make a shaddow, or deputies make deputies? Whence can the major part derive their power? Not from the people, they trusted the whole; not from the minor part, for they oppose them, and cannot give what they have not. Why did not the major Vote of the eleven Tribes pretend to this right against <hi>Benjamen</hi>? No, they knew they could not of right assume the power of the whole of themselves, they being but a part; therefore, in absence of their Judges (the next united whole on earth) they take power and authority from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereof, namely from God himself: by whose assent and direction they came to be enabled herein: and until then, their resolutions in their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies had no rightful power for execution; but should have been reckoned amongst other Anarchical acts of self-liking, as wanting lawful authority otherwise to impose on their brethren and equals. And if delegates have not this power of delegation in themselves, where is it expressed or warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their originals, the People? And therefore, supposing the voice and determination of the whole Senate may be of force to binde the people, as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55976:58"/>
having their power vertually in their several members by them chosen to that purpose, yet this domineering power of a major Vote will prove unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: as having nothing of the pretended paction and consent, or political as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation therein: whose end and aime was chiefly protection, or defending the minor or weaker side against the stronger, if justice so required: at least, not to suffer the major part to judge of their own cause: but to appoint a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive and certain determination, that might be above all orders, numbers, and degrees.</p>
               <p>So that Anarchy is where the major and stronger do alwayes govern the less and weaker; and is it self not subject to any third differenced authority. And true policy is where this tyrannical force is avoided, and that, by a just submision of the major, aswel as of the minor, unto a third common and indivissible judge: who thereupon becomes stronger then them both. And, although in all disputes there must be disagreement, and a major and minor side, yet he being the vertual whole, and both parts submitting to him, union and peace must follow. Till this be done, nature is not holpen by policy. For, if government imply no more then the exercise of force or power, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable onely to such rules as the stronger shall judge fitting, beasts have it aswel as men: who by numbers and strength prevaile upon one another. But, unto men, this decision seemed too unreasonable: For they found it on all hands prejudicial. Inasmuch, as themselves that were on the major side in one case, might anon be on the minor in another: and that then, as they would be themselves protected from violence being weak, so they should not inflict or use it being strong. They found that, whilst this way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing was continued, men studied not equity, but association: not to get right, but force and numbers on their side. And they found, that, as each man judgeth for himself, so did each faction and party also. In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies the dangers of mens lives were more to be feared (in relation to the whole State) whilst they thus contended in multitudes, then while they strove singly: as set battailes destroy more then duels, and the two Israelites striving in <hi>Moses</hi> time before the Law, made not equal destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the combination of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> against each other after the Law.</p>
               <p>On all sides they confessed, that right, and not force should prevaile in decision: but who should judge of this right? Would not each party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it? was it to be expected that either should say we contend for what belongs not to us? Therefore, while this course held, right had no certain aboad in causes or persons, but fleeted up and down as the major side did. Should any third person interpose, out of charity, and to reconcile them, both sides would answer as the said Israelite to <hi>Moses, Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us</hi>?<note place="margin">Exod.2 14.</note> They had (no doubt) the Rules of Do as thou wouldst be done unto, or because I would receive no harm I should therefore do none; With such other common maximes of equity amongst men: and these, from the very first, acknowledged and assented unto. They had (no doubt) customes and rules of decision; besides other positive laws to that purpose. But to what availe? For those rules and laws, which should decide their quarrels, needed decision themselves: because each one pretended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted them for himself. Therefore, till they placed some supreme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to interpret their law, unto whom, as unto the last appeal in all questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all persons, assemblies, orders and degrees besides might be subordinate
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55976:58"/>
and inferiour, Anarchy was not avoided. Neither was any law then of just force; but, on the contrary, when seeming Law and equity was now easily assumed by a major vote and faction, it was heightned and established.</p>
               <p>And if any should argue, <q>That, since the number of contenders in these state assemblies are not to be presumed so great as when before the people judged themselves, and that therefore, the danger and mischief to follow the disagreements will probably not be so great and general.</q> We will therefore suppose them least, namely an Aristocracy or Oligarchy of two persons: yet the danger of disagreement will be then most. Suppose them (for peace sake) three; because two being alwayes on a side, it will probably scare the third to agreement: yet then, will not there be the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual terror of a major part upon the minor? wil not the force be equal, or more as of 2 against one, of the 1000 people against 600, or of 40 <hi>Senators</hi> against 30? In which cases, the people, by their elections and resignations, have not lost, but changed their miseries. For first, the manner and fear of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is the same amongst their pretended peacemakers now, as it was with them before: and the mischief in prosecution thereof is not abated nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: because in then disagreements the people cannot secure themselves as lookers on: they cannot shift their own interests: but will in the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ention be engaged on one side or other.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is now manifest, that Anarchy is not want of government, but want of unity: and, being the same with Poliarchy, is not where no governors are (for no people can be so) but where there is equality and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alike, or in more then one as the word or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ginally doth import. As in the Inter-regnum of the Judges (before mentioned) because there was no single authority or King in Israel, it was said <hi>Every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> It could not be meant of single persons: for as they belonged to some Tribe or other, so were they unde the authority of the Fathers thereof; but of the plurality of governors, and their equality amongst themselves: whereby the leaders (not their whole tribes following them) did what seemed good in their own eyes, vvithout any controle or coercive povver above them. And Anarchy is vvhere such equal authorities are, as while some condemn others may acquit: so that, at the end, it will be, as with the people of <hi>Laish</hi> in their inter-regnum, <hi>Wherein was no Magistrate that should put them to shame for any thing.</hi> And is onely avoidable, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting one governor with unrepealable power of punishment and protection. For as in a family, whose head is wanting or otherwise disabled, although the wife, children, or some more eminent person may (as they can raise strength by faction and association) exercise authority over the rest, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this cannot be called the right government, that family is in the true state of Anarchy; as being destitute of its head: as is also that state or Kingdome, which hath the like want.</p>
               <p>And lastly, Anarchy is worse after the abandoning or removal of this unity in government, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en is the approach or preparation to it: as a relapse is worse in our natural bodies, then a state of recovery. And so it is also where the factions are fevver, then vvhere they are more: as appears by the former example, vvhen all Israel vvas on the one side, and all <hi>Benjamin</hi> on the other. For, as all Anarchy is disunion or division of the whole body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke, so is the division of it into two parts most dangerous: because, being therein wholy in contrary parties interessed, they will want a third (as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55976:59"/>
to unite them. Whereas, in petty and more divisions and factions, there cannot be so strong contrarieties and eager engagements of emnity: because, as two cannot be contrary to one, nor parties disagreeing amongst themselves will not so probably unite against a third which doth but so too, there may be hope that others may escape as being but lookers on, and equally well willers, or averse to both.</p>
               <p>All this past discourse I foreknow cannot but extremly offend many, whom interest or ignorance have hitherto blinded with the specious shews and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of that freedom which these imitations of government make such boast of. So readily it falls into every mans fancy, that since he is hereby impowered to be acting and consenting to all that shall be done, his share of advantage will be great. Not considering, that he can no wayes be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged without his fellows loss; and then, where is general freedome? Not thinking that as thus, under shew of liberty, he aimes at power to act his liking upon others, so he yeilds others the like advantage against himself: Insomuch, as he can neither chuse to act according to every ones command, nor but to suffer at every ones dispose. But however, I, that was to treat of policy and government in its divine and natural foundation, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humane authority and example, cannot be blamed (as I formerly said) for leaving these out of the number; when I found them not warranted thereby. For in government (as government) I finde one must govern another; but here, every one is aiming to be governing himself: which, if it be not Anarchy (as being but the first natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) I know not what is, nor where to finde any such thing. Neither could I, as I conceive, be true to my design of setling publike peace, without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of these forms. For the very conceit of their justice and lawfulness, and the hope to attain and be sheltered under them, is the most usual and ready cause of civil disturbance and insurrections, and of subjects associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against their Prince. And many (without doubt) are of the same mind; who yet, in a kinde of flattering modesty, as loath to condemn the practise of so many, that do or say otherwise, are unwilling to express themselves in so plain a truth.</p>
               <p>Nor could these forms have bin so readily fancyed by so many men, eminent both for goodness and Learning, had not the mischiefs and absurdities thence arising been hastily clouded in each ones conceit, by the hope he had that in these general meetings himself should still prevaile by those reasonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions he had to make, tending evidently to the Publike good and his own honor: and that therefore, in order to both, he had just reason to cry them up. Forgetting all that while, how likely it was he might be mistaken in his proposals himself, or else might be unapprehended by his auditors: how that others might, in these assemblies, prevaile aswel as himself, and those of the worser sort aswell as the others. But, most of all forgetting, how, by the obtaining this his conceit and supposition of any one mans prevalence, he should quite overthrow the other supposition of a community in government. For, since many cannot speak at once, if some one mans advice do not take place, there can be no administration or government at all; if one man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly do so, then is that person a true Monarch, because the most absolute Monarch can aske no more then to have his councel followed. And indeed, as Anarchies are no farther capable of councel or execution in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then as they are Monarchical, so they, coming to be occasionally led by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55976:59"/>
their popular orators and heads, are but unfixed Monarchies: being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon so much more ill, as more unfixed. For, while they decline the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and guidance of one mans will, they are thereby enthralled to the lust of all.</p>
               <p>There is also a great occasion taken for casting off Monarchy, from that ready apprehension each one hath, that where the Soveraignty is taken from one and put into many, he hath great probability of being one of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and the more especially, in regard of that high degree of desert and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty every man is in his own opinion endued with above others. Not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how, through the like partial respect and expectations of others, he might fail hereof: and then should he come to have many masters instead of one. Nay, not considering, how afterwards the many crossings of his will to be received from his fellows in Office, would, as coming from equals, or such to whom he held himself superiour in birth or merit, be more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some then from superiors already acknowledged. But there being a farther and longer discourse required to foresee those evils that would follow to each one from this parity in command, then there is to apprehend the pleasure and benefit to arise from the command and power it self, and because again po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives sway us beyond privatives, it is no wonder if men, in their thirst after Polarchical governments, come to be affected as men with lotteries: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, although we do, or might beforehand know the certain loss that must ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally befall the Casters, yet shall we alwayes finde multitudes venturing that way: as being so hastily carryed on by the imagination of his present share of those prizes which may befall him, that he considers not (withall) those many chances that may fall out otherwise.</p>
               <p>There is another great inducement for entertainment of these Anarchies, for that vulgarly men are led to conceive that the Commonweal doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the same with the Polarchs themselves that do therein bear sway: and this, because these States-men are wont to act all their designs in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths name. But, if men would well consider it, these tearms of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealh,</hi> and <hi>Publike</hi> good are but bare political notions, not living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, capable of address or interest: and that they are not otherwise man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable, or to be represented or collected into a sum or total, then as in relation to the persons therein intrusted: so that, as they shall have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests more or less united amongst themselves, and are more or less com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of the whole, so will the good of the Commonwealth be more or less convertible with theirs. And therefore, since the Polarchs cannot act but as separate persons, differing in interest from one another (for when they do make a major vote it is but what fear or hope did first make them agree to in order to their distinct interests) therefore their good can neither be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal amongst themselves, nor can the good of the Commonweal be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible with them all in general.</p>
               <p>As for example, suppose the whole riches or stock of any place to be ten hundred thousand pound; and that the present Polarchs may in their several proprieties contain the half thereof, it must fall out, that, although in that respect they shall know the loss or good of the whole will involve that of their particulars, yet, it happening that in all Publike debates some part of the whole is more concerned then another, they must consequently be induced to favour that part most wherein their particulars are most involved: and they will generally chuse, rather to have their half encreased by one third part out
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55976:60"/>
of their subjects wealth, then to have their subjects wealth to be generally encreased one third part more then it was by any foraign acquisition whereof themselves have no share. And this, because they being but separate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, cannot have whole interest: In which regard also, each one amongst them, will again be ready to joyn in faction against others of his fellows; &amp; rather desire to have his own private stock of riches or honor to be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one third part out of theirs, then to assent to any thing that may double that of all the rest of his fellows; or of the whole people, without encrease of his own. From which it plainly appears that men are but deluded with this notion of a <hi>Commonwealth</hi>: as thinking there can be under Polarchy of any sort such an unity of interest or agreement as really to make but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Whereas, in truth, there are to be found in all places and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries governed under the name of Republikes or Commonwealths, as many Commonwealths and Republiks as there are parties and factions: whilst each of them is taking to it self the name of the whole, and pursuing their more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct interests under that notion.</p>
               <p>Which things can never happen unto an unlimited Monarch; whose honor and riches being in the whole, and inseparably subsisting by, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing and diminishing with that of his people in general, it must follow that his care will be led to respect the whole good; as having his and that convertible: in such sort, that he cannot lose any part of his whole kingdom, but he will himself be a proportionable loser. Whereas the Polarchs propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and interests being no higher in the whole, then in reference to their part, they cannot but respect this their part in the first place, and the whole but in order thereunto.</p>
               <p>But the truest ground for Scholastical mens entertaining this opinion, is that they have derived it, as also that other opinion of paction from the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Philosophers: who, being all of them born and bred in Republikes, it is no wonder if we finde them, in self-regard, so ready to commend something these forms: as not daring to gainsay the practice of their own country. From whom therefore we receiving in a manner all our Philosophy and opinions, and this amongst the rest, it is no marvail if from thence, and the general hope of share of power hence arising (as formerly noted) we are so inclinable to the defence thereof. Yet truely, unto any that considers with what prejudice the Greek and Roman Authors were to be supposed to write in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e things, the preferment of Monarchy, even by some of the chief of them, is an argument undeniably concluding that the sufferance of the other was from necessity, and not choice. For, although they durst not reprove it as a fault in that kind of government, yet (doubtless) the many sad exampl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of those ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fatal rewards and usages, by them continually practised towards such of their own Citizens and subjects as have been most eminent in any kind of vertue, or most deserving or serviceable to their country, could not but, in conscience and reason, make them resolve that it must naturally arise from that form of administration. For their form of policy subsisting by, and openly aiming at parity and equality in honor and power (whilst each one in it was yet arrogating to himself) they must necessarily stomack any pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence that shall be given to any one above themselves: as justly fearing, he might thereupon take advantage of making himself their Master. Who (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) if (out of cautionary compliance) he shall never so lowly makes his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements and submission to the whole Senate, yet if he do not so
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55976:60"/>
also to such particular men as be leaders, and such as do speak for and uphold him, he will still be subject to envy and ruine: Nay, if he do it not to such also as do not appear for him, he will be hazarded by their revenge also. So that, in truth, vertue and merit have herein no longer security, then the party can protect himself by secret bribery of their Factious leaders, and by popular and base flattery and compliance: which can yet serve his turn but for a time. His surest course to prevent their malice &amp; ill, being to advance himself above their power, and to make use of those forces to defend himself against them, with which he hath so often defended them against others. And, except it be by this course, I know not that any one famous servant to any Polarchy hath been recorded to scape censure and punishment for his reward: the surest way not to suffer like <hi>Scipio,</hi> being to act like <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this kind of Scholy some are so ignorantly inclined, as finding the tearms and notions of government usually imployed about these devised forms, and that in their best sense, they come to think them no where due and proper but there: For so, they think that true policy is (from its name and derivation) to import, not the government of a kingdome by a King, but of a City, and that by Citizens in equal authority. Not well considering, that in ancient times each territory or kingdom took its usual name from its City, as that did again from its most eminent King or founder: and that, as each City had its King, and was Monarchical onely, so the notion of Citizen signified but the same with another subject; and not power and rule. Nay, it should seem to infer greater subjection; as to those, who, by their habitation were more civilized by Laws and obedience, then to those in villages, called therefore Pagans.</p>
               <p>The like misapprehension ariseth from the notions of <hi>people</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>: which have different values in Republikes, over they have in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</p>
               <p>But however, these Greeks (before mentioned) having cast off Kings, and the acknowledgement of all power above themselves, they must next found it on themselves; that is, in the community or people from whom also they must suppose even Kings to arise. Hereupon the title of Anarchy came to want difinition and existence. For to say it was in the Community, was to overthrow that main end for which this notion of a community was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: namely, to pact and consent for conferring of power. For how can men in that condition be general or free pacters or consenters? If they say men are not to be supposed born unanimous, like Aunts of a litter, but rather (as formerly discoursed) like <hi>Cadmus</hi>-brood by Poets feined to that purpose (in their different appetites) pursuing one another in a confusion of every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst every one, and that from thence they come to be a community, then they make a community and agreement to arise from that which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for how shall these disagreers be brought to voluntary and equal Parity and Paction.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is no way but to say, Anarchy is absence of Unity; or the exercise of power without it: For it is not only a privation of good, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying precedent union in the single person that did govern, but also an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of evil, by setting up contention in the many heads now ruling.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to say that Anarchy is then onely, when there is such a condition as that every one should be against every one, is to deny that it can be. For how should it come to pass? Because, as no settled government can
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55976:61"/>
be overthrown but by union of opposition, and men cannot live without such relations of kindred and other interests as must keep them bound in some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociations, so cannot they, as <hi>ab origines</hi> (such as the Greeks to this purpose supposed themselves) be so born or brought together, without all union by former friendship and relation, as to be, each one to each one, contra-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and equal in all things.</p>
               <p>Without due consideration of which impossibility, and of the intervenient degrees between the perfection of unity which true Monarchy will afford, and that confusion which the extream of Anarchy will yeild, men are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led to this mistake. For, as we may, and justly do stile that a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, where the last appeal, and some other inseparable marks of Soveraignty do remain in one man, although many prerogatives may be parted with, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so, on the contrary, we must judge Anarchy to be where the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in more: and if we do not this, there cannot be such a thing as Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, aswell as no such thing as Anarchy. Because, as disability and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will occasionally more or less make Princes leave and entrust their power to others, so, in like manner, are we to conceive of Anarchy: namely, that although the people (<hi>viritim</hi>) cannot, or do not personally act or agree in all administrations to Soveraignty proper (but that some one man at once may be trusted in several parts thereof; whereby, in respect of their approach to Monarch, they are for the present so far kept from the mischiefs of absolute Anarchy) yet since the right of government is at liberty claimed to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by all, the government must be Anarchical too: although, as we said, one Anarchy may be less Anarchical then another, in regard of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to unity and Monarchical administration; like as also one Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy may be less so then another; even so far as these Anarchical forms shall be mingled therewith.</p>
               <p>Nor hath Monarchy gained precedence (as aforesaid) by the confessions of Polarchical writers, but it's open and active enemies, the Polarchs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by their endeavors to resemble the real unity thereof in those repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of themselves by presidents, speakers, or the like, and by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to unite their votes and opinions in such sort as to be capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and government (by making their many wills seem but one) do all of them (by deed and experience) confess that they have neither worth nor fitness for government in themselves; and are so far only good, or rather so far distanced from ill, as they can approach that exemplar of union which in Monarchy is essential. Again, if we shall observe them in their fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals for laws, and forms of execution of their governments, we shall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde that as themselves are usually but some fragments and scraps of Monarchies rent off by Rebellion, so will the main body of their laws and semblance of policy, be found such onely as were by their former Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns and Kings enacted and contrived.</p>
               <p>But (to return) if Anarchy must be supposed but the first beginnings to the overthrow of established government, what shall we say of lawful conquest? Or, if it be in civil or intestine strifes onely, then, since (in these) men cannot strive singly, but as united in Factions, when shall it begin; and when shall Anarchy end? Shall it begin from the first underminings, or from the first overt act, or from which, or what sort of them? Shall it end when the other government is overthrown, and there be no enemy left to hinder its peaceable settlement in an union by it self? How shall it be known? and who shall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55976:61"/>
judge when this government or other opposition is wholly subdued, or so far as is requisite to its establishment in a government by it self? What if this government be thirty or fourty yeers destroying? And what if at last, it stand still on its own strength without farther fear from this opposing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: which (it may be) now hath set up for it self also: and as a free State (as they call them) entred into aliance or agreement with them? In which and other cases, since the form of government in the faction established is the same in prevailing over one another now, as it was over those that held the government before; that is by force of a major part, why should not the same government aswel be an Anarchy now, as before? And, if there must be a set time when this prevailing faction ought, and may (though still the same people and faction) take on them the title of lawful government, which is it?</p>
               <p>If you say, when they have made agreement, or utterly subdued their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prince; this I conceive can (at best) but acquit them of rebellion, in order to himself; because done against him: and thereupon, for a Monarchy so gained, it will serve to make it a just government afterwards, because it is so in its form. But since Anarchy (consisting in division) must arise from the form of government, that is from the divided heads and persons whereby it is enforced, and not from the divers hands used in the managery (for all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments must have such) it must be confessed that Anarchy must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished as a different thing from rebellion; and remaine in the form of government, and not in the manner or circumstances of beginning or using it: or else, such a thing as Anarchy cannot be at all.</p>
               <p>I know the common division of government was formerly into Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy; and their deviations, Tyranny, Oligarchy, and Anarchy: so making six sorts. But, as it is since found that there is but three sorts, by including their deviations, as Tyranny into Monarcy, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy into Aristocracy, and Anarchy into Democracy, so I, concluding but one onely right government (<hi>viz.</hi> of Monarchy) have reckonnd both the other under the common deviation of Anarchy: esteeming it all one, whither a lesser or greater number of people preside therein, which only thing doth difference Aristocracy from Democracy.</p>
               <p>And as for that fancy of co-ordination, it may be reckoned an Oligarchy, consisting of so many Governors and Governments as the co-ordinates are: and as Monarchy is limited above, or under this supposed equality in co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, so far is it more or less uncapable of its chief end, peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For, as all Parity must breed confusion, so dissention also: and the more Parity in governors the more dissention. Which, as it may rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally be foreknown to arise from the very nature of that Government it self, so will it by instance most lively appear in that government of family: wherein, notwithstanding there is greatest interest and obligations towards concordance and mutual assistance, there are yet more observable disputes and differences arising between man and wife (even to the bringing the whole family in divisions and sidings) then between him and children, or between him and servants; who come not so neer to him in pretence of equality of power. For as they, pretending to less power, are therefore probably less subject to be sensible of the loss, so is he less subject to be covetous of the gain of that little.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55976:62"/>Therefore it may be concluded, that the greater the power of the co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate is, the more subject is that place to Faction and Rebellion: which we will next speak of.</p>

               <p>AS we have already shewed the necessity of self-seeking in Nature, so now we are to shew, that since Nature cannot be altered, how in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty her course may be steered to publike good: so that men still retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their sense of good and bad, separate and distinct to themselves, they might therewith, and thereby also, be more provoked to the good of others. Therefore, after the vulger manner, to dream of publike spirited persons or publike souls (meaning such as have no private interest) is not onely untrue, but, could it be, it would, instead of benefit, be the ruine of that whole State. For, through the distracted endeavors of so many voluntary publike under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, the whole would perish by degrees: and while each particular failed, for want of due self-regard, the whole would fail by consequent.</p>
               <p>Experience of those many mischiefs and disturbances generally arising in the world through mens inconsiderate and violent prosecution of their own appetites and wills, without due regard to the sufferings of others, hath brought it into the serious doubt of many, whether this Philautia be lawful to be prosecuted or no: and while some (as finding it natural) have neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily thought it warrantable, yet have they onely thought it an allowable rule to be made the beginner, but not the ender of our enterprises. As though the end and design of each action, must not, in all voluntary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Agents, be before any attempt thereof. Or, as if any reasonable creature, could, out of self-regard begin any thing, which, in the issue, he did foresee would prove otherwise.</p>
               <p>But it hath not been well considered, that those very Rules of <hi>Do as thou wouldst be done unto,</hi> and, <hi>Love thy neighbour as thy self,</hi> (on which their conceit is grounded) do of themselves imply and warrant each mans sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate good to be both first and last preferred before that of any other. Nay, these Rules being chiefly intended to avoid partiality in such dealings and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributions as concern other parties, and so to be used by such as are to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office of Judges and Umpires, doe in that case onely (as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall be shewed) appoint both the Judge on the one hand, and the two contending parties on the other, to square his sentence upon them, and they their obedience unto him, as fancying themselves reciprocally interessed. In which case, themselves not being immediate parties, every act of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is injustice: they having no rule to love one man better then another. Whereas, on the other side, if any man be party with another, all things he doth to the advantage of another against his own, is not onely unnatural and foolish, but unjust and sinful also.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:55976:62"/>What if we shall say farther, that in all dealings between one man and another, no man can be otherwise sinful, then as he is to himself foolish and neglectfull of his own good? It is not hard for men to conceive in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that wickedness and folly fall one into another; and that no man can prejudice himself, but he must thereby sin: nor sin, but he must thereby prejudice himself. All the mistake being for want of consideration, that when any doth, by warrant from above, sense of Honor, or dictate of his Conscience, prefer the benefiting of another to the enjoyment of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent content of his own, that, even in this case, it was self consideration of procuring reward or avoiding punishment to himself, that was the end of this good deed he did to them.

               <p>Therefore, as in Natures polity in the Government of the World, there is pleasure annexed to such enjoyments as are most beneficial, to direct and incite us what to do in pursuit of our single preservations, (and so of the whole species) and pain on the contrary, to deter from what is hurtful; so, in political foundations, (that the whole Kingdom may be preserved) the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties necessary to be performed or avoided by the several members thereof to that end, are to have such rewards and punishments annexed to their Edicts, that each particular member, being naturally led to seek pleasure and avoid pain, may, in the pursuit hereof, (by politick designation) follow the good of the Commonwealth also.</p>
               <p>As for example, should the Commonwealth appoint (as out of duty to the whole, and out of common Charity to one another) that men should, without any self regard; have spent their whole time and labours in Tillage or otherwise, they would quickly finde the Proverb verified, <hi>That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ass is ill sadled.</hi> And they would finde, that since men are properly and expresly onely sensible of their own good, that therefore, as this stood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, their actions would remit also. Reason therefore quickly taught all Founders of Laws and Rules for sociable living, that because the whole stock of common improvement must arise from private managery, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex unto publike employments and duties such private advantages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as might encourage their undertakings.</p>
               <p>And therefore, those that have gone about to propound the dis-impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Goods, Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thinking upon taking off the notions of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> to take off all Civil War, do not onely (as aforesaid) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake what is impossible (as supposing, Man, a Creature of so much appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and leisure can be without something in that kinde to seek) but that which would be hurtful also. For although Bees, Ants, and such like creatures, which some inconsiderately think imitable, do enjoy a parity, and have their private good and the publike all one, in the same dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

execution, yet if their different condition from mans be examined, it would be found as reasonable that man should do otherwise, as they should do so. For they are born all at once, so as being but one litter, and seeming but one thing, they do accordingly keep up co-habitation. And as this strict co-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation keeps them from intermedling with other creatures, whereby to be affected with imitation of their appetites, so their own appetite of self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation for necessary food, keeps them so wholly intent in the provision thereof, that they want the sole occasion to faction and disunion, which is idleness. And therefore they may be discerned always in haste, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about that very one thing, namely provision of food: and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need; for the whole yeers expence lies upon a short times gathering. Whereas men, that have such difference of age, company, appetite, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so much leisure, cannot but be thought to have as different and private ayms. And to think that a man shall not have self-aym in all he doth, is to think he shall have no aym at all; but to do always one thing, and that out of present haste and necessity, as Ants do. But, as we finde all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, as such, must, according to their degree of Knowledge, have self-aym (in so much as Beasts of most leisure have it most) so man, as the most contemplative, long-lived, rational creature, must have it most.</p>
               <p>Which things duely considered, and the respective and different cares and parts of Prince and Subject, it will easily appear what things are, and must be the aim of both. For the one, seeing that the whole good was his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good, and thereupon following the natural rule of self-seeking, he must, as he desired his own good, seek that of the whole people: because, if any part of the publike be decayed or lost, even so much his private is decayed and lost also. For the Prince should be in the body politique as the Brain to the body natural; without sense to it self, and yet be the common sense to all other parts. Then the Subject on the other side, as naturally seeking pleasure and avoiding the contrary, is, as regarding his particular herein, stirred up by the rewards and punishments of the Law, to do, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void such things as are agreeable to publike interest. By which means, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man seeking necessarily his own private, and then publike and private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits being in all relations the same and convertible, Polity is established, and Charity also: while our neighbours benefits are established in our own. And while Prince and people thus move in course, according to each ones order, the general welfare is maintained.</p>
               <p>But if the harmony and proportions be broken, by any ones invading on the others imployment, mischief will follow. For if any order or estate of the people shall forsake their own bounds, and take upon them to judge of publike expedients and mischiefs, and act accordingly, then, as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good will fail for want of care, so will their own good fail therewith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. And so again it is, if the Prince, upon the terror of any discontented parties, hath parted with some of his Soveraignty or common interest to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands: will not his care, that should be common to all alike, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, come to be less to those; because they are less Subjects then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
               <p>And then again, if the King himself, out of favour to any, shall give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions or priviledges derogatory to his just Prerogative, this will cause a partial eye towards them in his time, &amp; (it is like) an angry one towards them afterwards: in both cases hazarding publike care and Justice; because the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55976:63"/>
whole is not looked upon with equal interest. But the truth is, Princes er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors this way can seldom go far: for that the successors, finding this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence prejudicial, will still recal them into common again. For, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable their Fathers favorites were none of theirs, so (you may be sure) none of the peoples; so far as to fear part-takings in devesting them.</p>
               <p>But now, when this politique direction and rule for self-seeking is laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and the rewards and threats to obedience cannot so prevail, but that some daring spirits, of more then ordinary ayms and affections (hoping to have their Ambition, Covetousness, and Revenge satisfied better in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way then what is by Law appointed) will be acting to publike disquiet, then it is that Faction is beginning: which is nothing else, but <hi>an unlawful association of Subjects, in opposition to their one supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>: which association is by each one run into, as he findes his own hopes or fears therein attained or secured. In which case each Faction is in its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings without publike allowance, to be looked on as a private person.</p>
               <p>The original and rise of Faction being discontent, hence it is that no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatsoever can be wholly without it: that is, in aym and design, however it may be kept from act and execution, through fear to prevail. And this, not onely, as all Government is in it self to be considered as a re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>raint of our wills, and so prompting us to contrivement of ease, but inasmuch as there can be but few persons so constantly and entirely favored or be friended by the present power of any place, as not to have many things in their ayms and hopes (in order to Revenge or Covetousness) to be got by siding and complyance elsewhere, therefore all men whatsoever are to be presumed more or less enclined to Faction, as they are more or less disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But then because men singly, and in small numbers, cannot act, or secure themselves against established polity and the penalties thereof, they must next endeavor such strength by association, as to be thereby enabled to bring on their own aims by complying with the interests of others. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though again, there can be no two men found of alike interest and aim in all things, yet men, not finding agreement so fully as they would, do then seek it in the neerest proportion they can: and since they finde none to make companions in all their ayms, they then joyn with such as concur in most. And so, having gotten (as they believe) association and strength enough to carry on their design, they now begin to separate and divide the Kingdom, by separating themselves. These that side with them they call (for repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation sake) the people, and the good party: and those that joyn not, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the publike, ill-affected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this means having gotten such strength as to be able to pursue their own interests in opposition to lawful Authority, they proceed with less fear towards the accomplishment thereof: whether it be that more neer interest, the advantage of pleasure belonging to each ones person (commonly included under riches and desire of property) or that which is more distant, as of Wives, Children, Kindred, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may be ranked under the sense of Honor. For still, our pursuit in attaining them is heightned, as we conceive our propriety and interest in them to lye.</p>
               <p>Now, as the leaders private ends were (as beforesaid) Ambition, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, or Revenge; so, to joyn interest and engage the people, they flatter them with the notions of Liberty, Propriety, and Justice; correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55976:64"/>
with their own aims before mentioned. For Liberty answers Ambition; both proceeding from Pride, and impatience of Government.</p>
               <p>The desire of increase of Propriety, answers Covetousness. And po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Justice is nothing else but Cruelty and Revenge. And now have they engaged all affections too. For Ambition is the extream of Honor, the pleasure of the Minde. Covetousness includes all the pleasures that sense can desire. And Revenge is the utmost bound of our malice against the things we hate, tending to the satisfaction of the irrascible faculty, as the other did of the concupiscible. Therefore the Leaders, never defining or telling what civil Liberty, Property, or Justice is, or ought to be, they leave it for the people (who have them promised as great matters) to think that by Liberty, they mean, not onely freedom from all subjection themselves, <q>but, because they are told all Power comes from them, and is at their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, they think they shall now have power over others also.</q> By Propriety, they are led to think, not onely to have their own estates altogether inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt, but to be freed of all Taxes and Obligations besides. For the meanest cannot but expect (if he be not directly promised) that upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of the enemy, great encrease will then come to his share And then, as the weakest Natures are ever most revengeful, and cruel, so Subjects can never want objects of this kinde, whom, under shew of publike Justice, they will always implacably prosecute.</p>
               <p>Nor do the Leaders of Factions hide themselves and meanings on the naming of things onely, but of persons also. For having themselves cast off subjection, and teaching others to do the like, they use not the name of Subject any longer; it is now the people a word which (as used in Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies) signifies insubjection: and therefore can be never proper but in Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy) and sometimes it is the Commons they represent and stand for. And then, there is none so low, but thinks he is included in one of these notions: there is not one of the meanest servants in a Family, but is in his conceit one of the People, or one of the Commons at least: and answerably, he is ready to take the side that makes him such fair promises. And he may hope also, that as the greater includes the less, so a free-born Subject, as he is, shall be freed of Master, as well as Prince: for he is sure that all his bondage hath been from the one, and not from the other. They (poor souls) little thought that by People and Commons are meant onely such as the Leaders shall choose (after they have made themselves by their helps Masters of the other party) to stand as for the People, or to choose, or to be their Representatives. At which time (I hope) being the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they will not break their former Promises of having no intention but the good of the People. Upon occasion of which deceits and mistakes it comes to pass, that the generality of the people are ever murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Governments, and more ready to change again then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Monarchies: as now finding that those large promises of general Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comes to none other end then to be at the continual dispose of their fellows; and that their own share in power or riches, answers not that great hopes they had thereof when they deposed their former Prince.</p>
               <p>When this Association or Faction divides against the Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it is called by a peculiar name of Schism: which is seldom want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the other is. For Religion, being taken of general concern to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55976:64"/>
all, the reaping up of abuses herein cannot but deeply engage: and, in order to this, the peoples Liberty in interpreting Scripture must be asserted: and then, having set up Levites to scholly them to their purpose, Conscience comes to be engaged for them also in this pretended Reformation, and as much as much as may be drawn from the other side.</p>
               <p>But now, as all Faction hath in its aim the overthrow of Government, so it is, from its own divisions again, always a ruine to it self, as it had been to the Kingdom by division before. For the common enemy (as they call them) now subdued, which was the cause of their uniting, they begin to reflect upon themselves, both in the division and managery of the power and profits now come into their hands, and also of the neerer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of those particular interests that brought them into this associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Both which occasions will again necessarily break them into sub-divisions: and lead them to finde out new associations of such as come yet neerest to correspond with them, against such as are farthest off: and upon like Grounds and Arguments as they had associated against others before, they associate against one another now.</p>
               <p>Nor can this well be otherwise, because (as I said) publike good was not the cause of their joyning: except a forraign fear yet remain, or do arise to keep them united: or except the Leaders be allyed by kindred, or have all of them a common interest. The last commonly happens, when claim is laid to the Crown and Government. For then, as one mans interest made them associate, it will keep them so. The other is when the heads are few, and their interests so agreeing, that more is probably to be got by a great and sure share now possessed in the Government, then in adventuring for all. Therefore, the present successors to Monarchies overthrown by Faction are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristocracies: but these many times so short-lived, as their Government is not to be setled and known. For one, or some amongst them, as courting more the people, will still, by their help, set themselves in the Throne: or if that fail, rather then submit again to his incensed fellows, he perswades, and sets up the peoples general power above them, under shew of more liberty: and so comes usually Democracies: which, if they fall not into Monarchy again by the force and choice of their souldiery, grow by degrees more Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocratick. For those that call themselves the people, secluding always as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they can, and taking in none to share with them in power, their number at last must be few.</p>
               <p>Besides, as Nature in all things, being left to her own working, will by gentle and orderly steps tend to that perfection she was forcibly deprived of, so it may be observed, how by degrees all Governments do of their own nature, and uninterrupted by violence, always lead to that perfection and state of Unity again from which by force onely they were hitherto debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And, unto the undeniable proof of the natural right of Monarchical Government, it may be asserted, that, as no Government of it self (let alone in the hands of the governors, without the forcible intermedling of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned) but would still come to be Monarchy, so, no government was ever brought from fewer to more, but by the force and terror of the people upon the Governors themselves: who now (as in the Fable of the Serpent that would be governed by his own Tayl) will be governing themselves: and so make all lawfulness of Government (at last) vanish into forcible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:55976:65"/>There are many other particulars by which Faction useth to make its rise and support; which shall be spoken of in the next chapter of Rebellion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other things which are the originals of that also. For these two are of such like extraction, and so neer a kin, that what is properly the cause to one, is (for the most part) so to the other: Faction being but Rebellion in its birth, and as yet but in devise and contrivance; and Rebellion being but Faction brought into act and execution: even as Polarchy, or Anarchy is but both of them, brought to such maturity and perfection, as to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of self-subsistance.</p>

               <p>AS the inordinate thirst of pleasure, and its consequent (Liberty to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it) is in us all, both natural and unlimited, so, where Rules and Laws of Polity and Government (the onely means of restraint) are not strictly enjoyned or duely obeyed, it commonly falls out, that what should have been a bridle, proves rather a Spur; and the possession of one inordinate lust, doth by it self make way for another: even as the abundance of drink, to the drunkard, is the cause of greater thirst to ensue. Observe we this, First, in that lesser Government of a Family: and you shall finde Children and Servants nowhere so unquiet and discontented, as where the indulgencies of the Parent or Master do most appear. And so it is in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms also: where Subjects that have soft and mild spirited Princes, and from whose more gentle and easie natures they, having already attained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of Liberty and Freedom, do come at last to forget how inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent these things may be with their duty or publike peace, and to think that their very asking should now be the onely rule for his granting.

                  <hi>that he made silver and gold to be in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem as stones,</hi> &amp;c. And yet, as in a kinde of wantonness and surfet, they come to his son <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to ask release of this grievous yoak of <hi>Solomon</hi> his Father. But in truth, we can interpret this their coming to <hi>Sechem</hi> to no other end then to make a Covenant and association to rebel: and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King, was but the outside of their appearance: when they intended to unmake him. For first, <hi>Rehoboams</hi> raign was not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective but in right of his Father and Grandfather, as heretofore noted: and he might as well have reigned in their stead without the peoples approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Ishbosheth Sauls</hi> son did over them in <hi>Davids</hi> time, or as <hi>Nadab</hi> in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> stead, over the same <hi>Israelites,</hi> without any such confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>So that this Assembly was indeed to settle <hi>Jeroboams</hi> new Principality, and not to confirm <hi>Rehoboams.</hi> And therefore,<note place="margin">1 King. 12.3.</note> since they first <hi>sent for him</hi> to come in the head of them, whom they knew to lay claim to the Crown, this action looks purposely to aim at a quarrel, and gain a denyal; whereby to get a pretence to rebel. And was indeed the threatned punishment of <hi>Solomons</hi> offence against God, and not of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> to the people: and so suffered to be done in pursuance of that end:<note place="margin">1 King. 11.11:</note> namely <hi>the punishing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with the rod of the children of men.</hi> Whereupon this his <hi>refusing the councel of the old men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.14. 1 King. 12.8.</note> must be considered as a fit and necessary means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And this may seem the reason of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> answer, importing a denial to the ground of the peoples Petition, and answering in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as though experience had fully told him, that since too much indulgence and concession had lost to his Father, he would recover it by rigor and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>But, to affirm that this Rebellion was a punishment of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> answer onely, were to give God the lye: both for the reasons already mentioned, and as plainly crossing his direct Promise to <hi>Jeroboam:</hi> saying, <hi>I will rent the Kingdom out of the hands of his son, and give it unto thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King.11.35.</note> 
                  <hi>even ten Tribes.</hi> Plainly arguing a forepassed fault to God, and not of oppression to the people: upon which onely Reason he is warned to desist. For of that war, what good issue could be? To have <hi>Jeroboam</hi> beaten, were to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God and his purpose: and to have <hi>Rehoboam</hi> beaten, were to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance rebellion in people.</p>
               <p>But if you look to the fruit of these Concessions in <hi>David,</hi> you will finde him the fittest instance for retaliation in both kindes: whether you respect him as a gracious Prince, or an indulgent Father: as may appear by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances formerly given. The like will all other stories do, being but confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of this Maxim, <hi>That those people that have largest Immunities and Liberties, are ever the most seditious for more: and that civil war and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55976:66"/>
doth not arise from want of Liberty and Freedom in the Subjects, but from having too much:</hi> That is, from Princes intrusting so great a portion of Soveraign power into their hands, under colour of giving them Liberty, as shall encourage and enable them to stand in open opposition and defiance against him and his remaining Authority for more: and, by degrees to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or rather command all, if they shall think good.</p>
               <p>For as it comes to pass with all such prodigal persons, as well Princes as others, as use or know no other way for gaining love and credit, then by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of that whereby it should have had foundation and continuance, they in the end finde, that as (before) their estates was the cause of their Loves, so, this being now gone, the other would fail also. And therefore they should beforehand have considered, that what was the onely mean to their desire, should have been the chiefest object of their care: lest in the end they come to finde, that too great liberality unto private and undeserving beggers, makes them but publique and unpittied beggars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Even so, when Princes are soothed up with the specious shews of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning love by condescension, and parting with the fundamental rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, to please and gain the people, they must now expect, that what directed their love to them, while they had it, will be a cause of want of love, being parted with. They must consider, that since the different love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Princes above others, was but in regard of their different power; whereby it also came to pass, that what was beneficially by them done, was therefore more meritorious, as less constrained; abate them then this power of doing so, or otherwise, and how shall the love and thanks to Princes differ from that of other men?</p>
               <p>And since Government, as Government, requires the administration and execution of things according to the will of the Governors (when as the pretended government by love respects onely the desires of the loved) how can it then be government? And Princes so governing, that is, by the will of the governed, as he and they are in their wills different, so must one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be the overthrow of another. Wherefore, if fear and reverence be not made use of, but Subjects always courted by loving condiscentions, Experience, as well as Reason, tells us, that his Authority will stand on fickle ground.</p>
               <p>Nor do Princes hereby onely offend against interest, but Duty also: to wit, against that prime and incommunicable trust of power from God to them derived, to enable them to govern their subjects according to his Laws. When they, beyond their own Commission to give, or the peoples capacity to receive, shall strive to dis-invest themselves of so inherent a propriety, and by a strange and preposterous way of proceeding, endeavor to invert Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reason, and all kinde of Order and Rule, to their own ruine, by this setting the commanded above the Commander, and making the Subject not subject. Whereof, what other sequel can we expect, but that, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment justly deserved, and most adequate and congruous to such an offence, all Insurrections and Rebellions against them, from hence most natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should proceed.</p>
               <p>So that, when it shall once come to pass, that either fear to enjoyn or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what he knows to be fit, or the hopes for countenance or assistance in what he believes otherwise, shall so far work on his resolution, as to make his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55976:66"/>
Subjects the objects of his fear and courtship, he shall finde, that what is hereby, for the present gained, will come to him at so dear a rate, as, upon the issue, to endanger and cost him his whole estate: whereas Nations under absolute Soveraigns, are, in respect of these, but seldom observed to rebel.</p>
               <p>For as, when the childe hath once so far prevailed over his indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that his wanton appetite cannot be satisfied without the enjoyment of what is offensive to others; nay, not without those very morsels and what else belongs to the necessary sustentation of the Parent (which must now be the only object and remedy of its peevishness;) it wil be found that as this too great kindness was the cause this stubbornness, so it will, at last, prove a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening of respect and duty in the childe: and the childe will thereupon also, be more truely called the guide of the Father, then the Father of him. And seldom have the Concessions of Princes any other fruit then to be invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to new demands; till at last, Subjects have so wholly freed themselves from the more milde and tolerable government of one, that, through the greedy pursuit of such natural and universal liberty as is with government it self inconsistent, they again fall into the perfect slavery of Anarchy, where <hi>every man is oppressed of his neighbour:</hi> and, instead of one, have many Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to disturb them. The usual issue of all unhappy people, grown wanton with too much Liberty: where the commonnels, and easiness of former grants, is made the onely rule for desiring, and obtaining new Petitions: which come at length to be reckoned as acts of duty, not of grace. But to these in brief it may be answered, if they may not be denyed, why do they petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? if they may, why do they rebel? And having so far considered Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in its prime cause, the division of Soveraignty, we will examine it by its usual pretences, and give some answers.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, I shall desire such as may conceive these last passed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses or others elsewhere used, to be impertiment for a Treatise where Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and not Princes parts are to be set forth, to consider that I intend not here to shew Kings what to do, but to shew Subjects what to obey. And if this encroachment of Subjects on the Prerogatives of Princes be well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it will be found no less needful to be propounded to their considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in regard of the inconveniences thereof inticing them to Rebellion, then in regard of that proneness again which Princes do hereupon take to fall into acts of Tyranny: insomuch as all tyrannous and severe regiment may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to have arisen, either to remove, or prevent this danger: tyranny being nothing else but soveraign revenge or severity, according to the presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of injury past, or to be feared.</p>
               <p>The evil of Anarchy, and benefits of Government have ever been in all mens eys so apparent, that none have been hitherto found so desperate, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to profess to introduce the one by destroying the other: but deceived sometimes themselves are, and always they strive to deceive others, by shew of Liberty and Freedom: either from suffering some evil, or for attaining some forbidden content. <q>For (say they) the more general good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is ever to be preferred to the more particular: which is the good of the whole people to that of the Rulers. For look into Nature, she made them equal: intending no more the satisfaction of one, then another. And the very end and aim of Society it self, was primarily the good of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of the Governors but in order thereunto. That hereupon, all, or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55976:67"/>
most people subject not themselves to the arbitrary rule of the Prince, but unto the known and established Law: by which onely, according to his oath and compact, he is bound to govern. For could men (say they) be imagined to have parted with their native freedom of Will, and debar themselves of the many pleasures of life, to no other end, but hereby to advance to a state of felicity some one, or more men, unto whom they could in nothing acknowledge themselves inferior? No, since Kings and Rulers were set up, and had obedience given unto them for the onely good of the people (for of them is the whole power derived, and they may at pleasure settle what Government they please, and as they think fit to restrain or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it) therefore, when they shall be found to fail of this trust, and turn their power to their peoples hurt, they might with good reason re-assume their own strength, and imploy it to the attainment of those benefits, which by the wilfulness or foolishness of the other is crossed or neglected. And if in pursuance of this course, civil war and slaughter do follow; it must be imputed to the stubbornness of them in Authority: which then must be endured as a cure to the state: when as, by a momentany suffering of some mens loss, the perpetual hazard of all mens slavery is avoided: and is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then like tolerating a less evil to avoid a greater. And this power of resistance (say they) must be in all limited Monarchies; else the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nothing: but he remains as absolute as the other.</q> But because these and the like propositions, have for the most part been bred and countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by some of the Romish and Jesuited Clergy, we will (by the way) look thereunto: leaving the farther censure of their intermedling to another place: and also referring the full answer and satisfaction in other things to the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapters: wherein, under the titles of Liberty, Slavery, Property, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be shewed how Faction and Rebellion have unjustly laid claim to any justification under these notion.</p>
               <p>A great Argument, and associate of mans frailty it is, that even from our best and most holy performances, advantages to sin and impiety have been taken. Arising chiefly, from the malice of that wicked one; always ready, (if the sowing of the Wheat cannot be wholly hindred) by his Agents to cause such Tares to spring amongst, and from it, that for their very sakes, the other might have none, or at least less use and esteem. For who would else have thought, that that very height of Piety, Religion, and Devotion, that caused the first nursing Fathers of the Church, as in honor and duty to God, to bestow divers great Priviledges and Powers upon the (at that time) well-deserving Clergy, should, by a strange and inconsiderate ingratitude, prove the readiest Feathers, with which the shafts were made for their own destruction? For so we finde, when Popes became inheritors onely of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue and Prerogative of the Church, and not at all of their predecessors devotion or humility, they first begin to seat themselves above Kings, and all that is called God: and thinking they could never bring low enough that power, whose due height they had just cause to fear would be a curb to their pride, they not onely tread on their necks themselves, but, by their Agents and Factors, they everywhere teach and authorise the Princes own Subjects to do the like. <q>Telling them that all civil power is originally in the people: and that from them, and their underived majesty it was, that Kings had their Soveraignties: which as they might be by them streightened as they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55976:67"/>
saw occasion, so were they to judge of his defaults in case of tyranny or oppression.</q> And then, reserving to themselves the power of deposing and sentencing them, in case of heresie or schism; and of defining what they were, they had poor Kings (they thought) beneath them low enough: even as far as man is beneath God: Kings being the peoples, but themselves (as <hi>jure divino)</hi> Gods Deputies.</p>
               <p>These things seem not so to be wondred at, in a time when implicit devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and superstition had caused such general ignorance, that any thing almost would take: but, for a sort of men, undertaking to reform all errors even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Word, and professing such great hatred to Popery, as to cast off some harmless things, onely because they think them popish; for these (I say) to contradict a thing so expresly taught in Scripture, and (on the contrary) to assert a thing onely fraudulently brought in, and by none taught but Jesuits, can have no other ground, but that they agree in common aim; the aim of ambition and insubjection. For so, as the Pope puts Kings under the people, to advance himself in his room, as in Gods stead; so do Presbyters put him under too, that themselves, in their consistories, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne, and be above him, as in Christs stead. By which means, Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer King of Kings, but King of Presbyters, we should (for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our Liberties) have (besides the domineering consistories) a King and a Pope in every Parish. Concerning the sum of which Doctrine, namely that all power, and that of Kings is from God onely, we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy spoken: but because I finde that divers learned men, favorers to neither of these sects, but lovers of Monarchy, did yet hold by consequent the same opinions, it will not be amiss to speak something hereof: and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies &amp; absurdities arising from that conceit of derivation of power from Paction and consent: leaving the more particular handling of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reality of Paction it self to its proper place.</p>
               <p>These, though they thought that, notwithstanding this Concession, they would still evince all active resistance to be unlawful, even because it broke a Paction (made between I know not what King and their people (and so I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sometimes thought from the plausibleness of the scholly) yet, upon stricter enquiry, an error on one hand or other cannot be avoided. That is, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that this is a thing useless, and serving the people to no purpose, or else all those consequences of Rebellion will naturally flow from it.</p>
               <p>For you admitting it the peoples right, they put you to shew where you finde that they by any Paction utterly resigned this right into the Princes hand? as you may affirm such a Paction, so they deny. And for conquest, they say it can no more take away a known right, then any other force. And if it be the peoples right, it is their right as well against him as any other. Will you suppose such a contract when they elect a King; they press you to shew it: and say, they are to be supposed as all other rational Agents, to have done it for some advantage to themselves: and consequently, as trusters, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand accompt from the trusted, and make redresses also: else they have a dry right without a remedy. Therefore they appeal to these Pactions also, and say, That as they are tyed by Oaths of Alleagiance, so is the Prince by oath tyed to observance of the Law: and that, if he break his Oath, theirs is fallen of consequence: and then the power and trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns. If it happen they onely swear, and that to implicite obedience, they then say it is a force: and so invalid to binde any, since (as grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you) all power is founded on the Will. So that we may
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55976:68"/>
plainly see the mischief of this Scholly, when, as to make government the more easie (as in a kinde of flattery) people are told, that although they have originally this power, yet having once devested themselves thereof, what hath been their voluntary resignation, they have not now power to recal at pleasure. But let us a little examine these grounds, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>Their first is, <hi>quisque nascitur liber,</hi> in which they must suppose that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people can be like (like Mushromes) springing up all at once out of the earth; without all relations one to another: so as not onely without Princes or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, but sons without fathers, wives without husbands, servants without masters, families without heads, and people without pastors. If not so, then is the son of every father, as he expects the same protection for person and estate his father had, bound to the same obedience his father was. If they decline this power of government in the diffusive body of the people (out of the same reason, and the impossibility of its convening) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon say that the heads of families have onely power to elect and dispose; for that it is to be supposed all in their families have already resigned to them all their power: then, this neither is, nor can be done by the heads of all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; since women, Church-men, infants, and divers people under such and such qualifications for estates come to be left out. So that, when au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority comes to be derived from the people, it will be (as heretofore noted) but the contrivement of some Faction; using such or such restrictive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, as they may not be hindred in their aims.</p>
               <p>But this done, they have lost their first ground of free-birth: for (I hope) they will not leave children and slaves at choice for obedience: and for that obedience that wife and servants give, their Pactions express not (I suppose) any such resignation of will or power from themselves to the head of the family, as thereby to oblige them to his Pactions in the state. <q>Yea but (they say) none but such persons as have some share in the kingdom, as having an estate of some value shall have share of power.</q> To this it may be first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, how shall such a law or appointment be made generally binding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we first allow of a precedent governor amongst them to establish it? Who again, if he were settled by former Paction, how come they now to be free? If not by Paction, then is not government grounded on Paction.</p>
               <p>But let us proceed in their way of supposition. A Master of a family of a hundred servants is but equal to him that hath but three. And again, if the Master of a hundred servants be impoverished, and not able to maintain his former rank, his affection and ability to serve his country must be supposed lost, and a single man with fourty shillings <hi>per ann.</hi> put in before him. And then again, if estate enable men to be in the number of people, and so, fit to govern, me thinks it should proportionably do it; and so, four hundred pound yeerly will make one man two hundred people: and then it will be <hi>Regina peeunia</hi> indeed. These, and the like differencing rules are good to be made and observed in Monarchies: where the Monarch himself (to the end he may know his subjects desires and grievances) doth, by his writs, give the people of such and such distinct places, ranks and qualifications power to elect, and also gives and permits the elected to have power to proceed, according to former rules of his progenitors, or new ones of his own, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all prove derivation of power from below. For if the original power
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55976:68"/>
be in the whole community, and every one have his native and equal share, how comes it to be never so used? Is it due to all Masters of families? then is it from God, and due by Office: and not by Paction from them.</p>
               <p>And if we suppose power to arise from the Master, as Master, then will one Master, as his family is greater, have more power then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Estate cannot make it, for the reasons before given. If natural force and strength make it, the stronger will have most.</p>
               <p>If wisdome rule it, who shall decide who are wise: and in what measure it is to be stated?</p>
               <p>Put it to age, or what you will, it will be as hard to make any certain rate thereof, or to imagine how any should freely consent to be excluded by any relation, as to agree those in the chosen relations, by stint or size of estate, yeers, wisdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, when the community have not the power equal, the others have it by force, or usurpation. And therefore, all power is by Office: and to such Offices as are appointed of God: as Fathers, and Kings. They have it <hi>Jure Divino</hi>: and are restrainable therein only by those above, not by those under them.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a most fond supposition, that because those assemblies of Parliaments, or the like, which are made in Monarchies by such like rules of distinction, and have their acts reputed as afterwards binding, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other inventions should do so too. For in this case they are to consider, first, that there is a superior power constituting these differencing rules, and making up (as before noted) the whole representation in himself. And then, they are to consider, that the different ends of these and the other supposed conventions, will make them extreamly differ in their force of binding. For in the Monarchical conventions men may well be convened under the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of riches, because, being summoned to advise and determine concerning publike leavies and the Kingdoms wealth or Commonwealth, they may be thought inclusive of it all: whereas in the suppposed convention for disposing mens natural power and right to govern, none can reasonably binde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vote, in that where all are equal by their own supposition.</p>
               <p>But if they (in their supposed way of conferring of power) shall exclude children and servants, and leave none but the Master power to elect, then break they their supposition of equal and native freedom, because the major part is excluded. If they have power to elect, then, being so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, I hope they will chuse such a government as shall now binde their Master and Father, and not he them.</p>
               <p>But let us go on by way of supposition. These selected heads are met to chuse and empower a governor, and to give them all their power; that is, their power of their several families, that so he having power of all families, may consequently have power of the whole kingdom: which done, they intend (belike) to give up house-keeping. If so, he will have a great task indeed. If not, I would know whether they mean to have less power over their families then before? No (they say) they mean to govern them under him. Well, I suppose you can give this power you have over them so far as you had it, and over your self too: but then, since the power of life and death, and other things necessary for the Prince to have, you
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55976:69"/>
neither had over them nor your self, how can you give what you have not?</p>
               <p>Again, suppose the people the original of power, and farther (to make this power useful) suppose they may recal it to right themselves when they finde it abused, and that thereupon, the liberty to appeal to them must ever lye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; why then, this serves to defeat the power of their representatives, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel as of Princes. For these, being set up also for the peoples good, have no farther power neither then while they act that way: the people must still retain power to hinder them from doing otherwise; and consequently, must have power to judge whether they do so or not. And then, this power must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and exercise it self in all causes; because their good or ill must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in concerned. And so, I pray how shall business go on? must the governor ask the governed their consent before he command? What is this but (as in mockery) to say to them, <hi>Do as you list or I will make you?</hi> What is this but for people to command, and Magistrates to obey?</p>
               <p>Again, although that maxime, <hi>Salus populi suprema lex,</hi> may be good in popular governments (as shall be shewed anone) where governing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned are supposed alternative and the same (because all come to be includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but yet, where there is difference, there the good of both, as making up the whole, must be taken into proportionable and joynt consideration; unless they can imagine that, by contract, the King should render himself purposly miserable, to make others happy by his infelicity. If so, <hi>David</hi> and others, that had promises of kingship from God by way of reward, had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no such benefit. And if this right and duty of resistance were so in the people as is alleaged, why, in so many thousand yeers, and in the raign of so many unjust and evil Kings as are set down in the Old and New Testament, do we never find Prophet, Apostle, or other men instructing the people in a duty of so great concern. They, if they had liked, might as easily have said fight as obey; and resist, as not resist.</p>
               <p>As for the Kings observation of the Laws and seeking the good of the people, I believe no good Kings but will make it their imployment; and, in order to it, no discret people but must thereupon grant, that it is his part to to know and interpret what this law and good is; for if it be left to be done by any other Party or Faction, not he, but they have now the charge.</p>
               <p>For to say they will submit in all things just and reasonable and no farther, is to appeal back to themselves; and is not submission to another: but all things are left to their private determination as before; and just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able must be but what they will esteem such. For (as before shewed) men could not make question whether reason or equity should take place or no, it was by all agreed it should: but men differing amongst themselves on which side this right was and both parties confident of their own cause, there was no possibility to avoid destraction and attain peace, but by this voluntary and joynt submission to be herein governed by others.</p>
               <p>So that laws of equity, peace, and government, require that all parties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their common and appointed judge and sentence. For as each man sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomes a man by having a proper will and understanding; even so it comes to pass, that there can arise no difference against himself, because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and will do in him alwayes unite. Whereas, if <hi>Thomas</hi> his will were to be guided by <hi>Iohns</hi> understand, or contrary, and either of them want will or understanding, or have them over-born by another, it were in the first
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55976:69"/>
place to overthrow the personal being of men, and in the other to make it useless. For should, or could my will incline to nothing but what aforaign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding saw good, it would then be the will of him that had, and not of him that wanted this understanding: and for want of understanding, I should want will also. Or, should I suppose there could be an understanding that could submit to that of another, this were to destroy personality by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding it: and to imagine an impossibility: fancing an understanding which should be, and not to be at the same time. Therefore, when by the help of anothers understanding mine is so cleared as to see reason to consent to what it saw not before, and upon it, my will inclined to action, this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of my will is the issue of the light now apprehended in mine own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and not as it was before in anothers. So in the body politick, to keep the essence and union thereof entire, there must be the same residence for understanding and councel (at least for the last result thereof) as is for will and execution.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as it would argue high arogance in any single subject to presume his own judgement better then anothers, especially then his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, so is it but the same thing from subjects, to commend that councel themselves follow, before that which their Prince follows. For since good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of councel doth not move by being but by being apparent, and since this trial and apparency must depend on the ability and judgement of him that chuseth it (none being able to take good councel but he that is in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureable to give it) it must therefore be granted, that the following of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers councel after mine own choice, differs little from following mine own.</p>
               <p>If it should be argued, that Princes may be carried away by partiallity and private interest, and so some should think that the Councel of subjects should in that regard take place, this were to beg the question upon a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against all apparant reason. For how can any be supposed to be so equally and universally interessed as the Prince? How will they have this liberty stinted, both for persons and causes? And who shall be superiour to see it on all hands performed? Will they allow subjects indefinitely to have power herein as they themselves shall see cause? they then invert and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw government.</p>
               <p>If these prudent considerations cannot prevaile with rational men to stop the current of rebelion, yet methinks the conscientious ties of Religion and the due observation of those Gospel duties of patience, humility, obedience, long-suffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might. Christian Subjects should consider how Princes are of Gods setting up and not theirs: so that when he that hath their hearts in his hand shall send them such an one as they deserve, and in a fatherly way shall make them his rods to punish their faults, they are not to attempt the throwing these rods into the fire themselves: but to kiss them, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of submission: and, unless they will undertake to measure their own sins, they must leave it to the same hand to withdraw, that did impose. And to this purpose, let them well consider that place of <hi>Job, Is it fit to say to a King thou art wicked, or to Princes ye are ungodly</hi>? if not to say so,<note place="margin">Job 33.18.</note> much less <hi>to strike Princes for equity.</hi> Nay,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.26.</note> although they be such as appear to us <hi>to hate right</hi>: yet, being our King, and Gods Minister, over whom we can have no lawful jurisdiction, we cannot <hi>condemn them</hi> more then he <hi>that is most just.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> For so he must be esteemed of us; and left to God for punishment: <hi>Who shall</hi> (in his own way and time) <hi>break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</hi>

               <p>AS we have heretofore shewed the glory of God to be the end of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that this glory was encreased from the variety of creatures; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as from their augmentation of benefit, one above another, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of his praise must proportionably arise: As we have also declared man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde amongst other creatures greatest receivers, and most capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, so now, as to the same end, we are to consider men amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as they stand in degrees of honour and power one above another. For as we shall finde them generally much elevated above other creatures, so also, much differenced by their own degrees of perfection. Insomuch as, whilst the meanest rank of men have great degrees of Divine resemblance above other creatures below them, so have also men of higher stations, as coming hereby to be called Gods by God himself, both an advantage and obligation above those of ordinary condition: to the end, that, as their power and eminence did encrease above others below, so their gratitude upwards should encrease also. For as every workman is himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in his work, and hath his goodness, power, and skil made apparent by the general perfection of all he doth, so is he yet more eminently herein repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, when of the same lumpe or kind again, he shall cause vessels of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent honor and perfection to arise.</p>
               <p>In order to this, as we finde that those large abilities which men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have above other creatures do chalenge and establish their right of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them, so, since one man hath as great (almost) above another, it is supposeable thereby to chalenge also proportionable superiority amongst themselves. Nor fares it so with man alone, but it is generally observable; that as the Species of creatures have more of perfection one then another, so have they also more variety of degrees in the individuals thereof, one above another.</p>
               <p>In inanimates, that have not wil, their different vertues are without claim or use in the exercise of power and dominion: yet (comparatively) we may see one Loadstone of greater efficacy then another: so as to draw from him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on even tearms, the same mass of Iron. Look amongst plants; their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perfections in the same kinds are to all apparant; and how also one tree or fruit, that is perfectest in the same kind or plant, over powereth that which is less. In such sort, as when we are to set forth Gods power and bounty in the vertues and endowments of stones or plants of any kind, it is our custome, and duety, to instance it in such as are the most rare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect particulars of the same kind, which may by their worth eminently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole.</p>
               <p>Beasts have their degrees of prudence and courage, whereby they come to resemble men, and be differenced above others of the same kind, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with the dominion over one another also.</p>
               <p>Look above our selves, and although our happiness cannot yet extend to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55976:70"/>
know any thing of the true nature of Angels, yet, supposing them in that one known relation <hi>of ministring spirits,</hi> their different degrees and orders in this office of ministration, must assure to us their different gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in performance thereof.</p>
               <p>And here again we are more particularly to consider what was before spoken; namely, that as creatures are in their kinds more perfect, so are the degrees in the same kind more various: that from eminence herein, eminence in power might proportionably arise. For as to have made any one Species imperfect in it self could not be imagined from the power of such an Author, so also, not to have made some individuals thereof more perfect then others (whereby (as it were) to confess that the Authors power by this certain stint was come to its highest pitch) could not be expected from omnipotency either: no more then it could from his justice or goodness, not to Communicate more of his power and particular presence in things thus made perfect. Not that any the lowest thing hath hereupon cause or reason to complain; because each one having a stock of blessing suitable to its capacity, and the smaller and greater vessel being both alike full, they must, in that respect, be alike pleased.</p>
               <p>Nor could God but hereby be much advantaged in general acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilst, in their grateful sense of enjoyment, all things rest contented with the measure of their receits. Thus while each superiour order of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (in that celestial Hierarchy) looks upon those successively below, they must acknowledge their encreased obligations of praise: whilst the lowest of all, standing yet satisfied with continual benefit (and also beholding it self so far enabled above other creatures) all that it can do will be thought too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to requite so large a gratuity.</p>
               <p>If men take also the same course, how shall those of higher power have reason to acknowledge higher praise: and the meanest Subject, even for his being man, and for that proportion of Religion, Liberty, Protection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he enjoyes above other creatures, have cause also to bless that inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible fountain of goodness?</p>
               <p>Whereas, if men and other creatures had been made for vertue or power equal in the individuals of the same kind, then, for want of eminent obligation, and examples of vertue and power in the particulars in each kind, Gods goodness and power should not have been so remarkably set forth as now.</p>
               <p>Nay, this very Office of Kingship will not be lost by his subjection: for its chief duty being protection, this will be alwayes residing more or less in his power: so far as, by such redresses of oppression amongst men or other creatures as shall be the occasional objects of his pity, he shall prove himself actually a King herein: and also so much more resembling God then he, as he shall be more ready and propense thereto, rateable to his small degree of power.</p>
               <p>And the same order may creatures below us go, untill they come to inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates: on which the lowest of sensitives taking its pleasure and content, as it is thereby provoked to rejoyce (which is in its kinde to thank and praise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Maker) so, that inanimate or vegetive again, being not sensible of any pain or injury, continues in its kinde still obliged as before. For as power can be no where in perfection but in God himself, so, to make it subsistent in other things, as approaching him, it must be in making them so only in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55976:71"/>And as the original of power is one, so the more it is diffused, the more weak and unworthy it is. For if all men should have power over all men (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Democratick supposition) as all men have power over all other creatures, or as all Lyons or other Species of creatures have power over other Species below them also; how would power come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for want of eminence? for being thus levelled, he that should have most power, having but what the meanest would have had in the degree of subordination, and so, he that hath least having still but what he hath above other things (for over his fellows he must be supposed to have none) he of the lowest rank is not increased in his obligation, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders are decreased in theirs.</p>
               <p>So that then, if there were not the necessity of subordination as for peace and government sake, yet, as to perfection, and approach to Divine resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance (by bringing the diffused power in perfect creatures to unity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence) it would be needful to men, as with Angels, that from the lowest order of all it should be gathered to fewer in the next rank; and so on to fewer still; till, after the Divine examplar, it were centred in one. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as man is the perfection and Epitome of all other creatures, and as <hi>Adam</hi> contained all men, so should he, or some other, if our fall had not crossed, have stood as the more worthy for receit of Divine favor in himself, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of it to others; with no small advantage to the whole race; even as now we finde it come to pass by that fountain of mercy, but in a far higher degree, since the dignifying of our nature by that one person of our Saviour; and so, by him, having access, we come to be capable of those benefits which without him could not be expected.</p>
               <p>In which respect we may finde him so often expressing himself under the notion of the <hi>Son of man</hi>: even as one who having taken on him the <hi>Semen,</hi> or original element of our kinde, should, to our undoubted comfort, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make the whole race capable of dignity and bliss also. And this, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of our future condition, as Jesus; being that fundamental <hi>Corn of wheat</hi> by whose Resurrection and exaltation the several Individual graines of mankinde <hi>should be drawn unto him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 12.24.32</note> but also, in respect of many temporal advantages arising to us here, as Christ and King.</p>
               <p>In order to the receit of which temporal advantages, Christ himself ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the several parts of his Church his particular deputed Christs (by means of them and their representing of him amongst us) it comes to pass, that each particular man is again made capable of the benefit of Divine protection: at least so far as concerns society and government, as shall be more fully declared in the next book.</p>
               <p>And therefore we may observe, that when God appears in kindness it is to one at once; and that he never makes a general manifestation of himself but in judgement and terror, as to those stubborn Israelites; who thereupon said <hi>Let God speak no more to us least we die</hi>: Meaning that they would have some worthy and eminent person, like <hi>Moses,</hi> to beare their person and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them to Godward. The which people again, although, as they were then Gods peculiar Church and people, and had all other nations blessed or punished, as they were to them benigne or averse, yet was that very love and favor God cast towards them, both at first placed, and afterwards continued, from that more eminent love and favor setled in their first father and original: In such sort, that, after their rejection of their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55976:71"/>
and our Saviour, <hi>a remnant according to the election of grace,</hi> should come still to be <hi>beloved for the Fathers sakes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.28.</note> by that God who out of particular kindness had once stiled himself <hi>the God of Abraham.</hi> And so we shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain finde favors and blessings promised them, even <hi>for his servant Davids sake:</hi> the King and representer of that Church and people. From all which it will be evident that subordination in power is from God: and for the good of the people it is that one is by his providence thus set over them: who should as their Representative <hi>stand for them to Godward.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But to come neerer, to shew what that power or liberty is which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site or proper in political constitutions, we must consider each man as having an appetite and end to follow. But then, inasmuch as before shewed, in the attaining and pursuit of these our ends we did often cross and interfere one upon another, it was necessary that Laws and Rules of Government should be setled to accommodate our actions to Peace and Agreement. For the same Liberty we might before justly claim as men, and due to us by Nature, we cannot now expect as Subjects linked in politique Societies: because as I then acted for my self onely, I needed no prohibitions from evil, or invitations to good; but now, common concern makes Liberty suspensible to common approbation. And because this first natural Liberty was by our fall forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would, (if by our corrupted wills put in full use) prove our destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it was necessary the same should by his power and Laws (and such as he should therewith intrust for Society and Government sake) be so far restrained, as the mutual good and peace of the whole should be advanced; and not the wanton affected Liberty of any part of the State or Kingdom, in prejudice thereof regarded.</p>
               <p>And therefore, the true Liberty of Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects will appear to be in <hi>the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of all external impediments which cross his desires, without regard of more publike utility.</hi> And the two extreams thereof are first Slavery: when this Liberty of the Subject is not regarded at all as to his, but to the Rulers benefit: and then licentiousness, which, without respect of peace and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the good of others, reacheth at all things without controul.</p>
               <p>We may call it a desire of freedom from external impediments: external (I say) because inwardly I cannot be divided against my self. And though the Affections and Reason may have temporary disputes, yet when the Will puts forth to the attaining any object, the impediment that hinders my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it must be without my self: and I can lay no complaint or reparation elsewhere. Wherefore this desire being external, and of a thing in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and possession of another (for if it were in my own I should not deny my self, or had reason to complain) it will follow, that this obtaining Liberty in me to acquire, will be the loss of Liberty in him that is dispossessed. For if our desires are (as indeed usually they are) most heightened and fixed to those things which are most rare and scarce in their kind, and such as through the common endeavor of others have obtained price and estimation, will it not come to pass that my liberty to get from him what is already in his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session or expectation, will prove as great a loss of freedom to him, as it is gain to me?</p>
               <p>So that then, Liberty as it is usually endeavoured and sought, is but the acquisition of power to act or obtain something we have a minde unto, which is now in the possession or power of another. If then I, laying claim to my natural liberty, and forsaking the determination of my rightful superior, will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55976:72"/>
proceed to execution of mine own desires without considering those of others what can follow but confusion? For all men having in Nature equal desires and claim, why should mine prevail in mine own case, so far, as, without leave, to inflict on another what I did before complain of as a grievance towards my self?</p>
               <p>For instance, when fault is found with the yoak of Government in Church or State, as oppressing the liberty of Conscience or person of the Subjects wrongfully, and men, in order thereunto, seek to dispossess the present exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, as abusing their power, and to settle it on themselves or such as they have most interest in, or confidence of (which must necessarily and doth always follow) what is this to the advancement of liberty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in general, or beyond their own particular party? and is to shift, but not to ease the Yoak. What is this but for parties to take upon them to be Judges: and for one part of the Subjects, renouncing the sentence of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and determination that was before held as publike and indifferent to all parties, now to usurp power over their fellows and equals?</p>
               <p>If they plead it is not another Government they seek, but say, "There ought to be no restraint in such and such things at all: do they not hereby seek to introduce that liberty of Anarchy, and overthrow all possibility of Peace and Agreement? For since strife and competition can never happen but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout such things as are desired by others as well as themseves; if then, in this prosecution of these desires on both sides, the common rule of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be not observed as indifferent, must not one party fall out to be judge over the other? Whereupon, as that one party may, in the conquest, call themselves free, so may the other, being subjected and overcome, call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves slaves.</p>
               <p>From all which we may gather the usual mistake in application of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Liberty, as proper to the governed; when it is proper to the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor onely. For to say the Liberty of a Subject is none other then a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: for wherein he is a Subject, he is not at liberty; and wherein any is at liberty, he is not a Subject. But because no government can be so exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, as not to remit some things to the choice of the Subject, he may still justly be called a Subject, even in what he is for the present free: because having been therein restrainable by his superior, his freedom and power to act therein by his own Will proceeded from the freedom and power of the other and is thereupon originally and truely the governors power and freedom, and not the others.</p>
               <p>For since, to the stating of government, an explicite act or execution is not always required, but a true stating the Corelates of governing and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned (whereby the Governor may act as he shall see occasion) it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that freedom in the Subject or Patient, will in order to polity, depend on the freedom of the Governor and Agent: and that as these are more or less obnoxious, so will the governed be more or less free. For as the brain could not impart sense to its own Membrances and Nerves if it were in its own substance in any sort patible, and affected by impression of objects that way subjected unto it, nor could the eye judge of colors if the Christaline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor stood any ways particularly tainted, even so the freedom of Subjects can be but proportionable to that of the person whom they serve: both in order to the singleness and worth of the Commanders, (considered in themselves) and also in regard of the paucity of precepts from them proceeding. Hence
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55976:72"/>
as God can be onely perfectly free, as being alone and onely in all kindes and degrees unsubjected, so can his <hi>service be onely perfect freedom.</hi> Not that service and obedience (as such) can be freedom: but the singleness and high worth of the Commander, must make the commanded to be comparatively free to all others, even in the execution of the command it self. And so will the abatement of number in the persons commanding do the like, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it comes to Unity or Monarchy: so as to make the benefit and good of commanding and commanded, to be reciprocal. For considering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a voluntary Agent, and so having an end proper to follow (and not to be governed like the meer passive instrument) the known good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and power of the commander will be always so ready a stop to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, that the performance of the Governors will shall be the same with his own: as knowing his good to be in all things respected.</p>
               <p>As these considerations will make the freedom of such as are Subjects to the Monarch onely, to be greater then the freedom of servants: because the Prince hath none but God to obey; whereas the Master hath the Prince, and Magistrates also: so again, will he be more free then the Subjects in Polar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies: who have so many above them, that they can, by their equality, neither have any eminence of freedom or honor amongst themselves, so as to give it to their subjects; nor can have such true reciprocal concern in their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects good, as upon the like assurance of their sincerity, to make the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their commands the continual object of their Wills, as the Prince may, for that cause, do. And also because, in obeying him, they do, upon the matter, obey God onely; who hath so commanded: and so arive at a state of perfect freedom: that is to say the highest degree of freedom which humane subjection can admit. For liberty (as before noted) cannot consist in bare freedom to will, for then all would have it alike, but in liberty to act which must imply power: and that the party having it, must, as an Agent and Superior, have others again relating to him, as Patients and Inferiors.</p>
               <p>So that, degrees of subjection being necessary, men then onely come to think they have lost their liberty when they forget that necessary and sure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of duty and obedience, to wit humility: and, proudly overlooking their equals or inferiors, would still retain that freedom and power they have over those beneath, and be also freed from those above him. Thus an insulting Peer, or proud Wife, if restrained by their Prince or husband, from taking their full liberty, calls their subjection slavery: and do repine and complain thereof (usually) oftner, then the meaner and inferior Subjects, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>Therefore, we may say that slavery is thirst of Liberty: and is not proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the measure of Liberty wanting, but to what is desired. And, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Liberty being in regard of the Will, he that cheerfully obeys twenty commands is freer then he that stomacks any one. And therefore, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can never truely be tearmed slavery.</p>
               <p>But they that seem to speak most against extream servitude, say that it wholly abates the courages of men: so that they become unuseful for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Country. A man might answer, that when all Kingdoms should have due subjection, all being valiant alike, none would be cowards. For valour is not proper to Subjects, as Subjects; or to be exercised without leave by one man against another. And if rebellion and stubbornness can onely make valiant, what if we wanted it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55976:73"/>But if it be necessary to be used against such, then it is true that meaner and baser people are not (on the suddain) so fit for martial affairs as others. But this happens rather for want of education and discourse, whereby to know and apprehend sence of honor and shame. For (doubtless) they have their lives in as little esteem as the other; and should usually dare do more, as less apprehensive of danger. And wise men (as wise) must be fearful: and therefore (usually) is the Commander better armed then the common man. But the mean bred man is most subject to run, because not so apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the shame. And, if cowardliness follow subjection, then the very disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of souldiery should amate men most; for that it calls for strict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and duty; and under such tearms of rigour and severity, that nothing but necessity can make the meanest subject undertake it.</p>
               <p>The truth is, though men of servile condition be at first unswayed by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor (the cause of valor) and also for a while (through ignorance) causelesly scared, as apprehending battails above their true danger, yet experience eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day tells us that of these are made good, if not the best, souldiers; at least for foot: for as sense of honor and encouragement encrease with them, so will valor also. Again, they coming from an inferior tank and state of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obedience, are more hardned against affliction then the other: and are beyond them also in discipline and obedience, the main suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of an Army. And, however an Army of voluntiers may, through suddain heat, avail in some present enterprise, yet an Army can never conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and long subsist of such kinde of souldiers onely.</p>
               <p>But let us suppose valour to follow degrees of honor, and that the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath more then the Peasant, the Gentleman more then the Yeoman, the Knight, the Lord, the Earl, Marquess, Duke, each above other; what way shall be now taken to encrease the prowess and strength of a Nation? shall we enlarge the number of Nobility or Gentry, by taking in and enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising those below them, to encrease souldiery? how shall they then be free, when they come by this means to be the meanest and most servile themselvs? Shall we place between the Gentry and Peasantry, a middle degree of Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandry, to make the body of an Army of; and so refuse the Peasant? Each Country hath its own rules herein. But it is generally to be known, that places of command have voluntaries enow: but Souldiers, as to the Bulk of them, are first made from necessitous persons, and then perfected by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
               <p>But to come to an issue, Freedom and Rebellion, Tyranny and Slavery, are tearms of relation; and are the one, or the other, as they exceed their due li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. The Master of the Family, that exceeds in his power beyond the law of God, Nature, and his Prince, is a Tyrant; and his servants slaves: and so is the Prince that rules beyond the Law of God and Nature. And the Prince, or Master, that is straightned from rules or Power below them, are Slaves also. And again, as the Servants or Subjects that resist against such as are lawfully above them are Rebels; so, when their submission is no farther, they are free: be their service as servile as it will. For the tearms of slavery and tyranny express most usually the parties hatred or anger against such or such persons or authorities: and not the truths of the things themselves.</p>
               <p>But, if things be rightly understood and considered, sociable Freedome, or the true liberty of Subjects cannot be separated from subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. In which condition he is more or less Free, as his Prince or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55976:73"/>
is more or less powerfull. And this, because all Laws of restraint having in their intention and aim the hinderance of the actings of some few Subjects that would else likely break forth to the prejudice of the liberty and free enjoyment of others, it will follow, that as Laws are more or less enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and kept up, and as Princes are more or less obeyed, their Subjects will generally be more or less free: that is, unrestrained in their enjoyments. As for example, if the Laws against Murther and Theft, (with all their subordinate attendants to the disturbance of Subjects safeties or properties) be more or less particularly and severely made and executed, so will their liberties living under them, be truely more or less stated also: being thereby rid of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of one another, which is ever most, where the persons are more.</p>
               <p>So that their mistake is now evident, that are so ready to teach Subjects to cal out for possession of that, which, as they are Subjects, is no ways proper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: inasmuch as liberty supposeth power, and not subjection. For as none can govern another wherein himself is not free, so, to suppose any one free, is to suppose him a Governor: for so potentially he is: wanting onely a relative object of subjection to bring this power into act. At which time he that stood before as a free man (separately considered), is now a Governor; in relation to this his object of subjection. And the servant or subject can be no otherwise free, then as left so by their superior: even as the Prince is no otherwise free, then as left so by God. For as power to act, whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or civily, came from him, so are we by such superiors restrainable as by just derivation of power from him are to this end set over us. In which case (as before noted) our obedience is truely our liberty: as being but subject to God, and in pursuance of our own good, the object and end of liberty. And so we shall, whilst complying with the end of the Prince (the good of his subjects) pursue therein our own good also.</p>
               <p>In which consideration, it will fare with the Prince, in those restraints he lays on his subjects for their good (by maintenance of publike Peace and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety) as it doth with Parents in those tasks and restraints they impose on their children, for their better education and benefit hereafter: to wit, that, as children, if left at liberty to be continually spending their time in play and sports, according to their present desires, would inconsiderately make their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty their ruine, even so, subjects also, if the Prince, in a fatherly care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, should not restrain them of such liberty to act on one another as might engage them in civil broils, his indulgence would be their destruction. And as all men do confess, that such Parents as do use those restraints do best perform their offices towards their children, even so must it be acknowledged of Princes: however it may, and doth usually fall out, that, as such Parents are by the children themselves esteemed unnatural and severe, even so, such Princes, by heady and licencious Subjects, are many times reckoned as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: of which we shall next discourse.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of Tyranny.</head>
               <p>IN great alterations, especially of Government, we are not to expect that the Authors should give other then fair titles to what they themselves do, and as bad to the contrary. Thus the <hi>Athenians,</hi> after <hi>Codrus,</hi> would have no more Kings, because he was so good: and the Romans, imitating them in fondness of liberty, would after <hi>Tarquin</hi> have no more neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was so bad. But the truth is, they were both of them people of impetuous spirits; as their neighbours, as well as their Kings might wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>But, from the Greeks we have the name of Tyrant; importing primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Lord or absolute Commander; and of no farther ill. For they were wont to give this name, even to lawful Kings; if they thought them more Lordly and absolute in their Government then they approved of: but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all Kings after their rejection amongst themselves: the more to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that form themselves had cast off.</p>
               <p>After whom, by way of imitation, the Romans hated the names of King and Dictator both, upon <hi>Tarquinius</hi> and <hi>Sillaes</hi> expulsions. For the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heads in both places, so exasperated things in the peoples memories, that, through personal failings, the very Offices and their Titles came to be held odious; as importing oppression and cruelty. But as (hereupon) their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of that kinde of Government made them so hasty to fasten this Title to all Princes, so that very use of commonness took away at last from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probriousness of the Title: insomuch as, coming in the end to signifie (as at first) but an absolute and severe Prince, or else one that through force or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had gotten the Soveraignty, it came to pass that thereupon, the Princes themselves to whom it was given, answered thereto; as not reckoning it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory. For so <hi>Plato</hi> directs his Epistle, <hi>To Dionysius the Tyrant:</hi> and he answers, <hi>Dionisius the Tyrant to Plato health.</hi> And by this name were <hi>Ptittacus</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> both Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> called. But process of time hath made that word to be now constantly taken in a much worse sense: as it doth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word also from them received, namely <hi>Barbarian.</hi> Which name, by them formerly given to all not of their own Nation, and then, by reason of their greater learning and civility, having more esteem then their neighbors, in time it came also to signifie, not onely such as were not <hi>Greeks,</hi> but such as were rude and uncivilized also: be they of what Nation they would. Even as the Jew, calling all Gentile but his own Nation, and other Nations being at that time idolaters, Gentile and Idolater came to signify the same thing.</p>
               <p>But to return to our enquiry; If the name of Tyrant be due to such as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without the express election or consent of the major part of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal people, then was there never any but Tyrants: for no such election ever was had, or could be. If to such as come by the ordinary way of Providence, namely by power of the sword, what shall we think of the <hi>Cesars,</hi> with many other famous Emperors of <hi>Rome:</hi> and of <hi>Philip, Alexander,</hi> and others over Greece, 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55976:74"/>
and other nations; that by conquest and force of the souldiers were holpen to their soveraignties; and so the major part of the people not freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting: and yet have been in Histories famous without such imputation?</p>
               <p>They that say conquest may give title indeed, but that it is consent onely that gives right: If by consent they mean the major part of the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude freely and expresly voting, they will (as formerly said) never finde any so elected: but if by consent they mean non-opposition of his power and command, and so think that possession (as right of prescription in other things) should give him herein right also, they must then finde out some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shew, why, since the force by which he entred is the same with that by which he rules, the facts he did in his entrance should be more unlawful then those he doth afterwards: and the subject (if other circumstances alter it not) not bound to obedience as well then as now. For fear prevails at both times; and it may be in the last time more; as having all the Militia in his power. Unless we shall think that the Prince, in complyance to this opinion shall, in complemental imprudence, resign all his Majesty and power; and, laying aside all that God and his own prowess had already bestowed, put himself (as a man of no greater right then others) to the suffrages of those his Subjects whom he hath hitherto so much offended by forceable intrusion and Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ernment, whether he shall continue their King or no.</p>
               <p>But it may be by some replyed, that <q>If he continue his absoluteness, the people (as exasperated) may endanger him by some violent attempt.</q> True indeed; but then this is most probable to grow from his remisness: for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him they fear least (as most unlike to punish them) and against the mildest Princes people rebel most. And therefore, for farther security, Princes use to impose Oaths of Alleageance on such they fear: that where his own terror cannot prevail, Gods may.</p>
               <p>But, to come neerer the present business; he that by any means makes himself a Soveraign against the right of another is an usurper: and if he, or a lawful Prince, shall, through flattery, covetousness, or revenge, have respect onely to himself or some of his own favorites, without equal justice to all, according to the Laws of God, Nature, and his Conscience, he is so far a Tyrant as he shall then press it forcibly to the overthrow of anothers Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Property. For, in so doing, he ceaseth to act in the capacity of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like person: and, taking on him the affections incident to a private man, he doth thereupon become tyrannical and unjust.</p>
               <p>Nay more, if he, for favor or fear of the seeming whole people or any party thereof, shall, against known Equity or his Conscience, put to death any one of his Subjects, upon no other consideration but in complyance to them, or shall not protect him to the hazard of his life or estate, in case of oppression, he is a murtherer to boot: upon the same ground that <hi>Pilate</hi> was; who by washing of his hands, could not cleer his fault of deserting the innocent. And of this kinde of Tyranny, soft and weak Princes can hardly be free. For they are ever over-ruled by seperate orders or persons of their Subjects: who must, in their prosecutions, have partial designs. For these Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their unactive spirits, kept from knowledge of the true state and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of things, the threats and power of such as they are most obnoxious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prevail with them to believe their private ends, dangers, and wrongs to be his: and thereupon, is his Authority made to become tyrannical; by execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these mens interest and revenge upon their fellow Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55976:75"/>But they that are so ready to accuse and cry out against the severe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Princes as tyrannies (because by degrees themselves would be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less) may consider that Princes can never tyrannize, that is, seek to destroy or severely punish their subjects, as subjects; but as under the notion of their rebels; and such that will not be subjects, he always doth, and may punish. They are to consider, that tyranny can never proceed from a Prince of the same Religion to any height, where stubbornness did not precede as a cause: and which humility might not extinguish, or abate. For as it is not tyranny when a Prince, subjecting a forraign people that war with him, punisheth them, or useth them with severity; no more is it when done against such of his own people as disobey or resist. For they, in that case, taking the event upon their own hazard, have their punishment as enemies, and not as subjects: which may be cruelty, but cannot be Tyranny. For that must onely be the unjust and excessive infliction of a power submitted unto; and not from the degrees of triumph or possession made by a victor.</p>
               <p>And those reports of such as <hi>Nero</hi> 
                  <q>To wish all <hi>Rome</hi> one neck, that it might be cut off at a blow,</q> do become his murtherers to tell, more then us to believe. For I cannot see how a rational man (which none denied him to be) should, at the same time he aims at Empire and Dominion, wish or plot the lessening of it. And, from hence, most evident it is, that Tyranny is (as before noted) but the usual term of political railing; used by such as aim at total insubjection: for otherwise, they would have better agreed in stating of Tyranny, and its marks and degrees, so as Princes might have known and avoided it.</p>
               <p>If usually Government it self (at least such wherein themselves were not chief) were not the intended extream they meant to abolish under the odium of Tyranny, I would fain know why we have not found out as odious a name to express the other extream by; that is, the excess of Princes rewards and favors, as well as that of Tyranny to express their punishments? Being onely, because that no man is afraid of being too much rewarded, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have that extream pass as a vertue, that it may always be run into by Princes. And upon this reason again, in the severe carriage of the Master of the Family, we use no such expression of Tyranny, because it might come about to our selves: and yet is the Father and Husband, more subject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract irreconcileable displeasure against Wife and Children, then the Prince against his subjects. For he may suspect his Wifes honesty, and his childrens extraction; which by no action, complyance, or submission of theirs can be avoided. But the Subject cannot but be beloved in that relation of a Subject: and always in his power it is, to make himself known to be such an one.</p>
               <p>And if severity in punishment must make Princes to be Tyrants, who can judge of that, or its excess, or just measure, but he must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be above the Prince? And will not all Government be more or less Tyranny; because there is always more or less severity? If Tyranny be when the Laws of God and Nature are transgressed (as is sometimes defined) we are still to seek how to be bettered by this information: for who shall judge of that above the Prince also, so far as to condemn him of the breach of any positive Law of God; since he is, as chief Magistrate under God, to have their custody and interpretation; or of any injustice in Government, which, as his trust, can be tryed onely by his Conscience? But this definition will inform us that Tyranny is so far from
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55976:75"/>
proceeding from power, that it is alwayes in the want thereof. For Princes are accompted Tyrants as they stand Subjects; that is, to the laws of God or Nature. Whence we may inferr, <hi>That Tyranny is the act of Oppression forceably committed by one Subject upon another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For so was the taking <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard tyranny: not solely because <hi>Ahab</hi> had private respect therein, but because he proceeded according to sentence of authority derived from himself, in a particular wherein God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred any jurisdiction unto him; but wherein they stood both equally subject. For that God having, by express command from himself, (during the time that state was in a Theocracy) forbidden the alienation of inheritances, and the People being yet bound severally to look to the external obedience of these Laws as they were set down by <hi>Moses, Naboth</hi> might well make that answer he did,<note place="margin">1 Kings 21.3.</note> 
                  <hi>God forbid I should give the Inheritance of my Fathers unto thee.</hi> Importing, that because God had expresly forbid it me, (to whom I am in the first place to be subject) therefore I cannot alienate or give it unto thee. And that this reply was more grounded on fear of displeasing God, then sense of injury to himself, may be also concluded by the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Ahabs</hi> offer unto him; namely, of Money or exchange above the worth. But because, in the Jewish State, (although Kings were eminently entrusted,) the literall observation of the Law was still universally obliging, and to be obeyed by each one in particular, in order to the outward way of regiment God then exercised: therefore could not any King therein, by his command, free them from guilt in such externall performances as their conscience told them were against Divine precept. Therefore, in these cases, the Jewish subject had his only way to avoid rebellion on one hand or other, by being subject to both: namely, by being actively subject to all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and passively to such as the Prince commanded contrary: as formerly noted.</p>
               <p>But although the usual acceptation of the tearm of Tyranny is in acts of high severity, yet, for mine own part, I believe whilst the Prince, in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or punishments, is guided with publike consideration, he can never deserve the name of Tyrant. For even that indiscretion which suddain passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may cause him in any thing to commit, must (at least) be excused by the goodness of his intention. But then, Princes hearts being inscrutable, who shall judge his intentions? Not Subjects certainly. For, besides that it is against their duty, it is unreasonable, as being parties. And, although an other subject (then the present sufferer) do judge, yet is he a party by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent too: because he will presently be applying it, <q>The case may be mine own.</q> And this self-consideration works with all Subjects in general to cry out upon all strictness in Government, as Tyranny. But however, all men must confess that the punished cannot judge over the punisher; that is, of the measure of the execution of his lawful Office.</p>
               <p>And as for the name of Tyrant, me thinks Christians should rather imitate that modesty used by the Penmen of Gods Word, in not using it all, amids the Stories of so many that deserved it, then now to impute to Christian Kings, so commonly, the Heathen phrases of such as never knew the precept, <hi>Thou shalt not revile the Gods, nor curse the Ruler of thy people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22.28.</note> And that (especially) because it is so hard a thing to say what actions are tyrannicall, and how many of them must amount to make that name justifiable to any person: for one cannot doe it, no more then the doing one just deed can make any be called a just man.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of Slavery.</head>
               <p>AMongst other devices men have for the decrying the reputations of such as oppose them in their ambitious designs, the chief is to render them odious by fastening to them the name, and therewith the guilt and scorn of that extream unto which they seem more neer then themselves: not regarding herein whether it be a truth or no. So, (for example amongst other things) they that would make their intended innovations please and take with the people (who are ever listening to all offers of liberty) were wont to call all government differing from their own Tyranny, and all people so governed Slaves.</p>
               <p>The word (as report goeth) cometh unto us from that extream drudgery &amp; servile usage which the <hi>Venetians</hi> put the <hi>Slavi</hi> or <hi>Slavonii</hi> unto, after they had subdued them: and from thence, all base and Arbitrary servitude comes to be called Slavery. But antiquity, and the best Commonwealths and men in them, have, by use, made this subjection lawful: and the word Family takes its name from <hi>Famulus,</hi> as having slaves the greatest part of its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. <hi>Strict slavery we may call a degree of servitude; wherein the Life, Liberty, and Property of a man, hath no assurance or redress beyond the will of the Lord:</hi> for he is owned by him in so high a degree of propriety, that the Commonwealth with her Laws, seems not to regard or protect him as a member. Whereas the Citizen, or him we call a free Subject, claims a right or assurance in all these, by the common Rule or Law of his Country: and hath power of appeal in case of injustice.</p>
               <p>But then again, these Citizens stand in all things as lyable to the dispose of the Law, and him or those that have the Soveraigne interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and execution thereof, as the other doth to the dispose of his private Lord: so that, when it shall be hereby interpreted that the Life, Liberty, or Property of any one is forfeited, there is no remedy, more then to the Slave. Nay, the Lord, in respect of his more assurance of his Slaves obedience, can never look on him as an enemy: and in regard (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) of his more particular benefit by the life and health of his slave, he seems likely to take more care hereof, then the publike Lord or Soveraign; who, in regard of his more common and more multiplyed relations, holds (it is likely) each particular not of so great loss and concern. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (comparing their numbers) more Subjects then Slaves have violent deaths: not onely as souldiers and luxurious, but as criminals. Forasmuch as slavery, wanting hope of farther Property or Liberty then shall stand with his Lords liking, wants also the two usual spurs to rebellion against his Lord, as the other hath against his Prince. And the veriest slave cannot be so wholly deprived of his Will and things delightful, but sometimes to have them: in which case, absence may, like abstinence in diet, make his relish more delightful: whereas the Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects possessions, usually causing covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of more, makes him undelightful with what he hath. And then, since in all strong and eager covetings, what is past is forgotten, and the anxious care
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55976:76"/>
for enjoyment of what is sought, growing to be more to him that seeks more then to him that seeks less, the slave that, for reward of some past labour, hath a tester given him to drink or buy what he likes, is (no doubt) better rewarded and comforted, then where gain is onely for propriety sake: and to the owner accrews nothing, <hi>but the beholding it with his eys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the true use of Property the slave cannot want: that is, meat and drink, and things necessary. Nor is he equally afraid to lose them with the Citizen. For, whilst his Lord hath it, he must, for his own sake, help him too: but if his Lord be attainted, or suddainly or wholly despoiled, he is free, and may go to another: but the Citizen failing, ruines himself, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually his Family. But then, it may be said the subjects Trade, by which he lives, consists not of so base Offices as the slaves doth. And yet, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done by slaves, how base soever, but is done by free-men (as they call them) where they are not: and since these can be hired with mony, I see not but Obedience and Duty should make the deed as commendable.</p>
               <p>And then, as the Subject may appeal from any injuring him to the Prince, so may the slave from any of the Family to his Lord: and as he is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediless, so is the other. And the slave hath this advantage, that his duty is more easily managed then the other; as it is easier to follow plain verbal directions, then intricate Laws: especially when another must interpret them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, as the onely difference between the Lord of a Family and the Lordly Monarch is not in power to command, but in multitude of the commanded; so it will happen, that through impossibility of personal inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Subject avoids the continual eye of his Prince, and thereby he is like one that hath his copy set, that may manage his duty more as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth: yet the slave, that hath, by continual reproof and direction his hand guided, is more sure to do his work better, and so avoid blame likelier then the other: in whom, liberty may cause pride, and pride contempt, and contempt punishment.</p>
               <p>And therefore, we are not to wonder that many have voluntarily gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to slavery: and that some, after experience, and being now free, have (by suffering <hi>their ears to be boared)</hi> chosen it for perpetuity. For certain it is, that the condition of the one is more setled then the other: and that very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of liberty the subject hath above him resolves to this, that the slave must do his duty presently, where the other may fail, and be punished. Nay, in present possession the slave seems more happy; because more contented. For since some liberty must sometimes come to the slave, who expects little, and some restraint (incident to all Government) must come to the Subject, who is still gaping after more freedom; the one must be more content in the little he enjoys, then the other in that great measure he vainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
               <p>But having spoken all this to take down the prejudice of such as (not knowing what slavery is) are ready to fasten it on all such as have not (as they believe) equal freedom to themselves, we shall therefore now, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a slave to be him That is in all things at the arbitrary dispose of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and so out of common protection. For if any be enthralled to the Prince, I see not but that, as his appeal and protection is equal, his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of freedom should be so also. As in Families, the life of Wife and Children have sometimes been at the same persons dispose, to wit, to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55976:77"/>
head of the Family, as well as the slave. And therefore as we see there is difference in the Soveraignty of Princes, one in the comparison of another, so is there in degrees of serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tude, of one Princes subjects from anothers, and of the same subjects amongst themselves. And if all be slaves where ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute rule is, then are the subjects in Aristocracies and Democracies all slaves: with this aggravation, that, in regard of their many Lords, it is hard to escape either task or punishment.</p>
               <p>But I look on slavery as having its foundation in Reason: where the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Conquerer, having power to kill, saves for his own farther service: hereby obliging the other, by way of gratitude, to obedience. But (in after policies especially) it was scarce practised on fellow subjects or natives; but usually on such as were spared in wars: and so <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> served ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they took. Whither this kinde of servitude may be fit to be continued for to save some sorts of condemned mens lives, and make them profitable to the Commonwealth, we will not now dispute: onely, we wish the fault of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this title where it is not due were left off. For if it must follow Arbitrary Government, then (as before said) all Republikes have it: unless you will esteem it an case, that some of the people may rule by turns: by which means, as by a kinde of revenge, their discontent will abate.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, in Aristocracies and Democracies (such as those of <hi>Greece Carthage, Rome,</hi> &amp;c.) slavery is most usual, and most severely exacted. For there, as each one comes to esteem himself a King, having none above him, and yet comes to have so little share of Soveraignty, having it divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many, it will come more severely to be managed over few; for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is an active quality. But Kings, that have many at their command, cannot be so severe, nor the burthen of one so heavy that is born by many shoulders, as where the same is by fewer persons more distinctly born. Again, subjects in Monarchies are by Laws of superiors in their houshold authorities stinted, and seldom is any vassalage great in degree, but where an appeal lies not in case of misusage. For in Republikes, where a Faction and number of persons by conspiracy and agreement come to rule over others, each one hath his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the case: and the servant must look to be more a slave then elsewhere. For as slavery is the lowest degree of servitude, so is it incident to the lowest degree of Commanders: and the subject in a Republike differs in freedom from the Subject of a Monarch, as a King doth in power or honor from that of a Burgomaster. Therefore, if I had onely respected recrimination, and not truth, I needed not to have made any Apology for slavery: but have turned it, with its odium, upon its true Authors, the Polarchs themselves. But that which these people would have be considered and meant by slavery, is not that servitude they impose themselves on their Subjects, but what is by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imposed on theirs: that so, under the noise of slavery, they might cause all Monarchs subjects to become indeeed slaves to themselves.</p>
               <p>But, farther to answer them that will make arbitrary power such an odious thing, and yet grant it to so many; that will make Government depend on Paction and consent, and yet use force therein themselves; let us a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their Justice by these Rules. Suppose those that call themselves the people be (as in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> have been enrolled) usually not the tenth part so many, as the number of Tradesmen, Artificers, freed men, and slaves come too within their own City, besides other Cities and people they ruled over (which it may be in all made more then a hundred to one) how come
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55976:77"/>
these fewer number to rule over the other, and to make Laws to binde them thus arbitrarily without their consents? where are the Pactions they can shew to warrant their so doing? what, are these the whole people, and yet not the tenth part of them? how com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s this name of people to be appropriate to so few, and to impart Soveraignty? Did the major part of subjects grant it? No sure. Do they claim Dominion over their slaves as taken in war? Then they make right of Conquest lawful Dominion. And when they appoint their measure of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rvitude, and time for continuance, is not this arbitrary? What are these many, and variable Laws for shutting out, and taking into freedom, and the several degrees thereof but Arbitrary Government? How comes mankinde into this thraldom of one another? Nay how comes it that whole Nations are to be subject to this arbitrary disposal of the prevailing people of another City? Was it their fault their Prince fought against them? It may be they were not in the battail: if they were, what must they be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for being overcome? If fight, or not fight, or well, or ill fighting be the same, is not their enslaving arbitrary?</p>
               <p>And hereupon, we shall finde that Republikes are ever most greedy of Empire, and do make greatest use of conquest for the subjection of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Nations and other Cities: they having so many to share in the spoils. And if we shall agree to their usual definition of freedom, calling him onely a Citizen and free that hath a share and voice in the Government, then all under their obeysance must be reckoned slaves, as indeed they are: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of Tradesmen, in some Commonweals, the different admission of freed men, and different yeers of emancipation and admission of children to be Citizens, shews all their rule to be arbitrary, and not depending on their pretended Paction or consent.</p>
               <p>Nor is the little finger of these Polarchies heavier then the loyns of Kings in point of Liberty onely, but in Property also: the publike Levies and Taxes being always rateably more in them, then in Monarchies that are of like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for Territorie or number of Subjects. The which must so come to pass, because they can never subsist without Armies: both to force their own vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals to obedience, and also to keep the major part of the whole commonalty and people from having power and opportunity to set up some more eminent person in trust and charge with the Commonwealth in their stead.</p>
               <p>And, to conclude, as we defined the <hi>Liberty of a Subject to be when he shall be suffered to enjoy his own delight and good so far as publike utility is not cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> to <hi>slavery is hereof to be deprived without the same regard:</hi> but in neither case, is the reason and measure left to the parties own judgement, but to that which is publike and common.</p>

                  </gap>ives, and that, as man had the most variety of perfection here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, so stood his obligation of gratitude and praise higher then of other creatures. And this is not only remarkable, in that every thing one way or other is made delightful, but then farther, because the stock of nature (in many kinds) is not of it self sufficient, and because again, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous appetites of others will not many times let things extend to general satisfaction, therefore, to preserve our contents, and thereby invite us to thankfulness, we may observe that each one hath his pleasure and delight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to what he possesseth: even so, that, be it of what kind it will, the possessions of others, in the same, or other kinde, passeth with less repining. For as the food we eat, be it never so unlike the body it self, or never so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from other sorts, doth yet, by long retention and the divers concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and passages of the body, attain at last to a perfect degree of assimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; even so our sence, through daily presence of our own particular enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth at last imprint them unto the fancy with such steady delight, that they come to be valued in a kinde of Identity, or second self.</p>
               <p>Answerable hereunto, both in end and effect, is that property of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or that property that usually provokes us to seek all others, namely that great love of parents towards their children: which, as a thing of greatest use for preservation of mankinde, and esteemed of great concern to parents, comes to stick so close to our affections out of no other considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Insomuch as, in all creatures, this affection prevailes as acquired to its particular object, and not out of any innate sympathy in nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another yongling, of the same or divers kind, if the dam be ignorant of the change, obtains as great love as the true would do: So that Hens (we see) and other fowl will hatch and bring up fowl of other and different sorts to their own: and all, because in eggs they were not easily distinguishable: whereas, after they have taken full notice of their own, a remarkable stranger shall not be admitted. So, in other beasts, before their sense have had time to take notice of the shape or smell of their brood, part of, or all their litter may be changed: especially for others of the same kind, where there is no disparity of size, or yeers. As for men, mark such as have their wives in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition; how they will pick and choose among their children, not as any other affection, but as conceit of propriety shall lead them. And again, such as have just cause to suspect, but yet are not at all jealous (under this conceit of propriety) either love all alike, or distinguish not by any revealing sympathy. Nay, what mother, at the same time of her delivery, might not be cozened with a change; as also, while children are at nurse? Their best security be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this affectionate esteem of propriety makes the poorest parent of all even loth to yeild thereunto.</p>
               <p>And although our particular goods and estates, as being reckoned not of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55976:78"/>
so great concern, nor being so long or often in our sight, comes to have a less regard: Yet an especial indulgence we may observe cast towards them: in such sort, that the true fountain from whom they flow comes many times to be forgotten. For so full of pride and vain-glory are all sorts of men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so heavy a burthen doth the due return of received benefits seem to our ungrateful dispositions, that rather then any diminution of content (through the acknowledgement of such receit) shall lye upon us, we are ready by all inventions we can make, to shift off the plain confession of any dependance whatsoever. And because <hi>It is a more blessed thing to give then to receive,</hi> we would in nothing, or at least in due measure,<note place="margin">Act. 20.35.</note> acknowledge our selves receivers.</p>

From which, as from a stock now our own, our wants being supplied, our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and gratitude comes many times to be forgotten. And this is not onely practised by mankind in general against the common right of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures (as accounting himself sole Master and Proprietor of natures common revenue) but also by Kingdoms, Societies, and particular persons, to the detriment of one another.</p>
               <p>To meet with this inconvenience, many things are by our All-seeing God in his law enjoyned; in acknowledgement of his original and Paramount propriety: for so comes a seventh of our time, a tenth of our substance, the first of our fruits, liquors, cattel, nay of our own sons to be his: to keep us in remembrance that we have not in our selves any unconditionate propriety, not so much as over our own persons. And, to shew that these things are of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interest (as between men, so) between men and beasts, every seventh yeer the land is to rest and lye still: <hi>That the poor may eat, and what they leave the beasts of the field may eat.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23.11.</note> And this consideration is expresly set to the letting the land lye fallow in the yeer of Jubilee;<note place="margin">Lev. 25.4, 5, &amp;c Verse 23.</note> namely that <hi>the land is Gods:</hi> and so, they being but Stewards or Tennants, no humane right of prescription can prevail against his original right. And, in a word, to keep his right and our gratitude in continual memory, were all those sacrifices and other feasts instituted: serving but as so many Indexes and Lessons, to shew <hi>that the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof.</hi> And although we, on whom the dregs of Time are come,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.26.</note> are too prone to forget this everlasting precept <hi>of honouring God with our substance,</hi> yet, as a continual remembrance of his undoubted propriety,<note place="margin">Prov. 3.9.</note> it is our custome and duty (as to pray to him for what we want, so) to thank him for all we receive: which thanks, in the receit of our ordinary food, is called grace: as denying all right of our own, and acknowledging all to be his grace and bounty.</p>
               <p>Which being so, all Societies and men must be looked upon but as Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for such term and condition as the Landlord pleaseth. So that when this great King, after the manner of going into a far country, shall be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not so immediately to operate in worldly affairs and dispensations, but trust the several talents of his bounty to others, as namely to Kings (from whom he expects account to himself onely, as by him onely trusted) we are still to acknowledge Gods propriety in them; and <hi>For this cause are to pay
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55976:79"/>
tribute; for they are Gods Ministers attending continually upon this very thing:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13:6.</note> That is, for to be as Gods unto us, aswel in fastening and assuring our proprieties amongst our selves by his laws (which could not be else distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the common natural claim to one man more then another by any meer humane right) as they are to continue (again) Gods universal claim and propriety, by taking and demanding some part, to keep us in continual memory and acknowledgement of Gods supreme right still, and of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of propriety by loyalty and obedience.</p>
               <p>And as for Gods acknowledging his Minister herein for himself, it is well set forth by that speech of <hi>Zelophedads</hi> daughters, pleading that their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances should still remaine in propriety to them, because their father had not forfeited them by any rebellion against Gods chief Minister, that is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Moses</hi> the then King of Jesurun (or Israel) saying, <hi>Our father died in the wilderness, and was not in the company of them that gathered themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the Lord in the company of Rorah: but died in his own sin.</hi> By which, we may plainly perceive that they claim right for continuance of those the proprieties of their family which were by Gods Minister formerly settled,<note place="margin">Numb. 27.3.</note> because their family had not made any such forfeiture by Rebellion as to cause them to revert again to the first Proprietor, God, and the Prince.</p>
               <p>Which was the reason why, in the case of <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard (before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) <hi>Jezabel</hi> did advise to have him accused <hi>For blaspheming God and the King</hi>; that, under colour of these crimes, she might cause that inheritance to return;<note place="margin">1 King. 21.10.</note> which could not be otherwise done. And therefore, as Kings are Gods Deputies and Vicegerents to us in representation of his power, so are they to be acknowledged his Deputies amongst us in respect of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and unquestionable propriety: even by their receit of such propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions back from their subjects, out of those their proprieties by their laws made, as those <hi>Ministers of God attending continually upon this very thing shall see fit:</hi> either for advancement of Gods (the great owners) service, or the good of himself, or others in order thereunto. Which portions, in the New Testament, are usually included under the general names of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and tribute: because amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom these taxes and contributions were given, they were the usual appellations for publike leavies.</p>
               <p>And this precept of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for acknowledging the Prince his para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount propriety, under the notion of paying tribute, is answerable to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Saviours, including <hi>Caesars</hi> propriety in all things, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of money. For, in deciding that question of the lawfulness of paying tribute, he takes a sure way towards making our proprieties to be <hi>Caesars</hi>: In that, calling the piece of money <hi>Caesars,</hi> because it had <hi>Caesars</hi> image upon it, he concludes him to have the same right to all money as to that peice; for that all money had his image upon it. He doth not say give unto <hi>Caesar</hi> of your money, but, give him his own, <hi>Or, give unto Caesar the things that are Caesars</hi>:<note place="margin">Mat. 22.21.</note> concluding that Gods immediate propriety being for the present entrusted and delegated to these in his stead, we were now to acknowledge them so far, as, by our readiness in yeilding <hi>of tribute to whom tribute, custome to whom custome,</hi> &amp;c. we should thereby, amidst our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duties of giving <hi>to all their dues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.7. Ibid.</note> give to God his due also: And, by our readiness in yeilding to his Ministers to this end appointed, testifie our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55976:79"/>
readiness to have done the like to himself, in case he had deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
               <p>And demand it (no doubt) he doth, aswel from Christians now, as from the Jews formerly: nor hath he lost his true right, although he be not so immediate in his claim. For then, because the law was instituted in the time when God himself was King (that is, had no such direct Officer under him amongst the Jews) the acknowledgement of his propriety (as under the notion of tenths and offerings) was claimed in his own name: and God having thereupon disposed of it, takes the wrong done in Tythes and offerings as robberies of himself. But although these tenths and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as Gods gift to them, instituted by that Law which was still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, were to remain to the Priests and Levites unalterably, without the impeachment of those Kings that succeeded (inasmuch as they had their taxes besides) yet now amongst Christians, whom that Law binds not as positive, but as natural, those Tythes (where they are collected) are, or should be, paid to Princes in the first place, as Gods next Ministers. And although Princes do, upon just grounds, appropriate them to the Clergies maintenance, yet, in acknowledgement of his headship and propriety above them also, he hath tenths, fifteens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> reserved from them again. And this is done to each King under the Gospel, even as King; that is, as Christs Deputy: after the example of <hi>Abraham, Who,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7.9, 10. Vers. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>on the behalf of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, paid Tythes of all he had.</hi> For as <hi>Melchisedeck (the King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and of peace</hi>) was a Type of our Saviour unto whom all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms do belong, so do the tenths and tributes, as Gods and Christs right, belong to Kings their Deputies now: unto whose Office that of High Priest is subordinately annexed. Whereupon, as Kings are Tenants to God for their whole territories (be they greater or less) so are the people again Tenants to him; according to their several allotments and trusts. Upon which ground we may observe, that as every Prince hath the whole power and propriety of all within his dominions from God, and he thereupon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King of such or such a Countrey, so are all lands held, or to be held, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of the Soveraign after one tenure or other: nor can any alienation (though never so independent) exclude his power from making use thereof upon publike occasion: whereby to answer his great trust to God in respect of his service, or for general benefit of his people: nor from his own occasions leading that way also. The which was well proved by our Saviours example, who, sending for another mans Ass, bad his Disciples bring him away without other legal satisfaction, or answer to any for their so doing, <hi>Then that the Lord hath need of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which speech of our Saviours will the more directly prove each Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable propriety,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.31.34</note> if we consider the time and occasion whereupon he useth it: to wit, that he never used it but upon occasion of expressing himself in his Kingly right and Office, in his riding in state to Jerusalem, and there exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising kingly power. Plainly declaring that as no private possession can disim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the publike <hi>Lord,</hi> so may this grand proprietor redemand the same, not only to answer the more publike charges of the Commonwealth, but upon occasion of his own Royal support also.</p>
               <p>In pursuance of which Original Right and Claim, or <hi>of doing what he will with his own,</hi> as we find God, during the Theocrity, making Laws of restraint both for the use and bequest of mens proprieties,<note place="margin">Deut. 21.16, 17</note> so may we observe it still to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55976:80"/>
remain of unquestionable right to his supreme Deputy to do the like by their Laws and Edicts, in the disposal of such part of that kingdoms property which particular subjects, by Laws under him, hold in their hands. From whence, we may call property <hi>That share of the Commonwealth which by the Law is held in severalty to the possessor, free from the dispose of any but the law-maker himself.</hi> Which thing, as it is by them done by power from God, because <hi>the earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof,</hi> so cannot he lose the hold and claim of general right, but the Subject must loose his right of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular propriety also, which is derived from him by vertue thereof.</p>
               <p>But, for a plainer example of Gods claiming his propriety, and particularly of power to impose tribute in acknowledgment thereof, we may observe the same fully set down in the 31 Chap. of <hi>Numb.</hi> In which, God as their present King, imposing such a leavy and tribute upon the people both of persons and goods as he saw fit, did thereupon become a plain and warrantable president for his succeeding Deputies to take the like from their subjects also, even as <hi>his Ministers attending for this very thing:</hi> that is, to receive Gods due, in acknowledgement of that propriety and protection they (by Gods blessing) enjoy under them. In which Chapter, we shall finde the tribute owned by God six several times, as <hi>the Lords tribute:</hi> although it were given away to others,<note place="margin">Verses 28.37, 38, 39, 40, 41.</note> even to the Levites, his then immediate Ministers for receit thereof.</p>
               <p>And as this maxim, that God and the Prince are proprietors of all things, is in it self most true, so, if people would rightly consider it, it is by God upon good ground established for their benefit: because, as every one is most careful of his own, so the Prince, looking upon the possessions of the whole subjects and of every one in particular as his, will be more circumspect to encrease and preserve them, then when they aim to recover or possess any propriety or power more fully, shall set him at strife within his own Dominions. For Princes (as such) should have nothing in the dispose of subjects exempt from their Power, but Honor. For this he can never have by force, and without their consents; or the most or best of them: and therefore he will study, by Complacency, Justice, and meritorious deeds towards them, to be daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring this so precious a Jewel. And they will finde, that whilst he is to make his sole imployment after the search of this onely, that their common and respective benfits will be necessarily sought: whereas, by putting him to strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for other things which they cannot keep justly from him, his care will be neglected, and the mischief of Civil disturbance inevitably will follow.</p>
               <p>And, when all is done, men are but abused by an affectionate conceit of the word: For propriety can never be in that degree they fancy: and if it be not at the dispose of one Prince, it must be of more. For since Laws are but the will and sentence of the Lawmakers, and since proprieties are also but the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Law, it will follow that proprieties of particulars are but the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the publike person that is in soveraignty and power; though not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent act, yet so, as that soveraign may reduce his power to act, as he shall see fit.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, namely to debar Princes from occasion of seeking farther, that such large revenews are allowed in all kinds: that, through their power of interpreting law (the judge of propriety) they need not covet beyond what they have to their own use already. For to allow those that have the particular proprieties aright to judge the rule of propriety, is not only partial but to themselves prejudicial: opening, by that gap to soveraignty, an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to perpetual Civil war. For since every particular propriety is but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55976:80"/>
of the publike (that is, of the general propriety of that particular kingdom) if that publike have not a person of whole &amp; equal interest herein, &amp; thereby of whole and equal in the particulars hereof, how can the whole be duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: since particular proprietors can have no aim but what is respective to themselves? But let us enquire a little farther into these things, &amp; make them plain by instance, and consideration of some sorts of publike good, and of the manner how particular subjects come to have their proprieties therein. That stock of honor which each kingdom hath, one in respect of another, no man doubts but the same is at the Prince his dispose onely: that is, who shall be more honorable then others: and so also, for matter of Offices, and of power and command over one another. For if these things should not all be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to subjects, as from him the general proprietor, how should they proceed with Justice, or agree in sharing them to themselves? would not each one, to encrease his particular propriety, be so covetously contentious as to destroy thereby the stock of the whole propriety? But the reason why Princes cannot be in the particular propriety of riches such immediate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensors, as in Honors, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but must refer them to divers other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to be managed according to his general pleasure signified by Law, is for that land and (the fruit thereof) riches being continually necessary for each subject in particular to have, the business of continual allotment thereof would be so great, that one person could not arbitrarily dispose of it according to the occasion and proportions of that food, apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which should ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and to each one be necessary; and which cannot to any one, at any time be wanting: Whereas Honor, Command, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being necessary, but to few, doth both afford him ability personally to act, and time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult in each particular.</p>
               <p>So then, wealth, riches, &amp;c. are, from their general use and possession, to be guided by common rule or law; but honors are still manageable by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rule, or prerogative law. And indeed, as this necessary and general use of food, &amp;c. makes that kind or possession that is more immediate in acquiring it to be called and take on it the general name of Propriety, so is it (in a maner) the whole subject of law it self. And therefore, we may say the Prince hath no more right to disimpropriate any one contrary to law, then any man hath to take back from another any thing that by his general appointment was given to him; which is unjust, without other circumstances to authorize it. And therefore it will be considerable, whether this gift were absolute, and without all kind of reservation or no: or whether the Prince proceed herein accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to interest and increase of his particular propriety, or no? For if private propriety have encroached on that which should have remained as yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and common, and that without leave, or if there be any conditionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of rent, taxes, or of repossession at a certain time, or upon such, or such default, or the like; by the same general law and rule set down, the Prince may with better right (by his Magistrates) recover his own, then his subjects could dispossess him.</p>
               <p>And as thus to himself and his own use, so although no reservation be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, but where the proprieties seem most high and absolute, the Prince (as aforesaid) may for the publike occasion make a publike leavy as he shall think good. For since all private proprieties will in themselves increase, and be more, as that publike whereof their parts is more, and doth increase, and so on the contrary, it will follow (as a thing of great equity) that private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55976:81"/>
should contribute to this purpose: and that, according to such degree of exigence, as he that is publike proprietor shall finde fitting; that is, for the ways for increasing it by invention of Arts of all sorts, by foraign invasion, with Armies, Navies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by maintenance of it, by Religion, publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, buildings, works, foraign traffick, agriculture, or such like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To keep it from decay, by the same, or like means. For the necessity of having these things to each subject in particular, making it necessary that there should be one to judge and take care thereof in general, must also imply a necessity in the means, that is, publike maintenance, aswel as of the end, which is publike good. But now, although few doubt, that either there should be care or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for publike advantage, or to resist publike detriment, there are many do yet actually, and by consequent, interrupt and deny it: by putting such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and restraints on Princes herein, as, whilst they would disable him from taking more then is fit, they disable him from taking what truely is so: &amp;(thereby) also from doing that good which they ought; as experience too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shew us. How Princes should guide themselvs in their own particular reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and collection and managery of publike charges, is a proper discourse for hereafter. In the mean time, I shall answer in general; that since all these kinds of trusts, as also all others that are in mens managery, will be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to abuse, therefore if it should happen that the Prince should in these things exceed publike regard, the damage and dishonor is not so great to the people to be by him over-reached, as by others of less note and concern in the publike. For he, as the publike Minister, ought to be by them maintained; and the more his honor, the more theirs: but to be cozened by their fellows, and to have them thereby made rich above them (which in all Republikes must come to pass) will neither gain them thanks nor credit. And again, the more the Prince shall gain by frugallity in the managery of those publike imployments and trusts, so much less need have they to add to his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Royal support: Which as it is their duty to do as subjects, so though the same should be done in a manner more plentifully then ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet could not the whole kingdom be therein a loser: seeing it is spent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its members, and within the bounds thereof. For the Prince himself can eat or wear but the share of another man, and what would have been eaten by others if he had not been: and having nothing of the rest but the <hi>beholding it with his eyes,</hi> it is eaten and enjoyed by their fellow subjects: for such even those are that are more particularly waiting on him and called his servants.</p>
               <p>All which, well considered, together with what was formerly spoken of, the reason and beginning of property (namely common improvement by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate managery) as it will (on the one hand) shew it to be the duty of Kings that none of those talents should be hid by them, or lye idle in their own use without necessity, (whereby publike benefit might be hindred) so (on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand) how heavy will it make the offence of Subjects, that, instead of Tenants, shall make themselves such absolute and unconditionate proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as to withstand or deny publike occasions? For if they, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the husbandmen in the Gospel, should seek to make the inheritance their own, and, by way of association and Covenant amongst themselves, seek to kill or dispossess the true heir, what think we shall the great Lord at his coming say to such husbandmen?</p>
               <p>Therefore, as private mens judgements must submit to publike sentence, so their property to publike use: and as all mens proprieties are settled by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55976:81"/>
Law, so, upon occasion of preservation of that Law, they may be disposed of: &amp; that according to the judgement of the King, the Maker, Keeper, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of these Laws. For the Soveraigns office being to protect his subjects li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties &amp; properties against all others, he cannot do it against himself, no more then he can binde his own hands. It cannot be done by another, because on earth he hath none equal, or Superior in his own Dominions. And if it could be, Government would not be: because our persons and estates are the onely objects of Government. And the same rule is in a Family that is independent: for, in both, all is to be supposed at the proper disposal of the Prince and Master. And upon the same ground that the sojourner in the Family, and Ambassador or stranger in the Commonwealth, have their freedom in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or estates (that is, because unsubjected) those that are subjected may be justly made lyable. And as these Reasons wil allow him power in general to lay Taxes according to publike occasions; so thereupon also, to judge in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular what is the concern of these occasions; and the charges and expence in them required: according whereunto he must have power in his Levies.</p>
               <p>And they that from the instance of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, would conclude for the same absoluteness of Proprieties under the Gospel, will farther finde themselves mistaken: for that unto the Jews their promises for reward of obedience ran still in a strain of this kinde, <hi>Blessed shalt thou be in thy basket,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut.28.5.&amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>in thy store,</hi> &amp;c. but under the Gospel, not a Promise that way: but rather, <hi>Blessed are the poor, woe to the rich,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.20, 24.</note> &amp;c. And as for this reason, it was not to be in the Prince his power to punish whom God hath rewarded, so again these established proprieties belonging necessarily to the support and division of the several Tribes and Families, their alienation from Tribe to Tribe, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to Family, was prohibited by him that had promised and foretold, that our Saviour according to the flesh should come of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and seed of <hi>David.</hi> All which considerations were the reason to keep that exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heraldry and Genealogies amongst them: lest the knowledge and proof of both <hi>David</hi> and his Family should have been confounded or lost. So that, by this means, particular mens proprieties having an end or good looking beyond the good of that Jewish Nation, it was the reason that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince, the Representative of that Nation onely, nor the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themselves, could, without leave from God (the sole universal Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Jews and Gentiles) have power to sell and alienate their Proprieties of Land, more then they could change or lose ther Families or Names.</p>
               <p>But, after our Saviors birth <hi>(the heir of all things)</hi> our Proprieties are to be retaken in him on other conditions,<note place="margin">Heb.1.2.</note> and to be held but as of him or his chief Ministers: not as in absolute severalty, but in such manner and measure as these his deputies shall finde fittest for supply of that general want which other our brethren under their charge shall require. All which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve intimated, not onely by our Saviors sending for the Ass before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but in the primitive selling their hereditary possessions.<hi>Of Lands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act.4.34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>or houses, and laying them at the Apostles feet.</hi> By which deed, they, in the name and behalf of succeeding Christians, did renounce legal uncondition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Propriety: and shew themselves now willing to accept of the distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christs Ministers, to be held no otherwise from the common enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others then the common owner shall authorise. And however the Apostles, during the power of heathen Magistracy, could not have compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ananias</hi> to have submitted his former title to their dispose, (but that he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55976:82"/>
might have kept it still his own) yet was their fact that did so, left as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable president for Christian submission to authority upon publike occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>But now, upon all these grounds and reasons before mentioned, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Polarchies must (amongst other their defects of right Government) be faulty also in this matter of Propriety. First, for that they, in their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unwarrantable jurisdictions, being not capable to unite and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (as from under God) the whole and intire Propriety of each Country, cannot thereupon be able to distribute and settle legal and rightful portions to each particular person and Family: but each separate person and Family herein, undertaking to be possessors and sharers by Authority derived from themselves onely, and not from any above them, must thereupon be unjust and partial usurpers. And again, the Polarchs having distinct Proprieties (whether you respect them as divided amongst themselves by Factions, or from one another singly, by that particular love which must follow the care of each mans Propriety) they can in neither consideration accompt their Proprieties and the publike to be the same and convertible; but must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to proceed both partially and oppressively in their Levies. And because the Governors themselves consist of different interests and judgements from one another, they must also be guided in what they do upon those below, or upon one another respectfully to that self-regard: according as they can drive it on by Faction; and not out of general consideration, as before noted.</p>
               <p>And, as this will cause them to be partial and unjust, and by reason of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal concern laying more on one part of their subjects then another, as they shall conceive them friends or enemies (under the notion of well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or ill-affected) so will this their own multitude cause them generally to be oppressive: in that they, with all their allyes and dependances, striving still to engross so large a part of the publike stock in their private hands, will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be put upon continual plots to make and raise Taxes; out of which they may raise their own fortunes also: which is the reason why the Taxes and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies in Polarchies run so high, over they do in Monarchies of proportionable bigness.</p>

               </head>
               <p>EXcept God Almighty, who alone is omniscient, and to whom, by creation and omnipresence, the goodness, deserts, intentions, and actions of all creatures, with all their circumstances and relations are truely valued and known, there is not unto any thing else imparted such a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of comprehension, as to make a perfect and true estimate of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of actions, and distinguish between right and wrong, equity and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For as unto him, the rightful Judge of all things, this ability was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary and proper, so, to men and other creatures, to whom subjection did onely belong, it is more fit we should know what, then why to obey. And indeed, the sad price of our fall hath furnished us no farther, then with a seeming knowledge herein: and to no other avail, then to prove us thereby <hi>the more blinde, because we now think we see.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Examine our abilities in this search, even of those things that concern most each mens particular, and we shall finde, that while cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>om, education, or the like, prevail as the censures of good and bad, in objects and actions and that this is differing again according to each parties inclination and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the knowledge of good and bad must consequently have no certain or fixed aboad. And if thus in what is so nigh unto us and concerning our own more private good, what can be expected in things or actions of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concern; and wherein more general approbation should concur? Will it not hence follow, that if I have no sufficient ability to judge what is good for my self, I should have much less to do it for another? So that, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the different disputes hence arising, not to be satisfied and silenced by every mans own wisdom, brought men everywhere for quietness sake to refer themselves herein to custom and publike allowance: insomuch as now, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Equity, and Right, is whatsoever the lawful Authority of each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try says it to be.</p>
               <p>They that think that the rectitude of the Laws of God and Nature should correct and set right the positive constitutions of men, will finde great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty truely to number and state what these Laws are. In which doing, and in the interpreting and applying them, so much difference and uncertainty will still arise, that we shall again (many times) want another light, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the beams of these lights from other lights, and also to shew when they point directly to the business in question, and when not. As for instance, in these Laws known to be received from God himself, how ready are we to balk their litteral interpretation, and judge of the fitness of their execution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they refer to publike Utility: and that by rules of our own seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reasons: and many times again, to trust to their letteral interpretation onely? Nay, all that acknowledge them for rules, practise sometimes one way, &amp; sometimes another. Wherupon, denying that either way is to be wholly followed, it must needs leave it doubtful, whether in our so doing in each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, we lean not too much to one hand or other. For so, theft by them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55976:83"/>
punished with restitution, is in other places capital: and on the contrary, Adultery by them punished with death, is by others censured in a less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>Look we to the Laws of Nature; if thereby they intend those rules and customs which are universally common to us with beasts, how shall man, which so much differs from them, pick competent rules of good, and fitting both his and their particular? What, shall he live in Herds and Droves, and again destroy Policy and Property to enjoy their communion? And, because we would not have them kill us, must we (with the <hi>Banians)</hi> think it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to kill them? And, in particular, what Law in Nature shall we finde to found marriage upon?</p>
               <p>And if we seclude man, to follow some rule proper to his own species, and put him for his practice and imitation to learn what is done by others, you will finde this practical direction still render him as defective in ability to determine what is just and good, and what not, as before: For here, if you take in that practice of mankinde which is most common for a rule, who shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge of that: or shall the fewer and wiser Nations be governed by the more foolish? Shall Idolatry and slavery be thought founded on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because so generally heretofore, and yet practised?</p>
               <p>If by Law of Nature you mean the best Reason, who shall judge of that also? Can you think that any Nation, People, Faction or single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, will condemn themselves of imprudence and injustice in what they do?</p>
               <p>And since each people hath its peculiar Reasons for what they act or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and it may be unknown to any but themselves, how shall they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be guides to the practice of others, and their Reason be found a reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way fit for guidance of such as must necessarily differ from them? But experience being so ready to testifie both these differences and their irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilableness, amidst that partial respect each people casteth to its own customs. I shall not need to instance therein: but shall here somewhat examine that rule which men have more generally concluded to be so infallibly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally binding, as to suffice for application and direction in all particulars; namely the rule of <hi>Do as thou wouldst be done unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This rule must in it self be acknowledged as a direction most fit and full for the steering us in our deportments and abearances one towards another; being accompanied with such other helps and qualifications as hereafter shall be spoken of: but if taken alone, and at liberty made use of, according to each ones separate judgement, it will put us upon the same uncertainty (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) we had before, For it makes the will and choice of each man the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for good and equity: so that what I would be content another should do to me, I may do to him. And then, considering how weak and differing the judgements and wills of men are, right and wrong must have the same chance. So that he that is a fool and cannot tell what is for his own avail, may yet have hereby liberty to prejudice and impose on me. And again, he that through vitious inclination and custom cannot distinguish of good or bad, just or unjust, will have the same advantage over me too. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, one that is brought up, or otherwise agrees in opinion with such as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Community of wives or other things, may he not by this rule make use of my wife, being himself before willing, I should not do the like to his?</p>
               <p>They that seem to make this Rule more pointing and express, by enlarging
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55976:83"/>
it, say that because I would not have any thing done to me against my liking, I should not therefore act on another against his. And then, according to this rule; they say the taking away a mans wife against his liking is a plain wrong: (and a sin I hope it is, although all private parties should consent) By this turning of the rule, they conclude indeed against the first inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but avoid not the uncertainty of the direction, but onely alter it. For whereas before, I might act according to my own will and opinion of right and wrong, now is not the Will and Opinion of the Agent, but of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient made Judge: and I am to suspend execution till the consent thereof be had and known. And then, what help to the discovery of right or wrong; since every mans Will and judgement (as before) is still made Judge? And besides, by its limitation, it will put a stand to all business. For if I must not act until I know anothers liking, I shall then, it is to be presumed, not act his liking but in what may be first apprehended to my own advantage: nor he so from me. And then, in case of stubbornness, how shall business be done, and who shall judge when the denyal is just, or unjust; for nothing in the rule can do it? Again, what right hath the Will of another to be a stint and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to mine? as though my Will could not tell mine own desires, and were not as infallible in judging right and wrong as anothers. And take it which way you please, instead of giving the rules of directions for mens Wills to follow in the choice of good and bad, mens wills are made dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to it. And although it be a rule certain and infallible (as aforesaid) in its self, as to the general stating of us just or unjust before God (who judgeth by the heart and general inclination as hereafter shall more appear) yet in respect of us, and the imbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ility and partiality of our Reasons in using and applying it, it comes to be but contingent and fallible in particular manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: as not having direction and plainness enough, to shew in each action whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have done well or no.</p>
               <p>As for example, I that am to contract with another for House or Land, or any Commodity I want, am I to give the seller the price he asketh, because; supposing my self the seller of any thing, I should be willing the buyer should give me the price which I should then demand? or shall the seller be bound to let the buyer have it at the price he offers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when himself is to buy of another, he would have it at the price he bids? If you suppose neither of these prices to take place, how shall Contracts go on? If either of them, how will you avoid the inconveniencies of partiality, arising through each mans judging for himself; but make it onely unnatural; whilst they must thus wholly be prosecuting each others good, and be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whilst they are thus neglecting their own wants and desires, which they do know, to be, as in a kinde of Complement, reciprocally prejudicing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in obtruding to supply those wants and desires which they know not: unless we shall suppose all mens judgements, wants, and desires equal? Or shall we suppose that course to be taken which can make this rule alone most pointing, namely that we should neither so wholly consider our selves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out others, nor others without our selves, as to be forgetful of either: but that, both parties are to be taken into equal consideration. The Question will be, whether the buyer or seller shall be the judge and determiner herein? and next upon what manner of evidence shall he proceed towards the discovery of the others wants and desires, so as to secure himself that upon a just conference thereof with his own, he hath judged impartially: and so avoided sin, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the rule?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:55976:84"/>The seller, it may be, through good husbandry or good fortune got his commodity very cheap; it may be it cost him dear at first, or is grown so to him through casuality or neglect: what now shall he do? Shall he sell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably cheap or deer to the rate the thing stands him in, he must then prejudice himself or another? shall he, as he knows the buyers poverty or riches, or as he findes the thing more fit and useful for him then others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease or abate accordingly his price? How shall he know these things? and how shall he be a competent judge? And if you make the buyer Judge, upon like considerations, how shall he know the others condition also?</p>
               <p>Now, as for matter of Government, this rule will of it self alone be so far from estating men regular and obedient therein, that it will take off all kinde of subjection at all. For since the Prince or Magistrate would not be willing that I should have command over him, how can he justly have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over me? If we give the superior leave to apply the rule otherwise and say forasmuch as he himself wronged and in distress, would be glad to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the power of another, therefore ought he also to preserve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his power that he may in the like kinde be serviceable to others: then, supposing the present possession of power in the Superior a just bar against the inferiors assumption of the rule, and desiring power and superiority to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like to his superior, or others, we are fallen upon a right rule against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and insubjection towards the present higher Powers: and so we will next see how this rule can alone steer us under Government.</p>
               <p>If it point at equal and Arithmetical Justice and proceeding, making the good and liking of Kings and beggers alike valuable and controleable at the arbitrary discretion of each other, then, by overthrowing distinction and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it overthrows Government and Society. Or take it to point Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically and respectively, and so determining that beggers should do unto Kings as they would if themselves were Kings be done unto, and so on the contrary, how will they come to fancy (through so different educations) the same inclination to vertue, or ability to judge thereof? and since experience tells us, how hard it is for us to manage aright those callings we were bred in, what hope of ability or skill in those so far removed? For though <hi>David,</hi> as proper to his Office of King, could rightly judge amongst subjects, saying, <hi>the man that hath done this shall dye the death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; shal make restitution four fold,</hi> yet when he comes to be told <hi>thou art the man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> he thinks not fit to execute mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on himself: <hi>but submits to God,</hi> as having onely power of punishment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.<note rend="inter">psalm. 51.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And from this uncertainty and diversity of appliation, it was that men first entertained polity, and more positive and express rules of decision. But here again the same hazard overtakes us. For since these rules and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be expressed by words, as the current Tokens of mens mindes, and words have not onely different interpretations themselves, but men also differ in the manner of expressing them, how shall it be known what the words themselves import, or whether poetical or Rhetorical improprieties have not so far abused us, as not to know whether litterally taken they are to express the Authors minde or no? To remedy which, there is no way to Peace but to admit a positive Authority for interpretation of this Authors minde, as we did before for yeilding thereunto.</p>
               <p>So that when all is done, the result of right and wrong is but the sentence of Law, and the sentence of Law the sentence of the present supreme Judge
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55976:84"/>
That is, either the direct sentence of God himself, in what is undoubtedly set down by him; or the sentence of the Prince; interpreting and judging in his stead, in all things here amongst us: unto whom the application and managery of this general rule was intrusted. For he, having in him, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Representative, the universal will included, can be onely in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars directly said to do as he would be done unto, and to love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himself: because having a common and like interest in, and with them, and subsisting by their good and benefit, it must consequently be always by him measured as his own: that is, equally and impartially so, because to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally his. Whereas I, in doing as I would be done unto, or doing but as any other private person would have me, the dealing must be unjust because par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial: one Will and Understanding being onely judge of what was of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to both. And though both should consent, yet the rule might be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and commonly is: because few things can be of such separate concern, as wherein directly, or by consequent or example, others besides themselves were not interessed: and so, not having full content, the rule of Do as thou wouldst be done unto is broken by both of them.</p>
               <p>For our Wills, in choice of good and bad, following each ones sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Understanding, and that again depending on, and varying according to the several observations which each one hath made of what is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and usual, it will follow that the nature and sense of right and good, must in our judgements be as variable as those inductions out of which we concluded it were. And this, because we are not here put into the world to be Standards of good and bad our selves, but to estimate and conclude it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of that tacite verdict which the harmony of effects and operations in the course of Nature informs us of (whereby constancy proves at once both God the Author, and the Act good) or else implicitely to yeild to a positive command of God, determining good by his direct Precepts to us himself: and in case Gods own directions appears not, by referring us to Princes for what he leaves, and to Masters or Fathers for what they both leave unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined: Lest else, our different Judgements and Affections, causing differing prosecutions in the attainment of more less and private good, they should lead us to lose our greatest earthly good, which is Peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as all Government was at first Arbitrary, so it is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, until God himself by <hi>Moses</hi> had given set Rules for mens sociable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, any other composed or setled Rule was established for knowledge of good and right, then what proceeded from the Dictates of this Prince or head of the Family. For each Father had it as well in his power as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (like <hi>Abraham) to command his children and houshold to keep the way of the Lord, and to do Judgement and Iustice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.19</note> And then also, innocency of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and natural simplicity in the use of pleasure; as it kept them from much coveting, so from many of those strifes and injuries which our luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries now produce. And for reconciling those differences that should yet happen, they had the ready determination of the Father before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Nor stood they in such need of positive Edicts to keep them steady in case of change, because, through length of age, he might live to see many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and as it were whole Territories peopled out of his own loyns. Then was he probably brother, or neer of kin to the great Father of the next Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory: and so, kept from forreign injury. Whereupon, what by knowledge
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55976:85"/>
of their duety, and what by force of Education, and remembrance of these rules and precepts themselves formerly learned, the fathers of the several inferior Tribes and families had means of sociable entercourse and neighor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And, where maxims drawn from natural Law and equity were not so plain a guide, there, usual custome and practise was their supply: and where custom was dubious, parental authority was definitive, and bore sway.</p>
               <p>And as that course of life is alwayes most pleasant to which we have been most enured, so it seemed also to them most reasonable, to continue those rules that publike consent, long use, and tacite agreement, had now made to have the force of Law. And, in a manner, all laws (especially such as are called common) are but the customes and usages of our country. Therefore, with them question was never made, whether customs should be kept or nor, but whether any such custom were; or whether it did make for the side of Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff or Defendant? And the old definitive sentence being now dead, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed and divided families found Law, in it self, no more available to Peace and Unity, then the Light of Nature had been before. For when Custom or Law was alleadged, what and if the other side denyed it, or gave it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary interpretation? In this case, no way to Peace, but to rely on some sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence beyond appeal, for the decision and interpretation of these Laws. For, to imagine a Government to meerly arbitrary, as where there is no kinde of Law, Custom, or Rule of Government agreed unto or practised, is against Reason: because, even the prudence of Governors must, for their own ease sake, lead them to permit this course. And, it being for themselves impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to entervene in all the emergencies of their subjects, it will be expedient to commend and enjoyn unto them, the observation of all such old usages as to them seem most expedient: which thence coming to be Laws, we may call <hi>Law a rule of deportment enforced by a Superior:</hi> and hath with us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its several aims, several names.</p>
               <p>That which directs us to future bliss, divine Law. That which concerns us as men, and directs to the attaining the felicities of our kinde, we may call natures Law, or the rule of Reason. That which concerns men linkt in soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. National, or Civil Law: which is nothing else but a publike direction for mens sociable abearances one towards another. For as Peace, Union, and ceasing of strife, is the main end of polity and Government, so is this end, not onely to be attained by the decisive power when controversies are on foot, but by the directive power also: that prevents, as far may be, their birth and growth.</p>
               <p>And for our failing or following this rule, it is not the law it self that can or doth determine: although the Judge, in his decision, take direction from thence, by way of president, how to proceed. They that think law hath in it self a power to decide controversies, let them consider that there are no where so many, as where laws do most abound. For men are there often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est found enquiring the meaning of them: which (with us) is called going to Law. A thing which none would do, for the loss thereby received in case he be overthrown, if he had before hand known that the Law would have made against him: but each side through private passion and partiallity thinking it make for him, it would be considered, if there were not a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive sentence in the interpretation of law, of how little availe to peace Law would be in it self.</p>
               <p>So that, Laws now appearing to be made chiefly for the governed, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55976:85"/>
thereby they might have directions how to attain or avoid the benefit or punishment of sociable duties, we shall therefore finde them still promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and addressed to the people. But as for Governors, having the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of the whole publike good unto them committed, these rules are either by them framed, or by God and Nature set down as to be enforced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to that end: and all other secluded the interpretation or application of them.</p>
               <p>To which end, namely to shew that the sentence of the Judge is still made the Standard and Rule of judgement, we are to interpret those words of <hi>Solomon, A King that sitteth on the Throne of judgement scattereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all evil with his eys:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.8.</note> which way soever his definition of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth lean, evil and injustice is departed from thence: and cannot be imputed thereunto, more then injustice to one that is just. For so doth he also explain it, <hi>to punish the just is not good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 17.26.</note> 
                  <hi>nor to strike Princes for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the contexts of these two places do most plainly confirm Justice to be positive upon Authority, and not depending on the various judgement of private mens opinions: and this is done by adding the Precept of right Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances and Weights presently after.<note place="margin">Prov. 16.11.</note> Which things are commonly taken as the emblems of Justice. For so it is said, <hi>A just weight and ballance are the Lords, all the weights of the bag are his work.</hi> By which words, God own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original of the measure of Justice to be from himself, (which we know he doth no otherwise execute and manage then by that divine sentence he put into the <hi>Kings mouth</hi>) it must follow, that as the proportion of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in all things is rated by those Standards which are by his Authority ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, so also,<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> as his Authority is uncontroleable in setting the Standard for the Pound, the Bushel, and the like, his Authority in stating and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding other controversies and things must be uncontroleable also: even for that all things done by a different Standard of Justice are for the same cause unjust. For as there can be but one Standard (as by the context of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place appeareth, saying, <hi>Divers weights and divers measures are both of them alike abomination to the Lord)</hi> it is in effect to conclude as aforesaid,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.10.</note> that at the first definition of the size of the Pound, Bushel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were from Authority, even so, the measure of Justice in all things else must rest on his determination: and that, the difference from that is inequity, because departing from the rule to appointed; and not, as out of inherent justice in the things themselves. For had Authority appointed any other different weight or measure, which is now disallowable, to have been the true Standard, then had the other, that is now the rule of Justice against it, been the faulty one to it; even as those faulty ones are now so to this which is by Authority set down.</p>
               <p>For except there be such a positive and standing way and rule for establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and defining righteousness and judgement, as by a King <hi>sitting in the Throne of judgement, who can say</hi> (as in the next verse follows) <hi>I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin</hi>? because,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.8. Verse 9.</note> if his appointment and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of such callings and ways of comerce make not our gainings upon one another lawful farther then the rule Do as thou wouldst be done unto hath first been reciprocally examined and assented unto by the particular dealers, then are all dealings unlawful: forasmuch as intent of separate advantage is still in each ones design, and the others benefit or suffering never openly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55976:86"/>
and impartially considered therewith: of which more anon.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we must say, that since Laws are necessary in Government, and since a publike definitive sentence in their interpretation is necessary to Peace, and since in the Cases and Questions of misgovernment, the breach of Laws is as well denyed on the part of the Governors, as affirmed on the part of the governed, it is against all Reason and Rule of Equity, for any body or order of the people to usurp this inseparable and prime mark of Soveraignty: and become judge to their fellows, and to judge those that should have been their Judges also.</p>
               <p>And if it be granted Princes to have power to make Laws, it must be presumed that themselves should best know their own meanings. And, a thing against reason it must seem, first to affirm that Rulers or Princes are to govern according to Law, and yet deny them the power of knowing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting them. What, would they have him follow a rule he understands not, how shall it be a rule then? Therefore, when men think it necessary for Kings to be sworn to govern according to Law, they must conclude they have liberty of interpretation allowed them; or his oath is null and useless.</p>
               <p>And so we must conclude, that since all positive Laws are to be founded on those of God and Nature (for Law-makers can have no Laws but these above them) and since the meaning and measuring of these are disputable (as hath been hitherto shewed) Reason and Duty do enjoyn us to submit to the known and undenyable precept of obedience, rather then (after the sin of breach hereof) we should be but at the same uncertainty of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as before: with this aggravation, that in the first case our excuse for fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is easie, but in this last, it is no better then pride.</p>
               <p>But they that yet think there are within the compass of natural Reason such general rules and maxims of Justice and Equity as to enable men to judge of right and wrong in things done by Superiors, let them tell me why <hi>Ely</hi> (of whom we finde nothing of ill mentioned besides) should be so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punished for his sons faults whom he did reprove:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.13. 1 Sam. 8.3.</note> and why <hi>Samuel</hi> should escape, that shewed greater indulgence to his that were as bad? If, in these and other like instances they will say (as they must) that <hi>the judge of all the word doth right</hi>; in respect of his equal and paramount propriety in persons and things,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.29.</note> they must then confess, that his deputy therein which shall be amongst us, must be holden as uncontrolable judge of right in his jurisdiction also. So that, for <hi>David</hi> to take away half <hi>Mephibosheths</hi> Land, who was loyal, and give it to <hi>Ziba</hi> his servant whom he knew had both abused his Master and him, and that without any legal form of process, must yet be acknowledged as rightly done by that supreme Officer, who being substituted in <hi>Elohims</hi> prime right of <hi>Mishpat</hi> amongst us, cannot therein be controled or censured by any else.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.11. &amp;c.</note> And if any will yet say, that these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer instances might have been found right even by the rules of common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, had we been knowing of all the circumstances of them, they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also confess, that since the Judge hath his secret reasons proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to judge by, so can there be no definitive proportion of Equity but what is from his sentence proceeding: until there can be some way found to search into Gods secret Counsels, or <hi>the heart of the King which is unsearchable.</hi> For, as it is the glory of God <hi>to conceal a thing</hi> (that is to keep his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55976:86"/>
from common apprehension) so <hi>it is the honor of Kings to search out a matter:</hi> and, by vertue of his deputation from God,<note place="margin">Prov. 25.2, 3·</note> to give always <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine sentence,</hi> whereby not to err in <hi>judgement:</hi> that is, not so to err,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.10.</note> as not to be the rule of Justice to those below, although it may be erronious and unjust in it self: in relation to that full and high interest and jurisdiction which God hath above him. And therefore that wise King makes <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Wisdom, Instruction, Justice, Iudgement and Equity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> depending on obedience and attention to God and our lawful superiors; when he says, <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom; but fools despise wisdom and Instruction</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> all that are disobedient and conceitedly wise are fools: and when he next says, <hi>My son hear the instruction of thy Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and forsake not the Law of thy Mother:</hi> that is, learn Religion, Law, Equity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from thy ghostly and civil superiors.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we may farther say, that <hi>justice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quity,</hi> so far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns a Commonwealth, <hi>is to be that way and course which is most advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to publike utility</hi>; and that <hi>Law is the rule set down by those that have chief Authority and trust therein.</hi> And therefore is that maxim avowed as the ground of Law and Equity in a popular State, <hi>Salus populi suprema lex:</hi> For the directest course to that end is the greatest Equity: and those that have the charge of the end, have also the charge of the means, in assigning that which is most just and fit. And therefore in this case, we must reckon the society, as it is united for common good, as one person: So that then, as Nature teacheth all men to benefit themselves, so doth polity direct the publike. But then again, as each man in wronging another doth wrong himself, so societies, when they practice injustice, oppression, &amp;c. do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods punishments feared to follow thereupon, wrong themselves also: and do (as we before observed of particular men) prefer a less and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany benefit, to a more high and lasting one.</p>
               <p>Upon which ground there is another maxim avowed in Monarchy, that <hi>the King can do no wrong.</hi> Not denying he may do himself and others harm: but so long as we do (according to our duties) submit to that he doth command, he can do no wrong. For he can of himself have no private respect, but must judge all alike as out of common regard: except where, and when some persons or order of the people, taking on them his Office of judging equity, and, in partiality to themselves, thinking and seeking more then is already allotted, make it a wrong to the other side, by having the cause decided by a private and partial judgement: for, take away Justice in the fountain, you may vainly seek it in the streams. And thereupon, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> prays to God to give him <hi>an understanding heart: to judge the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and to discern between good and bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And such as are not openly denying supreme Authority to be obeyed, and would yet by consequent overthrow it, by allowing inferiors a liberty to judg and act beyond, or otherwise then is enjoyned, let them consider the answer that God gives to his chief Magistrate that would undertake to know the way and means of honoring and serving God better then himself, and would make that solemn established Law of Sacrifice, defeat his present command which was but extemporary; namely that <hi>Obedience is better then sacrifice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.22.</note> 
                  <hi>and to hearken better then the fat of Rams.</hi> For I verily believe that no subordinate Magistrate or subject can have a fairer plea for disobeying his King commanding in Gods stead, then <hi>Saul</hi> might have had here
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55976:87"/>
for refusing <hi>Samuel.</hi> For if it had been at all lawful for inferiors to judge of fitness and morality, or to set a former command or Law against a latter, what more just and reasonable then, first to preserve innocent creatures, whose destruction (on one hand) could have been a benefit to none, when as (on the other side) they (being thus imployed) should have so expresly advanced Gods way of service constituted so solemnly already. And we might thereunto add (that which some would make of highest value in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and bad) that the importunity and request of the people ran that way also.</p>
               <p>And as our prying into the reason of Gods Laws, and not obeying his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Precepts, was our Original fault, and a sin in the government of nature, as shewing a mistrust of Gods wisdom or care of us, so, in obedience to civil Laws, to seek out another equity then they import, is not to be subject to Law, but to controle it. And as God said to <hi>Adam, Who told thee that thou wast naked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>hast thou eaten the fruit I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?</hi> So Princes may say to subjects, that without authority undertake to judge of publike good and bad, Justice and injustice, how come you to know these things except you have transgressed the bounds I set you? Have you not proper stations of your own to walk in? Why meddle you with mine?<note place="margin">James 4.11.</note> 
                  <hi>For if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that then, all obedience to Laws must be implicite: that is, to Gods Laws, as his; and Civil Laws, as the Princes. For if in either sort, I obey but what upon examination I finde reasonable, I take the Law-makers part upon me: and obey not him, but my self. For Law and Justice being the instruments whereby Governors Act upon the Governed, they must be at the choice and guidance of the workman and agent; and not of the work or patient, as heretofore noted.</p>
               <p>Law (then) is Councel imposed: Justice is equity executed. In Laws, the Subjects are to act: in Justice the Prince, or Magistrate for him. In Laws he shews how much of his Will Subjects shall do; in Justice how much he will do himself. So that Law may be called Equity taught; and Justice E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity practised: and is when the Judges own Councels are acted by himself; whether in pursuance of Law, or not. For Justice and Equity may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out standing Law, as in the less government of a family, but not Law without them; that is the Authority of the Prince.</p>
               <p>Now for Justice it self, it proceeding from Equity, as being the sentence of the Judge upon the judged, it may be blinde as to execution; because that part concerns Ministerial Officers, but cannot as to the sentence and Judge: for taking, seeing, for understanding, his eyes must be only open, as to stating of Equity.</p>
               <p>Disinterest, nor equal interest alone, cannot make men competent Judges: because they may be so qualified, and yet strangers and unknowing of the cause. And therefore Judges must (besides knowledge) have Concern, equal Concern, and whole Concern: and the like we must say of Power. For if all the matter and persons contending be not at his dispose, to what purpose his sentence? Nay, if his propriety be not the highest, and his power high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, he will in judgement proceed but faintly, for want of compleat interest and courage. For though the Concern and Power of the Judge may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in, and over both, or all the subject persons, yet if be not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55976:87"/>
he must so far want the perfection of a Judge, as he wants interest to make him concerned to judge at all, and power to execute his sentence.</p>
               <p>And more persons then one, or not having authority from one, cannot be competent Judges over others: for they must have unequal concern through unequal passions and interests: and must, through unequal power also (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of different strength or courage) proceed differently and partially in their sentence. For whilst the same Plea or Cause is estimated by divers bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances according to that divers judgement and interest abiding in those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers persons in the seat of Justice, their sentence can never be uniform to the interest of the persons and the cause they judge, however they may be in their sentence outwardly agreeing amongst themselves; as in order to fear, or other interests of their own.</p>
               <p>Nor can two or more persons judge their own causes, because of the same reasons: and also for that in this equality, none can have whole interest or power.</p>
               <p>But to make these things plainer by instance. When any two parties that are at difference shall have their cause decided by any of the ordinary Judges appointed to that purpose, the failing of that Judge therein, so far as to make him culpable, must happen upon the grounds before noted. For if he have not concern enough, so as to think his duty, honor, and benefit to be founded and established by the practice of his imployment of a Judge, he will then wholly neglect it, or proceed so coldly therein, as for want of through examination of the full evidence of the truth of things on both sides, his judgement can be no otherwise then accidentally true and upright. And this inconvenience will not only be subject to mislead him in his first sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and decision of causes, but farther also, in case that bribery, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have caused partial judgement, through want of entire and equal concern, it is the usual hindrance to all re-examination that should arise from equity by way of appeal: insomuch as, untill the oppressed party can find a way how to make the redress of his grivance appear of more availe and concern to the party appealed unto, then it is to him in the state it now stands, he can never rationally expect reparation, or furtherance from him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>From all which it must come to pass, that none but God Almighty can be held as the onely universal, ready, and upright Judge: so far as to be the onely true object of appeal. Because, as he hath onely omniscience suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to know all circumstances that are necessary to the stating of Equity in each cause, so hath he alwayes such whole and high interest and concern in the good of his creatures, as to make him always ready to hear all complaints: Whereas all other subordinate Judges must, as they stand in degree below him, and so differenced in respect of concern, differ in their readiness to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain appeals and make redress.</p>
               <p>By which means, the Monarch, who hath highest interest, power, and trust delegated from God, and hath his honor and interest of more concern in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Acts of Justice then any other (even in such degree that he cannot find any reward else so valuable to divert him) must be presumed thereupon the readiest to hear and amend, when any thing in this kind shall be offered. And if the ordinary grievances of the poor or meaner sort, be not by him taken into consideration, like the more remarkable appeals from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55976:88"/>
great ones, it proceeds still from the same cause of want of concern, not in him, who, if he be an entire Monarch, and no wayes made obnoxious or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in propriety, would hear poor and rich alike, as equally sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects; but for want of concern in other persons of ranke and eminence, that should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it and state it unto him. Which is a thing so difficult to be done, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us, that it is the great obstacle of all redress: namely for want of concern to make another take so much pains as throughly to examine the state of the grievance, and so apply himself towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress.</p>
               <p>For we shall finde all private men to be still so full of their own business, as not to be sufficiently enclined to make any other of such equal concern, as to remit the present care thereof, to intend his, beyond respect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And although the sense of pitty and Justice be in all men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet the difficulty will still lye, How, for want of concern, to make him attentive in such length of discourse as must be requisite to make my cause appear so. Upon which ground it is, that Fees are given to Advocates, Councellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by those that are appellants and suters: hereby enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to take their Clients business into concern, and make it their own.</p>
               <p>Men have hitherto thought Justice in the abstract to be before it in the concrete: as though truth, or the affections or adjuncts of things could have been before the things themselves. But as Divine Justice is but the proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that equity which resideth in God the supreme Judge of all (whereby the affairs of all creatures are disposed and ordered according to the known measure and equality which their respective merits in relation to the good and Oeconomy of the whole doth require) so neither was humane Justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the administrators thereof: no more then positive Law was before the Law-maker: who, by that did publikly determine what was fittest to be done in the Vierge of his jurisdiction also. Therefore, men making Justice to be <hi>juris statio,</hi> or dependant on the sentence or determination of the Law, could not choose but to have considered (onward) that that <hi>jus</hi> or law, must again have dependance on the Law-maker, or him that hath <hi>juris-dictio,</hi> had not a kind of conspiracy in the flattery of private mens abilities towards the judging right and wrong, made them determine Justice measurable by Law, and Law by themselves: that so (onward) publike Justice might be submitted to private sense of equity: whereby at last all should resolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to opinion.</p>
               <p>In which regard, it is no wonder that subjects in general, do, in order to obtain their fancyed degree of liberty, agree amongst themselves upon such maximes as they conceive restrictive of the exercise of their Princes power over them; upon the same ground as servants use to do towards that of their masters. For so experience tells us of those measures of good and bad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters which are by servants usually entertained amongst themselvs, in order to deny all masters and their actions to be good, farther then they are respective to, or carried on towards their interests or approbations. Thus the master that is most profuse for diet, apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is called the best and most kind, by his own, and by all other servants too. Whereas that master that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures these things by his own conveniencies of estate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint accordingly, is called Churle and miserable. And so again, such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as permit liberty and licentiousness, have the servants joynt applause
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55976:88"/>
as just and kinde unto them: whereas such as restrain and punish them for faults, are by them called cruel and unjust. For how should it be expected they should like to be straightned or punished for what they had formerly approved?</p>
               <p>Nor can men under servitude of any kind, separate themselves so far from their interests in relation that way (that is in desiring freedom) as to take the interest of the correlate into equal concern with their own: and not rather still to chose and fix upon such reasons and maximes as shall most confine the will of their governor to be submitted to theirs: and, in order thereunto, to fancy (as we see it come to pass) that there are general rules and laws whereby justice and right are as measurable by inferiors as others: yea even whilst they are inferiors.</p>
               <p>But suppose there is in every man implanted the maximes and grounds of general Justice, as God to be worshiped, parents and superiors to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every man to have his own, or the like, yet since they were in several men, variously concluded from several inductions and observations in the course of humane affairs (for they encrease and differ in men as yeers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility do) it must come to pass, that when they come to refer back and are to be applyed to particular occasions, they must be both different, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible also: as not determining how to worship God, or w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erein to obey su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superiors, or what every mans due is. Upon which grounds, it is no wonder that <hi>Astraea</hi> was fained to leave the world about the same time when Laws began most to abound; and men undertook to fancy, that that obedience to the Laws which was constitutive of Magistrates and subjects justice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, was also to be definitive and bounding of justice in the original.</p>
               <p>But, if we make not justice to be residing in that sentence and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of equity which each rightful superiour imposeth, then hath it indeed no certain aboad amongst men: Or, if they bound it by any other positive Law then what is to be by him interpreted and enforced, then they not onely take away all justice from the golden age of the world, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chiefly called so because the publike person to whose sence of equity things were intrusted did particularly judge in emergencies, and so more exactly measure causes then can be now by standing rules and laws, but they also (for the present) take it from fathers, masters of families, and the like: where right and justice is depending on their arbitrary and accasional di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as Divine Justice, or the general rule of equity in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, is dependent on the Divine Edict and determination of God, who hath the government hereof; and as the rule of justice of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is dependant on him that hath that charge also, so is the same to be granted in each kingdom: even to be the decision of him that hath Legislative power, and trust to determine of things towards the stating political peace or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
               <p>To which purpose some have conceived the word <hi>jus</hi> to be the abrievation of <hi>Jovis os</hi>; which we may call the <hi>Divine sentence in the lips of the King:</hi> making it the positive decree of the soveraign power. For although this Synterisis (or inward assent to the general maxims of equity) be usefully in all men, because they must more or less have dominion, yet for inferiors or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quals, as such, at any time to use them upon their own authority,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55976:89"/>
cannot make the execution take the name of Justice; however the sentence may be in it self equal, or proportionable to the equity of the cause.</p>
               <p>And indeed, that common definition of this vertue, of <hi>giving every one his own,</hi> would have caused men necessarily to conclude this the proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the person in supreme power and propriety, (for how else shall he have right to distribute) had not (as before noted) private covetousness and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of judgement, made men conclude it not to be justice, except under that notion of his own, each man had such distribution, as should not onely be directed by positive Law, but by it according to their interpretation also. As though there could be private propriety against the publike, or that the Prince, the Master of a Family, or other publike superior, were to regard the good and propriety of the contenders, or any other separate private persons, without regard to the whole propriety and good: and not rather make his distributions of the publike stock of honor, riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to private persons with repsective care to the whole.</p>
               <p>In which respect, we may again call publike Justice <hi>The exercise of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity proceeding from each rightful superior, as his sense of equity in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar distributions shall lead them, with regard to publike advantage.</hi> So that, he judging according to sense of equity, as between two, both the parties contending are to be taken as one: and decission is to be so made between them, that the other more worthy party, the Commonwealth, be Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically considered. And this, although the whole present people be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent contenders in the two parties: yet is the succeeding community or their own future inconveniencies to be considered. From whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a just man and a governor to be convertible: as also is the notion of Justice with that of government: having both issue from his authority and determination. Saving that under the notion of government (as more general) we usually comprehend both equity and justice: that is both the directive and coercive parts: but by Justice, we commonly conceive but the bare vindicative part to be acted, separate from the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>If in this his sentence, he bear such particular eye to the parties in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition as to forget or neglect common interest, he is unjust to God his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; as failling in his general trust: however, to his inferiors he must alwayes, upon the same reason, be acknowledged just.</p>
               <p>We are also accustomed to apprehend the notion of justice to have (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the persons subjected) a more particular regard then that of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: namely when then the Justiciar shall more expresly respect the comparative fitness or interest of any two separate parties: at which time, the governor being more remarkable by an explicite determination, it may thence be called particular government, as government it self may be called general and implicite Justice: both of them being stated and defined by the due exercise and receit of that power which caused their relations, that is of the governor or Justiciar as agent, upon the governed or justified as patient. In which case, the Agent and patient standing reciprocally constituting each other, according to their relations, to impose and receive, it follows that where the governor is not endued with his proper power to impose on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, according to his vertue of Agency, and the governed, on the other hand, endued with the vertue of receit and patibillity, there cannot be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55976:89"/>
government. But, in proportion, as the inferior invades the power of Agency, or is insusceptible of the others Agency, so far the political harmony and order is broken and inverted, and approach is made unto Anarchy.</p>
               <p>And many times also we difference Justice from Government by its object: as making it conversant about the Government of our proprieties, and apprehending the notion of the Government to have most particular reward to the Subjects personall liberties: and this way that definition of giving every man his own, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Justice into distributive and commutative may seem to look.</p>
               <p>Philosophers, in their usual Scholy, desiring to make it a vulgar and common vertue, for their own applause sake amongst their Scholars, have fought to define and defference it from other vertues by its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or effect, without assigning unto it a proper subject (by inherence whereunto, it might, like all other abstracted notions, stand formally differenced,) have thereupon made it to import as large as vertue it self: of which they would have it understood to be a kind. For so in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, a just mans imports as large a commendation as a good man, or a vertuous man.</p>
               <p>But it is to be considered, as before noted, that this vertue can no otherwise be supposed common to all men, or every man, then as that man may at the same time be supposed a full superior or proprietor, in the distributions or commutations he is to make and that thereupon, it is not a vertue proper to him as a man, but as such a man: that is, as relating to him in his present power and superiority in what he is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute, and his full propriety in the thing he doth exchange. And from thence it will still follow, that as this occassonal relation of supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority did make the notion of Justice assignable as aforesaid, so, to make it capable of a constant specifical difference, there is no way but to affix it to him that is by Office a constant superior.</p>
               <p>For they should have considered, that although this vertue cannot be without the others, namely without prudence preceding, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and fortitude accompanying its execution, yet it having its objects wholly foraign, and respecting such persons onely as stand relating to other men in superiority, and not as each man hath power and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over himself (as the other vertues do) it must thereupon have its different definition accordingly.</p>
               <p>As for example, Temperance, that wholly relates to each one as having jurisdiction in himself for Government of his own appetites and affections, must therefore belong to all men, because all men have such things to govern: and can have foraign jurisdiction onely as accompaning the Justice of a superior. And so must prudence and fortitude, that partly relate to others good and partly to our own guidance, be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to all men likewise; because of the daily and general use of both, for the benefit of others, and their own separate good. Whereas Justice, that hath its object wholly in the good of others, and doth thereupon suppose the party quallified with abillity proportionable, must be appropriate to such onely as have by their relations power to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:55976:90"/>And then it will come to pass, that although Justcie may have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees, and be more or less a vertue as this governor is more or less prudent, temperate, or magnanimous, yet must the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice be alwayes assigned to the actings of superiors upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, as such, notwithstanding occasional deviations.</p>
               <p>For as to be a reasonable creature remaines the definition of all men, as men, yea though they be most foolish, so cannot the violent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some, deprive men in supreme authority from having the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice appropriate to that sort of men onely. And this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a man in supreme Authority being the subject wherein Justice can onely reside, even as mankind in general is the subject of reason, It is not therefore the pravity of some Monarch, or other occasional devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in some Acts, can deprive them of the definition of just, more then the unreasonableness or imprudence of some men, or of some actions of any man, can take from them or him that definition of a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature. For the question being not concerning the perfection of the predicate, but of its propriety of inherence, therefore, as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is amongst sublunary creatures the proper subject of reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none else can so truly or perfectly have it, so doth justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main proper to men in supreme authority: although they may be in degree much inferior, or defective one to another.</p>
               <p>And this truth we shall finde asserted by one that was incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wiser and more knowing in these things then any of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; even by <hi>Solomon</hi> himself: <hi>Also to punish the Just is not good, nor to strike Princes for equity.</hi> In which words the just man and the superior stand plainly convertible:<note place="margin">Prov. 17.26.</note> as also they do in that saying of Saint <hi>John, My little children let no man deceive you, he that doth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:</hi> that is, since God the fountain of Justice gave them power to be doers,<note place="margin">1 John 3.7.</note> they are in their deeds alwayes just in relation to those below them: of all which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>And therefore, lastly, as the abuse of this prerogative and advantage of reason, prevailes not with God to take it from mankinde, because of that general good which the use of it doth ordinarily afford, (both in mens deportments toward one another, and other creatures also) no more are the accidental abuses in the seat of Justice, of availe to take off, and defeat that continual benefit arising to mankinde by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral exercise thereof. For in these cases, wisdom grounding her self upon an infallible rule of comparison, raises this her maxim, <hi>Better to suffer a misc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>:</hi> better that the common benefit of Justice should be kept up, notwithstanding its occasional mischiefs, then the avoiding of those occasional mischiefs, should defeat the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of Justice.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the two extreams of this vertue mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ht have denoted the proper subject thereof, had men had as great readiness to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their Princes vertues, as to mark their vices. For as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none but men of power it can be a fault to neglect Justice, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to tyranny or rigor, so can the vertue it self be formally agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to none, but such neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:55976:90"/>So that then, we may plainly finde that they that have hitherto defined Justice to be a vertue giving every one his own, by their not setting down certain rules to judge what these proprieties were, and how to be known, and ont determining the persons that shall have this power of distribution, they have made justice, that was ordained to be the great instrument of publike peace and quiet, to be the occasion of Civil war.</p>
               <p>They that think they have come neerer the mark, by determining Justice to be <hi>Juris statio,</hi> meaning the sentence of Law, they have thereby indeed found out a good remedy to bridle the exorbitance or Magistrates, and also to direct them in each particular execution of their charge; but then, since justice is not a contemplative vertue, as depending upon the knowledge of the Law, but upon the due execution thereof, it will still follow, that as <hi>Juris statio</hi> doth depend on <hi>Juris dictio,</hi> and the execution of the Law is not otherwise justice then as the person executing the same hath above others power therein derived from that person that is Law-maker, even so also, justice it self must be acknowledged more or less such to inferiors, as it is more or less in its execution approaching and derived from its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we must say that when the tearm of Justice is given to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, as denoting their upright dealing in the discharge of any trust, it is then (as before noted) confounded with the vertue or honesty: for hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty is the proper commendation of any in that case, even as denoting trust and inferiority. Whereas, to do justice, or justly, supposeth a power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and distribute. But when we do suppose any inferior person (as such) to be capable of justice, so far as he hath been equal to the rule and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his trust, we do thereby grant justice not to be any wayes originally in him, but to be properly onely assignable where the rule is; that is, to the party that holds the ballances, as being possessed of power: And therefore is Justice painted with a sword in the right hand, and scales in the lest, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening that the estimation and decision of causes and controversies is the proper office of him that is in the supreme seat of authority and power, who is to be conceived the Trustor, and not on the judgement or censure of such as are inferior, or trusted.</p>
               <p>And this, because the Trusted's justice or equal dealing being to be measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Trustor or superior, he can no otherwise be just then by him justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: which is not to be actively or formally just, but proportionably so. For although he might have been upright or honest in his return, as having herein done to the utmost of his abillity or conscience, yet cannot he be therefore truely called just: because the superior in his trust, might have had other ends or intentions in the assignment of the trust, then hath been, or could be by him adequately returned: in which case, falling short of the rule, he failes in point of Justice also.</p>
               <p>And to manifest these things more clearly, namely that the Justice of superiors is not dependent on the judgement and sentence of men below, and that againe, our own conscience cannot justifie alone, we shall finde Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saying <hi>With me it is a very small thing to be judged of you, or mans judgement: yea I judge not mine own self, for I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby justified, but he that justifieth me is the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.3, 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:55976:91"/>From whence we may truly infer, that no man can be just before God in this life: not onely, because not fully knowing his will, but also in respect of inabillity; in coming short thereof, even when we are most conscientious. And so again, taking injustice to import negatively (that is, absence of justice) we may call all inferiors more or less unjust: and that also, whilst to their utmost they are most honest. Even as on the contrary, we may say all inferiors are more or less just, as more or less justified. Upon which ground, the Publican, a neglecter of the Law, <hi>went away rather justified then the Pharisee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 8.14.</note> a most exact keeper thereof. In which regard, justification being according to supremacy in power, it follows that any man may be called just, when justified before God the fountain of all rule and power, although to his Prince or Parents he may in some particulars fall short of his trust: like as, upon the same rule again, the justification of the Prince may include justice to any subject, notwithstanding his failing in any inferior charge.</p>
               <p>So that now, the attribute of Justice being formally proper onely to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, hence it comes that the acts of no superior but God can be universally and strictly called just. For Princes being, as his chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, in some things restrained, and to be directed by his Laws, they can in those things be no farther esteemed just in execution, then as they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant of them: Whereas in other things, by God referred to them as to his next entrusted Deputies, the stating of right or law must be dependant again on their sentence. In which case, as those Magistrates by them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with execution of their Laws, must have above other subjects power to interpret, and act according to their own sense of equity and right, which is to be obeyed as justice by all others, even so again, the actions of Princes, as Gods supreme Magistrates, must, as in duty to God, be submitted unto by subjects in general.</p>
               <p>And we must farther also say, that as Gods universal power and interest makes his actions to be alwayes equal and just, even because they are his, even so (in proportion) Princes must be held in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more or less just, as they are more or less powerful or whole proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in what they judge. And farther, that as no man can be the proper and formal subject of justice but he that stands in relation a superior, so none unjust, but as he stands by relation an inferior: even as failing of, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in, the execution of that trust of power and propriety received from such as were herein above him. And, from the premises, we may farther say, that as the true stating and observance of the relations of governing and governed makes government, and the execution of this government makes Justice, so, in Republicks, where these relations are not fixed and certain, but that the governed as Agents do sometimes act on the governing as patients, there Justice must be proportionably wanting or uncertain.</p>
               <p>Out of all hitherto spoken it will (I hope) appear to be each mans duty now, as he would be freed of the guilt of doing ill, aswell as that of stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borness and disobedience, not to take upon him to judge of the morality of laws and institutions, above, or without the leave of his superior. For as sin in the wil must proceed from error in the understanding, if I respite my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inquisitivenes, and suffer my self to be guided by the general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that right and wrong are better known to these I am bound to obey then to my self, the result of my actions, whether they did what was good
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55976:91"/>
or no, must yet be safer to me that perform them by implicite obedience, then they can be otherwise. For if they be right and good, the merit of that obedience by which they were done will encrease their good: and if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it will abate it, as being therein my just excuse. For the less will I had therein, the less sin I must also have: as shall be more fully discoursed of when we treat of Religion.</p>
               <p>And bootless it is, to say that obedience to humane authority is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in things indifferent: For if the doing or not doing be indifferent for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality or benefit in my conceit, I yeild to authority, not as out of duty as such, but as doing what I should have done to any ordinary request. Or if, besides the sense of duty, I go to set my self a rule how far, and how far n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that now, to conclude this discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For, unless we will be again content to be let loose to our first natural liberty of having no certain proprieties, but make dominion again fleeting, and dependant on the issue of each mans occasional strength, to hold or acquire, and, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance thereof, to his own censure of right and wrong to possess, there is no remedy but we must submit in matters of judgement and sense of legality and morality, to the same person we now publikely submit our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force: unless we should fondly think, that it were fit men should be put by rules of true policy in such a wretched condition, as to be left free to judge of right and wrong, that, to their greater torment, they may be by force deprived. Or, unless we shall farther suppose, that use of force and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance was in these cases remitted also; and so, absurdly make each subject a superior; by being his own judge and Magistrate.</p>

               <p>WHat hath been hitherto spoken of the necessity of self-seeking, as to the preservation of that whole species which must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of those particulars, must, upon like reason, be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the justification of wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e good of one another. For although the good of the whole race of mankinde be in common reason preferable to that of any Kingdom, yet since neither men themselves, nor all Countries in general, can be so reduced or associated under one entire government and care as to <hi>Call any man father or master on earth</hi>; it must therefore fall out that this general good, subsisting by, and arising according to that of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the necessity of each kingdoms having separate propriety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and of an understanding and will proper to it self, will to it be the same (I mean to the preservation of each kingdom) as the having proprieties di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct to the particular subjects of the same kingdom, is to the saubsistance and advancement of the general propriety of the whole kingdome: or as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving distinct understanding and will, is necessary to constitute each single person. And as God, who is, and can onely be the universal Monarch of all mankinde, doth so fasten mans specifical being and preservation, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable objects accompanying his generation and food, or the contrary on things contrary (in such sort as we are thereby preserved from danger of total decay) so are particular parcels hereof left to the particular guidance of stewards and officers of his own appointing: who, having their distinct allotments for improvement, are through the natural sense of honor and greatness provoked to look to the encreasing thereof as their proper duties: and that, although, in their exchange or usury of these talents, other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms be proportionable or greater losers.</p>
               <p>From all which, gathering how each kingdome is to be justified in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their own good apart, we are next to consider what this good is. In this case also, we must, as conceiving these notions of <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> to include a distinct multitude of mankind there associated by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a common head, attribute unto them the same end we did unto men in general before: namely the prosecution of pleasure; although under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother name, to wit that of plenty: which do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h suppose and imply <hi>that stock or store of things pleasurable, which each kingdome is to have for the use and benefit thereof.</hi> But because the care and charge for acquisition and preservation of the particulars that serve to promote and make up this plenty or pleasure doth belong to the Prince, we shall not here speak thereof.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, considering all political happiness united, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general notion of pleasure, we must say, that as other pleasures
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55976:92"/>
of privat persons, so the different pleasures of one Kingdome or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth above another, is in vigor and sincerity of fruition, or in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and extent thereof. For if a people should be pleased with appearing contents, or with riches and its appurtenances onely: as ease, dainty fair, fine cloaths, houses, or the like; these, as they came short of what might have been added in the same kinds, and as they stood unaccompanied of other political benefits, as Religion, Fertility, Arts, Militia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as again they wanted certainty for continuing in their possession or esteem, they wanted also of degree for compleating their political hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
               <p>Nay farther, collecting the happiness of each Kingdom into a total, it is not onely needful that all and every member thereof be, so far as may be, made sensible thereof, but, because goodness and benefit is more or less, as it is extended, each Kingdom is also more or less happy, as it hath more or fewer to participate thereof. For as the happiness of a whole Kingdome must (collectively considered) be greater then the happiness of any single person or order in the same, so must the happiness of one Kingdom increase above that of another in proportion, as the persons by them made happy do differ in number. And therefore we must also say, that by <hi>Happiness of a Kingdom, we understand that whole stock of pleasures and benefits of all sorts wherewith each Kingdom is furnished: and withal, the fit application and distribution thereof, according to the general capacities and numbers of the subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for example, if one party of the kingdom, being too strong to be awed by the supreme power, do enrich themselves by the spoile and plunder of other subjects, it is not their taking upon them the shew of the whole people or Commonwealth, that can make their particular gain the gain of the whole kingdom: but it is rather really the loss: whilst, besides what is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoiled by fire, rapine, other mischiefs accompanying Civil war so many men as must be imployed for souldiers, are kept not only from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture, manifacture, and other necessary imployments for publike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; but also to live luxuriously upon the labor of others: to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartening, and decay of the Publike stock: as famine, the consequent of Civil war, doth well declare. But all this, is little to the most considerable loss of so many mens lives: which, as man is more valuable then any thing else, is the greatest loss can befal any Kingdom: not onely as in its self, but as it is wholly irreparable. No, when we see the ploughman, the shepherd, the spinster, or the like; to be intent in their labors and providing food and clothing for us. These we may truely call Commonwealths-men: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they do by their occupations make real improvement without the loss of others. Whereas he that through publike disturbance, hath seated himself as high in Office and Power as his ambitious heart can desire, cannot at all be called a Commonwealths-man in what he hath done: nor in what he shal do in this his imployment and power, otherwise then as directed and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by his Soveraign. Even because in all distributions and disposals made by any Magistrate of any of the Kingdoms stock already gained, a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential loss must light on them that were before possessed: when as they that make an encrease from nature or art, as they do thereby empoverish none, so are they alwayes to be held publikely beneficial, whilst they manage their proper imployments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:55976:93"/>And as publike good may be thus damnified by private actings of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects one upon another by force, so may it by commerce also. For if some persons or degrees of subjects, do encrease their happiness or riches onely by consequent affliction or poverty of others, none can call this an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happiness to the Commonwealth or Kingdome in general. But if this be effected by lawful and usual wayes of contract, commerce, and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of subjects amongst themselves, then (at the worst) what one looseth another gets: and so the whole Kingdom neither gets nor loses in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or whole stock thereof. But, if this way of acquiring from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be without publike leave, then, by destruction and neglect of so much of that Kingdomes stock and improvement, as great lots must follow to the whole thereupon. For since to the whole Kingdom there can be no improvement but what is acquired either from nature, or husbandry, or invention of Arts; or from other kingdoms; as by Merchants, Arms, or the like, so can nothing be lost to the whole but by neglect of these, through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of endeavor, or by actual destruction of what hath been so gained.</p>
               <p>We may therefore well compare those distributions and partitions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made amongst subjects by the Prince, unto that dole of bread, or the like, which, upon pre-regard had to each parties wants, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly and orderly given according to the direction of authority; and so nothing comes to be lost. Whereas we may compare that way of partition which subjects do factiously and partially take one them to make amongst themselves, to a kind of scrambling: wherein, while each party or person is confusedly endeavouring to engross to himself, without consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wants of others, a great part comes to be spoiled in the contest, and by neglect: besides that danger of quarrelling, which must follow thereupon.</p>
               <p>Upon consideration of all which, it will appear, that as the publike or whole good of the kingdom is not to be estimated by every private possession, but by all in general; so can it have no competent judge of its reality and extent, but that publik person that hath universal share therein: And so (farther,) that none but he that hath common interest in all the persons of his subjects, can be well able impartially to minde their universal contents, and provide against the covetous engrossements of publike and common benefits. And this, not only for deviding the present stocks of riches, honors, offices, &amp; arms, amongst subjects, but also in differencing and setting the true value and proportions of each of them according to publike benefits, one in comparison of another. Else may his subjects place all their delight in riches, and so neglect Religion and Gods service: or, growing thereby secure, neglect the means of their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and acknowledge of arms. Or they may set their mindes wholly on honour: so as, through emulation, to fall into faction and civil war. For, as in our natural bodies, although the humors themselves be necessary for our preservation, yet if they exceed in quantity, so as to defeat and interupt one anothers workings, or be not in that proportion as the state of that body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, they then destroy the body: so, in politick bodies, although the having of all politicke benefits be useful therein, yet may the unequal and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate possession of some so them, destroy (without good care) the enjoyment and good of the whole.</p>
               <p>And thereforefore, as the proper will and appetite of each person is in him supreme and uncontrolable Judge against all other foraign wills, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the private and single appetites of his own particular members, so is the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55976:93"/>
will of the publike person, in the same kingdom, uncontrolable judge of that kingdoms benefit: both against the publike judgement of other kingdoms, and also against the judgement of any of its own private members: or else there will (at last) be no such thing as publike good at all.</p>
               <p>For when one Faction doth prevail on another, or one Community or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration upon another, so far as to encrease in riches or other necessary appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of pleasure; since what is by one order of Subjects gained is in the same proportion lost to another order, the gain of the Kingdom can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise conceited to encrease in the whole, then as these tradings and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one upon another had licence and direction from publike Reason: even therein foreseeing how that Kingdoms publike stock might be therein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by forraign supply, or kept undiminished by avoiding home neglect. In the first case prevailing by way of acquisition and gain, in the other by way of parsimony and thrift.</p>
               <p>No, it is not the assuming to themselves the name and notion of the Commonwealth, and so, by reason of their present supreme and uncontrole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power, commanding without general agreement or leave of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon head, that can make the actings of any prevailing party or faction to be rightly and justly called the Government of that Commonwealth: much less can it be conceiveable, how the particular gain of this powerful ruling Faction, and that separate and distinct encrease which is thereby raised to themselves and their party, by the consequential loss of a greater number of the people and inhabitants of the same place (by them kept in subjection) can in any true sence, be called the gain of the Commonwealth: let their pretensions of acting for, and in name of the Commonwealth or people, be as fair and plausible as they will.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of Paction and Commerce·</head>
               <p>VNder God Almighty who alone is Omnipotent, and in himself All-sufficient, there is no sensitive Agent but stands in need of security and advantage to be obtained elsewhere: and which (according to the sence and knowledge thereof) doth not, to the utmost of its power, finde out means of trust, for avoiding the objects of its fear, or attaining those of its hopes. Thus, the Lion hath his Teeth and Tallons as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to defend himself, and also to obtain his prey. The Fox trusts to his craft for both. But generally, all Beasts, Fishes, and Birds, seek to shun their present fears, by the nimbleness of their Legs, Fins, and Wings: their food being usually so ready, to all that live not on prey, that little provision or care need to be taken.</p>
               <p>In men, the weapons offensive and defensive are chiefly their reason: for as their fears and hopes encrease above other creatures, both through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what truely is, or may be hurtful or good unto them (which beasts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55976:94"/>
do not) or through the variety of those objects of harm or delight (which beasts have not) so they have accordingly made larger provision for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities and advantages.</p>
               <p>For supply of our continual wants, so far as they refer to Nature or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we, like other creatures, have no cause of fear or mistrust, that the <hi>Covenant of Seed-time or Harvest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 8.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Summer and Winter, day and night,</hi> with the continuation of other influences and affordments of the creatures, should ever quite fail: because in him that appointed them, as there is no self-want to divert,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.17.</note> so <hi>there is no variableness or shadow of change.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in those supplies that are necessary for our use, and yet are in the power of others that have like use with our selves, the acquiring or possession of them cannot reasonably be expected, without a voluntary and free resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>To suppose it voluntary, is first to suppose it reasonable in the opinion of the party from whom the curtesie is expected. And reasonable it cannot be, till something equivalent, in the eye of the proprietor, be granted in satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and lieu thereof: whither it be in equal-goods, or curtesie, or onely in thanks, as a free gift. In which latter case onely, no pledge or contract useth to pass: though, to a generous minde, it be the straightest obligation that may be. But, in the other cases, the kinde of return or requital, with the weight, measure, number, or other estimation thereof is always agreed upon.</p>
               <p>For although it might be alleadged, <q>That since in Nature there is no Propriety, why should not he that had store of Corn, Cattel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> share with him that wants, who is both his equal and hath like interest. And what more noble then in this case freely to give.</q> All which is true: but since these are things which each one cannot want, who shall have power to see this distribution made, or force one man to drudge for another? And since it is not to be presumed that he which plows and soweth, will be so far delighted in that expence and labour, as to do it for such as from whom (it may be) not so much as thanks is to be expected; therefore there will be danger, that either he that expected bread from him will want it, or else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing his whole labor in getting bread for himself and others, he should, for want of time to imploy in other things, want all other food, and apparel also.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as the setling of Propriety encreased tillage and other sorts of husbandry (which otherwise would have lain still) so Trade and Commerce make Propriety useful, to the improvement both of the goods of Nature and Art. For hereby the Husbandman, the Grasier, the Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, the Tayler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have mutually to supply each others wants: and he that hath more food then he needs, may exchange the overplus for apparel or what else he wants. And so, whilst mens abilities are not diverted, but wholly imployed in one Trade, each one (to the common improvement) will grow of greater excellency therein.</p>
               <p>And thereby also, mens several gifts and endowments come to be alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and publikely useful and beneficial. For the strong and able bodied man, who (perhaps (hath not equal judgement to him that is weak, is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for execution and labour in those things which the invention of the other hath by his Art and Study made more easie: each ability finding an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment proper. And although, at the first, while Families were
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55976:94"/>
great, they were like little Commonweales or Cities in themselves, and so might, through their many hands, and unity of Command and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, be in all things well furnished, according to such proportion as their simplicity then required; yet less Families, being now collected in narrow bounds within Cities and Commonweals, as they could not otherwise subsist, so they are hereby served with greater ease and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</p>
               <p>But, necessity, the mother of invention, saw yet a defect. For he that imployed himself in shoe-making, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might want food or other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, at such a time as they in whose hands these things were had no need of his shoes: but it may be of such other things as were not in his power. In this case there was no way, but to agree to some one or few things, that should serve as common values and exchanges for all others: which at first (it is like) was of Leather, Iron, or what was generally most useful. But this not serving to all wants and occasions, and through its plenty being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to deceit, mettals of greatest scarcity come to be politickly brought in, and stampt by Authority, to give it denomination and value: So that, where anciently estates were reckoned by cattel or goods, it is now computed by mony.</p>
               <p>But let us go on to discover what is just and not in matters of Commerce, (supposing men as under rules of Religion): A man comes to buy or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with another for any thing he wants, what gain shall we allow the seller? shall it be twenty in the hundred, a double, or treble value: or else what can he get? Where shall Conscience stint it self? Shall the Law appoint the proportion? Why so? Is not the seller a Subject as well as the buyer? And if then the Law rate and stint not all commodities and dealings, it is partial: if it do, to what use; since the gain might as well have gone round; by my enhansing proportionably my commodities to him or others, as now our losses do, as being all of us low rated? But what if the buyer have not commodities, for all men cannot be stored alike? Why then commonly you discourage Trade: and so, through a general dearth of things, prejudice all men. Therefore authority interposeth but in few cases with success: and, in my judgement, in the silence of Authority, they are under no rule but of their own Consciences: namely of the rule of <hi>Doe as thou wouldest be done unto.</hi> For the buyer and seller, trusting to their own judgements and skill in their bargains, may advantage themselves as they shall see good. For where is no trust to be understood, there is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage: otherwise all Trades would be unlawful. For if you measure unlawfulness by proportion of gain, the least again is unlawful also.</p>
               <p>But for this partial respect to generally sheyed towards the buyer against the seller, there is the same reason to be given as was formerly for these many declamations against the atbitrary power of Princes, and for the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of bounding their single powers more then the powers of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny superiors in Aristocracies and Democracies: namely, that as Subjects and parties are onely writers of those things, so few writers of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Political duties are Tradesmen or sellers, but all buyers: and so, for their own interest sake, having not regard to the equal justice of the thing it self, would have them bounded, and not themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:55976:95"/>And as it thus fareth at the Market or Tradesmans shop (namely that the buyer is at the sellers choice for the proportion of mony or other exchange to be given him in satisfaction for what he takes) the like it is with Officers, Artificers, or other persons, from whom any thing belonging to their offices or labor of minde is desired. To wit, that, where the rate of their pains and imployment is not stinted by a superior, there, he, being an equal subject with the other that hath need of his imployment, is not, like his slave or drudge, to be made to serve him without such requital as himself shall judge reasonable.</p>
               <p>And so also it is in the case of that great publike officer the King: for, he having none on earth above him, who shall set any stint upon him: so far that if any will make use of his protection, he shall not again have liberty to encrease the rate thereof, according to occasion: as Merchants do of their wares, or other Officers or Artificers do of their skill? And upon the same reason that he may make rich and great men pay him greater Rates and Taxes for their protections, as having greater shares therein, why may he not generally upon occasion, encrease or diminish these Rates from all or any of his Subjects, as he findes this his office of protecting them to be more or less dangerous to himself, as well as difficult and expensive? For where God (his superior) hath not bounded him, I see not why he should be rated by any others: much less by the parties themselves, for that great hazard of his person he undergoes, in that security of person and estate which he gives unto them.</p>
               <p>Let us look neerer to this in Pactions, where performance on both sides is not present, as in contracts before mentioned, but that both are future, or one party must perform before another. This Paction, and the security thereupon will be found void, without a common Authority to hold the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged party to performance: For else the first cannot in reason begin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since all trust doth require due return and discharge, men, for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual securities herein, do not relye upon the single assurances of one anothers bare promises, but either engage witnesses therein, or trust to some such deed under hand &amp; seal, as may be available to call in publike justice to their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in case that breach of Covenant should be offered. In which case, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side hath right to determine for it self, so can they not refuse the appeal and umperage of the superior Authority therewith intrusted. For so, in all Commonweals there is Law, and, by a just subordination, there is a Superior for decision of all things; till we come therein to the supreme of all: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond whom, no appeal on earth is to be had. For that, if I should appeal from the Prince to any on earth, I change the Government: placing the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty where the last appeal is. And because in these things we must come to some pawse, therefore if we place a supreme above a supreme, we make all controversies undecideable: and lose our selves as in a circle of giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>So then, the difference between a Contract and a Pact is, that, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a present exchange of Property, the alternative possession gives and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures their rights, without supposition of superior civil power to the new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, as firmly as it did to the old. Whereas in Pactions, the possession of the new property being not yet had, he that performs last hath for his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture possession no assurance but what ariseth from a power superior and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both: Into whose hands the whole Propriety must thereupon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55976:95"/>
be supposed to be put; (as is usually done by deed in his name attested by witness) and that, according to the degree that this third power stands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in presently concerned and powerful, the trusting party hath his security. And therefore, to make Pactions and Contracts the same in Reason and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the superior must have whole Propriety in the thing pacted for, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and supreme power over the pacting parties: or else they contract for contingencies instead of certainties.</p>
               <p>But then they agree, that either party, being a voluntary Agent, may gain on the other to his utmost. For in case the superior person do mittigate or alter, he doth it as in relation to his own common and supreme Propriety: because in those Pacts which he personally and expresly doth not ratifie, but onely by general rules, he may vary as he shall finde those general rules mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken or wrested: otherwise you both ingage and dis-impropriate him against his consent. For since each superior, being to be supposed with many in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate relation under him, cannot personally and particularly preside in all bargains, but must for direction of his pleasure in these things give and make Laws, it stands with no reason that for his good intention herein (that is for dispatch of the business of others) he should be by them disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself.</p>
               <p>Now, imagining a Paction between King and people (as is by some done,) this difference will arise between the ties and securities which subiects make one with another, and those they make with their King. First, Subjects bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains are expressed, and that usually under hand and seal before witness: and then have they a person, and way of decision ready to reconcile their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Whereas, between Prince and people, nothing like Paction appears: but is onely supposed. Again, the Prince having onely God above him, the Subjects have no appeal but thither; who onely is King of Kings: for how should the Subjects judge, they are parties, and beneath the Prince? How shall the Law judge; for that must be under its maker also?</p>
               <p>Again, in Pactions one is performing before another: between Prince and people it is not known which is to begin, or which is to end: for their ties are continual, and reciprocal: the Prince is continually to protect them, and they continually to obey him. Is he sworn to keep the Laws and do Justice; they are sworn and obliged to obey the Laws, and him in execution of them. Therefore when Monarchs take oaths for maintenance of the Laws made, or for doing of Justice or other things, having none but God to judge hereof above him, he can be to him onely accomptable, as to a superior, for any breach: and if he be, he is no Soveraign. And if oaths do but what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law or Polity can do or secure without them, the attestation of Gods name and presence is but taking his Name in vain: the obligation of an oath being in value as far above Law, as God is above the Prince. And when the oath of Allegeance passeth from Subjects to Princes, it is for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther securing him against opposition and revolt: because if sence of duty to God do not, it is not possible for the fear of one man to keep all in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>They that imagine Kingly Government is grounded on Paction with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as deriving from them his power over them, will appear in a farther mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake herein, from consideration of the nature of Paction it self: which we shall a little more particularly examine. For first, they supposing that the community is at that time associated by mutual Paction so as to act in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55976:96"/>
the capacity of one person, do fail, in that neither express Articles to that purpose could ever be made or produced, nor could there be any witness, nor a third present obliging superior party supposed. For, witness there can be none, but such as are parties: and third common obliging and powerful party there cannot be, but God. For if another on earth, he is their Prince alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and it is he, not they, must give content. So that God not being present, as to manifestation of express consent in what they do, otherwise then by his Will already known by his Laws; the people having none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (equal parties) to judge how far their Pactions are consonant to these Laws, must, as wanting present power to hold them obliged to one another, want also power to grant any thing one to another. And therefore, they failing to think that such a body can be at all, or that a body without a head can perform the Offices of Discourse, Will, and Understanding, which is to the making Pactions requisite, we will next see what likeness of Paction there is in any thing that appears between Prince and people, supposing them as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; which some do fancie for making subjects submission (as they think) lawful, because voluntary.</p>
               <p>In this, the first great difficulty will be, how to bring the people into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of appearance for making this stipulation. For if by their mutual and reciprocal Pactions amongst one another, they have but, (as is usually supposed to make them one body) transferred each others power, they are as far from being one body as before: because, as they were before separate in having their own distinct personal powers, so are still as distinct in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the powers of each other. For, if <hi>John</hi> have given his power to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> it must be (I suppose) that <hi>Thomas</hi> should also give his own power to <hi>Willsam:</hi> And then, as <hi>William</hi> may be supposed to have a treble power (that is his own and the two resigned) to at last, by his transferring these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed powers onward, they will come into one hand. But this will be a long work, and much trouble there will be with whom to begin, and in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to follow therein; and who shall be the supreme obliging party, to see performance of these many Pactions.</p>
               <p>But if they be supposed to pact all at once, how shall we in this confusion be able to finde out and distinguish the pacting persons from one another; and the third obliging party and witnesses from both? <q>For if <hi>John</hi> say to <hi>Thomas,</hi> I give you all my right in governing my self, upon condition that you give the same and all yours to such and such, and this we mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige our selves by oaths to do, </q>Then, taking these pactors by pairs, here will be a long work again, and to no purpose: unless the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be impowered with all power, do severally stipulate with these pares: and then he will have as many Kingdomes as pairs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>And to suppose each party pacting with the whole community, and saying <q>I give all my power to this Community, that they again may give it unto such a man; </q>Then must each man singly come to do to. Which done, each man will come but to have the same power he had at the first: forasmuch as every one being a member of the Community, hath also his equal share therein still. And therefore each one, as sharer in the power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, must anew consent, or we are never the neerer of having a political person to Pact with; or of having made any Community or Corporation. And as this cannot be without a present superior Authority for so doing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55976:96"/>
(by force of whose Law the same must be done) so will much more follow, that as they could not by Paction have become a Community with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Superior Law and Power; so, beyond the leave of that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Law or Power, cannot they, as a Community, act any thing of force: much less can they set a Superior above what is Superior to them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>Again, it would be considered what they pact for in these their supposed Pactions with Princes, because all rational creatures must have an aym. In this case we must still continue supposing (for matter of Fact will never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear): either then they pact for their right to govern others, or for their right to govern themselves: If the latter, it must be meant onely so far as their separate deportments come to be publikely useful, for still I suppose each one must have power to manage his proper business. Then, Question being what shall be publike, what not, the supposed Paction must be invalid: because, expressing it not, it saves not, nor remedies not one pacting party from the power of the other: that is, the Subject from the Superior; to whom it belongs to have power to judge in all, or else he can judge in none. If it be meant of the first (that is; of his share of government of others) then must each person singly pact: to the end that the Community (inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all) may have joynt right to govern. But then, how can they give what they have not? For since (as formerly shewed) none have by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as men, rule over one another, but what is derived the natural way from constraint, how shall force or fear be reconciled with the supposed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Paction?</p>
               <p>Again, if precedent Paction must be supposed to make Government law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how shall we do for establishment of Democracies? Do the people of such a place Covenant with themselves, both to transfer to themselves, and retain to themselves the government of such a place? Do they thus derive power from one to another, to no other purpose then to do every one as they like still, and to be just as much, and no more powerful, then before? Here is a mad work indeed. Or if it be not done, then by their Argument these Governments are but Anarchies; which is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>But if we should (to avoid some of the passed absurdities) suppose no Paction to pass between Prince and people, then, (grounding Justice and injury on the observation or violation of Pactions) we make them uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (by that supposition) of doing Justice to, or receiving injury from his Subjects: and so destroy Government, for want of mutual obligation and sense of duty.</p>
               <p>Lastly, these considerations will much puzzle us on what to ground the duty of those in the Family towards the Master. If he need not derive his Authority from Paction, but as due by Office, then is power of Office, and founded on Gods Precepts: not on consent below. If children and servants must pact with one another to impower their Father or Master, then must he get them and take them in all at once: or else, upon the birth and admission of every new childe and servant, they must all pact anew, for fear that these new ones, for want of being Covenanters, should be injured when any thing is by their Father or Master done against their liking, And then, what shall we say of the Wifes subjection? Must the husband have many Wives, that one may pact with another to empower him? Can he not also have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55976:97"/>
Fatherly or Masterly power while he hath but one childe or one ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for the like reason? At what yeers must Children be supposed able to pact? And by what Authority must the Father command in the mean time?</p>
               <p>Some, that first founded Government and power on this supposed way of pacting, have reckoned amongst sociable creatures Bees, Pismires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being bred all at once, do romain as it were but one litter: And again, they being of equality for wit, Courage, Size, Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must have, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their agreement in these things and shortness of life, their particular sense of good undistinguished from that which is common: and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely instances, amongst sensitive Agents, for an independent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as heretofore shewed. But how shall these things be fancied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men? What are our supposed Pactions no more then theirs? It is like indeed. But how shall we contrive men to be so contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary: or in such equality o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Birth, Appetite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to resemble them?</p>
               <p>Suppose a Collony of men agree to go to a new Plantation, their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to future Government will have example and reason from former sense and Education in Governments whereupon to found it self. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, with them, force prevailes not for the present establishing one man above another, yet riches or craft will: so as, by the unequal power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to destroy that supposed equal Paction, upon their coming to this new Colony, and also in receiving others to them: towards whom, if they proceed not by open force, yet in their new Agreements (as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst themselves) they prevail on one another by opinion of Power and Force: which must consequently overthrow supposition of equal Community. For the share of Power cannot be equal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst such as have it in degree one more then another: and where then is their formal consenting to set up others in power above them, since it arose but from the considerations they could not avoid it?</p>
               <p>And men may make suppositions this way while they please, yet it is in truth no more possible for men in a perfect state of freedom to consent to any degree of subjection, then to consent to endure any other evil. For when men in this new Collony or in any other condition do submit to another, as in discretion, and out of choice of two evils to choose the less, it is but the same thing as to submit to a conquering Monarch. In which case, as the feared evil is more plain, so will it more prudentially justifie their submission.</p>
               <p>The benefit and design of this prudential choice of subjection, is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down by <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Issacars</hi> blessing: <hi>viz. He saw that rest was good, and the Land that it was pleasant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and bowed his shoulder to bear, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a servant to tribute.</hi> That is, he finding that it was not to probable that he should gain perfect Freedom or Dominion by resistance, as it was apparent that he should thereby hazard and lose the benefits arising by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, he therefore of two evils chose the less: and since he could not avoid the choice of subjection it self, he discreetly chose that kinde of submission therein as should render him most happy.</p>
               <p>And this kinde of prudential Freedom is not onely all that humane condition is capable of in matters of subjection, but in all things else.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55976:97"/>
For absolute freedom, that is, not to be liable to inconvenencies in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the objects of choice (so far as that which shall be in it self most pleasing, shall not upon other consequential and unavoidable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be often subject to be past by) is a prerogative of him that is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent onely: as having his power in all things equal to his will: and not of mankind; who, as bounded by the Laws of God, Nature and other his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, hath his power alwayes so stinted by his own imbecillity and the will of others, that the objects of his liking can be none other free to him, then as quallified and accompanied with such continual difficulties and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, as must render it inconsideration thereof, the object of deliberation whether to take or leave, and not of absolute freedom whether to take or leave that particular object, simply and in it self alone considered. If sense of tast or honor prompt us to the enjoyment of any particular food or place of preferment, these objects in themselves desirable, do through those abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of dangers and inconveniencies arising in their acquisition or possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, become so far still the object of deliberation, that we many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline as evil, the prosecution of what we apprehend or know to be good: and whether we choose or leave, our freedom is not higher then of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to choose the less: that is, the evil of want of the object we desire, or the evil of presence of it with its inconveniencies: Our liberty being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver higher nor lower in any thing then absence of constraint in taking or leaving. Nay more, he that in the highest objects of his delight is not bounded by laws of superiors (as not being under government) yet since these usually are by others desireable aswel as himself, he will have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of feared prejudice of his equals, still make it the object of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation: whereas the same liberty of choice and deliberation, cannot be so taken off by the highest and most severe law and penalty set down by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but that there will still be absence from constraint and place left for deliberation, and consequently for volition either way. For as God alone is onely altogether unsubjected to the will of others, so inanimates and creatures below us, that wholly want will of their own, can be onely wholly subjected to the will of others.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to return to farther examination of the Princes power as grounded on the content of the community and particularly by oaths, we say, that if things be duely searcht, the Princes oath is only voluntary and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be enforced by Law of the Country, or Law of nature, in prudence to his security. And oaths proceed not from mutual trust, but distrust. If either of them break these oaths, they are so far only punishable by God. For the Prince punisheth his Rebellious subjects, not as perjured, but as they are offenders; and subject to the laws: And therefore those that take not these oaths are for such offences equally punishable herein to those that do. And the truth is, that without these oaths, both King and People stood obliged to all reciprocal duties belonging to their offices: And if oaths should be taken to disable them in due performance of their offices, or enjoyn them to unlawful or unfit actions beyond their respective relative duties, they are invalid.</p>
               <p>But although these Oaths cannot amount to a Paction, yet is their use good. For first, the solemn manner and place of delivery (being at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) cannot but deeply imprint in Kings their duty to God, to whom, and his Laws they are to be obedient, aswell as the meanest subject: then, by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55976:98"/>
promising to govern according to Law, Justice, or the like, they are put in minde, that since their office is chiefly for their subjects good, they are to apply these rules to that purpose: at least so far as they see them thereto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable. And so again, subjects by these oaths come to know that God, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the law enjoyns them obedience.</p>
               <p>In Aristocraties and Democraties, the capitulation is supposed between the whole state and each member: but in a Monarch, between the whole community and the Monarch. Subjects in Polarchies have no Oaths from the collective body, nor do the particular members of the state give any to the whole, as the subjects in Monarchies do to the Prince. And this, because each member in the state, as having a share in the state, and the state being not the whole state or soveraignty without him, he is neither in reason obliged to do it to them, nor much less they to him. For as in the first case (his share be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something) it were absurd to demand of himself security for himself, so in the second, to give security where none is taken seems unreasonable. So that the maine security which Polarchies have against the revolt of the people is in their own forces and numbers: making so great a share of them, that, with themselves and dependants, they are commonly the greater party of such as have arms. And therefore subjects can never ease themselves of the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Polarchies without foraign help, or of some of the States against the rest: or else, when war hath so far wasted these heads themselves and their forces, as the subjects may have strength enough to revolt. But the single persons of Monarchs, being disabled to prevail altogether by force, must relye also upon Oaths: and such obligations as may prevaile more by love then fear.</p>
               <p>Now, to come to the example of Kings Covenanting with their people, it is oftenest urged in <hi>David.</hi> Who, as first of his family, and one that God intended to have firmely settled in that office, was thereupon to have the more solemn and notified entrance: And, for the peoples stronger ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to acknowledge and serve him, he was to receive his annointings again as by their appointment and consent; and they also, to that purpose, to promise him obedience and service. For surely, none can think it was in <hi>Judahs</hi> or <hi>Israels</hi> power, whether or no he should have been their King: being before annointed by Gods direction, without consent of either of them.</p>
               <p>So that their former King being now dead, we must suppose that in Justice they could do no otherwise:<note place="margin">1 Chro. 12.22.</note> secondly nor in prudence, he being of such merit in himself, and having besides <hi>A great host like the host of God.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these considerations, as also his gifts, made the Elders of <hi>Iudah</hi> first anoint him, yet I finde no expression of the peoples doing it: or that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Elders made any Covenant with him. And as for <hi>Israel,</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant spoken of must be understood in pursuance of that made with <hi>Abner:</hi> who, as in the chief command, had made <hi>Ishbosheth, Sauls</hi> son, King before: to whose face he threatens to give the kingdom to <hi>David.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.9.</note> And therefore, when in pursuance thereof, he makes a league with <hi>David to bring all Israel to him</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> It is to be understood of a league with <hi>Abner</hi> first made: for after the league between them <hi>Abner</hi> now calleth <hi>David, Lord and King</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 21. Ibid.</note> and saith, <hi>He will gather all Israel to David to make a league with him, that he might raign over all that his heart desired.</hi> Here is indeed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and subjection promised on the peoples part when they should make this league with him; but what was the engagement from this or any
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55976:98"/>
other King to subjects, by way of Covenant, I finde not.</p>
               <p>But to proceed on this enquiry concerning <hi>Davids</hi> Covenanting, that which was probably <hi>Abners</hi> aime (besides his thirst of treacherous revenge was) indemnity for his past act against <hi>David:</hi> and therefore he durst not come till he had sent messengers on his own behalf. Which <hi>David</hi> accepts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that <hi>he should bring his wife Michal with him:</hi> or else no forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: expressed in that phrase of anger, <hi>Thou shalt not see my face except,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note> &amp;c. And likely it is <hi>Abner</hi> was taken into favor also: which might appear by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> feasting him, and <hi>Ioabs</hi> envious killing him, and by <hi>Davids</hi> mourning for him afterwards. And therefore his Covenanting with Israel afterwards can be interpreted (as before noted) but a promise of indempnity from him, according to, and in pursuance of the promise formerly made to <hi>Abner</hi>: who had before undertook and prevailed, <hi>To bring Israel and Benjamin to him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 19.</note> So that, after <hi>Abners</hi> death and their Kings, it was much more reason they should come to <hi>David</hi> for this Covenant then he to them. And it is to be noted, that they send to him, he comes not to them: as he did formerly to <hi>Iudah,</hi> with whom it was more likely he should have made a Covenant, if it had been necessary that kingly right and power had depended on Paction and consent of people. Therefore this Covenant could not imply equal sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation or resignation of any royal power: because then, <hi>Iudah</hi> had more reason to have pressed it, as having more power to stand on their tearms with <hi>David.</hi> For they, being not in like trouble and confusion, might have also joyned with Israel against him: nor was his strength then so great and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, as afterwards.</p>
               <p>But their not doing it (as not having offended by resisting <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Israel</hi> had done seven yeers together) makes it evident that this covenant imported nothing but an act of oblivion, or the like: and that it was not at <hi>Davids</hi> suite, as summoning them to settle him in his throne, but at theirs, to be settled by him in their liberties, which were probably to be the same that their brethren of <hi>Iudah</hi> already had: And therefore they say unto him, <hi>We are thy bone and thy flesh</hi>:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 5.1. Chap. 19.42.</note> because those of <hi>Iudah</hi> might else presume to much as <hi>being his kin</hi>: acknowledging also to him (before they speak of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) that God had appointed and said unto him <hi>Thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 12.2.</note> And their annointing is not ascribed to freedom in them to have refused, but it is said, <hi>They annointed David King over Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of the Lord by Samuel:</hi> that is, acknowledged him King as God had appointed.</p>
               <p>And to shew that this League or Covenant imported but some promises of grace, or the like from the King to the people, and did not imply equal sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, we may observe that he is alwayes set down as the free author and agent hereof: and that both to <hi>Abner</hi> and the people it is thrice called his League. In answer to which promise of indemnity or the like, we find that when the League is set down to be made from the people to <hi>David,</hi> it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (to denote their promise of fealty on the other side) <hi>that thou mayest raign over all that thy soul desireth.</hi> Upon which ground also,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.21.</note> when <hi>Ioash</hi> is to be acknowledged King (being so young that he could not promise to the people so as to be binding) the Covenant goes in the peoples name, as their Covenant.</p>
               <p>And this covenanting with <hi>David</hi> could not truely be supposed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any greater freedom to <hi>Israel</hi> then formerly they had under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55976:99"/>
of <hi>Saul</hi> and his son; for this had been to have given <hi>David</hi> less Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignity then <hi>Saul</hi>: and to have made <hi>Israel</hi> more free then <hi>Iudah.</hi> Which (if so) makes against the whole drift of the argument: namely that Princes have their power by Paction from their subjects, when the example proves rather he thereby loseth it: and so comes at last to confess that Kings have all Civil power by God given as of right to their office, and that as Gods Vicegerent, he may grant, by Oath and promise, to his subjects such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions and immunities as he shall think good: not derogating from his honor, or disabling him in his publike trust. Which promises, when they come to be publikely and solemnly made, as at Coronations or the like, are usually taken for Pactions: and the subjects thought givers, even in what they are but receivers.</p>
               <p>But this matter of Covenanting between King and people, will be best conceived, as to the intention thereof (which as before noted was chiefly to acknowledge and confirme subjection and obedience to a new question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prince) by that Covenant which <hi>Iehoida</hi> the high Priest caused to be made with young <hi>Ioash</hi>: where, at the time of his making, it is said, <hi>And all the Congregation made a Covenant with the King in the house of God,</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">2 Chron. 23.3.</note> and, to shew what the Covenant was, it follows, <hi>He said unto them behold the Kings son shall raign as the Lord hath said of the sons of David.</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">Ibid.</note> Then <hi>Iehoida</hi> appoints them particular services to do for the King: but for making any promise on the Kings part to the people, not a word there, nor no where else. Again, this covenanting in <hi>the house of God</hi> must imply their solemn Oaths of fealty and obedience: the which are expresly set down as implicitly and unconditionately given him. <hi>And the seaventh yeer Iehoida sent and fet the rulers over hundreds with the Captaines and the guards, and brought them unto him into the house of the Lord, and made a Covenant with them, and took an Oath of them in the house of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and shewed them the Kings son.</hi> The people here swearing, and that to a King of seven yeers old (that therefore could not be supposed to capitulate with them,) and their doing it in the house of the Lord, clearly interprets what was meant by renewing <hi>Sauls</hi> kingdom <hi>before the Lord in Gilgall,</hi> and of <hi>Davids</hi> covenantings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned: namely, by Oaths solemnly taken, to establish obedience to a new race more strongly in the people: and not to crave their authority for impowring his Office.</p>
               <p>In like manner are we to understand, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.16. where it is said, <hi>And Iehoida made a Covenant between him and between all the people, and between the King:</hi> that is, he promised obedience to the King, both in his own and the peoples behalf, <hi>that they should be the Lords people:</hi> and walk as obedient children to his Minister. Which last words do denote to us, that it was the custome of those people, at these conventions to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of obedience to God also: the state of Theocrity still continuing, whilst God had a Prophet amongst them. Which will yet be more likely to be the sense thereof, if we compare it with a paralel text and expression used at the making of <hi>Solomon</hi> King. Where <hi>David,</hi> as Gods chief Minister, commands the people to make their acknowledgement to God (as here the chief Priest doth in the Kings minority) saying, <hi>Now bless the Lord your God,</hi> after which it follows, <hi>And all the Congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and worshipped the Lord and the King.</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">1 Chron. 23.20</note> In which words we must not think the King is idolatrously joyned with God in matter
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55976:99"/>
of Divine worship, but as having obedience promised to him also, after they had promised it to God. From which we may also infer, that this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting was no more needful to Kingly power, then it was to make gods: But since upon these solemn occasions they were to be assembled to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of these his deputies, it was fit the Author and Fountain of all should be acknowledged in the first place.</p>
               <p>Nay this young <hi>Joash,</hi> though (as other Kings) said to be made by the people, yet was it not to be understood as if his right had depended on their consent. For he was to raign as in right of inheritance from his father <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> who had also all his right and authority from God: and the people had no more rightful power to reject those individual persons, then they had power to refuse the keeping of Gods other commands; for all power (as heretofore noted) must come from above: that is from God to Kings, and from God or Kings to people: and not from inferiors to superiors. For none can, as from themselves alone, make others more powerful then themselves, more then they can make themselves other, or more then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>And when God himself is often mentioned in holy writ as covenanting with people, he is never to be understood as if done for increasing his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by this means: but, whether he express the return of general obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his laws (which thereupon come to be called Covenant also) or not, he is in both respects so far from acknowledging any derivative power from them to accrew by their consents, that, on the other side, what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is of free-grace and goodness from him. For though this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as due for the receit of more extraordinary and remarkable favors, come to claim a greater willingness, as carrying a token of more high obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (through such expressions of goodness) to certain people and persons, yet (as God) he had right to the same obedience and measure of gratitude, from those and all other his creatures: and must be presumed, as herein only applying himself to help our backwardness in this due return, by this repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of extraordinary mercies. For however it be in peoples power to be more or less willing in obedience and gratitude, yet the duty thereof can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease: nor the duty of willingness herein neither: whether God be more particularly beneficient or no. Even so (in measure) it is with Kings, and parents also: who cannot be in any thing empowered from below, but must also, in the expressions of such Covenants and leagues, nor to be thought as equal Pactors. But so far as they, and those under them, can be according to their relations mutual Covenanters, it can be in no wise understood of such things as were formally constitutive of them in these relations: as for the inferior to give power of government, or the superior to give the other power of obedience. For this had been to have supposed them to have been before stated towards each other in a contrary respect: as the superior to have been an inferior, and the inferior a superior: and that they were now but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers. It is indeed many times practised, for superiors to promise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, justice, and such like things as are proper for them that have power, and for inferiors (on the other side) to promise fidelity, obedience, and the like. And these things have their use: because they both, as voluntary agents, might be by this means reciprocally the better minded of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their mutual obligations. But since the same things had been due from each to other; had they not been expressed, they cannot therefore be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55976:100"/>
reasonably thought constitutive of that separate power and vertue whereby the relatives act.</p>
               <p>Hereupon as Gods particular benefits promised unto men are sometimes called Covenants, so mens solemn promises of obedience to God are called Covenants also: but whether we vow to him, or he promiseth to us, yet, as long as there is not at the same time any mutual express consent of both parties for acceptance of conditions, I see not how they can properly be counted stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or Pactions; in any sense to be applied to the intended purpose. Nor do I also know how to admit the like phrase of what passeth between Prince and people: where the conditions or breach are not set down; but are onely implicite promises: and that commonly but on one side.</p>
               <p>And if we look to Scripture phrase, we shall finde Covenant and promise to import the same thing: as in that promise to <hi>Noah</hi> of not drowning the world any more: God calls it <hi>making his covenant</hi> (not onely) <hi>with Noah and his seed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9.10.</note> but <hi>with fowl, cattel, and every beast of the earth.</hi> Here the name of Covenant is seven times mentioned: sure it could not import any stipulation: for we find nothing expresly required back from them: nor could irrational creatures be capable of bargaining in this kind. And as the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow was a sign of this Covenant or general promise, so was circumcision a sign of that particular Covenant or promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for performance in due time of the promised land and promised seed: they were not stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; as if the parties were equal: or as if God wanted, or men had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their powers, which otherwise then by voluntary bargains could not be granted.</p>
               <p>So that whether Gods gracious promises to men, or mens promises of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God come to be stiled Covenants, It is not to be thought that God and man can come to such terms of equality as thus to stipulate: or as though God must entreat first: And therefore both are never promising re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally at the same time. But however that these Covenants or promises of obedience from us served not to estate God in a right of power over us, yet they have great availe to minde us (under this notion) more strictly of our duty and obedience to him: as also have these signes of Unction, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> towards the settling our obedience to Princes.</p>
               <p>All which (well considered) may instruct us what to think of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discending phrases used by <hi>David</hi> and others in Scripture, when they would by this adulatory means win their subjects, or some eminent persons amongst them to some extraordinary performance: as when the Arke is to be brought back, or the revolted Israelites to be won to obedience by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> or <hi>Amasa.</hi> In which, and such like cases, when subjects have by force taken upon them to be more powerful then they should, it is no wonder that Princes must, as in discretion, be forced to appear so much less then they ought. But yet, even in this condition, they can (for all that) be no more truely said to derive the power of their office from Paction, although they should in those cases pact with their subjects, then the father or master can be said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o derive their authorities from those of their houshold. For these, for the like ends, may likewise entreat where they might rightfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: even in case they should be by stubborn or Rebellious children or servants awed, or kept in durance: and so forced, for their release or security sake, or for fear of their running from them and betraying them, to use the fairest speeches they can, and also to make such promises as the other will
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55976:100"/>
demand. For in these cases, the power of their offices being indivisible, and so they having the same right from God to all as any, this forceable depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation can yeild to subjects, sons, or servants, no higher propriety in what they thus bereave them of, then the robber hath to what he takes from the owner: who may have as good reason as subjects, children, or servants, to say hereupon, that he gave the owner what is left; even because he took not all away, aswell as the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore, the name of Paction cannot be proper where all the thing promised or mentioned is onely in the rightful power of one, and where none is superior to that one, as in cases between God and man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is God <hi>said to swear by himself as having none greater.</hi> For he,<note rend="inter">Heb. 3.16.</note> as superior to all both in power and concern, is both judge and party: so far, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e hath not onely power to judge of his own performance, because none above him, or knowing thereof but himself, but also of the obedience and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness of people, because he is the onely supreme judge thereof too; though not as Covenanter, yet as God. So that when <hi>Saul, David, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Samuel,</hi> &amp;c. have been in our sense deprived of those promises that seem made to them and their seed for ever, we are herein to consider, that as God could not give away his power more then deny himself, so not cease to be judge of his own meaning in making the Covenant, or of theirs or his performance. Even so also (in proportion) it befalleth Kings: who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none but God above them, they cannot be obliged by Paction from their people; farther then either conscience and sense of honor shall lead: and as God in his attestations is said <hi>to swear by himself as having none greater,</hi> so is their Royall words the highest assurance that subjects can have. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though Kings as promisers and Covenanters be hound as men, yet, as Kings, they have onely power on earth to be Judges of their own or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples performance. For though Kings extreamly differ from God in degree of superioriry, yet (as superiors) they have both the same reason for exercise thereof. And (on the behalf of both of them) it must seem a thing aswell unreasonable as ungrateful, for inferiors and receivers to make the good deeds of those above them in power and office, to serve as a means of their depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nor can that Paction but be invallid, where superior and inferior treating, as such should, Covenant to destroy those relations, whilst they yet pretend thereby to estate and settle them. So if a man in his wooing, promise the wife freedom of restraint or command other then what shall be to her liking, or to have power to execute or manage her own or the affairs of the family inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of him, this, though it might induce her marriage or putting her self into his power, yet, it cannot take away any power necessarily belonging to his office for the good and quiet of the family: but rather, as the promise shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an extraordinary affection towards her, it should the more obliege her to obedience.</p>
               <p>Nor can she, or children, or servants, have any freedom against him, but what a power superior to him allows: For so far as law restrains his arbitrary power, and doth (for instance) design in what cases joyntures, portions, and degrees of servitude shall rest in compact with him, this must be derived from power of a superior, and not from a power below, and in themselves. For they being appellants to law and a higher power, shew they can have no power above him; and that this superior power, and not themselves alone
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55976:101"/>
can restrain him. No more can after Pactions between Prince and people, given by his free grant and promise, or forced by their rebellions, prevaile more to the disinvesting him of any just power, then the after indulgent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to wife, children, or servants for non-restraint, can deprive the Master of what power is by law left him, and useful in the execution of his office: because as their power is given from above, so can it be onely restrained from above.</p>
               <p>The Master cannot give away the power that makes the office and yet continue the office: nor they assume power beyond the degree of children and servants, and yet continue such. For when wife, children, or servants, refuse any command of the Master, they do it not as they stand in these rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to him, but as they are joynt subjects to a command superior: and so this is not liberty from his power, otherwise then as thraldome to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>So when Princes command any thing contrary to Gods law, the subjects suspension to do it is not to disobey him, but to obey God: unto whom both stand subject: who, if he shall own and protect them therein, they are so far discharged of their obedience, otherwise not.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, in all capitulations between Prince and people, the case will have great difference from that wherein wives or servants (before they are such) do stand considered as Pactors with their husbands or masters: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these alwayes have a present immediate superior to them both; namely the Prince or his Magistrate: unto whom they joyntly relating as Subjects, have a ready means for decision of any differences that shall arise between them about breach of Articles, if they had not the Law it self. Else their sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations would prove but the ready disturbers of that peace and charity which they intended to establish: even by adding those new occasions of quarrels that should arise to them hereabouts, to those formerly incident to them as men. Even as we finde, that amongst such as do not acknowledge God to have any present magistrate settled here above themselves to decide differences and demand obedience, the like continual breaches daily to arise about the meaning of his Laws.</p>
               <p>But it will plainly appear that this plot of paction was but of late times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by <hi>sons of Beliall</hi> (or such as would not be under restraint) to serve their own ends, and not truths, if we consider that we finde not any one urging for the Jews right in chosing and impowering of their Judges. And all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men, being not now under the authority of such temporary officers, are not so careful to devise wayes and maxims for taking to themselves power to set them up, and make their restrictions by. But that which is the truth herein is, that since it is never urged that the Jews did challenge a right of setting up these lesser powers, it proves that their meaning is mistaken by those that think they had right to set up the greater. For if they could not set over them <hi>Moses, Joshua,</hi> and the rest, why should they have power to confer the office of Kingship? If they could not, or did not make <hi>Moses</hi> King of <hi>Jesurun,</hi> how came they to have right to make <hi>David</hi>?</p>
               <p>And therefore, to sum up all, kingly office being by Divine institution, the power necessary for execution thereof is not by Paction from inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, but by gift from God above. When Princes upon occasion promise the imparting of any power to magistrates or others of his people, this, as coming
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55976:101"/>
from a rightful superior, is on them bestowed as of grace and gift; and not any way arguing, that the power remaining is from Inferiors to Superiors by capitulation.</p>
               <p>For though those Monarchical Judges and High-Priests that ruled while Kings came, had not so much power as Kings, yet because they were straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from above onely (by Gods continuing King upon great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occasions) that Government was a Monarchy: no otherwise then those still continue Families, where Laws of superiors streighten the power of the Master most: by taking the cognizance and judgement of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, as in the relation of Subjects.</p>
               <p>Therefore when Government (as in neither of these cases) is not strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by power from below, it continues right Government; because nothing of subjection is remitted. For that power the Father exerciseth not, the Prince doth: and what the Prince doth not, nor cannot, is done by God: who is onely above him. And again, although the governeds obedience be to more then one, (as touching their general subjection) yet since in each particular command they have but one determinate Commander, and have but one in chief to appeal to, their Government is still right and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of Magistrates, Councellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS we have hitherto declared the necessity of Government, and confined it to one person, so it must be supposed, that so great a charge cannot be managed by any single man without the assistance of others. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, these assistants being in many thing the immediate executioners of power and commands, in, and upon the Subjects, it comes many times to pass that the original of power is forgotten, and the very right of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty it self usurped by, and imputed to these subordinate Ministers. This chiefly appears in those useful Ministers in each Kingdom, to wit, Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Magistrates; by whose help the single eys and hands of the Prince do receive information and execution elsewhere; and are thereby enabled to contrive and act what other ways in his proper person he could not.</p>
               <p>The which inconvenience is not so incident to the Master of the Family: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in his less charge, he is able personally to look into his affairs, &amp; to direct according to occasion himself: and so needs but seldom to ask Counsel, or to appoint standing Laws or Officers for execution therein. For Magistrates are but the executioners of Laws, and Laws are but the Processions of Councel, and Councel again, is but the result of particulars debated: we shall therefore speak of it in the first place, as the gound to the rest.</p>
               <p>The excellency of man above other Creatures, and of one man above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is in Wisdom, Discourse, Reason, Councel, &amp;c. which is imployed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55976:102"/>
either in aiming at the best ends, or chusing the best means for attaining them: either in the knowledge and discovery of good and bad, or in knowledge of prosecution or avoidance thereof. Mans end we said (before) to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: which being of different sorts and degrees, according to the supply of the object, and capacity of the receiver; it will produce two differences of pleasure: that is, the difference in degree, vigor, and reality of fruition; and difference of the time of its lasting and continuance. The knowledge of the first of these belongs to each sensitive Agent, even as it is such: the other must depend upon Discourse: as must also the difficulties and expediences in attaining it. In all these things, if we consider men in Nature, that is, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unsubordinate, they will depend upon his own Sense and Reason: but as he stands in relation or subjection to others, it must have measure and approbation from them accordingly.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, being to consider men as linked in society, where private good is to give place to general, and the judgement of what is general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to those that have general trust, the discourse both of the lastingness of the possession, and the way to acquire it, must belong to others also. Nay, as the Prince hath charge of all in general, so hath he over each one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: and as fewer persons are not to be pleasured to the harm of more, so is no one, or many, to harm themselves unavoidably. Therefore if the whole people, deceived with a false appearance of things (occasioned by their own weakness, or through fraudulent disguise of others) should request any thing which he foresaw would not be pleasant in possession, or would be overvalued in consequential inconveniences, he may justly deny. For it is his part, as to seek the subjects continual pleasure and good, so to avoid and divert what may produce their harm and affliction.</p>
               <p>And the same we may say of single persons, or few: which if they shal choose to act without experience, and deceive themselves in the true estimation of pleasure, though herein they think they cross not others, yet, they are to be by him debarred: as having the charge of each ones good. For the same reason that forbids the pleasure of few to the damage of more, in regard of the equal relations they all have to him as subjects, forbids his permission in harming any one solitarily considered in the same relation. And as, when subjects are comparatively considered, the pleasure of more is to be preferred to that of few, and the harme of more to be diverted to that of few (in things equally prejudicial and unavoidable) so the pleasure or harm of all, many, or one, is, in the absence of such comparison and modification, to be absolutely granted or denyed.</p>
               <p>So that then, all that Subjects (as such) can have implicite trust to be judges of, is, in the vigor and reality of the pleasure of what they desire: and this each one can have but for himself neither. For if it be of a pleasurable object which he hath not tried, he may over or under conceit it: as also, he is less able to judge or apprehend what will be the fruition of another there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Therefore now, to come to application, the good of the whole Kingdom being the object Councel, and the good of the whole arising from that of particulars, the first enquiry must be what truely are those several desires and aims of the subjects? The next must be, whether they have not deceived themselves, as to the valuing of their fruitions, or to the consequents atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them? And then, whether the possession or means of attaining them?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55976:102"/>
be feasible and lawful: that is to say, unprejudicial to others. All these things have their degrees of comparison to make them capable of choice or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, according to the general maxims of a less evil to be endured before a greater, and a greater good to be chosen before a less: else, if many subjects, in a kinde of wantonness: should desire a pleasure which would highly and necessarily prejudice a fewer number, it is not to be granted: for that the Prince having equal interest and relation, the more in number would be the less in value: as would be the death or ruine of one Subject, to satisfie the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or avarice of many. In this case therefore, the rule of comparison still stands true; the less evil of displeasing many: to be preferred to the greater evil of undoing few: &amp; these things depend on particulars, which are infinite.</p>
               <p>As these considerations may give us light to judge of things debated in those more general Councels which are called Parliaments, where the desires and grievances of particular Subjects go upward, and are by degrees colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and represented unto the Prince, the general and common sense of good and bad, to the end suitable accommodations and remedies may be granted, so when this common Sensory and Judge of good and bad, gathering ground from hence, or by information elsewhere gotten, shall act downwards by those Magistrates neerest him, and, according to the fitness of any thing to be done or avoided, make any Edict or Law to that purpose, these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative values must be acknowledged the prime guide of what is to be done both ways: and thereupon, that none but he hath power to admit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of debates.</p>
               <p>And this, because if any Councel have power to admit and receive what they like, and to make what conclusions thereupon they like too, what shall hinder them of absolute Soveraignty? For implicitly to follow Councel, is all one as to follow Command. And therefore, this peremptoriness of Councel being proper onely to such as have the highest power, because it is to be supposed the guide to power, it is the reason why Christ takes it as an honorable and powerful name to be called <hi>wonderful Councellor.</hi> And in the Scripture sense, <hi>My son I counsel thee,</hi> is the same as if it should have been said, My son I command thee: all of them shewing, that such as are under subjection in things that are commanded, must be under subjection for that counsel also whereupon those commands are grounded: or else it will be to be really superior, and to be under but in shew onely.</p>
               <p>For if the Prince, like an ordinary Subject, must submit his Will to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a superior understanding, he is himself a Subject: and if you take away his negative voice, you take away his Soveraignty. Which thing you also do, when you deprive him of his rightful power either to chose publick Councellors, or to admit of things Councelable; and to limit proceedings in debates. For as no man can command in what he is not himself free, or with Justice demand Obedience from another, to what he hath not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as just in himself: so ought Princes to have their Understandings and Consciences satisfied and free in themselves, before they should impose on their subjects.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I should think that those which meet in Parliaments to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the desires of such and such particular places and people, can neither of right assemble without leave, from the Prince, whose Authority can onely make them a publike and lawful Convention, nor Debate or Councel reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies further then they have leave and direction from him too: or else, they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55976:103"/>
shall become both Parties and Judges. Because, in these expedients, the whole Kingdom, or a greater part then themselves and those they stand for, coming many times to be involved, their private interest and judgement must in reason and duty submit to that which is impartial and common. Nay if the Prince should give them leave to Debate and Vote, and they, by joyning many private interests, should, by a kinde of confederacy, make a joint claim to the effecting any thing to the ruine of a few, all were yet free for the Prince, out of his common and impartial relation to them all, to approve or deny, as shall stand most valuable by generality or neerness of concern, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules before spoken of.</p>
               <p>But when persons representing particular places, shall so far be suffered to proceed in Debates of remedies, as to come to Vote, conclude, and councel what is to be done, and have for their so doing no Authority but what was issuing from themselves; there can be nothing more destructive to the good government of a Kingdom then it, for it quite subverts the whole frame of Monarchy; and runs that nation into the mischiefs of Anarchy, whose absurdities have been formerly spoken off. And this is none other then if a single induction, or else some single appetite or affection, should of it self, and by its own presure upon us, prevail to the determination or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing we do, without taking notice of that general appetite and affection in us, called Will: which, by reason it hath been founded upon the continual experience of the different concerns and issues of these lesser appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites can be onely able to say which, and how far any of them should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. For subjects are to be taken onely as competent Judges of pleasant and unpleasant: but it is the Prince his Prerogative from God, to judge of good and bad.</p>
               <p>And again, although a negative voice of Soveraignty should be allowed to restrain execution in these debates, yet the inconvenience of the subjects discontent will necessarily follow: Inasmuch as they shall finde their desires now ackowledged fit in the resolutions of so many, and onely crossed by one: which shall never fail to be construed out of some private interest of his own, or of some neer about him.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as these Assemblies of Parliaments are necessary, that thereby the wants and grievances of subjects may be known, so do some Kingdoms wisely order to have many of them; that is in every Province or Shire one: by which means the peoples desires might be more particularly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known; and accordingly represented to the Prince in a more general Councel to be considered of. Whereupon, these Assemblies of several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces meeting in several places, cannot at the same time joyn in the same Vote (as out of plot) in their desires and remedies; but their several requests and opinions being referred to a superior common censure and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, each one will conclude that their private desires were denyed or delayed out of publike regard. And then the Prince, truely knowing the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and grievance of his subjects, may accordingly provide for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering publike discontent: which is like to fall out, when people shall be pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in minde of any new suit by knowledge of their Representatives Votes, which they will be always thinking the most equal and just rule to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: especially while they are consonant to their own desires: And yet in truth, nothing more unreasonable. For suppose the major number wise and unprejudiced, yet when the number of dissenters are taken out of them, the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55976:103"/>
over number can be onely taken as concluding that way: who cannot avail in credit against the Prince, the representative whole. And therefore he, for that very cause, and for that general account and trust sake, he is put into, he ought in all reason to have his Conscience and judgement left free: and to be first satisfied, whether these proposals are correspondent to the Laws of God and Nature, and truely conducent to publike benefit. But partiality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest doth so commonly cloud and byass subjects in these kinde of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that we may observe that in those places, and those very men that do most enveigh against this negative voice in the King, as leaving too arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a power in him that is to rule, are all that while, assuming to themselves, that should be ruled, an indisputable power of suspention or refusal in any Law or Precept of his, in case they in their judgements finde them contrary to the rules of Religion or publike Justice. And since all the reason which private persons can give for this their denyal, is but for some particular dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hazard to themselves, they must thereupon grant, that he that is to answer for the welfare and safeties of others ought much more to have this liberty allowed him.</p>
               <p>But certainly, had not Scripture and Antiquity acknowledged the Prince to have an indisputable right unto a Negative voice, and to be himself so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme in all Councels and Debates, as that their chief value and reputation should depend on him, and not on them, I see not how the frequent threats of giving <hi>Children, Babes, and Women</hi> to be Kings and Princes, could be taken as a true <hi>woe</hi> or malediction, but rather otherwise. For that, in such places where their Kings were restrained from personal medling by such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, it must follow that the Councellors proceeding with greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the deliberations and conclusions, they shall proportionably also cause the happiness of that State or Kingdom to encrease: by that encrease of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable Authority they shall by this means have.</p>
               <p>By all which we may finde, that it is so far from being Tyranny or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, that it is true prudence and duty in Princes, as to admit of no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels or Councellors of whose sufficiency and integrity themselves are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, so never to grant them general and arbitrary power to conclude or vote: thereby to have their sense of things published till they shall be his too. For as it is distastful to do things without Councel, so much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. And it will be prudence in him too, by no means to add their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his acts, or very seldom to do it: because it will in time eat out his power by its growing reputation, or cause Rebellion when he shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</p>
               <p>And again the Nature of the thing it self will require this superintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for nothing more incident to Councels then partiality and siding, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to interest, either of bribes, kindred, or friendship in debates that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern parties and affairs in the same Kingdom: Or if it concern other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or States, there is nothing more usual then to have them Pensioners to forraigners. All which the Prince is in reason free from. For as he hath alike interest to all within his own Kingdom, so can he not have an equal wish to the welfare of himself and another Prince: which the Councellors may have, through ambition, bribery, or revenge to him or others: as <hi>Ahitophel</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> and other examples do declare.</p>
               <p>Again, as in all other meetings of equals, Councels cannot be without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: where some one mans reputation wins many after him, like flocks of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55976:104"/>
sheep, which way he shall encline. In which case, I see not how poling and numbring of the persons voting, can justly estimate right and wrong, or the result of the Councel either: for that these cannot be reckoned in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Counsellors to the Prince, but as servants to others.</p>
               <p>Add to this, that usual height of arrogance which men ordinarily take to themselves in presumption of their abilities in this kinde; insomuch as truth is not so much desired, as victory. All which Passions, as they shall come to be by the Prince discovered, it were strange if an odds of two or three in a number, should be thought sufficient to conclude against the stronger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Reason that shall appear to him to be in a less number of persons: as though the whole number of any Councel could be for Wisdom and Honesty equal, or that these things must ever follow the greater number. But, in these last discourses, I would not be again understood as teaching Princes in this place what to do, otherwise then may serve to let subjects know what they are to obey.</p>
               <p>Now concerning Magistrates, and the reasons both for institution and limitation of their Offices, it may well appear out of what hath been hitherto spoken of Councellors. For as the one being chosen or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be helpers to the Prince in the farther information of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, are not thereupon to be so far consultative or deliberative as by their peremptoriness therein to overthrow and exclude that very end for which they were ordained, even so also Magistrates, being by him chosen or admitted as helpers to his Will in the better execution of what shall be by him decreed and appointed are not thereupon to proceed upon their own Decrees without leave of him that authorized them. Else it may happen, that Councellors determining as in their own rights, and Magistrates acting so too, they should (as too often it cometh to pass) thrust out and seclude that Soveraignty that set them up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross it to themselves.</p>
               <p>So that we may call the Magistrate <hi>a publike Officer appointed and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by his Superior power for the oversight and execution of so much of his authority as he shall command and entrust unto him.</hi> From whence, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates may be apprehended to be of divers sorts; according to the nature of those trusts which that superior power shall commit unto them. For as he shall delegate them as chief Judges and disposers of things, either in Ecclesiastical, Civil, or Martial affairs, so may they come to differ in denominations, as Bishops, Judges, Commissioners, Ambassadors, and such like.</p>
               <p>But, as, by the words <hi>appointed and authorised,</hi> he must be presumed under the Soveraign (especially when he is present) so, by the word <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,</hi> he must be taken as of absolute power in his absence: or else his deputation and power is useless. And therefore when some are say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magistrates are bound to the Laws, so as to rule according to them; this is true, as far as concerns their trust and charge received from those above them, But as for such as are to be ruled by them, they must be (in the Soveraigns stead) absolutely above them: and the whole interpretation and enforcement of the Law must depend on them also.</p>
               <p>So that from hence it will appear, that none but God Almighty is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55976:104"/>
an absolute Soveraign: because Princes, being by him intrusted with Divine and Natural Laws, are but as Magistrates under him. For when he shall immediately appear in any thing, by voice from himself, or by extraordinary direction from some Prophet, (which for our belief he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests by miracle) their power is to cease; upon the same reason that the power of their own Magistrates ceases, or alters when themselves appear, or give to others more late or extraordinary Commission under their hands and seals.</p>
               <p>But although it be true, that, in respect of God above, they be but Magistrates, yet the usual calling them Magistrates, as thereby making them but of equal rank and power with others, hath bred the fame mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehension to abate their just power, as the calling Subjects People, hath prevailed towards the belief of the encrease of theirs. For as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and people are republike compellations, which, subsisting by, and aiming at equality, do by their expressions signifie as much, so Prince and subjects are onely proper in a Kingdom, where greater disparity is the foundation thereof. But, while the King hath the title of supreme Magistrate given him, as importing his more large power from God, he is still in his true seat of power: for while he is such, he must in all Gods Laws, and where God presides not himself, be obeyed as in his stead: as that Statute and setled Officer for execution of his will according to all Laws already received. But if God send any Ambassador, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, or Prophet, or Apostle, with an extraordinary message of his pleasure (as before shewed) then is he to be obeyed upon our knowledge thereof: as having neerer instructions from the fountain of power. For as it would be unreasonable for <hi>the Axe to boast it self against him that heweth therewith,.</hi> &amp;c. In like manner would it also be,<note place="margin">Isai. 10.15.</note> if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates made by Princes should arrogate against them.</p>
               <p>But now, as for such who doe acknowledge it unreasonable for the Magistrate or subordinate Officer to resist or rise up against that power that gave it Essence to be such, and would yet countenance disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence against Princes, by affirming Magistrates and Officers in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to be in some Employments and cases so far from being Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, and his Magistrates, that they may, as having power therein from God, both refuse his commands, and also subject him to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their own Authorities and Offices, they should doe well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that God can have but one supreme Magistrate, namely, the King: and that all others can have power but as sent of him.<note place="margin">1 Pet.2.14.</note> They should consider that God hath made him Keeper of both Tables, so as to preside over us in all things, as well of Religious as Civill cognisance. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, we can no more divide him in his entire Trust and delegation in these things, then we can divide the author of these Trusts in his sole Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also.</p>
               <p>Now it might be demanded of these men, That since these Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and intrusted Officers had their places from the Prince onely, and since without Commission and power from him they could not have had Power in any thing outwardly to be exercised, more then other ordinary Subjects, how should it therefore come to pass that by vertue of a Deputation to serve, and be subordinately assisting unto him, they can claim right and power to be unsubjected, and in any thing above
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55976:105"/>
him? But we shall here somewhat examine the usuall ground of this stubbornness: which is by distinguishing (at their pleasures) Religious and Civil duties, one from another, and then making men obliged to obedience in the first sort to Gods precepts onely; with this farther supposition, that themselves, or such are they fancy are to be obeyed as his Magistrates therein. And they then stint the Princes power to be onely exercised in what they refuse, and shall call Civil matters: of which distinction of duties we shall speak more fully anon.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, because the conceit of Magistrates distinct and unsubordinate power, hath arisen from belief of this distinction of duties, we are to consider in brief, that being now Christians, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at our private pleasures renounce and take off that general relation, and say that in such and such particulars we act as natural men, in such as civil men, and in such onely as Christians: but since now, <hi>all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness is sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.17. Matth. 12.36.</note> and a sin against God too, even to the degree <hi>of an idle word</hi>; so hath God united the high trust and oversight of all these things to this his onely supreme Magistrate: And this in so neer a tye of obedience, as where he is not divided in himself, that is to say, differenced from us in Religion (but is a Christian as well as we) there we cannot more divide from his Authority in our Christian obedience, then we can in our Civil: without dividing Christ that gave him this Office, and separating him likewise from his right of Kingship over us: and so affirm that we are to obey Kings as Gods deputies in the State, but not as Christs in the Church.</p>
               <p>For albeit in some Assemblies of Christian Subjects, where persons in holy Orders do more particularly appear and preside, (as being an Assembly by the Prince constituted for more neer examination and stating what in the Scripture is more particularly contayned, or what is more expresly tending to Gods Worship and Service) Princes may be thought thereupon secluded, yet since they are still Christians Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as others, and have (as we said) their whole Assembly and their particular powers therein authorized from the same head that other As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies have, we may conclude that each Kingdom is as well such a Church as such a Kingdom: And as Christ is head of the Church, and King of Kings too, so is each King, under him, head of both also: and, while he continues a Christian Magistrate, he must be always so obeyed and acknowledged.</p>
               <p>And although, where the Prince or Supreme Magistrate is no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (as in the infancie of Christianity it fared) the saying is useful <hi>of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 22.21. Act. 5.29.</note> and <hi>of obeying God rather then man:</hi> because, in that case, the Magistrate not undertaking to be Gods or Christs Vicegerent at all, (so as to promote their honor and worship, but it may be the contrary) it were strange to give him the power of the Church which he will not own, but rather refuseth. Therefore he refusing to act as a Christian Magistrate in matters of Divine Precept, we must have recourse to Gods command our selves: or to such representation as any Assembly of the Church at that time can have. But where the supreme Magistrate is a Christian, there, as in all his relations, he is supreme to the rest of his Subjects, so is he in all his commands to be obeyed as a Christian Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:55976:105"/>For if that rule of giving to <hi>Caesar,</hi> &amp;c. be taken litterally and expresly, so as to exclude Kings (as Kings) from being Gods Ministers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates in Church matters, it must again exclude God from medling in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs or matters of the Commonwealth: doing thereby not so much wrong to Kings, as to God himself. For since without a Magistrate nothing can be done in the Law-makers absence, all Laws of Religion must then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main arbitrary and useless: and God would (by consequent) be as well thrust out of religious power, as directly hereby excluded out of the Civil.</p>
               <p>So that, when that, or the Precept of obeying God rather then man is to be taken of direct use and force, it must be when Subjects stand subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as aforesaid: or else (as we said) in the case of new express command from God or Christ himself received: who, as the higher power, must then be obeyed; as in that particular case wherein this sentence was spoken may appear. For Christ having himself particularly and expresly said to his Apostles, <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 28.19. Mark. 16.15. Act. 5.40. 1 Cor. 9.16.</note> for them to have obeyed Magistrates <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to teach any more in his Name,</hi> had been expresly to have obeyed <hi>man rather then God:</hi> and to have put them in danger of <hi>Woe if they preach not.</hi> Even as, on the other side, to hearken to such Precepts as come to be invented and pressed by private men, contrary to the sense of Gods publike Minister, and without express revelation therein from God (which he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to prove) is, as done against Gods command, to obey man rather then God also. And this, not onely, whether the doers be private persons, or else subordinate Magistrates. For all power being in the King, and they deriving theirs as sent of him, as they cannot claim obedience from others but by Authority from him, so they must, as private persons in respect of him, give obedience to him, by whose power (under God) they had this their jurisdiction.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Of the Right of Dominion.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto spoken of the duty of subjection, and particularly to Kings, it will farther be necessary to say something in designation of the persons: that so the stubborn may be without excuse, and the Consciencious have direction and satisfaction (as far as may be) what to follow.</p>
               <p>We must now again therefore consider, that as mans obligation of Praise and Thanks to God above other Creatures, arose from his different receit of things beneficial and pleasurable, so the use of these things standing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, some way for possession of them stood necessary also: else, while God had been so bountiful in giving, we might yet lose the benefit of enjoying them. For mankinde to make good his content against the molestation of other Creatures is not hard; because of his great skill and ability above them: but then, how to enjoy them from the disturbance of one another, we have no other way then that natural one, common to them also: which is by the decision of force; or by that other way, proper almost to man, which is by craft. For if such decision were not, but that every one, as having a like appetite and equal natural right, should have equal force also, one man would be a continual hinderance to another: which now, by the decision of victory, or the fear thereof, comes to be possessed by all: that is, by the victor first, and by the weaker afterwards.</p>
               <p>When two beasts have their prey or love the same, if the issue of their contest were as equal as their right, their enjoyment would be none: And therefore, the same Law that gives them right to the thing, gives them also right in remove of opposition. But then again, as they want discourse so far as to make them provident for the future, so, having secured themselves of their present enjoyments, when that is over, the fear of dispossession is over also. But man, having as well his future as present wants in his care, by the same reasons that he provides for the one, he may likewise do it for the other: and as then (like them) I use means not to be disturbed in what I presently did, even so also (beyond them) I should take care not to be disturbed hereafter. Whereupon, we may gather that propriety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and propriety of possession arose from the same root. For beasts, that looked onely at present possession of things, looked no farther also then security against present disturbance. But men, that aim at continual possession, must also provide against future inconvenience, and may, by the same reason that beasts beat or scare away one another now, so subject those that are in their present power, that they be not able to do the like for the future. So that then, propriety is but continued possession: and possession but present Propriety. And force is but present Government: as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is but continued force.</p>
               <p>As beasts and men differ thus in continuance of their power over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so also in managery thereof. For when one beast hath been victorious
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55976:106"/>
over another, he hath not onely disabled him against future opposition, by fear, but as many others also as were present, at least such as held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves weaker then that which they saw subdued. For they, having not abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so far to discourse as to engage others to their assistance (to the end that what cannot singly may be joyntly mastered) therefore, present and future subjection is to them the same. But because men can both watch advantages, whereby they may be singly able to recover, and can contrive association, in case they cannot, it remains reasonable for the present possessor, if he sees his fear of any thing in these kinds to be just (while the persons are or may be gotten into his power) to provide for his security: and that not only against single persons, but against associations also; as of more danger. Which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and government comes, by continuance, to establish as great a right over mens personal liberties and actions, as continuance of possession doth in other proprieties: for it is founded thereupon.</p>
               <p>To remedy which inconveniencies amongst mankinde, we shall find the positive and statute right of dominion in the elder brother to be declared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first mention of propriety: even to avoid those continual contests for mastery amongst brethren, which else the natural trial of right by meer force after the example of other creatures might continually endanger: and so makes mans propriety, by its uncertain issue, to be on the one side more coveted through hope, and on the other side never possessed through fear. For so we find the birthright given to <hi>Cain,</hi> presently upon the mention of his and <hi>Abels</hi> several callings and interests. And so much may easily be conceived to be implyed under those very names of theirs, given them at that time by their parents, which knew how to do it most properly: <hi>Cain</hi> signifying <hi>possession</hi> or inheritance, whereas <hi>Abel</hi> signified <hi>vanity</hi> or empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And although they could not as yet, and during the life of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have absolute proprieties, yet the nature of their several imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may seem to foreshew the same thing: the elder being hereby put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a neerer possession of the soile; and so made as it were a Landlord unto the other.</p>
               <p>That this unction or donation of the power of dominion in the definite office of father of the family, or elder brother (which was to succeed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therein) was both institutive and also grounded upon the former natural right, appears by that speech which <hi>Jacob</hi> useth to <hi>Reuben</hi> while he is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his sons. <hi>Reuben thou art my first born, my might, and the beginning of my strength: the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.3.</note> By all which phrases it may appear, that although God did, for the general good and peace of men, determine the right of dominion on the elder (because one must have it) yet is natural right preserved all that may be: in that he was of all other to be presumed the strongest and ablest, for the reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.</p>
               <p>So that the foregoing discourse is but to shew how government in general stands pointed out by nature, left alone to her self: and how that it is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical in particular amongst men, even as among other creatures. For they, for the time they obey, it is ever to one in chief: and we may observe, that amongst them, there is no such thing as a parity in command: but, by continued subordination, they are one under another, in the same heard and circuit of power, from the highest to the lowest. From whence it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, this government of one amongst men was but the dictate of nature also: and that it is aswell against natural practise as reason, either for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55976:107"/>
many equally to command many, or many equally to obey many.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding which, we do not therefore affirm that this way before spoken of was the onely rise to government at first; for we elsewhere shewed, that God, by establishing obedience first to parents, and then, for succession, to primogeniture, he left men in so settled a condition for mutual peace and agreement, as the blessing thereof could not have been lost, unless forfeited by rebellion and Anarchical confusion.</p>
               <p>But when these rules shall be broken and interrupted, and the Laws of God for obedience to this present lawful Prince so far slighted as by force to subvert the government, and, for the present, to bring our selves into such confusion as what or who to obey is uncertain, then onely (I suppose) enquiry is to be made, what direction for well settled obedience can follow this disorder.</p>
               <p>In which case, as men must be first presumed to have forsaken the command of God and King, and all that hath power above them, so being now to be supposed to have no other then the guide of nature and self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to follow, it might be by some thought that what was before shewed as allowable in nature in the dealings of each man towards other, in order to self-defence and security, should be warrantable to each faction during their contest: as supposing them to be as so many single men, united by their distinct interests.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whereupon they might argue that as each one is by nature or reason directed and warranted to secure it self to the utmost against fear, and the quantity of that fear, and the security thereupon to be taken, being left to his judgement also, it will follow that any faction may herein proceed, even to the death or other overthrow of its opposers and enemies; if in its judgement his own preservation so require. For in doing otherwise, and out of pitty onely sparing, it would be to transgress the Law of Nature and Reason, and to prefer the sence of anothers preservation before its own. Therefore each party being diversly affected, and so looking upon each other as enemies, they must consequently be each of them intent to provide for their own securities: and whether they put it to the issue of war or not, the weaker is necessarily at the discretion of the stronger: even so, that what of liberty or property is remaining, he is bound in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the other, as of a free gift.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But in this case there is great disparity: for the single man had a separate will and understanding by nature implanted for his own guide and security even as all other natural agents: but we cannot say that nature hath so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a multitude of any sort: nor can we pick out any example amongst crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where, by joynt understanding and will, multitudes did command multitudes: nor can they so do with any colour of right, otherwise then as they are now Monarchical, and under one man: or were made an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent community by their Prince.</p>
               <p>And therefore I should rather think, that the most rational course that in this case can be taken to recover their former happiness and peace (I am sure that most Religious and conscientious it is) that they return to the same form of government and obedience under which they formerly enjoyed them. For although it might seem (for the present) tollerable, for each faction to stand upon tearms of safety and defence against the other, yet since the destruction of their former government must be acknowledged unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55976:107"/>
they are to consider that till they return to that form again they are in no true political way, but do altogether depend upon the natural way of continual force. And that, though for the present what they do as men, and in order to their securities might be allowable, yet looking on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as Christians, they must make what hast they can to be settled in the onely commended and right form again: as knowing their present actions have no ground in true Religion. For though it might be, in meer nature, allowable for their whole body (supposed as one man as aforesaid) to impose on the other, yet since they can never be truely one in interest whilst not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by one mans command, it will still fall out that several parties of them will impose too: then which nothing more unreasonable.</p>
               <p>No nor unjust: it being plain partiality thus to prosecute the designs and interest of one party to the overthrow of another. For although self-love be natural and just, as heretofore noted, in which regard any one man on either side might warrantably act his designs to the prejudice of any one on the other, yet since none of the particular parties can have an entire interest, it must therefore follow, that in acting all the other interests of the rest of the faction to the overthrow of others equally his neighbor, he is partial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just: having in nature no warrant to love one man better then another. This injustice being onely avoided in that party that adheres to a Monarch or Prince, and so joyning with him in his entire interest and claim, do all of them act but as one person. Whereas else, that different degree of love, or hatred, or interest, which each person on the one side bears to each one on the other, must make them unequal and unjust prosecuters.</p>
               <p>So that although in case of self-defence against an unlawful invasion, or in some cases of acquisition and gain, it may be for the present allowable for men in this sort to unite and act without a joynt supreme authority, especially where it cannot for the present be had, yet in case of government, wherein a constant and settled way of managery of this common security and stock of riches is required, the case will be otherwise. For in the first condition, each one may be supposed firmly and uniformly united, and equally acting his own interest both in relation to self-defence and gain, even because each one seeking these things in the highest measure he can, doth thereupon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually consider each one on the opposing side as an enemy to himself; nor doth look on those of his fellows but as equally his friends. Whereas, on the other side, when places of honor and command (tending to common security or the common revenew and stock of a Nation) come to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided or assertained amongst the subjects themselves in these cases, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a differing enmity and competition necessarily to arise about the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and managery of these offices and proprieties between party and party in the same association, it cannot be avoided but that the unequal ambition and covetousness, residing in the several persons must make them (without a common united head) unequal and unjust guides and distributors of those things wherein they must constantly have such partial and unequal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to one another. Therefore, I conclude that true natural reason or justice no more warrants them to continue and exercise this kinde of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in shew of a lawful government, then Scripture and nature warranted them in remove of their old. So that now, out of a conscientious prudence, they should have a fellow feeling of each others sufferings: and not continue perpetual judges over such as they can have no jurisdiction upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:55976:108"/>They are not now to think they have right to continue this their present tyranny over their fellows. For none other it is, when government is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by any persons or orders of men but such as have by their offices power from God: which since these cannot have, as heretofore noted, It is not their specious and formal way of proceeding can make their actings to the prejudices of others just; more then can the actings by other robbers do the like. For as he that takes a purse by force upon the high way, is as cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable as he that steals it, and as theeves that shall come so armed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied as to beat off Guards and Watch, are as much robbers as others, so is it not publication of the act, which can but denote their present power, that can make Democratick censures lawful: more then if thieves, before they kill or spoil a man, should first hold a formal court of judicature amongst themselves, and there sentence him. For, in neither case, it takes off the guilt or illegallity of the fact, where parties become judges over their equals: but aggravates it rather, through imprudence and impunity.</p>
               <p>And therefore, although what was before alledged in justification of the dealings of one faction towards another, might be allowable as in order to self-defence, and for security of the invaded party against the others force as beforesaid, yet can it not establish them in a right to continue doing wrong to others, for it was onely allowable as a course that should have prevented it. It is also to be understood, that in Christian policy, it is onely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in the absence of Monarchy: as a temporary way to safety: and that neither numbers nor prescription, can ever make it a lawful government. For if there be a Monarch, then is that party that obeys and acts in his name not to be called a faction but subjects: and those that appose them oppose him, and are Rebells.</p>
               <p>In which case, prevalence of number or power, nor all the specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of leaglity, can no more make attempts against their fellows lawful, then can the like pretences warrant any association of the servants of a family to attempt the like against such of their fellows as are put into office and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by their Master. For, in that case, the loyal and faithful subjects and servants while their Prince or Master continue in their offices, and while they pursue their quarrel, and stand up against their enemies, are to be presumed as lawfully acting: because acting by an authority from God derived. And unto them, being so united in the interest and cause of one supreme person, is the dealing of one party against another warrantable and allowable. For they, in pursuance of the loyal quarrel or their own safeties, may deal with the other as lawful enemies: but the other party cannot do so towards them: for that they not onely want a supreme joynt authority amongst themselves, whereby to difference subjects from enemies, but do also still oppose him they have, in opposing their fellow subjects that take his part.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it will follow, that in case the revolted party have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the other, they are now to count all their actions unlawful farther then they can derive them from an officer authorized by God Almighty; who is onely superior to them both. In conscience whereof, when they shall return to their old form again under one head, nature and policy come to be satisfied in all their claims. For first, the subdued faction or party will by this means be freed from the partiallity of dominion under so many professed adversaries, and have one indifferent Judge to them both: and so it must be reckoned as done with their consents. Then, the prevailing faction must be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55976:108"/>
supposed to do it willingly; as it is likely to a common favorite, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing singly weary of each others precessure. And then lastly, supposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self willing to undertake it, there comes consent all along. And then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as men, we cannot quite shake off the natural way of gaining power by force, we are next to consider how these prevailing factions were again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over by their own chief head.</p>
               <p>In which last deed, we must remember what was formerly allowed to man, as one of his proper wayes of conquest; namely craft. For how else shall one man conquer and keep under so many; be it by money, flattery, or the like, it skilleth not. But he being now in power, as the conquering party had before taken security of others against their fears, so much more may he, being but one, and having so many that have natural power to hurt also, use it if he see danger. Of which securities the most usual is the force of guards for his person, after the example of the best of Kings, <hi>David</hi> himself. Which, if not done when occasion of just fear requires, the former prevailing faction may at liberty oppress the other still; and themselves also be still in danger of mutual mischief, for want of restraint from injuring one another.</p>
               <p>And to speak truely, this is so far from force, that there is but this way to make known the strength or desires of a people, and to know whether they have any, or no. For as their strength and desires must be known by such as appear therein, and not by polling the whole, so the strength and desires of these appearers, must, in what they act, be taken for the deed of all. And as when an Army of one country conquers another, although they be far the less number, and not elected by the people, yet we usually phrase it that such a Nation have overcome such a Nation; even so, things properly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing action being to be measured by the active part onely, it follows that what is done by the active and prevailing parts of the people, must be reckoned the act of the whole people: especially if the other do acquiess, or else they can have no action attributed to them at all. And upon no other ground then extraordinary eminence and appearance, are the actions of Princes made the actions of the whole people. For as all vertue gathers strength by union, so are the fewer united herein, to be reckoned to have both the vertue and appearance of the whole.</p>
               <p>For, in this regard, it fareth with those associations made by the more active people of any place or country, as it doth with those more active and pressing affections and passions whereby every particular man is provoked unto acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to wit, that as the will in each person could never be brought to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate design and execution, if those differing passions and affections, which are in every single man naturally abiding, should be severally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pressing upon him with equal importunity and vigor; so neither, could any nation or people be brought to any attempt at all, or conceived to be such or such a dictinst company of men, united and associated in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, did not the sence of honor, popularity, ambition, covetousness, or the like, finde so great and continual a prevalence in some, as to unite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to publike undertakings: whilst the rest, again, being of a more dull and fearful temper, are content to sit still and enioy with quietness their present fortunes, or to move onely in the condition of followers to that party that promiseth greatest advantage and security. And as thus, the more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and appearing party of any nation or people is to carry with it the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the whole people, so also, is the more eminent and active person of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55976:109"/>
each faction and party to carry with him the reputation thereof also, as having as much more courage then the rest, as they had above others of the Nation. Even as, when in any man there is such a prevalent compliance and associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of several vertuous inclinations and affections as to make him to be deemed just, honest, valiant, temperate, or the like, yet, the merit and force thereof can never be equally ascribed to those several considerations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by which these vertuous acts or habits were performed or acquired, but the same is still, eminently and chiefly to be applyed to the prevalence of some one more natural inclination of that particular party: as to sense of honor, conscience, reputation, frugallity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in each of those acts did most from strongly operate.</p>
               <p>And now comes policy to its perfection: other governments without a King, looking like a Pyramis without a vertical point. For the people, diffusedly considered, and contradistinguished, are of no force or availe to others or themselves: but serve onely for the foundation. When they associate, they make some appearance above ground. As the heads of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grew fewer and fewer, so the work riseth in beauty: till it come to its vertical point of unity.</p>
               <p>But then, though government is founded on force, yet it is not so often on inbred force as foraign. For albeit, dominions have usually natural bounds, as seas, rivers, mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or artificial, as walls, forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to keep them from mutual invasion, yet since (as to the generality of mankind) these are but particular associations for self-ends, it is also warrantable for any of these foraigners, as hope of gain or fear of damage shall direct (if divine law or particular contract hinder not) to use such force, and to take such caution of others, as shall serve for their content and security. And as this is most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, so more reasonable then the other. For first here was no precedent common government over them both, to whose decision they stood bound. Then, there is seldom such enmity as in homebred factions: whereby the prosecution comes to be more milde from the victor, and more tollerable in the vanquished: both for that, and also because the insolence of fellow sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects seems usually more heavy then of strangers. Then again, homebred factions divide unity already settled: but this makes unity, by joyning two dominions.</p>
               <p>So then there is no remedy, but that in all matters of civil subjection and interest, we are to submit to that politick governor we are born under: though we had no more hand in the choice of him then of our own fathers: yet, as to a person of more general concern, by duty and interest we stand much more bound to his authority. And as we have nothing, but the credit of our mother to assure us our right father, so nothing but the ordinary rule of providence to set up our right King: &amp; therefore, possession doth as strongly binde us to our reputed Prince, as reputed father. For as Christ was obedient to his parents in all things, though he knew his father was not indeed so, so (like him) we must be to our present Prince; although a foraginer, and having no right but conquest: it being indeed the onely rule of providence in this kinde: suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession depending thereon, and election having been never general and free; but onely sometimes made semblance of, for flattery and engagement of the people. And the same we may say of their expulsion also: it being usually done on a suddain, and not upon deliberate and full consent, but only by a prevailing party or faction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:55976:109"/>And yet, all Kings conquering and governing by fear, must be supposed the voluntary head of his own party whereby he prevails and rules, which (it is probable) is as great as any that elects or deposeth Kings. And as general willingness is not necessary to make the entrance into government lawful; so neither is continued general willingness more necessary to make the exercise lawful in general, then is particular willingness to obey him in every particular: for that general willingness must arise from particulars, and these may vary according to occasion.</p>
               <p>And if any yet think strange that force onely should have been at first the usual distinguisher of this property and right, as thinking that by Gods particular Precepts peaceable division might have been made, they are to consider that after the time that God was more immediately conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men in the disposal of their worldly affairs and government, (at which time <hi>the Lord at first divided the earth amongst the Nations)</hi> he is not in his recess, to be again expected as apparently and immediately intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in rectifying those confusions which our stubbornness and rebellions have brought. And this, both for the reasons heretofore mentioned for this recess from government, and also because, if God should have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appeared in sharing proprieties, how should his Justice and more true knowledge of our differing deserts have been able, through each ones cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness and pride, to have past to our liking? Whereas now, we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of fortune or our own weakness, but not of his partiality. And yet, we must not imagine him as an idle spectator. For though governments, by the appearing uncertainty of victory and conquest, seem thus cast into the lap of Fortune, yet the <hi>disposition is Gods.</hi> And he it is, that as surely sets up Kings now, as he did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Darius,</hi> and others of old. And Conquest, or fear thereof, (the usual ways for disposing Kingdoms) he by his Providence as particularly now disposes, as of that lot which the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> cast at their formal election of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as we formerly mentioned, that the positive right of Dominion in the elder brother was at first grafted upon the natural stock of force, as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him ordinarily most able, so we are now to consider, that the right of Dominion being transferred again to the elective primogeniture of kingship, which is not amongst Christians openly by God determined to any line or person under the Gospel, as formerly to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> it must therefore fall out, that it is to be determined the secret way of divine Election and Providence, manifested by the common and meer natural rule of force and strength of body: which must now make known and decide that personal or lyneal right unto this Office amongst men, which is by divine Providence appointed. And it must therewithal follow, that the person so gaining pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, is to have rightful claim unto all those Prerogatives which conquest can afford: being not otherwise to be limited then by the Laws of God, his own Conscience, and sense of honor. For as the decision of right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice between two contending subjects depends (as to them) on the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Prince, so is the right and Justice of Dominion, between two contending Princes, to depend (as to manifestation thereof to subjects) on the determination of the <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> manifested by victory.</p>
               <p>The which, undoubtedly, in order to humane preservation and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the peace of kingdoms, may satisfie the Consciences of Subjects so
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55976:110"/>
far, as to claim a just right to their submission and obedience: however the Conquerer himself, cannot farther expect peace in his own Conscience, nor a blessing to himself or posterity from God, then as he hath been just and Consciencious in his Claim and Conquest. It faring in this case, with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in general, towards their Prince, as with the Tenants of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Landlord. For as these are to pay their Rents and Acknowledgements to him that by the present Judiciary power is put into possession, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to examine whether he be a deseisor or not; or did by bribery, or other fraud thrust out the former owner; even so, subjects, being to pay their Obedience and Acknowledgements to their Prince, as Gods Minister, must likewise acknowledge him for such, whom they finde by the usual way of Providence put into possession. And further also, as the Tenant hath no avoidance against encrease of Rent or Service at the Will of his present Lord, but by leaving his Land and quitting his Tenancy; even so, is each subject lyable to such encrease of Taxes and personal duties, as his present Prince shall impose, whilst he is remaining within his Territories and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>And as natural Reason will thus finde cause to submit to Gods rule of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence now used for the establishment of the person of the conquering King, so will the same reason lead them to suffer it to descend to his heir: left they should again subject themselves to new Civil wars; which is ever incident to Elective Monarchies. And therefore this ought to be avoided by the observation of the Law of Primogeniture, in these Offices now suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in paternal right of power; upon the same consideration that this fixed Law of birth-right was instituted: namely to avoid the like diffenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and quarrel in succession to the heirship of the Family, while this power was formerly seated in the natural Father thereof.</p>
               <p>Nay this right of inheritance not onely follows in Reason, but as graffed also and comprised in the right of meer natural possession. For as the elder brother (as aforesaid) was to be presumed most natural heir to the Fathers Dominion in regard of his more probable degree of strength, so also it is to be presumed that, as being born, he will have advantage of the natural way of right, which is first seisure. Upon which score, if there were no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for hereditary Monarchy, natural Right, as well as Reason, would set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it in the possessors issue, and particularly on the elder brother, as heir to his Fathers acquisitions. The which rule we shall finde approved by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> and upon the like words as God gave <hi>Cain</hi> the power of Eldership, he confirms this right to the man over the woman: saying, <hi>Adam was first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and then Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which grounds, the lawfulness to Elect Monarchs, or institute Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarchies will be taken away: inasmuch as the Office and Possession of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in right of the Father and elder Brother, having first Seisure before any other, it must follow, that none can have just right but God against him or his heir.</p>
               <p>And if the beginnings and first rises of Kings be examined, towards the proof of settlement by Conquest, they will come so far short of deriving themselves from <hi>Adam</hi> in a natural line, as it will appear how their Ancestors, from a small stock, have by success and encrease of force, risen to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent height. And even by this scale of Providence did <hi>David</hi> himself climbe; although God had determined him the kingdom: That is, first by
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55976:110"/>
some magnanimous act to gain reputation, and thereby some few friends and followers to assist upon occasion: with these to encrease by degrees, till he become so formidable, that people had rather submit to his Government, then adventure their lives in opposition. In which case, their power of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is not so large as to choose him or not, or him or another, but whether they will take him on such terms as he proposeth, or put lives, liberties, and all to the hazard of war. In which condition, since fear was their guide, how are people more free before Election then afterwards: when Princes, for fear of punishment, are obeyed in then Governments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?</p>
               <p>And why should not fear be a wiser Passion then love? For they that are governed in their choice by love, consult not of dangers or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that may happen; for this fear is against the nature of love: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the loved hath always power over the loving, and not on the contrary. And none do so usually curb the people, as those that through flattery of the noise of liberty have gotten to be their darlings; and so come to have sole trust and power: at which time, discretion bids him hold the streight reins of power upon their wavering affections, lest, by another, using his policy, he should be again supplanted. When as, all Princes entrances which are made through fear, are made with as great deliberation and policy as may be; at least with as much as the adverse Faction hath present power to use. And it is probable, that he that findes himself afterwards thus streightned, through the peoples fearing him in his entrance, will, as in order to his own honor and release of fear, seek as far as he may to gain their love. And the truth is, Princes cannot well rule without both: the great difficulty resting, when to use one, when another.</p>
               <p>And if any Prince should be by people elected into a Government heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, out of particular love and affection to his person, yet, since his person and those Electors could not always have it alike, or were sure (at least) to have sufficient degree of power and respect, there might be occasion for him (but much more for his successor) to have power and force in readiness to make use of, if reason should offer. For as there might be reasons of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual trust between the first Prince and people, so of distrust in the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing is more giddy or uncertain then popular liking. So that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the present Prince his vertues were equal, or alike, to the others at first setled by them, yet they being not the same people, or having changed their mindes, it is not reason he should be so much their enemy, as not by force to keep them from forcible alteration, and injuring themselves by Civil war.</p>
               <p>And as for such Princes as come in by Conquest, I see not why force in the continuance should not be as lawful as in acquisition: more necessary to him (I am sure) it is; at least to have it in readiness. And this, not onely in respect of custody (answerable to that common rational maxim, that all things are best preserved by the same means they were acquired) but also in respect of recovery: inasmuch as, Government and Soveraignty never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing at the same just height, it must at last come to nothing; without some active and able Prince set himself again upon an equal recovery of those Prerogatives which his predecessors have lost: which necessarily causing the subjects aversion, as judging it a new Conquest, he must first be Master of a good force, or else look to be quite overthrown. And if we consider all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55976:111"/>
Governments and Governors in their stories, we shall finde nothing so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as this their variation in power; and the different carriages of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes in their designs and ways of acquiring, losing, or recovering it. And both reasonable and necessary it must be, that as the Prince hath his Civil Magistrates for government of Properties, and his Ecclesiastical for guide of religious duties, so must he upon occasion have his Military Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for Government of the subjects persons: or else in case of resistance, the other Governments will fall to nothing.</p>
               <p>But now, having only hitherto determined obedience to the present Prince, without differencing whether he be an usurper or not, it will be expected as necessary that I give my opinion what prescription of time is requisite to constitute a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight in the peoples obedience. Truely I know not what time to set, amidst such variety of circumstances as may make difference: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if there be equal competition of Title, present Obedience is due to the present higher power: and, without doubt, if any Prince have now made his Laws generally obeyed, taken oaths of his subjects, and they have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in the field, he is their true Soveraign against all others.</p>
               <p>But although I suppose these three ways of confirmation will establish a right to any Prince, yet I conclude not that all are necessary at once. For the last of them may not come to be used in a long time after his entrance: and both it and the next, it may be practised but by few of his subjects. Yet, till he have been acknowledged in the seat of Justice, I know not how he can be acknowledged as setled in the Throne of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>As for Subjects that have deposed or thrust out their King, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Free-States (as they call them) they can never have right against him and his heirs: because his Property cannot be altered but by new possession. For, the former Soveraignty of one being not to be possessed by many, that Property cannot be lost to that line for present right, or, in defailance thereof to any other for future right; to be established by possession also: Because he comes to be as rightly estated herein, as in any other of Gods blessings that are now let loose without proprietor or owner.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons why these things do fully estate a right to persons for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is, because they contain all the tokens that the subjects (as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) can give of their joynt consents and willingness: and if such a thing as Paction must be implyed between Prince and people, whereby each may stand reciprocally obliged (as on Soveraignty voluntarily assumed, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection voluntarily undergone) it must be herein, how the Prince his assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soveraignty appears voluntary, needs no proof beyond his search thereafter: and to have subjection to the person of any Prince known to be voluntary, there is no proof beyond fact it self: that is, their voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance under it, and submission thereunto. For if he continue to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Laws and Government, and might yet depart, he cleerly evinceth his choice and approbation thereof. If he have taken an oath of obedience and fealty unto him, he stands obliged in Conscience also: for an unlawful oath he was not to take, and a lawful one he must keep.</p>
               <p>But above all, if he have not onely acknowledged his willingness by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but by activity also, so as to have fought for him, he must be more expresly presumed as approving him. For though he may be pressed to war, yet the continuance therein for any time, as under his Government also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessarily to afford many opportunities of departure, the not doing it,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55976:111"/>
maketh the submission and approbation voluntary: I mean, as to general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of him and his right. For that, as no Government, as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can be without constraint; so many particulars of obedience must be unpleasant.</p>
               <p>And however strange it may seem, that there should be in humane appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance no other right then that of Force and Conquest unto the estating the first person of each Kingly race, yet if we will diligently observe the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the New Testament pointing at the government of the Church, we shall finde them still declaratory as to the same effect. One of which we will explain in this place: setting this very thing forth in most open terms: and that shall be the speech of our Saviour made to the Jewish multitude, concerning the Government <hi>of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or the Church. For these his Auditors, having heard the message sent from <hi>John</hi> to him, demanding an answer whether our Saviour were <hi>he that should come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11.3.</note> 
                  <hi>or that they should look for another</hi>; and being ready to expect a temporal kingdom to be presently undertaken by our Saviour, it caused him (after the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Johns</hi> office to be the <hi>Elias</hi> to this Messiah) to give them satisfaction why it was inconvenient for him personally to undertaken. And this he doth, upon the ground of the different manner of the entrance and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government under the Gospel, over it was under the Law. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, as there was both a rule for peaceable entry (the persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by God appointed that were to have the Crown setled on their race) so was there both Priests and Prophets who had a part of Monarchical jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in some things allowed them: thereby also keeping Monarchical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from that absoluteness it should arrive at after the days of <hi>John.</hi> In whom the Law and the Prophets ceasing (meaning amongst other things) that separate power of Priestly and Prophetick jurisdiction, so far as they shared in the Soveraignty) it is the reason why our Saviour frames an answer which did both imply this difference, and shew the reason why himself could not take this charge upon him.</p>
               <p>So that we may conceive, that that limitation <hi>until now,</hi> was added onely to give the Jews satisfaction why he then undertook not this charge himself:<note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> namely, that it was contrary to his minde and quiet way of demeanor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, to enter into a charge wherein so great force and violence must be used, both to acquire and possess: and not as determining that this forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of entry should then cease. For if we shall compare it with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel Text of Saint <hi>Luke</hi>; where Gods own inward Kingdom in our hearts is spoken of, we may interpret the expressions here of violent entry and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the outward Government in the Church, to be prophetick also. For it being there said, that <hi>the Kingdom of God is preached,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and every man presseth into it:</hi> we cannot conceive it of any present pressing into the Church; but as spoken of what should follow in the Churches encrease and splendor: at which time there should follow the most frequent use of violence for posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssing of Christian Kingship also.</p>
               <p>And that, by this <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in this place spoken of, is intended Gods own inward immediate rule he should have in our hearts, &amp; was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that outward exercise of outward jurisdiction which he should give to others in his Church (called there <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven)</hi> appears plainly in the occasion of delivery therof. Because it was spoken to convince them, that,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.12.</note> by reason of their own covetous humors, had <hi>derided</hi> our Savior for saying,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55976:112"/>
                  <hi>No man can serve two masters</hi>; but went about to <hi>justifie themselves before men,</hi> by shews of legal or moral righteousness: and could not yet well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how God should judge men according to their hearts: such that could not believe that <hi>the single eye and light of love,</hi> was the fullfilling of the Law: even of every tittle thereof: for the letter thereof was to last till <hi>John</hi>; and after that time, Gods Kingdom to be preached. That is, men were to be won thereunto by the milde and still voice of the Gospel: whereas his outward Kingdom over mens persons, was to be acquired and managed by the help of natural Reason and force; together with such divine light as God should furnish the Prince with. For although, as the God of Nature and great preserver of men, he do by the rule of Reason, and by Precepts and Examples of Scripture, plainly determine obedience and Monarchical Government (as heretofore shewed), yet doth he reserve to himself (<hi>as Lord of hosts</hi>) the secret approbation and disposal of those particular persons and Families that shal from time to time rule amongst us here as his deputies. And hence it is that all Kings and free Princes write themselves <hi>Dei Gratia,</hi> not <hi>Electione Populi:</hi> for although prudence may many times lead Princes to make semblance of their having, and relyance on the free consent or choice of the people; (even that they may be the more endeered towards him by this his professed acknowledgment and dependance on their favors;) yet that this election was never but by some party onely, and a thing in it self not to be relyed upon, will appear in that no Monarch, being fully possessed, was ever yet known to resign his other holds, and wholly to submit thereunto, for lawful title to be setled to him or his.</p>
               <p>Nor looks it but with a plain face of partiality and injustice, when we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Gentry and Nobility (amongst our selves) to be derived from the Arms and Ensigns of war, and yet allow not unto Conquest it self the like force to estate Kingly right. As though the same military Art or vertue did not adorn the leader, as well as the follower: or that <hi>Viriatus</hi> were not <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in the Chieftain, more then in the ordinary souldier. Whereupon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude being so much all other vertues, as to be the hand or instrument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are (as to Society) made useful, and to be conveyor of them to the notice of others, it hath made the world unanimously to submit to the plain eminence of this vertue, as the steadiest rule for judging the hidden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad of the rest.</p>
               <p>But although our Savior make that additional expression of <hi>until now,</hi> the onely reason for the answering the Jews why he undertook not this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom himself, yet were there many other important reasons for it besides. As first, the assumption of any such like State was not congruous to him that was in his own person so ignominiously to suffer. Then, if he had sat down in <hi>Davids</hi> right onely, as the Jews expected, he had lost right unto the Gentile Church. Then again, wanting lyneal race of his own to succeed after him, he could not have stayed but encreased the Churches division. To prevent which, should he have set down rules to any other for succession, it would have been called partiality by the persons neglected: especially in the disposition of Christian Kingdoms; where he could not, as son of <hi>David,</hi> claim power at all: and wherein, until his Gospel had been entertained, he could not expect obedience as Christ neither. In regard of which, it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be understood why our Saviour should so often be found saying, <hi>I came not to send peace but sword:</hi> and such like Prophesies of the necessary
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55976:112"/>
following wars and contentions which should arise for the obtaining those Governments amongst men.</p>
               <p>So that we must say, that as the Prince of each Country sits down in the natural right of strength and first possessor, and thereby in the positive right of elder brother, so doth he thereby also, silence and extinguish all right in the use of force to any other under his jurisdiction and obeysance: even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their proprieties have their separation and assurance from his. For, as we formerly noted in right of that part of his Office over his subjects, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to judge them,</hi> he was to be indisputably submitted unto in matters of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and morality, so is he in the other part also, namely for <hi>fighting their battails</hi>; and that of both sorts: as well that of publike protection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole Kingdoms Proprieties are defended from forraign invasion, as that of separate protection, whereby each particular subject is defended from the force of each other.</p>
               <p>For since none of the Subjects in each Kingdom, can say of his Lands and Possessions that they were gotten by any independent force and manner of acquisition, but were both gained and held by him in the relation of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that by such ways and courses as were by the Laws of that Country prescribed or allowed, there can be no reason why unto Subjects (as such) there should be any such absoluteness of propriety granted, nor other way of gain from one another allowed, then what the publike Laws for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce do set down. For although one Prince to another be left to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way of force for decision of Propriety, where Religion bindes not, yet have their Subjects no right to encroach or possess the Proprieties of one another, by other way of acquisition then that of allowable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: as heretofore declared.</p>
               <p>But, be these things as cleer and apparent in Scripture or Reason as they will, it is not to be presumed, but that those different interests which will be still arising from those daily changings of Governments and Governors, will, through that different hope of advantage to be gained by one form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or person governing, more then another, be continually prompting them with Arguments of contradiction, at such time as they shall apprehend that person in whom their hopes do lye, and whom they would have seated in the Soveraignty, to be by any of these discourses disadvantaged in his claim. In which regard large declamations are from them to be expected for taking away the right by Conquest; and for branding and enfeebling it with the odious terms of Tyranny and Usurpation: whilst others, although not so personally interessed, yet, being discontented with that share of riches or preferment which the present settlement hath allotted them, are willing to call out for the peoples right to choose; and to joyn with, and accompany them in any thing of change and alteration in the Government: in hope that, from that new shuffling of fortunes and interest which must hence arise, they shall have a better game dealt them then before: not at all regarding that general mischief and confusion which must follow hereupon.</p>
               <p>For will they say that it is fit this power should follow publike and free ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then, to bring any Prince this way into power, without danger of Civil war, they must first imagine that that whole Nation out of which he is to be chosen hath but one person fit for this employment; and also that that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath so publikely and equally demeaned himself in his merits and favors, that they should be always so equally known, and equally beneficial, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55976:113"/>
each one in an unanimous consent and agreement in his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Will they (for peace-sake) put it to the Major Vote; how shall it be known, except voices and consent be taken <hi>viritim</hi>? And how shall it be done but under government; where some must be imagined with general Authority to give direction herein? In which case, how shall those in present power be thought willing to submit to the suffrages of such as have none, whether they shall continue in it or no, or have their enemies (it may be) chosen in their rooms? If the major or stronger party do elect, and by force (or fear of it) prevail against the other, then what differs this from the course before spoken of; where the conquering Faction sets up its own chief in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power? Will they say, that since Princes are to be chosen more for eminence in wisdom, then in valor and prowess, that therefore his election for fitness, is to be tryed out by force of Argument, and not by force of hands, then, what hopes in this case to have an end of the controversie; since the minor party will no more conceive it self justly overcome this way then the other? For when do we see any person yeild to another in any Argument that is to be tryed out by discourse? Whereas victory will presently decide the contest of two Combatants. Besides, what greater assurance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of wisdom, then those effects thereof, whereby this greatness was acquired? Unless they would have it judged by talk onely, and not by action.</p>
               <p>For mine own part, I do not believe there hath been any more studious then my self to finde out a way how Subjects might free themselves from these kinde of inconveniences, as of Tyranny, Usurpation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet, all that while maintain publike peace: but, when I had throughly considered all those ways of redress that in this case I could think upon, and compared their probable benefit with those more certain consequents of Civil war which would attend them, I was at last forced to reckon these chances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those irremediable miseries which humane condition stood subject unto, and which God, as in his more secret Justice, had to himself reserved for punishment of our sins: even in this very case, making us sensible of that our original pride and insubjection to him, which had now brought us from his more immediate care and rule over us, to be thus made subject to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of such as are in Nature our equals; and thereupon to resolve, that no way could so assuredly prevent those torrents of Civil war, which upon these pretences would be continually let in, then by making a stop at that first gap made for entrance.</p>
               <p>For experience doth tell us, that, under pretence of the unlawfulness of the first seisure by Conquest and Usurpation, Princes of a long continued race have been opposed, and by Civil War dispossessed, as Usurpers: thereby plainly shewing, that no Government or Governor can be in security, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like peace kept up, if a discontented party may be still hearkened unto. For if we admit Usurpation a just excuse for disobedience to a present Prince, and any party or order of the Subjects to be judge thereof, there will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want a party who will make all Conquest to be the same: inasmuch as none can usurp Regal Authority to the dispossession of another, who were not by Conquest holpen in. And if it were unlawful for the first to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and govern by that claim, then is it so to all that succeed to govern, as upon his right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:55976:113"/>I considered that Usurpation and Tyranny were usually the expressions of Passion and Interest: many times laid without desert; and that by the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in number also: for had not the greatest part thought them otherwise they could never have got in. And hence it grew, that the old Prince was over called Tyrant, and the new one Usurper, by those parties that were their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And whilst some, out of their interests against Monarchy would reject all Government; as denying either the ways of Conquest or Usurpation to have Lawfulness of title, there are others again, that are ready to yield to the right of Conquest made by a forraign Prince, but strongly urge against U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation of a Subject: Whilst those on the side of the Usurper, say, <q>That all Conquest is not onely Usurpation, but with this aggravation, that thereby a forraigner makes entrance, and rules in despight of a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whereas the other cannot come in without the assistance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the major part; and being a native is not so like to alter their Laws and Religion as the other: </q>and they are ready to give instances for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Jews.</p>
               <p>When I foresaw, that, when all was done, Subjects were (upon their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val) still to run the same hazard from the next Possessor; when I foresaw that there was no other remedy against Usurpation and Tyranny, then what was certainly accompanyed with a greater evil then the disease it self, and yet, all that while, no certainty of cure, I then concluded that I could not go lower then I have done, in asserting submission to the present Prince in possession; unless I should have been false to my main design of publike peace and good.</p>
               <p>Nay, truely, I looked upon loyalty and subjection, as the onely sure reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to defend people against usurpation: Inasmuch as none being able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess another, already in power, but by the help of his own subjects, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty must precede, and be a cause of Usurpation: And therefore, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Civil war will remedy it, better to be loyal, then, by it, cure one Usurpation by another. And I shall ingenuously say, that could any yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me how it may be done, I shall more heartily recant and withdraw my former Tenents, then I did propose them: looking upon it as an evil in it self, onely tolerable to avoid a greater: insomuch as, if right to command should depend on general approbation there is no Prince but must come to be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed: and in that case we shall be much troubled who there shall be to state it, and to appoint what number or quality of Subjects may be thought fit to be hearkened unto herein.</p>
               <p>But since I cannot finde how any in the condition of a Subject stands an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable for the guilt thereof, if he have been passive onely, or that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to search into his Soveraigns Right, or break his Allegeance upon any jealousie of his Title (who being to rule over others besides himself, there is no appearing reason his single judgement or Conscience should bear sway against theirs), I therefore saw no lawful way of prevention or redress but what must come from God. He, he, if we will at all conceive him to be, or to be regardful of humane affairs, must with submission be lookt upon as a setter up and guider of persons and affairs of so great import, which have the good or ill of so many depending on them.</p>
               <p>When any Prince, by force or craft, shall ascend the Throne, although the several Victories by him gained, and Plots by him laid, as also all those ways and contrivances by which they were brought to pass, be to us fully
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55976:114"/>
discovered, and they do thereupon look but like things of ordinary producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hazard; what, shall we thereupon acknowledge no deity but that of Fortune? Or, that which is worse, shall we acknowledge his power and Government, and yet so far mistrust his Wisdom or Goodness, as to think he hath not done it with due respect to his own glory and our deserts? In which case, how can disobedience become us, who cannot at all be knowing of Gods intentions herein, and therefore ought with patience to expect the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? for many times, he that subjects may for the present look upon as an Usurper, may be by him that can onely search Kings hearts sent as a blessing, in the place of him that in ordinary humane judgement had a greater right thereunto.</p>
               <p>But when I say this may so happen, it is not to grant Subjects any liberty to assist any one against their present Prince, under hopes or colour of any such blessing, or to excuse them that did so: for this were to overthrow what was said before towards publike Peace, and of submission to the present So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. That which I would have men in this case seriously to consider of, is, that if they will not admit possession to have right in those Changes, then they must conceive the Government of each Christian Nation to be for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity impropriate to one single Family by God Almighty, as that of the Jews was to the lyneage of <hi>David</hi>: so as, notwithstanding any irreligious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, or oppressive acts in them, no alteration from Heaven should be expected, either for abdication of that lyneage, or dispossession of the right heir by any other of the same Family. But if there be neither president or hope, that such an establishment hath ever anywhere been, or can reasonably be looked for, then it must fall out that all bonds of Government and Allegeance stand now dissolved upon failance of just Title, or else it is to be justly claimed by possession. For certainly, the heirs of Conquerers and Usurpers can reign by no higher right then was that of their predecessors, from whom their Title was derived; but it may be often lower, as failing of the vertue of their first founder. And I do (for my part) believe, that <hi>Caesar</hi> had a greater right to the Soveraignty of <hi>Rome</hi> then any of his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: not because he conquered more forraign Nations, or added more to the Roman Territory then they (for that he did not) but for such like crafts and policies, whereby he purchased that his perpetual Dictatorship, and for those very Conquests he made at home: by all which he became enabled to assume (which others may interpret usurp) the Soveraignty to himself. For having hereby power to keep those his warlike Country-men at peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement amongst themselves, and restore them to their general liberty from the Tyranny of all those factious heads, who, like true Usurpers indeed, had engrossed all liberty and power to themselves, by pretence of being Keeepers of the Liberties of the people, and were so continually ready to engage their Nation in Civil war through their own sidings: he might (I say) more truely in that case be called his Countries preserver, then where a Forraign enemy is onely resisted; by how much Civil war is more destructive and dangerous then any other; and by how much the establishment of good Government and order in our native Country, is more heroick then to do it abroad. In which respect also, <hi>Caesar</hi> may worthily have precedence in his parallel with <hi>Alexander:</hi> who on the other side quietly at home succeeded in a Monarchy already setled by his victorious Father; and his Conquests over other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were but victories to his own honor and benefit, and not to their encrease
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55976:114"/>
of liberty, being under Monarchs before. And although <hi>Caesars</hi> victories are usually thought more honorable, as being more dangerous and difficult, yet, it is not hardness alone in the means, but goodness of the end that must compleat true honor.</p>
               <p>In consideration of all which, as I see not how the imputation of an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or the like, can in Conscience make any good excuse for Subjects resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or insubjection to that present Soveraign which is now by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence set over them, and who is thereupon to be taken as the Ordinance of God; so not in prudence neither: inasmuch as their opposing or repining at him is but the likely way to make him, that was an Usurper before against the right of another, to become hereby also a Tyrant against them; as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their insurrections. Whereas else, it is like, he will, by milde and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious usages towards them, strive to gain by vertue, what he wants in Title.</p>
               <p>More safe therefore (no doubt) it is for subjects to acquiesce, and in this case, to testifie their obedience and submission to God, by submission to this higher power by his Providence set over them: who, as his Vicegerent, and by reason of that present Office he is by him put in, is (as it were) espoused into part of his power: and cannot from thenceforth, and whilst he continues their Soveraign, be any more charged with any personal faults and failings then a married Wife can, by those of the Family, be taxed with any former dishonest act, whereby that respect due to her as Mistress of the Family should be taken off: nay although formerly she had been but one of their own fellow servants: because this duty is not due to her as such a woman, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately considered, but according to her present relation, as being such a mans Wife: and so comes to be part of that duty they owe to their Master. Nor do I believe but those that through interest and partiality would decline obedience to the present Prince, would yet, on their parts, expect his protection in case any violence should be offered. But men are led to misconceive of actions of this nature, for want of due regard how the same person stands accountable for what he doth herein, according to that different condition he stood in at the time of doing.</p>
               <p>Whosoever shall oppose, or make insurrection against that Prince that is in present possession, and under whose protection he lives, he, and all that side with him, are, all that while, not onely guilty of the sin of rebellion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the divine Tribunal, but before that political Tribunal also, wherein this Prince doth preside. Whereas all those that do assist this their present So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, are to be counted loyal, both by Law of God and Man. But if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence or permission, have given such success to any subject, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the present Prince, and to seat himself in the Regal Throne, from that time, both he, and those that took his part cease to be rebels, as to the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tribunal, for any thing they shall act afterwards: but both of them stand Criminals before God as for their rebellion past. And he also, so far as he is an Usurper, stands accountable, both there, and in his own Conscience, for al those injuries which are or shall be committed in his present usurpation; as wel by himself as those that obey him. Whereas they again, that were by the Laws of God and man, to be accounted loyal to the former Prince, in respect of that obedience they then gave him as their present higher power, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now rebels to this, if, while they live under his Government and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they pay not that respect and obedience which is to Soveraignty due: and they do (therein) stand accountable as Criminals, aswel before the divine Throne, as that of their present Soveraign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:55976:115"/>To the present Soveraign (I say) this subjection must be given, if (at all) we will allow subjection as a duty to be acted, and not as a bare contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue onely. For in this case, as obedience is due to the higher power, even because it is so, so must it be actually given to him that is actually seised thereof: who onely, having present power to command, and also to punish in case of refusal, must be understood to be the true object of obedience and subjection, <hi>not onely for wrath, but also for Conscience sake</hi>: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd whose resistance, as the <hi>resistance of the Ordinance of God,</hi> makes that party a Criminal, not onely in respect of judgement hereafter, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that present Judiciary power wherein the Prince is now seated. For this tribute of subjection must be held as legally due to that person in whose name the Laws are enforced and executed, as the payment of other tribute doth belong to that <hi>Image and Circumscription</hi> which is stampt upon the Coyn; which was enjoyned to <hi>Caesar:</hi> a stranger by birth and religion, and one that had not so much as legal title at home; and yet being acknowledged by him that had all title, it will thereupon make the duty of subjection to the present power much more apparent.</p>
               <p>But then again, although those that now take part with the present power are to be accounted loyal in all thy do in his obeisance, whilst he continues their Soveraign, and, on the contrary, those that were formerly loyal, are now to be held for Criminals for what they act contrary to their present supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, yet are they to be lookt upon with this difference in relation to their actings past. Those that were loyal cannot justly be punished by him that succeeds, for any opposition against him before he was possessed: for that were to discourage and punish loyalty. Whereas those that took part for setting up a new power, having all that while no lawful Authority for what they did, are for all those acts legally punishable by the deposed Prince; in case he shall be restored: none but he having power to pardon what was done against his Jurisdiction onely. For certainly, as caths of Alleageance and other ties of duty, were given to Princes by Subjects, with respect, and in relation to that power they then held, even so must Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s be held Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals to that power, for all disloyal acts done while that power was up: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as they must also be criminals when they do oppose that which succeeds. And it will concern every new Prince (even in point of prudence) to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hereof. And although he cannot, in discretion and good nature, but be exemplar in depressing and rewarding some few that have more eminently opposed or assisted him, yet generally to punish or discourage such as have been true to the former established Government, onely because they have been so, and to reward such as sided for alteration, onely because they did so, will be found of most dangerous consequence, not onely to himself, but to the publike peace also: by leaving a president for necessitous and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons to attempt the like innovations for the future, upon the like incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and hopes of reward.</p>
               <p>Upon due regard of the necessary rendring this obedience to the present Prince, in order to duety and maintainance of publike peace, and in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the indemnity of Subjects for so doing, was that most gracious and beneficial Law made, by that most prudent and politick Prince of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh: enacting that none should be questioned as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, for any thing done in obedience to the present King. This most wise Prince had well considered how often the subjects of this Land had been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55976:115"/>
even for being true Subjects, by such as, being wholly swayed by sense of self-interest and revenge, did herein deal otherwise by them, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would in like case be dealt by. For they would not themselves have been content that their followers should, for their loyalty to them, be so used by such as should again succeed in this power: and much less would they be content, that any should withdraw their subjection from themselves, now in present power, under colour of the better Title of another. And much less yet would they have been content, if themselves had been in the condition of subjection to any Prince, and had therein been constantly loyal; that this former Prince, having now neither occasion to imploy or means to maintain them elsewhere, should ingratefully stomack and reckon as a fault, that necessary livelihood he were now forced to seek in his native Country, under the protection and obeisance of another.</p>
               <p>He foresaw that while that way of claim by Title was pleadable amongst the Subjects themselves, that they were not onely still at a loss for want of true evidence herein, but the whole Kingdom perpetually infested with Civil war; by that disagreement that must happen thereabout: whilst Subjects might, upon this pretence, be no subjects; by withdrawing obedience from the present subjector, to whom it is naturally, apparently, and presently due, to give it to such as were now but equals in Soveraignty: and so, being not able for the present to command it as a duty, what is to them herein done, can carry no other interpretation then as acts of love, friendship, respect, or the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not of loyalty and subjection. Which duty, obliging us to actual performance, the Question is not who should be, but who is in the feat of Authority.</p>
               <p>He foresaw, that, under colour of setling obedience by evidence of Right and Title, friendship and interest were still put into the scale, in the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one person before another; to the perpetual disturbance of the Subjects by their disagreements herein. Whereas, if right to possession had still followed possession, all Civil war should be avoided: because, being then guided by a thing so apparent to each ones sense, there could be none found to oppose or disturb him whom all did obey. Wheras those that withdrew their obedience from him that was actually possessed, under colour of that right which any other had to possess, as they must thereby confess it due in respect of that office he hath right unto, so (if they should separate themselves from their own interests and passions) they must acknowledge it, by the same rule, to be for the present, due to this present possessor. Else, by a strange and unnatural contradiction, he that is actually possessed, as King, should be, at the same time, actually dispossessed, and no King; by this absurd diversion and application of obedience unto a power which is not in being.</p>
               <p>Sense and experience of his own former condition had rightly told him, that as this belief or opinion of the right of him that is dispossessed, can, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that his private condition, claim from his former Subjects a willingness &amp; propension only to perform actual subjection when he shall be again possessed and restored to a capacity of actual command, so, in the mean time, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual possession of this other, must, by the same rule, claim actual subjection and obedience unto him, from all that live under his obedience and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: unless (as we said) we should make that Precept for <hi>subjection to the higher power</hi> vainly given; when such as should be subject, should have a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55976:116"/>
liberty hereby left them whether they will at any time be so or no; by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some pretence or other, that it is not rightly due to him that hath now onely power to command it.</p>
               <p>And therefore although this Prince, like others, did wisely cause such of his Subjects as were eminent, or to be suspected, to take oaths of Allegeance and Fidelity to himself and posterity, yet, by that truely self-denying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance before mentioned, he may well be thought more considerative of that future establishment of publike peace and benefit, then so peevishly respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the setling his race alone, as, upon any turn, to involve all men in the hazard of guilt and blood: by making that oath, which was made to preserve and encourage loyalty, a continual snare and punishment to all that had been so: and to such onely, who, in Conscience and friendship, stand enclined to his side.</p>
               <p>But now, for conclusion of this Discourse, we shall say something in answer to such scruples as may arise concerning those that are cast into that unhappy condition as to be under any of these Polarchies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (else) it might be supposed, from what hath hitherto been spoken, or may hereafter, that I did conclude that no man could live honestly or Conscienciously but under a Monarch. It is therefore to be considered (as we have formerly hinted) that as all these Polarchies have been formerly Monarchies, so are their Laws and Constitutions, for the most part, onely such as have been before setled and Authorized by a Monarch. In which case it will fall out, that the Subject living in any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Calling allowed by the former Laws, is to be concluded law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully authorized in his deportments: as obeying and submitting to the Ancient and right Authority still. But in all new Constitutions and Commands on him imposed by these unauthorized Guides, by which he shall be put to act any thing that may have relation beyond himself, he is, in that case, for want of warrant from Christs direct Deputy, to secure his innocence the best he may, by assuming to himself the power of judging of Morality; and to act no farther then the Conscientious rule of <hi>Do as thou wouldest be done unto</hi> shall give leave. And, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is he to make use of that distiction of obedience into Active and Passive: <hi>and of obeying God rather then man.</hi> So that, by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Willingness to suffer in his own person, rather then wrong another, he shall acquit himself of the guilt of that suffering he might bring on another, through want of a justly derived power. For when it shall be any mans unhappiness, not to have Christ, by his proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, outwardly directing him how <hi>to love his neighbour</hi> as himself, as well as, by his Spirit and Gospel, inwardly fitting him thereunto, he is then, by his Consciencious <hi>abstenance from all appearance of evil,</hi> and by his readiness to be assisting unto him in all that shall be in his power; and which according to his wants, shall be justly or reasonably demanded of him, to make up that measure of bounden good to his neighbour, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not actively undertake and perform.</p>

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:55976:116"/>In this last Chapter I have again raised up and united the former Fabrick of Monarchy, which in all those precedent, seemed to be buried in the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish of popular mistake and confusion. And as in the first Book, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation thereof was laid on that stock of discourse which Divine Edict, and the Rules of humane Nature or reason would afford, here I have again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the strengthening and establishing of the Work, such farther supply as the presidents of other meer naturall agents would readily contribute; although men (like them) should be supposed put into the world at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and without other direction or law then what their owne senses could frame. It seems now therefore seasonable, that for confimation of all, we should have our recourse to Religion; so called, because it is the tye of all politie and commerce; to see how all these things stand therein warranted; and are both allowed and commanded by that great Guide and preserver of Man kinde: all which, by divine assistance, the following Book shall declare.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow long since, or who it was that first made that distinction of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue into two Tables as now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I know not: but sure I am, that that common liberty every day ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of dividing mens duties and obedience into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and civil, hath been the cause of much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction and division amongst men. For whilst some are ranking under the classis of Gods parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular service what share of humane actions they please, they have on the one hand almost taken peace from the earth, by substracting that our bounden obedience from his immediate vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, which should have been the tye thereof: whilst others again, out of a desire to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves absolute in the managery of State affairs,
<pb facs="tcp:55976:118"/>
have come to seclude God, and the rules of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from having any immediate influence and authority therein; which are in these things, and to the support of that obedience which is on their behalf necessary, the chiefe securities and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Against some inconveniencies arising from the practise and opinions of those of the last sort, I have framed much of my discourse in the two precedent books; in which, by reason as well as Scripture, I have plainly shewn the necessary tye and dependance of political good and peace on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and its precepts; and how it is, not onely injurious to God, but wrong to our selves, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of superintendant dominion and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, either in the government of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or estates. And indeed to deny Gods care and superintendency over moral agents and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as natural ones, is an opinion border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only on Atheism, but on absurdity also; when as men shall be hereby thought not so valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the eye of Divine care and providence as beasts; nay as stocks and stones.</p>
               <p>In this present work, my intention is to set forth the inconveniences that arise from the sole under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of those of the other sort; that is, such as oppose this power upon the score of religion. And more particularly those of the Romish party, who first made use of, and applyed that notion of <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> unto the Christian Prince; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might, under that distinction of <hi>Civil,</hi> be not only separated &amp; secluded from any farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling
<pb facs="tcp:55976:118"/>
in the Church then as if he had still been a pagan, but also that, under the appellation of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> (instead of that of King) he might be but thought subordinate herein neither; even to that their own supream head, as well as were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and other Church guides and Officers; whom certainly they intend should be opposed unto him in this his civil relation: and be not onely absolute in Ecclesiastical jurisdiction and government of the Church, but to be super-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the State also.</p>
               <p>And although, amongst Protestants, this sole superintendency is not given to any Ecclesiastical person, yet when we find those that pretend great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reformation &amp; departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> stil retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this notion of <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi> and applying it to the Prince, we may conceive it purposely also so done, that thereupon another independent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, even themselves, might be closely insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, and also acknowledged and obeyed in Church affairs.</p>
               <p>Which done, and having hereby made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the next and more immediate Ministers to God and Christ, their next work is to stretch and draw out religious cognizance as far as they can, &amp; to leave unto Kings, as persons in a sphere below them, the managery of such other duties and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as they are pleased to list under the notion of Moral; calling the greatest proficients in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, (in a kinde of scorne) Moral men, or men ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy honest. As though the very Decalogue, and the whole Jewish law given from God himself,
<pb facs="tcp:55976:119"/>
carried not moral consideration with them; and were any otherwise binding then as moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to us now.</p>
               <p>In farther evidence whereof, I shall also shew how the very Gospel-precepts do make moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties their subject also, even as our Saviour ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily made mans body the subject of his miracles: and that the substance of the former more large moral direction is abreviated and fulfilled in the gospel precept of love: and how again, love is made useful by the tye and effects thereof, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humility, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in such sort, that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil good and society is by Gospel-directions more neerly and directly pointed to, and maintained then before. Of all which, by Gods assistance, in that which follows.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Religion in its true ground.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR discourse hitherto hath been to manifest that the end of all divine, natura, and positive laws, are both for the preservation of the whole world, and of man in particular. In which doing, we are not to consider God Almighty, (like our selves in our sports) as taking delight in the action it self, and entertaining it by way of pastime, as having nothing else to do: but as an understanding, free, and voluntary Agent; and having an end in all things he doth. For otherwise would not his works be regulated and stinted as now they are: but, there being no end of doing, the deeds would be also infinite as the Author. End he could have none, above, or without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to himself: because this must be the necessary consequent of choice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: For to do, or not to do anything, wherein self-good, interest, or liking is no wayes concerned, is not imaginable; but, in all knowing and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agents, must be presupposed.</p>
               <p>Therefore now, to come to examine what this end of God is, and how it is both true that all things were made <hi>for his own sake,</hi> &amp; again, how <hi>all was made for the use of man</hi>; we must take care that, in no consideration,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> we entrench upon Gods alsufficiency in himself, and think him hereby, or from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as in a kinde of supply) any way advantaged. For when we eat or drink, or make use of any thing, it is in us a contribution towards some necessary want and sustentation of our being: but, when God keeps on the course of his Providence, and hereby enables all Creatures to do him that service he requires, we must not imagine any indigence in him to be the cause thereof: for he, having none his superiour or equal, nor any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the verge of his power, how should fear or want approach his almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Therefore he, not being like other Creatures, who have their being and wel-being dependent on him; but, being truly independent of any but himself, his operations outward, (that can have no end higher or better then himself) must have it onely by reflection and return. Whereupon, he being all good, and it being proper to the nature of goodness to be extensive and communicable, he did, according to his good pleasure, Confer on other Creatures those different resemblances, and the participation of those beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and perfections, which were before solitary and in himself confined. All which proceeding from him without substraction, he is so far from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering diminution herein, that, by a kind of multiplication, he hath the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and content of his owne now encreased by that of others: even by their just and grateful acknowledgements of so much from him received. So that from hence we may conclude, the reason how all things come to be said made for his owne sake; namely, to express his honour and glory: which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55976:120"/>
return of praise and glory being justly expected of each creature as a duty, is, by Gods acceptance, reckoned as a service.</p>
               <p>But, because returnes of gratitude are, as neer as may be, to be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the measure of benefits received; and because (amongst subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creatures) man had the largest measure imparted; it will follow that from him, as from a Creature most bounden for receipt, and best enabled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, this duty of praise and thanksgiving should be chiefly expected: nay, in a manner, from him onely it can be had. For although <hi>the Heavens may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 19.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Firmament shew his handy work</hi>; yet because those beauties and excellencies, which by the wisdom and power of God are bestowed on them and other irrational Creatures, are not at all apprehended by themselves, and are, for the most part, but subservient to others, how should such return of praise or acknowledgement be expected from them, or any but man? who alone, (in these endowments and perfections received) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, of all Creatures, least tyed in a subservient relation: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, having all the vertues and benefits of other things directed and made appliable towards him, and his own abilities again standing directly pointing at the service and honour of his Maker, it may thereupon be fitly said, <hi>That all things were made for man</hi>: as the most able creature in regard of his reason to apprehend his owne interest and obligations, and to make suitable expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of thanks to Gods glory.</p>
               <p>By all which, it appears that the end of all our whole religion and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours should be to the glory of God: even such a God, that, being so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in power above us, is yet so particularly extensive of his goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, that whosoever shall but considerately weigh the measure thereof, must ever think himself to high a debtor, that with an holy extasie he may cry out,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.12.</note> 
                  <hi>What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me</hi>? What can be more proportionable, and becoming both our duty and benefit, then, in immitation of that (thereby) most pleasing person, to <hi>have his praises al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in our mouths</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 145.21.</note> nay not in our mouths alone, but in our actions also: <hi>these must so shine before men, that they seeing our good works, may glorifie our Father which is in heaven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When Birds or Beasts sing, or play, in the sense and exultation of benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from this universal Author of plentiousness to all things living, they, in their kind,<note place="margin">Reclesi. 51.22.</note> praise him: but unto us, as he hath given understanding, so it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to praise him: and if with reason we do it not, we do it not as men, <hi>nor with all our might,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 22.37.</note> 
                  <hi>nor with all our strength.</hi> And this reason of ours, we must, in so needful a work, strengthen with all the help we can; especially out of, that portion of his owne unerring wisdome, revealed in the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>And, for farther fear that their meaning herein should be mistaken, we are not to trust our single, and private judgements for their interpretation: but take direction from those <hi>that have rule over us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.7.</note> 
                  <hi>whose faith we are to follow.</hi> By which means, we shall also most assuredly keep up, and preserve our other duty, (the chiefe means of his praise on earth) namely the good of our Neighbour. For, as God keeps on the whole Creation and our particular preservations, for a means to express his glory by; so we, by observing his commands of Charity, beneficence, peace, and love to one another, must make that, (as having most necessary and direct tendency to this preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) the onely alowable means to give him that praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:55976:120"/>By this means it will come to pass, that although,<note place="margin">Job. 35.6.</note> when <hi>we sin or multiply our transgressions, we do nothing against him,</hi> nor that he, (as directly in himself) <hi>doth receive gaine or advantage by our righteousness</hi>; yet,<note place="margin">verse 7.</note> since <hi>these our wickednesses may hurt men as we are, and our righteousness (on the other side) may profit them</hi>; therefore comes our good or ill deeds towards them,<note place="margin">verse 8.</note> to be reckoned as so to God: and vertue and morality (when truly such) to be the same with piety and religion; probity being the same with righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and vice the same with sin.</p>
               <p>And as this is the end of Religion, so of nature also: for as both of them proceeded from him, so both of them point at the same end, the glory of God: but in the means thereunto they somewhat differ. For because, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God stands as the most supream and remote cause, and therefore (the exigence of his manifestation so requiring) is sometimes, by miracles, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make himself known to us, by being the immediat cause of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary production, (it being else very difficult for the wit of man, (through so many intermediate causes, and such long circuits of effects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending one upon another) to pass in order through all the links of this golden chaine, till they come at last to that which (according to the Fable) is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Jupiters</hi> toe) therefore God is by precepts of Religion, brought to an easie, plaine, and immediate appearance in our conceits. Whereupon, having our duties of praises and acknowledgments unto him manifested, even for the least good we receive, we are hereby (as by most plain direction) fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taught, both in the duty it self, and manner of our return of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: which is, by this means, made intelligible to all in general, and each one in particular. Whereas, if the light and direction of nature had been therein alone entrusted, this supream cause and end of our being, either, through its intricacy and our weakness, could not; or, through the hasty pursuits of our desires, would not in such due manner have been discovered, as to fix our selves on the Creator: and nor, by a kinde of Idolatry, on the creature it self.</p>
               <p>And as it had thus fared in the great end of all things, Gods glory; so, in the chief appointed means to it, mans preservation, it would have come to pass that the knowledge and practice of our duty (without precepts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) would have been, in many things, at a loss. For example, although, by long circuit of reason and such discourses as heretofore spoken of, some men might come to have found, that obedience should be given to the Prince or chief Magistrate, even in order to that we owe to God; yet, considering the great number of the ignorant, and the differences of others about the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and manner of affording it, (without direct precepts of Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding and determining it) nothing but civil war and slaughter would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. In which war, as my person must be equally hazarded with others, so, in lessening the number of mankinde, the lessening of Gods praises, in the instrument thereof, would ensue. Therefore, as well out of care of Gods glory as my owne good, my submission to government and a publique desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive sentence was necessary: but the ability to apprehend it by discourse hapning to few, and yet the end of it being the duty of all; it was behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that obedience should peremtorily be appointed by precepts of Religion: <hi>whether unto Kings as Supreum, or unto others as sent of him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As thus, in many matters of Charity, divine direction was usefull, so, to the particular direction of our Christian faith, (on which as a ground-work)

For since <hi>none could come to God except he first know that God is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that seek him</hi>; so, the stating our faith standing necessary as to the stating our obedience, we we may see cause for the frequent commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and injunctions thereof in the New Testament: where it is expresly said, that <hi>without it tis impossible to please God:</hi> that is, without confidence of his being, and of his rewards and punishments following our good or bad actions, we shall not be zealous of good works or duties of Charity. And having so far shewed what the ground of Religion should be, we will next shew what it usually is, both in ground and practice.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II. Of Religion as commonly received.</head>
               <p>BEfore the knowledge of good and evil entred into man, Nature was his religion: and what was by her law done, was also thereby justified. But being once possessed with the apprehension of this discovery, all our thoughts and actions were so involved herein, that nothing we said or did, could escape censure on one side or other: and so consequently, for well or ill doing, we could not but expect reward or punishment. But because (on the one hand) the natural pride and arrogancy of each man, was ready to put a greater rate and desert upon his intents and doings, then he saw them rewarded with in this life; and (on the other side) knowing the great and many faults that had escaped him or others, not at all espied by men, or by law so throughly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as he thought their gift required; the two main guides of our nature, <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear</hi>; led on our expectations to a future reckoning; in such a sort, that, where the souls immortallity and our resurrection are not by special re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation manifested, men are yet generally found believing thereof; the craft of persons in authority (many times) helping on, and biassing these <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of inferiours to sociable advantages, or self respects.</p>
               <p>Now the wayes men take for the obtaining of this future reward, or a voiding the like punishment, is their religion. And then, religion having its ground from conscience, and each mans conscience following the light of his understanding, in judging good and bad and their degree, from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of understanding, followeth the diversity of religions: which, as they had their first rise and fashion from their several Authours, so each one yeilds himself a Disciple, as he findes his hopes, or the fears of his owne conscience therewith satisfied. Therefore now, concluding mens religion and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be according to their understanding, and their understandings being not onely differing but altogether imperfect, it is impossible that any Religion should be true, but what is from God himself received.</p>
               <p>But then again, because truth doth not move by being, but by being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and because there is no way for this apparency till it be made conceivable to my understanding, will it not follow, that therein also, we must be subject to much difference &amp; uncertainty? So that men generally acknowledging a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; that no religion can be true but what shal be from him received, they do, by means of this fallible guide, so usually mistake in their choice. For knowledg
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55976:122"/>
in this kinde is not innate, but acquired: for why else are not Children, and innocents, as well as men of riper capacity, (by priviledge of birth and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) without more ado) instructed? Why is that long stay made, until, (by natural course) the sences and organs of the body receiving their due growth and perfection, the understanding (together therewith) arrive also at a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient capacity for the same reason to work by?</p>
               <p>So that then, the priority, and worth of divine truths, being not able of themselves to enter our capacities, otherwise then as let in by the senses, or else made familiar by such things as formerly were so, as types, parables, simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and the like; it comes to pass, that, according to the several preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men, and their several fashions in entertaining them, our several be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes and opinions do arise. And although we are seldome able to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber those sensible inductions out of which they grew, yet from such they must needs at first grow; inasmuch as, had they come in without mixture, they would (like truths) have remained to all men the same, and alike: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, their variety, shews the variety of their entertainment and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>And therefore, although naturally as men, and for satisfaction of our hope and fears sake, we generally adhere to one sort of Religion or another, yet, when we come to entertain the kindes, we stand not onely disabled in our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but for the most part use no Election at all: depending rather on chance, then choice. For what one is there of a thousand, that ever doubts of, or alters the religion he was brought up in? For do we not Scholly, and Catechise our Children in the same opinion with our selves? do we not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and send them, (with directions for beliefe and attention) unto such Churches and Preachers, where we are sure the truth and benefit of this, and the falsehood and dangers of all others shall be exemplified to the height? What probability then, that he should prefer an opinion unknown, at least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes discommended before one he doth know, and hears alwaies praised? Whereupon, we shall finde preoccupation of judgement of such force, that, whether they be Christian, Jew, Mahumetan, Heathen, or a distinct Sect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of these generals, yet all of them to resolute to their owne side, that they will embrace Martyrdom rather then a recantation. Not that all in any kinde will do so; (for all men stand differenced between perfect Atheism and height of belief;) but where such tenderness of conscience and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is met withall, as can be subdued to entertain Myrterdome on one side, the same party would also have entertained it on another, had education and other fore-stalling arguments been applyed unto him. And even as in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it self, and the sects thereof, we may find both Martyrs and Renegates, as strength of belief leades them, so in other religions also, (upon tryal) these kindes have been apparent. For as the Magitians feigned Miracles found greater belief with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> then the true ones of <hi>Moses,</hi> so a false infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, having nothing to contradict it, or education having forestalled our judgements, prevailes as true with us, and the contradictory thereof as false. For all men thinking it reasonable, that the proof of divine authority should be evinced by something more then humane; and that supernatural truths, otherwaies not conceiveable by sense, (and so demonstrable) should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained and illustrated by such as were, it made the founders of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pretend miracles; as thinking their endeavours vain without them.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as the miracles of the Old Testament were occasioned for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation

of all, or part of the Law, and the maker thereof; so, when alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in that, and confirmation of the Gospel was required, it was requisite as great, or greater should be shewed. Till these things were done, it was impossible for natural discourse to assent to misteries so much above its reach: Nay an infidelity it had been, to have departed from truths already so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly established, without higher ground. Therefore our Saviour saith, <hi>If I had not done amongst them those works that never any man did, they had not had sin.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But if when custome and education, (as in the other example, and these of our Saviour to the Jewes) was so prevalent as not to give sense (the greatest assurance we have) leave to discern between truth and falsehood; what can be expected from men now living; that have onely an historical faith in that case to relye upon? For although, in each Religion, the proof of miracles be brought in as a divine and infalible evidence of its truth, yet the truth of their story depending upon the truth of that traditional Doctrine, or that Scripture out of which the relation it self is framed, it must follow that, where difference in these things is not made by reason, Religion (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) must have its ground and rise from meer education. And so, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the founders of each religion have left unto their Disciples some set or standing record or written direction, both for guidance of their belief and actions, yet when the same comes to be taken into credit onely upon the score of tradition and humane authority, it will follow that the proof thereof can have (in our belief) no higher certainty then the evidence of education and authority will bear: which was all the premises we made use of to frame this conclusion by.</p>
               <p>But, by this means, having entertained a ground work in our phancy, for beliefe of some principle for our direction and guidance in all things else, hence comes the Bible with Christians, the Talmud with the Jewes, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran with the Turks to be had in such esteem, that what is in them asserted is firmly believed.

                  </gap>quire the foundations of things; yet then, as it must, on the one hand, distaste through a plain affront to their judgement setled the other way already, so cannot it, on the other hand, be naturally of avail, farther then as true reason can (without prejudice) be brought to assist in the discovery. For (without it) pretence of divine attestation to be gathered from that particular majesty and elegancy of stile, (which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet himself and his followers do so much brag of) to be found in their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, as an infalible signe that it was delivered by the holy Ghost) will be far from carrying the force of demonstration to persons unprejudiced. It being most apparent that, since thousands have, and do dayly read it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such discovery, that this assent of theirs, going alwayes along with such, and none but such as have, in their education, had it perpetually incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto them that it was indeed so written, can proceed from nothing else but prejudice and prepossession of judgement. For they cannot but conceive that if God had intended conviction that way, he could have so plainly and efficaciously have done it, as that those miracles they put upon him might well have been spared. But it is to be considered, that although from reading of books containing new argumentations and reasonings men may be altered in their judgement from what they were, yet in things delivered Magistrally, and by way of authority onely, the assent must arise from prepossession. For

I read not of any Proselites made, amongst the Egyptians or others, from those translations of the books of several Religions, wherewith <hi>Ptolomies</hi> Library was furnished.</p>
               <p>So that now tradition and authority being the chief evidence, it will rest the chief object of enquiry: even from the universality, soundness, and other strength thereof, for reason to lay her grounds for future certainty and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. and that, not onely in preferring the sacred Scriptures in general above the records of other religions, but also in discovery and distinction of the true Cannon thereof from other counterfeit or Apocriphal wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
               <p>For how else shall he satisfie himself, (amidst those many disputes that have been from time to time raised in the Church it self, and by the prime mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof) what books were true, and what forged (as well in the Old as in the New Testament) which for so great a part of them have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted; And, whilst some of those received have been disputed of, how shall he know that those refused, might not with more reason have been brought in in their rooms?</p>
               <p>And so again, of the particular Chapters and Texts in these books; how shall he finde any assurance, that, amidst those many Heresies that have from time to time gotten such strength in the Church, some of them have not been corrupted to serve their turns? Which, happening but to some, will cause all to be suspected: for, unless those places could be distinguished, it may (for ought I know) happen to be that Book, or place of Scripture which I am most to relye upon. In which doubts, Scripture alone cannot satisfie me. For (besides that nothing can be an evidence to it self) if one book should undertake for attesting the rest, that book must still want his attestation: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible to be higher, or other to us, that stand so far removed from evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the miracles brought to confirm it, then is our confidence of the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and sincerity of the tradition; or those several hands and conveyances, by which the record and report hereof hath come unto our hand. On which if we will not altogether implicitly rest, and take the truth of our religion on the hazard of our Births and education, we must then (as in a matter of so great weight and concern) make use of that stock of reason and discourse God hath blessed us withall, to discover and direct us in the way we are to go. Which, when done with humble petition for divine assistance, it usually follows that the same grace of ingenuity, that made us thus able to reach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ordinary, is usually accompanied with ability thus prudentially to be advised. That since the light of nature and reason discover to them a deity, and also a necessity of his worship; although herein they can settle themselves on no demonstration; yet, for satisfaction of their fears and hopes (which in Atheism could never be) they shall finde it more reasonable to rest on the highest probability they can get, then have no rest at all.</p>
               <p>Nor can this prudent course be yet left off. For, unless we will be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implicite in our beliefs, and rest wholly on education for the sense and meaning of these Scriptures, our reason againe must be taken up; to unfold and distinguish the truth of the texts themselves. For when (as Christians) we are fully brought to consent unto, and credit the Books and parts of the Bible, we become now as much amazed and dazled with too great light, as with too great darkness confounded before. For with too much familiarity and presumption, daring to approach too boldly those glorious rayes, (instead
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55976:124"/>
of true discovery, such cloudiness and mists have arisen in some understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that their owne conceipts have been believed for divine; and, instead of the direct beam of truth, the reflected and refracted beam of ignorance and opinion have been embraced. For as he that looks against the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some spectacle for his sight, doth both miss his discovery there, and also weaken his sight for other things; so fares it with men, when, scorning to take in natural helps, or the spectacle of reason and sense, they usually (instead of truth and satisfaction) reap nothing but opinion and error. And this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause experience tells us, that from it self alone no evidence can be had of its meaning. And therefore, to discover the rectitude or inequallity of opinions thence arising, rhere must be still some such rule made use of, as may direct us in our inquiry. For example, when we finde that all Christians do believe, and relye upon the guidance and authority of the Bible; and that yet; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the prejudice, before mentioned) that there is no Schisme or Heresie, but is thence derived, and endeavoured to be proved, what course by me, that am a lover of peace and truth, should be taken? For, do I alleadge that no doctrine but what is proved by Scripture ought to be believed; so much they confess also that oppose me: and, for satisfaction that they really thinke so, are ready to attest it with their lives. Tell I them farther, that upon more strict search of the Scripture, and comparing one place with another they may be convinced; they will answer, that, <q>As they beleive the whole Scripture to be Canonical, so have they examined it all over, and still find no reason but to believe as they do.</q> And why that part, or those Texts of Scripture on which they ground their opinion should be otherwise, or by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places interpreted; must be as distasteful to their understanding, as it is different from former apprehension and education: because more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments being not to be brought by any, it must be expected that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome and familiarity have made their entertainment both pleasant and fixed.</p>
               <p>All which well considered, &amp; the contemplation thereof compared to those sad effects of blood and war, under which not onely whole mankind labours (through distinct religions) but of those more fierce and uncivil slaughters and contentions, wherewith Christians themselves are so continually and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously carryed to mutual destruction, it cannot but abate much of that perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriness which men usually take to themselves in phancying the truth of their owne tenents and doctrines, and in condemning and punishing that of others. It must methinks move the heart of any that hath at all any true intention of being a Disciple to the God of peace, or of love to his brother, to begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine somewhat better the ground of this his impetuous and bloody devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and (if a Christian) to fear least that prophesie of his Saviour of <hi>killing men under colour of doing God good service,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 16.2.</note> may not light on his score to act; when, at any time, he is too hastily provoked. Let men take heed of phancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their merciful redeemer, (like a Heathen Saturn) to be pleased or appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the sacrifice of humane blood: Nor let too much self-conceitedness provoke fiery zeal to the perpetration of such actions, as lead to the overthrow of Charity and his neighbours peace. For since height of belief and perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conscience, can be (of themselves) no sure evidence of the goodness of a religious cause, (which can have but one truth amongst so many pretended ones) they had need be wary in relying thereupon: and careful that in their works they deny not him they so headily would serve; nor do not transgress plain commands to obey obscure ones. For since the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during

of persecution must also testifie, that those his Christian Brethren he now afflicts, are also confident of their own right serving the same Master, the persecuters must thereby become guilty of doing otherwise then they would be done unto, both in relation to this their joynt Master that thus makes them brethren, and to those their brethren and fellow members whom they ought not thus to judge, but <hi>leave to stand or fal to their own Master:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note> and whom Rom. 14.4. they would be loath should get, and make such use of advantages over them.</p>
               <p>In consideration of all which, there are that think that none should be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or molested in the peaceable use of his conscience: for they find, that after all those heaps of blood &amp; slaughter shed over all Christendom, in design and pretence to promote Christs sole truth, and bring men to agreement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that this truth is still as far from attaining farther certainty and evidence as it was before; and that the stock of division is but hereby exasperated, and not at all allayed.</p>
               <p>To amend, and put a stop to which inconveniencies and mischiefes, all such as will put themselves into the number of the <hi>blessed peacemakers</hi> will find no readier way, then seriously to consider (as we have endeavoured to shew in our past discourses) that since faith and charity are to be the foundations of our religion, and we, to our utmost, to serve God in both; it must also follow, that we are to perform them with more or less zeal and order, as we find the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their precepts more or less evident. And therefore since in matters of faith (either concerning the full comprehension of deity, and also of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worship) things have been but sparingly and darkly delivered, we are to presume that no farther speculation and discovery is necessary for us herein then what God hath been pleased to impart: who could have manifested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to general conviction if he had thought it fit. But since, in this and in the manner of his worship, he hath already done so fully as will serve for mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of his will, and so far as to bring us to salvation, what need we search farther?</p>
               <p>It will therefore be necessary for them that would avoid the danger of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmness and neglect of Gods service, on the one hand, and also the peril of breach of charity (through blind zeal) on the other, to make a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things fundamental and what is not. The first he shall find (in order to his salvation) so plainly taught and delivered, that <hi>he that runs may read</hi>: and to those things onely (as of immediate divine authority) are we to give such firm assent, as not onely to <hi>Obey God rather then men,</hi> but also,<note place="margin">Act. 5.26.

                  <hi>Though an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven preach unto us other doctrine, we are not to believe him.</hi> But, in the other things not so neccessary, as we find them more darkly delivered and not fully cleared by God himself, so have they their appointed Gods and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters here amongst us: unto whom we are <hi>to be obedient as to those that watch for our souls.</hi> In the first case, (that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> in the fundamentals of our faith it behoves us to be explicite and epress: for in that sence, <hi>He that is not for Christ is against him</hi>: whereas, in the other,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.30.</note> we are to serve Christ by our impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite obedience to his <hi>Church, the pillar and ground of truth:</hi> and, in that sence it is, that <hi>he that is not against him is for him.</hi>

               <p>But if he do not observe these, and other inducements to moderation and charity, he will be very subject to persecute Christ in his members, while he is about to serve and vindicate him in his truth.

For pretend men what they will of the equity and justice of their cause, (whilst they are in private prosecution of one another for religion) it can never be half so certain that herein they maintain that truth and doctrine which was by Christ delivered to be believed, as that they transgress that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of brotherly love commanded to be practised.

For to us men, that cannot intuitively behold his face and live, and so, out of rapture of his express excellence, glorifie him with immediate Halelujahs; our approach to him must be by his back-parts, his Image in our brother: and our praise of him here (if at all) must be by such light and works before men, that, moveing them as men here, <hi>They may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon glorifie God which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At first, there was no distinction of such as were to honour God before men from others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom we might (thereupon) call by the separate name of a Church: but, whilst mankind was thin, the Church was as large as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind it self. But that encreasing, the Nation of the Jewes were particularly chosen from the rest, to have his name more eminently put and worshipped: and amongst, and unto them, for the preservation of his more immediate service and honour he appoints a particular law to be written and observed, Whereupon, that sign of Circumcision that served for a mark to distinguish them from others, as being the pledge of their promised obedience, took on it the name of Covenant; to wit, the Covenant of works. Not that God was not still (worthily) the only true object of the praises of all mankind; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as his former precepts and our natural ability, had been so forgotten and insufficient, that Idolatry and oppression had now (in a manner) wholly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55976:125"/>
supplanted his worship and mutual charity, (except in that single family of <hi>Abraham)</hi> it seemed necessary; that, as well an increase of direction should be given, for increase of his service, as an appropriation thereof to some select people; for its better intention and security for the future.</p>
               <p>By this means, the race of <hi>Abraham</hi> come at once to receive the reward of their Father constancy in Gods service, (in regard of many promised bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings by them received) and also, (by having the <hi>Oracles of God committed unto them</hi>) they come to be a means for Gods honour to be more encreased;<note place="margin">Rom. 3 2.</note> even by being here, as by a select Church or company of men, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently served. For, from hence he might, through the observation of the whole world, have his name more hallowed, and have greater glory given and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him then before.</p>
               <p>Not that the common Salvation of man was lessened, by this more express care of his owne glory, but rather encreased. For, as the Jewes had open advantage by encrease of light, so other Nations had the same light of reason continued to them as before: with this advantage, that if they were diligent there with to examine those precepts delivered to the Jewes, they could not but discover (as we formerly noted in the Decalogue) great benefit by using them themselves. And since we find no other reward or punishment, then temporal, annexed to legal obedience or default, (for works as works cannot deserve higher) and since those vailes of Rites and Ceremonies were so thick, that it was neer as hard for the Jewes expresly to discern Christ by faith through them, as for the rest of the world to difference him by the light of reason, I cannot but charitably presume,<note place="margin">John. 7.20.</note> that <hi>the great preserver of men</hi> might finde a way for the saving m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ny of them, worshiping the same God; though not under that notion of <hi>the God of Abraham.</hi> For as the having of Circumcision did not save all that had it, so neither the want of it, did of it self destroy: but as those which were without the law of <hi>Moses, were a law unto themselves,</hi> by the law of reason, so it follows,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> that at this law of reason (proceeding from the same God) was unequally broken or kept, mens punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or rewards (no doubt) succeeded. Nor shall I ever make my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Sardinapilus</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> should be alike in their future reckonings for punishment, being not to be supposed equally culpable in the breach of charity, the end of the law; although they might equally miss heaven, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally incredulous.</p>
               <p>Yet, as we said, untill the law was given, whereby another way of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for mens honouring of God, and sociable abearance to one another did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, the restrictive name of a Church could not be applyed to one Nation or part of mankind more then another. For although the closer observation of the first light and way given to <hi>Adam</hi> and other of the Fathers might make some of them more truly called <hi>the sons of God</hi> then others, as the truer and more sincere worship of those of Judah, above those of Israel, might do the like; yet, as long as these Israelites did still make their acknowledgements to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the same law and rule of Circumcision with the other, it was not their Calves nor other failings could hinder them from being of the Catholique Church; no more then could the corruptions of the sons of <hi>Adam, the son of God,</hi> hinder men from being equally his seed,<note place="margin">Luk. 3.38.</note> and members of the visible Church: even after that their multiplication commerce one with another had caused pride, and covetousness, (the two daughters of humane frailty) to make <hi>the whole earth to be filled with violence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.11.</note> and so to be equally punished
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55976:126"/>
by the Flood: or then <hi>Noahs</hi> particular justice, and closer walking with God, above any other, could, at the same time, shut out all but himself from being of the same visible Church also. Mens general acknowledgement of the same way of divine guidance, as proceeding from God the Creator (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the time that unto <hi>Moses</hi> he was distinguished under the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the God of <hi>Abraham</hi>) making all of them equally of the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> although, by their deeds there after, they might differently be of the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although God might in mercy accept of that ready literal obedience in the Iew, and also of that substantial obedience in the Gentile; and, albeit the law of <hi>Moses</hi> or reason, were not exactly kept by either, might impute Christs satisfaction unto them, and so receive them into the merit of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, (as well as <hi>Job</hi> and other of the Patriachs) yet, unto us that now live, after the time that this Saviour hath been by miracles proved to have been and appeared in the flesh, as there can nothing save us but actual belief and profession (especially where it may be had) so, (where this profession of Christ is,) nothing can hinder the party from being a member of his body the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; nor the Church (hereupon) to admit him into her fellowship by the dore of Baptisme. Which Sacrament, being by the Church given to us as a seal of the performance of Gods gracious promises on our behalf, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Covenant also; and particularly the Covenant of Grace: and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause salvation comes to us by free gift, and not by performance of any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive outward law of God, as to the Iewes it did.</p>
               <p>Nor yet stand we now obliged (with the Gentile) to the observation of the whole law of nature: for although the precepts of <hi>Love the Lord withall thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> be positively set down in holy Writ, (because the general insufficiency of that portion of reason which is committed unto men, could not ordinarily otherwise discover so much) yet they are as natural as creation and providence it self; even as upholding the same. For, (as heretofore declared in the particular of man) each one, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, being obliged to do all things to the preservation and advantage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because even thereby Gods praise and glory is preserved and encreased, by the preserving and benefiting one another; it followed that, in whatsoever the least thing we neglected, or thwarted our duty of acting herein, we were so far culpable against the law of reason; which was, and alwayes is divine; both as being part of Gods inexhaustable fountain, and ayming also at the same end, the continuance and furtherance of his creation and providence.</p>
               <p>But because in <hi>Adam</hi> we had taken the morality of actions upon our owne score, the portion of humane wisdome which would have sufficed to guide us as natural Agents in implicite obedience, was not now sufficient to steer us unblamable in all things whatsoever, (no, though we should be most intent upon it) but that God and our Neighbour might have been better serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore God, to the <hi>Jew,</hi> abreviates this Universal strict rule to some set precepts; which, being observed, he makes his Covenant to accept of, for performance of the whole Moral law, or law of natural reason.

by, and the very knowledge of these precepts being in the absence of the Lawmaker difficult also, it pleased God, to us Christians, to make <hi>his Kingdom</hi> to be chiefly <hi>inward,</hi> and accept of the will for the deed: and the litteral exact performance being done by a Saviour in our stead, we are accepted, (not for doing all we should, but) for having done what we can. So that, by belief and adhesion in, and to him, and doing what he commands, we come by, and through him, to be accepted, as having done all that he did.</p>
               <p>And thereupon, we, that (in respect of breach of Gods precepts) were enemies and rebells to him, and so could not be received into that Kingdome of his which was designed for innocent mankind; came, through faith, to be made so much on with Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>(who hath taken our nature upon him</hi>) as to be accepted by God, as actual performers of the whole law.

For, under the condition of absolute necessity to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we have even as few precepts laid upon us under this second <hi>Adam,</hi> as there were from God, in Paradise, laid on the first: but that, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Christ by faith, and, in all our outward deportments to our Neighbours, walking according to Christian light and obedience, we should be as unblameable and innocent now, as then. For as <hi>Adam,</hi> while guided by the light of nature onely, had his duty and innocence measured by obedience to that one outward law, so we again, having no other direct outward precept from God or Christ himself, are through faith, and by our ready obedience to him, actually performed to his Church in his stead, (as having the word of reconciliation committed unto them) acquitted in all we do:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20.</note> but if done otherwise, we forfeit thereby the whole condition; and, as again obliged and culpable for the breach of the whole law, nothing but read mission into the Covenant of Innonency, by repentance; can secure us from damnation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of each particular Church and its power.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto spoken of the Reason and Foundation of the Church in general, and of the necessity of our participation of her communion: so now again it will be necessary, to speak of each particular Church and its juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For since we cannot otherwise attain to be members of this Catholick body, then as being first members of some particular Church, it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that as the necessary observation of the law of providence, which we could not explicitely and perfectly do upon our owne abilities, was the cause <hi>Christ became obedient to God for us; that we might be made the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in him</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> so there lies upon each member a duty of conformity and obedience to their particular Churches, that thereby, being <hi>made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the image of his Son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 8.29. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Cor. 4.4.</note> they may also be restored to <hi>the image of God.</hi> And therefore although the Catholick Church cannot be aggregate, or represented der any single head or rule but of Christ himself, yet since it is integrated, and (by parts) made up of particular Churches; and, in these, Christs power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be represented by other Christs or anointeds under him; it will follow that our obedience to this Church and the head thereof, must have of us, all that obedience which unto the other we cannot give; else would that precept of obedience to the Church come to nothing: as indeed (for the most part) is intended by such as would have the Writers of their owne mind to be held for the Catholick Church onely.</p>
               <p>Therefore now, being to consider the Christian Church as an assembly of Believers, separate from other for Gods more immediate honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we cannot well appropriate this phrase to that part of the Catholick which is past and unconversant with men, nor (for the present) to that part of it which is yet to suceeed: although, both the one, and the other, have done, or are to do their personal parts herein: but must interpret that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> (used either when those duties are in general given which are fit for the Church to observe in obedience to Christ, or when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine given for her members to observe to her) to intend that part of Christs body which shall be successively militant on earth: to whom alone, these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions can be necessary and useful in both kinds.</p>
               <p>But then again, as this general duly of praising God before men can onely be performed by the visible Church, because she hath onely power and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity therein; yet since this power, here on earth, is subsistant by the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate jurisdiction of those particular Churches which constitute her Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick body, and she can in no other sence be termed Catholick, with reference to any other head then of Christ himself; it must be therefore granted, that all those precepts for general obedience to the Church, must be meant of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church in particular: as having onely use of jurisdiction to this purpose. And as having besides (according to the several inclinations of their owne people, and the known affections of those of the world amongst whom they live) the best and onely ability to know and command what is fittest to be done for advancing Gods glory, according to the exigence of their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55976:127"/>
which otherwise, in the strange mixture of Christianity with other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons throughout the world, were not possible to be comprised under one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or equal rule; or to be known and executed, by one single persons power.</p>
               <p>And that the Church and civil jurisdiction of each place signifie the same, and that by obedience to the Church, obedience to the particular Church is ment, will appear by that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. where controversies are, (if not decideable by umperage) to <hi>be told to the Church.</hi> Under which name must be comprehended the present particular authority of that place, because else how shall they go to it? And it must be the civil as well as ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical authority also (as having them conjoined) because it determines particular personal injuries; where brother offends against brother, and one servant takes another <hi>by the throate, saying pay what thou owest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.28.</note> as the parable denotes. But the conclusion is, that the supream jurisdiction whilst it is Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian) is the very Church we are to submit unto: <hi>And those that will not hear the Church, are to be unto us as Heathens and Publicans:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 17.</note> that is such as have renounced Christ, by this their renoucing the Image of his authority, the Christian Church: whose definition and power, be the thing of never so civil nature, makes the breach of it a sin; as, on the contrary, our obedience to them acquits us of guilt. For it is from Christ they have this power, that, <hi>Whatsoever is bound on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven; and whatsoever they shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So that Christ having now <hi>blotted out that hand writing of Iewish Ordinances which was against us,</hi> and released them from their litteral strictness,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> to the extent of rational and natural laws; and having also answered to God for the large morallity of the whole rule of providence, (leaving Christians at large in all things wherein their reason or Christian precept is not transgressed) and lastly, having left the charge for custody and enforcing these Christian precepts to every Christian Church, (who are thereupon to answer to him for the faults of the people) the advantage that Christians have of living in a state of innocence, is unquestionable and immoveable, while they contiune o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient.</p>
               <p>And therefore Christs Gospel might well be called <hi>Glad tytings</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> and we may find that our Saviour made his general encouragement to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him and his doctrine, <hi>because his yoke was easy, and his burthen light,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that when he came in particlar to be asked what it was, he answered,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.30.</note> in one command for both Tables, <hi>thou shalt love,</hi> &amp;c. including, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of love to God and our Neighbour, <hi>all the law and the Prophets</hi>; that is, all things of faith and charity, or of faith and obedience, which is charities support.</p>
               <p>First, for our faith and its fundamental object, <hi>life eternal is to know God, and Iesus whom he hath sent:</hi> he is <hi>the way the truth and the life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 17.3. John 14.6. Heb. 12.2. John 3.36.</note> 
                  <hi>the Authour and finisher of our faith: on whom whosoever believeth hath everlasting life, and on him that believeth not the wrath of God abideth.</hi> Which one article, comes therefore to be eminently necessary, because it is the onely foundation: <hi>for other foundation then this can no man lay</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> and this foundation every man must lay, or else all the faith, and obedience to be framed thereupon will come to nothing. For although their be other articles (as depending on this, and incident to our Christian profession) which ought to be believed also, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as all things by God proposed as truths are) yet to add them as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55976:128"/>
necessary to salvation, it is to Christ and Christian faith as high derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to add circumcision or other observations as necessary to salvation in our Christian obedience.</p>
               <p>And as for our obedience outward, we are freed from those many rites, ceremonies and observations of the Jewes, which God in particular favour of the Jewish Nation had appointed: most of them being but shadows of Christ himself, and of that great and plain way which by the Gospel should be revealed. Nay the very judicial part, though instituted by God himself for that government, bindes us not as positive laws, but as useful presidents upon like occasion: that is to say, where their and our causes were alike: which is not binding as such or such laws, formerly made and authorised by God, but as parts of the general law of reason. For as unto them God was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate lawgiver, and, being given before Kings, was both God and King; so was the litteral observation of them in both respects necessary; that is, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and as civil duties also. For both were the same to them; because God at that time undertaking the managery of the Civil as well as Ecclesiastical Estate, made both one then, no otherwise then his remitting both to the Prince makes both of one sort now: that is, under the same chief relation to duty and obedience, namely that of conscience.</p>
               <p>But because of Gods express undertaking herein, to them it was <hi>do this and live:</hi>

               <p>All which in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is plainly signified: where God is brought in, speaking of the difference of the Jewish, and Christian Covenant and obedience, (according to the many Prophesies to that purpose) and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt</hi>: that is, not like as it was whilst I gave them particular precepts for all their outward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.9.</note> and did lead them in all their affairs my self, as if I should have taken them by the hand. But this course God now changeth <hi>because they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not saith the Lord:</hi> that is, because I found humane frailty so great,<note place="margin">ibid.</note> that these litterall commands could not be kept; therefore now; <hi>I will put my laws into their minde, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.

                  <hi>and every man his brother, saying know the Lord; for all shall know me even from the least to the greatest</hi>: that is, <hi>by the love of God, shed abroad in our hearts, all shall be taught of God,</hi> and by his Spirit led into all fundamental and saving truth: so that by <hi>being all

But, for our direction outward therein, <hi>we are not come unto a mount that might not be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that burned with fire nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempests</hi>; (that is,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.18.</note> to hear them from such a mountain which was made inaccessible through these terrible apparitions that accompanied Gods presence thereon) <hi>and the sound of a Trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the word should not be spoken to them any more, for they could not endure that which was commanded.</hi> That is, neither are we now to be terrified,<note place="margin">Heb. 12 19, 20</note> as by hearing God speaking with his owne voice to our outward ears: but we (for our outward direction) <hi>are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly Jurusalem: and to an innumerable company of Angels</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">verse 22.</note> to the present Church militant, and to such as do therein instruct us as Gods Messengers by their Angelical doctrine.

               </p>
               <p>And these Gospel duties of love and obedience,<note place="margin">verse 24.</note> we shall find to be the verry errand also of him that was to conclude <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> and to be Christs forerunner: as it is most fully, (though mystically) expressed by the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> and also by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> in their descriptions of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist his office and message. The first of these duties is couched in these words; <hi>He shall turn the hearts of the Father to the Children</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.6. Luk. 1.17.</note> he shall prepare them to entertain the loving of one another, in as high degree as the Father doth his Child.</p>
               <p>And then, secondly, for performance of the duty of obedience (whereby to make this love to be advantagious) it is added by <hi>Malachy,</hi> and <hi>the heart of the children to their Fathers</hi>: the which Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> expounding to mean the <hi>disobedient to the wisdome of the just,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 1.17.</note> doth plainly shew that the <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel of peace</hi>;<note place="margin">ibid.</note> and the way to <hi>make ready a people prepared for the Lord,</hi> was by bringing them into such a state of humility and obedience, as that they should give unto their superiours (endued with power over them from the <hi>just One</hi>) the same indisputable respect as Children did to their own Fathers: and so, (like obedient children) trust to them for the exposition of <hi>the Law of Moses, and the former statutes and judgements.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mala. 4 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This pronoune <hi>their</hi> being restrictively added to <hi>Fathers</hi> in the clause for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, whereas the pronoune <hi>the</hi> is added to <hi>Fathers</hi> in the other, will again shew us how large our love should be, and not at all exclusive: whereas our obedience is to be to our own heads or fathers.</p>
               <p>So that now, by means of Christs taking on him the kingly office under the Gospel, and so by his Church and deputies therein, affording us both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and persons continually accessible, we may say of his Kingly office in like manner as was said of his taking the Priestly office upon him; namely, that (as <hi>we have a high Priest that may be touched with our infirmities,</hi> so) we have a kingship also from him the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> whereby (as from persons knowing and sensible of our want) we may be continually supplyed (<hi>after a new and</hi>

                  <hi>living way</hi>) both with ghostly and temporal directions, by the grace, and power of him who hath uniued thesese two offices, and is (<hi>after the order of Melchisedec</hi>) King both of righteousness and peace.</p>
               <p>Upon which ground, we may find a ready reason for our Saviours speech; that, <hi>God had given him authority to execute judgement, because he is the son of man:</hi> meaning that as God had made his recess under the Law (before mentioned) in compassion of mans weakness,<note place="margin">

               <p>Whereupon it must now follow, that as a medicine doth not work by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by being applyed; and that as Gods new Covenant of inward grace, is to be made effectual by our outward obedience; so must now our condition of innocence, and fulfilling of the law by the precepts of love, be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then onely subsistent, when we act with, or not contrary to such as are by God and Christ entrusted, with the custody and direction of these precepts; and have power to command us accordingly. And although God himself rule not in us now by Tables of Stone, so much as formerly, but <hi>by the flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tables of our hearts</hi>; yet since these are still ruling by them in his stead, our obedience to them is necessary,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3</note> and <hi>acceptable in the sight of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>

For since I may obey but in what my self likes, or is for mine owne ends; or I may give obedience onely <hi>for fear of wrath,</hi> I am also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to submit my self; that is, to do it for conscience sake to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as one that is in duty subjected unto it. And to cut off that usual cavil against obedience to Christian authority, namely the hazard of our souls; we are here told that they are the watchmen of our souls, and that they must give accompt thereof. And this office of watching our souls, they shall then perform with joy, and not with grief; when we shall readily yeild them this our bounden obedience and submission; and consider with our selves how profitable this subjection is unto us; even for securing our souls, and estating us innocent.</p>
               <p>And least any shold think this admonition reach to civil duties onely, and not to directions for, and in matters of faith; the Apostle, in the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did before bid them <hi>remember them that have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</hi> That is, since the end of their imployment and rule overus, was that we might <hi>lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honestly</hi>:

or to be directed by them in matters pertaining to godliness as well as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, we are therefore to follow their faith in delivery of the meaning of the Scripture, as we have already followed their authority in receiving it as the word of God.</p>
               <p>And again, to take off the objection of personal defect and errour, which might be made to defeat obedience to some men in lawful authority, let our Saviour himself be heard: <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees</hi> (saith he) <hi>sit in Moses seat, all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 23.2, 3.</note> Where we may find, by the words <hi>all, and whatsoever,</hi> the generallity of our obedience to the persons in <hi>Moses</hi> seat; or seat of supream and just authority. Against which, if any exception or suspition of errour was to have been a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, Christ would never have so enjoyned it; as supposing the Scribes and Pharisees put into that seat: a people which he well knew to be in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars erronious. But yet however, whilst they sat in <hi>Moses</hi> seat, that is (as from, and under God) acknowledged and taught the fundamentals of the law, so long were their disciples secured in a state of innocence by obedience: no otherwise then Christians are, by obedience to those that are over them in Christs seat in the Church.</p>
               <p>Undeniably clear to this purpose is Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians: Do all things without murmurings and disputings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye may be blameless and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the sons of God, without rebuke, in a crooked and perverse Nation, amongst whom ye shine as lights in the world: holding forth the word of life,</hi>

                  <hi>that I may rejoyce in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</hi> In which words, he shews what is to hold forth, or make use of the word of life: namely, to do all things without murmurings and disputings. For this obedience to Gods vicegerents, will not onely make the persons themselves blameless, or to be the sons of God; but will also redound to God and his Gospels glory: when men (like the <hi>Philippians</hi> amongst the rebellions Greeks) shall shine by exemplary submission to authority, as lights in the world; or as directors to humane preservations and peace. And it will cause them that have this guide over them, to do it (as aforesaid with joy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ALthough those that would disturbe the peace of Kingdomes by setting up an Universal Monarch in Church affaires, and they that would set up the whole Clergy uncontrolable to govern in each Kingdome, after a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratique fashion, are both of them dissalowably out of what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken; yet for mens better information, we will hear speak more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of both. The first I conceive cannot be at all, both for the reasons before given in the discourse of the Church, and because it is that particular prerogative which Christ hath reserved to himself,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> of <hi>being with them</hi> as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick head <hi>to the end of the world.</hi> And as in particular Kingdomes and parts thereof, Christ presides by special deputies, as King of Kings; even so, upon the same reason of Universal jurisction and care, he is to take the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate charge of the whole unto himself.</p>
               <p>In which regard, as there should be <hi>no man called Father on earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.9.</note> or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monarch of the whole earth or mandkind (in derogation to Gods prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Vniversal <hi>Kingdome, power and glory</hi>) so are not the heads of any particular Church, to transcend their Apostolical pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.8.</note> In which words Father and Master in the singler number as we may note one person in supream authority to be meant, so will they serve to explain unto us who is meant and entended, when in so many places we are bidden to obey in all things, under these notions of Father and Master: namely, that it is that our particular Master or Father, who hath now as supream authority over us in his own territory and jurisdiction, as the former Masters and Fathers had in their families: who were then the onely persons that could be Vniversally <hi>obeyed in all things</hi>; because they were then the onely proper denominations of such as were in supream autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as Christians, Apostles, Patriarchs, Bishops, and the like, being not Officers to continue in supream authority as such; nor being so continually nor Vniversally resident, as to be able to determine all differences: nay they may be conceived included in the injunction too; because they exercised their present power in a patriarchal right and way, as shall be hereafter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So that, in regard of this injunction to obedience under the notion of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Christian Church had resemblance with the Jewish also: for their laws and commandments, being given by God before they were at that heigt as to be fitted to enjoy that statute officer, who should as a constant publick Father command amongst them, they had likewise their precept for obedience and respect, couched under the notion of Father too in the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: within the generality thereof, including as well such temporary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick officers as should immediately command, as that future setled officer of King, prophetically designed to be over them in both Churches,</p>
               <p>Now as these Fathers and Masters had, and have entire jurisdiction in their
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55976:131"/>
families and Kingdomes, because these could have but one head in chief; so must it be granted that since there can be but one Church, (that is to say Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick) because Christ can have but one body, and that body again but one head; that therefore proportionably, as any other authority and head shall come between Christ and this body, so much will the separation and disunion of him with his body be encreased. For to represent Christ in the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, is not so much to represent him as head, as to be head in his room</p>
               <p>And in abatement of this ambitious humour, is our Saviours reply to be construed which he made to the Children of <hi>Zebedee</hi>; who would have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended their Apostolical rank of parity, and have been (alone) sitting above their fellow heads of Churches, at <hi>the right and left hand of Christ.</hi> For if their suit had been but for equality, they needed not to ask it: nor do I see why any of the rest should have been so angry at it.<note place="margin">Mat. 20.20, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </note> But to answer these, it was that our Saviour sayes, that those that had highest abilities in close and holy following of him, might expect a reward or Crown in heaven for it: but they were not after the manner of the Gentiles, <hi>to exercise domini-over one another</hi> here. The like are we to conceive of that example of washing his Disciples feet,<note place="margin">John 13.</note> and many other places; where he purposely gives directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and precepts against this ayme of Vniversal Government: of most of which, we shall have occasion to speak in discourses following.</p>
               <p>As for the other Government by an independent consistory of the Clergy, it must to all unbiassed judgements appear unreasonable: for since (as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) they are included in the general jurisdiction and authority of each king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; so, for order and peace sake, they should by the same authority be subject to their diocessans; as they again are to be to the Prince, the head of that particular Church. Where by the word <hi>Church,</hi> is meant that assembly of Christian Believers, which is divided from others by an entire jurisdiction of their owne, and do thereupon come to be called this or that Church.

               <p>As God hath power, and will have glory alone; so it is necessary, in the constitution of those things in which he will have his glory more eminently to abide, that he have his power making and stateing them to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably and particularly manifest. Thus, in the Creation, that was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all things else, he acts alone; and so much alone, that his very word was the deed. In that particular designation of a Church (for his glory to be more eminent amongst men) that the honour of doing might be more his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:55976:131"/>
owne, he did first make use of the weakest means in humane reason for the foundation and establishment thereof.</p>
               <p>In the first Church, amongst the Jews, and whilst they were in their weak and wandering condition, (as their need was greater, so) his personal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and guidance of them was more express and apparent. And therefore, whilst they were in this Theocraty, their government was not to be managed by any setled Vniversal authority besides himself; or any one who took not, in all weighty things, immediate direction from him; least the eminence of his owne glory should be hereby abated: but they were to continue in their wonted obedience to the natural fathers of their families and tribes, until such time as being throughly setled in peace and security from their enemies, he might make his recess; and according to his former promises, permit and appoint them a King of their owne Nation. Who, as standing in his stead and authority now, and being entrusted with the future preservation and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that which God had so carefully brought to perfection; there was the same reason why he should have remarkable eminence and authority then; as why he should not at all have it before.</p>
               <p>The same course we may see taken, in the founding of the Christian Church also: for they, during the time of their owne persecution, were (as their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness required) in a Theocraty too; that is to say, guided by the express di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Saviour himself, given to his Apostles during the time he was on earth: and particularly, as being <hi>conversant with them for the space of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes, and speaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.3.</note> And in those things wherein his direction was wanting, <hi>they were to wait for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Father: even the promise of the holy Ghost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>who should lead them into all truth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh 16.13</note> Thereby came those spiritual Guides and Priests of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church to be sometime called Ministers and Pastors;<note place="margin">In the Saxon Tongue Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in French Prestre; even so Petroseli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num is by the Dutch called Peterselly, and by us persly.</note> but commonly Presbyter (from which the Dutch word Priester, and our English word Priest are derived, being a notion in the sence of antiquity importing) Seniority juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power; whereby they coming to be enabled (notwithstanding the weakness of the instruments and means) to bring that Church to its flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pitch and condition; the mean estate of the Churches owne officer did redound to the undeniable glory of that God, who did so manifestly appear in their assistance.</p>
               <p>So that Gods dealing in matters of Government, between the Jewish and Christian Church seems in every respect alike; save that, with the Jews, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of Eldership went by birth, according to the course of nature; but here, by election of the members of the Church. For they being the adopted sons of God through Christ, the particular Priests and Fathers that were to govern in this Church, were to be at this Churches election and choice also: or rather of its representative head Christs deputy. For so are we to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words to Titus, <hi>For this cause left I thee Crete,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting: and ordain Elders in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as I had appointed thee.</hi> And those Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Tytus</hi> (men that by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had been put into authority) will plainly declare, that (as themselves, so) others had also different power one over another, as in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Churches government.</p>
               <p>The office and power of this Elder, was in it self distinct from that of the preacher: as was formerly that of the Father of the Tribe, from that of the Priest, although for sometime added and involved under the notion of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55976:132"/>
in the same person that primarily had his authority for instruction sake; even as before the priesthood was divided, it was by patriarchal right exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the same father of the family. So that now, these Presbyters having, (during the time Magistrates were not Christian) power of civil judicature in what concerned men estates, as well as of external duties concerning them as Christians; it came to pass, where they might exercise this their rightful jurisdiction,<note place="margin">Cor. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Brother was not to go to law with Brother before the unbelievers.</hi> And when we find those eminent persons (called Apostles) directing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of external obedience, they do it as Elders or Fathers: which power and office was unto them annexed, as in right of their offices as heads of Churches:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.1.</note> for so saith Saint <hi>Peter he was also an Elder.</hi> And again many of <hi>these Elders did labour in the word and doctrine,</hi> and were therefore more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>worthy of the double honour, which was due unto an Elder that ruled well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.17.</note>But then, as the Apostles had in themselves, (as Christs deputies) this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of jurisdiction and power, both for preaching and ruling (although in the last sort the present power of Heathen Magistrates did almost wholly restrain them) so they did also often dispence unto the same persons, the same joynt jurisdiction in both sorts also: and that, in regard of the paucity of eminent and able persons to undertake them singly. Upon which reason, we come (in these dayes) to be so much puzled, to distinguish these primitive officers by their names and titles; finding them promiscuoisly in the Scripture set down: as sometime making Apostle and Elder to signifie the same: sometime Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and Deacons:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.1. 2 John 1. 1 Cor. 3.5, 2 Cor. 3.6. Acts 21.8.</note> and sometimes again we finde the calling of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist mingled with that of the Deacon. The which obscurity was also occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in that these Apostles and higher Officers were for want of Ministers under them, forced many times to act in those more subordinate imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and sometimes also those at first put into lower stations did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what did belong to functions above them. Which being by some now adayes not well considered, or being careless and ignorant of the originals of names and their true derivation, they would appropriate the notion of Elder or Presbyter to the Lay ruler onely, and wholly abandon the English word Priest, derived (as we said) from Presbyter, as implying sacrifice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have no English word derived from <hi>Sacerdos</hi>; which might properly denote a sacrificer; therefore this notion of Priest must be laid aside, and the word Minister taken in. Not duely marking how they thereby fall into that which they would avoid, whilst they call those of the Gospel by the legal name. For the Hebrew stiles those of the Law <hi>Cohanim,</hi> originally signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Minister; and thence comes the Greeek words <hi>Coneo</hi> and <hi>Diaconeo</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with <hi>Minister</hi> in Latin, and Deacon in English. They do also hereby abusively and absurdly put him under his owne congregation and charge; as sometimes calling him their Minister, no otherwise then as <hi>Josuah</hi> was called <hi>Moses Minister</hi>: as if the Pastor (for so they sometimes rightly enough call him) could be called a servant to the sheep: but they shall never finde them called Ministers or servants, but in relation to God or Christ, or the whole Church. And they also do hereby confound those Officers they would distinguish. For that inferiour Officer by them called a Deacon, is by name but the same with Minister, whom they would seem to place higher: as if by way of tautology they should call them Minister and Minister.</p>
               <p>But be they of what sort they will, evident enough it is, they were still at
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55976:132"/>
the appointment, and subordinate to the Apostles, or other heads in chief: who now as Christs deputies, were equally presiding for the guidance and rule of several Churches, distinct in authority from one another. The which may be concluded as we said, from many passages set down in the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>: who being by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> put in as Bishops or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scers over other Pastours, are in and by these Epistles, taught from him the chief head: and for what was not in them taught, they were to be guided by Apostolical tradition: <hi>the things which thou hast heard of me among many witnesses</hi> (that is, my avowed life and doctrine) <hi>the same commit thou unto faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.2.</note> Herein are all the several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of subordination briefly stated: the people are to be Subject and to learn of their owne Pastors and Elders: these to be subject to their Bishops; and the Bishops to their owne head in chief.</p>
               <p>And by that expression the <hi>things which thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,</hi> &amp;c. we may know how to expound our Saviours restriction given concerning our obedience to them that sit in the seat of authority, when he saith <hi>but do not as they do</hi>:<note place="margin">Mat. 23.23.</note> meaning that Rulers will sometimes do otherwise then they teach, or will publickly avow.</p>
               <p>Now, as this greater number of persons in separate jurisdiction, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated for want of civil entire power to make any one Churches jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of large extent; so it fitted best that persecuted condition of the Church: that is, to accommodate them in having of one guide in chief, to rule each Church in all their dispersions. And as the meanness of these rulers was then best agreeable to that their present condition, so was it advantagious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: because eminence in authority would have made them, (as more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so) more obnoxious to be oppressed and destroyed, by those Heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, amongst whom they lived: as would also their publick congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Churches have done the like.</p>
               <p>But now, after the time God hath perfected his work of the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and free establishment in peace and rest from all about her; after the time of his prophesie is fulfilled by appointing <hi>Kings her nursing fathers, and Queens her Nurses,</hi> and of the Church her <hi>having sons to be set as Princes in all lands</hi> (so that now under <hi>Constantine</hi> (as formerly under <hi>Solomon</hi>) the upper Roomes and wandering Tabernacles are converted into stately Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) for men to think of running into their wilderness and persecuted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again,<note place="margin">Esay 49.23. Psal. 45.16.</note> (by entertainment of those temporary forms which unto that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were most fit) seems to me to import both ingratitude and murmur against God; as also imprudence to themselves.</p>
               <p>And those that shall well compare those Prophesies that set out the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches happy and flourishing condition, with that which <hi>Moses</hi> made to the Jewes of having Kings when their afflicted condition should cease, will finde the same reason and practice for both; although neither Iewes nor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, had by <hi>Moses,</hi> or Christ, direct precept for doing either: no more then <hi>Moses</hi> gave direction for building a Temple, or Christ or his Apostles for erecting Churches. But these things being supposed to follow (as out of duty of gratitude) that flourishing estate God should bring them unto, are less mentioned then that future succession of Kings: concluding (as we may gather) that it would follow upon it: as both <hi>Solomons,</hi> and <hi>Constantines</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (before mentioned) so well declare.</p>
               <p>But (in this regard) we shall finde God Almighty observing the same
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55976:133"/>
method, in bringing the whole Church to its state of eminence and freedome from the bondage of forraign enemies, as he doth in bringing each one of its members from the thraldome of sin and the Flesh: that is, both in the time of their birth and afterwards, leading them through wildernesses and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; to wean them from the former relishes of their <hi>Onyons and Flesh. pots, and to prove them whether they be fit for that promised land and state of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>;<note place="margin">Deut. 8.1, 2, 3. Heb. 12.11.</note> or for <hi>that peace and joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> which is requisite to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Unto which state being once arrived, through the Almighty assistance of him that can do all things, and (proportionable to the greatness and splendor of the Church) having raised them up a more eminent officer for their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for men now to be affecting of Elderships, Presbyteries, and what other former temporary models they please to phancy, (in presumption that God must thereupon (as before) more immediately appear (as by miracles, guift of tongues, prophesie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) because of the weakness of those his present Ministers, seems to me none other then that temptation of the Devil offered to our Saviour, of casting himself down headlong; and so ingratefully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that ordinary way of safety he was now in, on presumption of Gods miraculous delivery. It seems to me none other, then as if the Israelites in the land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, should be asking Quailes and Manna, or the pillar of a Cloud; their former food, and way of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And lastly, these that will distrust Gods guidance, if he manifest it not after their owne way, seem to me closly resembling <hi>those sons of Belial</hi> also, that at the Israelites institution of Kingship, were ingratefully asking <hi>how shall this man save us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.27.</note> But they that are of the number of the repiners, murmurers, and complainers amongst us, should remember <hi>Solomons</hi> advice: <hi>say not thou in thy heart, what is the reason that the former times were better then these; for thou dost not enquire rightly concerning this:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 7.10. Chap. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>for he hath made every thing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in its time: so that a man cannot say that this is better then that, for in their season they are all excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And more excellent and honourable no doubt it is, and more redounding to the glory of God; that having promised to bring his Church to a flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, (so as to be eminent in the world for its owne strength and greatness) he should in such measure do it as that it should be now able to subsist by it self (according to the ordinary way of providence common to other Nations) then to be alwayes extraordinarily holding them by the hand himself: as thereby confessing he could not, or had not as yet made good his engagement.</p>
               <p>But, as concerning worldly splendour and greatness, it may be observed that the same degrees of different appearance have risen in the lustre of Christs deputies, by reason of his farther recess from extraordinary assistance and presence with them, as there is in the difference of the Moons shining, by reason of her distance from the Sun, her fountain of light also. For although those primitive heads, might in themselves be nearer and fuller partakers of Christs gracious and powerful influence, even as the Moon in her nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Sun is the like; yet was the radiation and light thereof, then most gloriously and apparently beneficial to the Churches present direction and guidance, when shewed unto us by a compleat lustraction of that body in our present view.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:55976:133"/>Nay this promise of kingship, (to be for compleating the blessing to a land) is worthy the observation of all these Antichrists that would seat themselves <hi>above all that is called God</hi>:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.4.</note> insomuch as (to the undeniable evidence of the divine institution of that office) we may observe that no one people have ever been at their perfection without them; nor none at the height of their distress till they were removed. According to that prophesie of the Jews desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; namely that before it should be, <hi>the land should be forsaken of both her Kings</hi>: the having them being in it self as sure a signe of Gods blessing,<note place="margin">Isai. 7.16.</note> as the want is of his anger to any people.</p>
               <p>And however some are ready, in the flourishing instances of some Polar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, to frame arguments for the lawfulness of those governments, yet can neither those examples equal for number or eminence, those of Monarchies and Kingdomes: nor can the prosperity or success of some rebellion in some people, (even so far as to be in some worldly security and happiness) conclude for their lawfulness: more then Gods premission of sinners of other sorts, (to prosper and go unpunished here) can prove for their vindication in iniquity. And therefore although God seems sometimes slacker in bringing on his threatned punishments upon some people upon their kings removall, yet that this removeall is a threatning of punishment may farther appear by <hi>Hosea</hi>; who, thrice in one chapter, threatens <hi>Israels</hi> calamity by that sign: <hi>for now they shall they say we have no King, for we feared not the Lord, and what then should a King do to us</hi>? and again <hi>the King of Samaria is destroyed like the foam upon the water</hi>; and againe,<note place="margin">Hosea 10.3.

               </p>
               <p>Nay we may observe this Monarchical administration so much owned by God, as to declare the absence thereof as the fittest and surest token of his dereliction and punishment of a people that had been first false to himself, and were now repudiated by him: as may appear in that other Prophesie. <hi>For the Children of Israel shall abide many dayes without a King and without a Prince, without a Sacrifice, and without an Image, and without an Ephod, and without Teraphim.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Hosea 3.4.</note> by the last words we may observe (by the way) not onely a depravation in religion and Church order to follow this no King in Israel, by making use of Teraphim in the Ephod, instead of Urim, <hi>as the man Michah did</hi>; but this disorder should increase,<note place="margin">Judg. 17.5.

For this use of Teraphim amongst Israelites was to bee looked upon but as a shift in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who wanting that order of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, made use of the meanest of the people: but in the Christian Church, and when Christ, typified in <hi>David, shall be their King,</hi> then also shall those several Kings under him maintain and settle order amongst the Priesthood and in religion it self as <hi>David</hi> also did.</p>
               <p>Now, concerning that separate jurisdiction which some Church-men would claim, under colour of dividing our duties into religious and civil, it cannot I conceive but plainly appear, that (notwithstanding sacred pretence) this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is but of humane invention, being not to be found in the Scripture: and, as it is (for the most part) made of no other use but to make division and discord (by abating our obedience to the Magistrate under colour of giving it to God,) so are men not at agreement in stating thereof. For while some think that whatever the Magistrate commands it but of civil obedience, and so lyable to temporal reward and punishment onely; and again, what
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55976:134"/>
is of Gods command (that is expresly set down in Scripture) is to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed out of conscience of divine authority; and then, leaving men to private judgement what precepts are thence deduceable, or when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates commands be such, they must consequently leave them no certain rule, whereby, either to preserve duty, or unity. As also those other sort do, who, distinguishing men in their several relations by them phancied, say that in whatever we do as subjects and men linked in Society, the same is of civil cognizance and duty; but in whatever we act as Christians, we are to be guided by precept from God alone. In which doing also, being neither able to bring from Scripture all things that concern Gods outward worship, and finding many precepts of Ethical, Political, and Oeconomical nature, and which do concern our duty and good even as men, although we had not been Christians, they must needs fall themselves, and drive others, by these doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full precepts, from giving any right obedience at all, instead of directing them therein. For although (as to some intents) men may be usefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in these different relations, yet when the same person is now both a man and a Christian, such distinctions as should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imply a possibility of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal devision again, so as for the same Christian to act as a man in any thing without being a Christian, must (besides absurdity) bring upon us the many inconveniences of rebellion and civil war.</p>
               <p>And therefore, although in our being Christian, we lose not the reality of manhood, more then in being rational creatures or men, we lose the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of sensitive Creatures: yet inasmuch as being rational Creatures, and so having a greater and surer light to direct our actions, all that we do answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to other meer sensitives, is therefore now to be attributed to us in the capacity of men, as of the nobler and higher relation. Even so also it fareth with us, after, and while we are Christians: namely that all those actions, in which, in execution and direction (I mean so far as is humane) we resemble other meer natural men onely, yet these things, being by us now acted under the inseparable relation of Christians, are, although not of express litteral divine precept, yet, if done in obedience to lawful authority, a Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or, if acted against it, a Christian fault. And it will follow that what was in us (as men) before, but moral vertue or vice, is now righteousness or sin; even to the degree of an idle word. And so again (considering us as subjects) those things that are onely by the light of nature investigable as civil duties, when they come to be enforced by a Superiour, having his power and office from God, have the obligations of religious actions: as being part of our obedience to that God, who said them to be in that respect <hi>Gods also, and children of the most high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Psa 82.6.</note>Therefore when God sometimes commands what would concern us and be our benefit as men, although we had not been Christians, (as indeed if we had reason enough all precepts for outward direction would appear such) or when (again) many things appertaining to our religion it self, and our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship therein, are by the Churches authority enjoyned; (whether the same be found in Scripture or no) they are both of them to be held as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious dutyes to us: and we being not able, while we are Christians, to act in any other personal capacity, must be obedient and subject, as in, <hi>and to the Lord</hi>:<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.5. Col 3.23.</note> that is, till something be enjoyned to overthorw Christianity, we as Christians, must <hi>obey in all things</hi>: and it is as sinful to disobey Supream au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55976:134"/>
in the payment of taxes, as in the observation of the Sabboth. For God not now giving particular precepts as unto the Iewes, but leaving us herein to the direction of the higher power ordained for that purpose of him, we are to be obedient to our <hi>Masters in the flesh as unto Christ, and willingly to do them service as unto the Lord, and not as men</hi>: That is, we are now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to obey him as Christs Minister and head of our particular Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.6, 7·</note> and not left at liberty to obey as in a religious tye, no farther then we please. For the actions and precepts of each State &amp; Kingdom, are upon their conversion to Christianity, to be called and reputed the actings of such or such a Church, and not of such or such a State: the name and notion of Church including that of State, even as (in the particular members whereof it is compounded) the notion of man is involved in that of Christian.</p>
               <p>So that now, as the entire trust &amp; power of Vniversal headship of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is unto Christ resigned, and he thereupon to be obeyed as under a religious tye in all causes whatsoever, by all such as acknowledge themselves Christians; although they seem of never so civil a nature: even so, his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream deputy in each Christian Church or Kingdome, being entirely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted like him from whom his power is derived) is under the tye of religion also, to be entirely obeyed by all that acknowledg his Christian jurisdiction: we being no more duely able to divide the supremacy of the one, then of the other.</p>
               <p>And therfore, the mistake and inconvenience of their opinion will plainly appear, that would from a short and groundless distinction, of the several objects and ends of our obedience, deduce a several and distinct tye, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the same person in the performance of this duty to lawful authority should stand diversly obliged: As if, because the good of men and humane Society were the next ayme of my forbearance to defraud or oppress, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it were therefore the last end, and not rather Gods glory, as heretofore shewed.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, since I, as a Christian, had light sufficient given me to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how God is herein served, by this my advancement of the good of my brother, cannot thereupon but account my self as well serving God. When I do any thing as a subject to the Prince, out of general tye of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to Gods precept that commandeth obedience to the <hi>higher powers,</hi> then it is, or should have been, if I had done it in obedience to the perticular precepts of <hi>thou shalt not steal,</hi> or <hi>thou shalt not covet.</hi> And had <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> had the like advantage of instruction with us, so as to have seen through to Gods glory and their owne salvation, as the great and last end and reward of all our actions, (as they had been obliged in conscience, so) they would (no doubt) out of respect and love to God and their owne future good, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all those Heroick acts, which, for want thereof, could not have in them higher consideration then temporary benefits of themselves or country; and so come to be imputed unto them as bare moral vertues and duties, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their conceipts, neither direction nor intention higher.</p>
               <p>But for farther clearing the understanding of these things, we will instance in a particular most common amongst us, namely our food. What the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative appetite (as necessary to growth and nourishment) doth herein covet, the same being in sensitive Creatures controlled and judged by their pallats and tasts, is ascribed as an action done by such or such a sensitive. And, in the same food again, the pallat being for choice and quantity (as all other senses) controlable by reason, for what we do therein, we are accountable as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55976:135"/>
men onely, and not as beasts. And so lastly, when, in this particular of food, a higher authority then our owne doth command, we must be then reckoned in all we do therein, but as in relation, and subordinate to that last and highest authority. For as Christ is above them all, so is our relation as Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to include and involve that of men or subjects. So that if I now follow too much my vegetative appetite, or sensative taste; and also transgress reason, so as to be drunken and glutonise; this, being done by me that am a Christian, is a sin endangering punishment hereafter; and not singly a moral or civil vice; as transgressing onely in regard to my health, or the rule of society.</p>
               <p>And so farther againe, when abstinence from any, or all sort of food is by lawful authority enjoyned, whereby the use of what was indifferent to us (in respect of any direct former Christian precept) comes to be streigthened, we are then tyed in conscience to the obedience thereof: and that, not onely when a Lent or Fast day shall be enjoyned for an explicite religious end, but also, when abstinence shall be publickly commanded, without such end ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed at all: or although the preservation of Cattel or the like, be the known end thereof. And this, because the person commanding being the same, and alwayes Gods Minister, where our ability of performance is equall, our sin of disobedience must be equal also: and that, without thought of dividing his jurisdiction and authority, and so disobeying the Prince as as oft as we please, by taking on us (as Priests in a separat jurisdiction) the sole interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods law.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, as every Master of a family is Priest also so far as concerns his jurisdiction, so the appellations of Princes and Priests are in many places of Scripture used as equipollent. But as the King, in regard of the multitude under him, is to use Magistrates to help him in civil administrations, so Priests also, in matters of the Church and religion. How far this their power is to extend, and how, and by what order of them to be managed, will be a proper discourse when the Kings part in government and peace shall be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
               <p>Therefore now (to return) by the name of Church we are not to conceive there can be any congregation of Christian subjects by order so distnct from others, as to have immediat power from God over the fortunes or persons of their fellows; without, or against the Soveraigns leave. For since the time, manner, place, and other things essential to the constituting the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self must (as heretofore noted) depend on the leave and direction of the governour in chief, and their authority, as an assembly, can be but subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to that from whence they derived it, it cannot in no wise be collected, that their power should be independent.</p>
               <p>They of the Romish Clergy, that would clayme a divine right to succeed the Apostles, in the exercise of external jurisdiction and power, by vertue of an uninterrupted ordination from them at first derived, (after the same manner as those ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were superstitious to place the vestal virgins for keeping in of their holy fire in their temple,) and would have the Office and power of high Priest or Bishop, in the Catholike, or each particular Church, depend on like uninterrupted succession to his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor under the Gospel, no otherwise then the high Priestship did descend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Jewes, had (no doubt) an ayme, by this peculiar way of puting one another into authority, not only to set up themselves in Apostolical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but to exclude Kings or Masters of families from having any divine right
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55976:135"/>
at all; since no such uninterrupted derivation of succession, can be on their side brought. But as they cannot find any text to warrant any claim hereby, so they are to consider, that as to the Iewes their particular Church was the same with the Catholike, so in order to Gods care for direction and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that particular onely Church, he did appoint, as well a distinct fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and linage for their Kingship, as he did for their Priesthood: it being as unlawful to alter the line of <hi>David,</hi> as that of Aaron. But, under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where like appointment was not made, nor outward prosperity was not promised, as to the Jewes, it will be very severe, to censure any particular Church as untrue, and her Pastors unlawful, upon the hazard of having some interruption in succession; or for want of intention or the like: whereby (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had some ineffectual ordination administred) all ordinations succeeding, and jurisdiction grounded thereupon, should come to be void also.</p>
               <p>However, before the time that the Magistrate was Christian, the claim of immediate succession or possession were a good plea in it self, and fit to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by others, to avoide the danger of Schism, as it was also then reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable enough, that in consideration the Bishop in each place was also supream head of the same under Christ; that thereupon the designation or ordination of persons into offices of power might be at his dispose too, yet since, even then this his own ordination or choice, and appointment into office was done by the people; and in the same form whereby they constituted other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, it will thereupon appear but reasonable, that as this power to govern, was by them then executed, not as Evangelists barely, but as the present su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Christian heads, so should it be afterwards resigned to him that did succeed as supream, in causes Ecclesiastical as well as Civil. And as their ordination, that is, personal succession and appointment into these functions of power (not their consecrations) doth (or should) depend on his choice or negative voice, as it did formerly on the people and Emperours, it cannot be now thought reasonable they should claime any outward independent juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, over the liberties or estates of others.</p>
               <p>By due consideration whereof we may know how to distinguish between those several ordintions of power and Office, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> admonisheth <hi>Timothy</hi> to make use of. For by that which in his first Epistle to him is set down as a <hi>gift given by Prophesie, with the laying on of the hands of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>: we may understand, that more civil election and ordination,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> whereby those Presbyters or Elders, the representative authority of that Church had (it may be at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> recommendation) chosen him as their chief guide or instructor, even because of that eminent guift of Prophesie or instruction they found in him, into which Office we may suppose him afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and also consecrared by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which he calls the gift of God, <hi>which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> For those places and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being but partly Christians as yet, whereby Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and other primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christian heads could not have entire jurisdiction; it was reasonable, even for the better obedience sake of those that did believe, to submit the election of their Church guide, to that very form they used in the choice of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magistrates. And as in these last alledged Texts, we finde both electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and consecration set down in that phrase proper to Priestly administration onely, namely <hi>laying on of hands</hi>; so shall we elsewhere finde them both at once comprised under the expression proper to election of other Magistrates, signifying <hi>holding up of hands</hi> called there <hi>ordaining.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 14.23.</note> The which Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial

way of choice continued still in the Church, after the time that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Kings were Christian; but not as at first, for then, these Presbyters did it as Rulers and Representatives of those places, some of them being Preachers, and some not: whereas afterwads, when whole Cities became Christians, those of the chief of the Clergy of each diocess or jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took upon them to make these elections, as the Chapiter of that place: but it was still done, or supposed to be, according to recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or licence of that Prince or Emperour that had supream power over them all. And however at first, before the people of any place or City were wholly converted, so as the jurisdiction could be entire under one Church head, they might well be distinguished under the notions of Church and state, as each might be under a separate authority; yet when, and where these power shall be united, then, and there all election and jurisdiction, in the one sort as well as the other, must be held dependant on this one supream Church head.</p>
               <p>If we suppose those of the Clergy, to be successors to Apostolical power by vertue of ordination received from the hands of one another (as by a kinde of confederacy) then, since the efficacy of ordination is the same to all of them, there must be now amongst us as many men in Apostolical power, as there are men in orders: because ordination having its efficacy as primarily inherent in the Apostles, it must follow that all those derived ordinations must be equal one to another, even as that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rst act of ordination from the Apostles received, was the same, or equal to it self.</p>
               <p>But, of those that would set up an Vniversal Pope, and of those that would set up a Pope (by this means) in every Parish, I would ask how far they would have their jurisdiction to extend? If they say they have right to all the Apostles had, then have they right to command and be obeyed in all things: for such right had the Apostles, as shall be shewed anon. If they say they have right to no more them was by then practised, and so claime to succeed in the power of excommunication and Church censure, so far as to extend it to corporal punishment, then they will have much ado to make this all one with a spiritual jurisdiction and censure.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that we must look on the Apostles in their sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as punishing men in the highest measure they then could; in regard of the engrosment of all coercive and vindicative power, by the then Pagan Magistrates they lived under; and not as thinking their refraining to keep a <hi>Blasphemer</hi> or an <hi>incestuous person company,</hi> were a punishment adequate to such offences,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19, 20 1 Cor. 5.</note> as by their hainousness and nature, did argue already no regard to their society. And again, this act of excommunication, was not then to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him from them, but themselves from him: For, as they could not force any to be of their society, or come to their meetings, so (as the case stood then) could not they force them from coming to any their publike meetings as well as others; even when they were to celebrate the communion, although they might <hi>forbear to eat</hi> whilst he was in the company.</p>
               <p>So that now, if the Church-men claime but the same measure of power the Apostles did, or might then exercise, and (againe) allow the person now excommunicate the like power with the other, they will then finde the force and terrour of their excommunication (as from themselves alone proceeding, and without leave and assistance from the Magistrate) to amount to just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If they claime all the jurisdiction and power that the Apostles as heads of Churches then had right unto, they will have right to all power
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55976:136"/>
whatever, that is power outward and civil, as well as inward and spiritual. For, of that nature we shall finde many things, that were taken into cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance by those primitive heads, and so lyable also to the censure and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magistrates and civil laws of the Countrey, as was that Incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act; and would, no doubt, upon notice, have been by them that had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent power punished in a more remarkable and sensible degree, then could be by the Apostles that wanted it. Whereupon, as we finde Saint <hi>Paul</hi> compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>Fornication, Covetousness, Railing, Drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>Extortion,</hi> under the then Church cognisance and censure, as well as <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5:11.</note> it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the power and jurisdiction of each Churches present head, was Vniversal and absolute, as of right in it self, to judge and punish in civil, as well as spiritual causes, Christ having then no Church head but them: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in matter of execution, he were (as before noted) many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained. Upon which consideration, we cannot any wayes assigne the now Gospel Ministers, to be successours to the Apostles or primitive Bishops in what they did as the then heads of Churches, but must appropriate that to Kingly right, as shall be more fully declared hereafter.</p>
               <p>All which, no doubt, (with some other things elsewhere spoken) will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please some of that order. For although self interest (as highest) may make them differ about precedence amongst themselves, yet to have their order eclipsed in any thing of honour or power, cannot but displease: because even self interest, though not so direct, is yet plainly therein also. And therefore, since Church-men are usually the best learned, and commonly the onely Writers of Church matters, and of State affairs also as often as any other: it is no marvil, if in so long a tract of time, so many arguments and contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for deviding the Kings, and establishing their separate authority, have been craftily laid by some, and as hastily entertained by others, in order to the making them more powerful.</p>
               <p>Amongst other things, it may be observed how pride and arrogance hath brought those notions of Laicks and Ideots, which were brought in by them whereby to be distinguished from other subjects, to import rudeness, ignorance, and inferiority: when as, by means of their greater learning and favour, divers priviledges and immunities were reserved to themselves. The which (God knows) I dislike not otherwise, then as finding it made destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to publike peace and good. For it is an order, which of all other should (I conceive) have the highest rank and esteem amongst Subjects: even for that their imployment is in such matters, as are apparently in themselves, and by publick approbation and appointment, held of most immediate concern in Gods worship and service amongst us: and is (in many things) of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is not by others undertakable.</p>
               <p>In which regard (truly) as much grieved I am, to finde that present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and proportionable want of eminence and esteem given them, in those places where Monarchy hath been ecclipsed or thrust out, (even by bringing them thereby so much lower as there followes to be more above them) as I am offended, at the extraordinary height, and success of their Antichristian pride, where some inseparable marks of Monarchy and government are held in their owne hands.</p>
               <p>But, however their success proves, it will concern men that would be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful of their salvation, and <hi>followers of things that make for peace,</hi>

And if self conceitedness could thus blinde our Saviours owne Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, so far as to lead them to this rash mistake, and that notwithstanding known miracles and profession made in Christs name, what may we expect from the ambitious aims of men now living; but that <hi>this following of us,</hi> should be continually made (as too good experience tells us it is) the dayly bait to draw us farther from Christ, under pretence of bringing us nearer? So that whilst some are declaiming against authority, and branding their commands as superstitious, even in things wherein Christs honour and worship are neerly concerned, they are yet found so resolute in their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sects and tenents, that they would have mens belief and adherence to Christ, to be measured onely by their belief and adherence to them: which, to my thinking, is as high and plain Idolatry as any can be.</p>
               <p>But the immediate following discourse of that text, shews the temper and ayme of this humor: when those very Disciples are endeavouring to wrest <hi>Eliahs</hi> president, by drawing fire from heaven against that authority which opposed them: the which although they were of another religion and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction too, is yet rebuked by our Saviour; as proceeding from a most ungos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-like spirit: and shewing him <hi>to be subject to like passions with others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, for the true stating of these things, we shall more briefly say, that so far as they are to perform the work of Evangelists, that is, to preach unto us Jesus, and to prove and declare him to be the only fundamental object of faith and salvation, so far have they their power from God alone: but so far as they have diocessan or parochial charge, and are in paticulars to shew unto us how we are to obey him as Christ and King in any outward deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so far are they to derive their authority from that Church power which had from Crhist power to ordain and separate them unto that work. So far as they are entrusted with the guidance of Gods inward kingdom in our hearts, that is, to perswade men to faith in Christ (which was the chief work of the primitive teachers amongst the Infidels) so far are they Gods Ministers and not mans, but, as they are to meddle with mens abbearances and external behaviour in Christs Kingdome the Church (that is to shew how to perform obedience to him being converted and acknowledging his power) so far are they to have warrant from those his chief deputies in the Church.</p>
               <p>Whereupon two things will plainly follow to the advantage of the Clergy above others. First, that, in respect of their ordination, they are to be held so properly Gods Ministers, that, in preaching and administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and some other things, none but they have power to intermeddle:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55976:137"/>
and yet are they not hereby excluded from having external jurisdiction and power over mens persons also, if the authority of the Church wherein they live shall so think fit. Nay, when the representative authority of that Church shall have distinguished between holy and prophane, I conceive that, in all such things as are concluded of religious jurisdiction and cognisance, the Church-members of the Clergy are, by the Church her head, to be therein imployed more eminently then any other subject: especially if they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in acknowledge themselves subordinate and subject unto him. All which I have in this part set down, to avoid such umbrage as might have been by some taken at the passed discourse.</p>
               <p>And for farther avoidance of mistake, about those persons or orders of the Clergy by me gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ced at in any censure here or elsewhere, I shall also now crave leave to say, that, as I profess my self a dutiful son of the same Mother, so do I also highly respect and honour that Classical order of the Clergy which the Church of <hi>Engand</hi> owns as hers: being men that have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved themselves the true sons of <hi>Zadock,</hi> the type of Evangelical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and been as eminent for loyalty as learning. But, the disturbances of Christendome are to be imputed to those of the Romish party, who, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to their owne head, are to subject (with <hi>Abiather</hi>) to miscary that arke wherewith they are entrusted; and to make the power and cognisance of those sacred orders, which should separate them from worldly imploment, to serve as a plea and pretence thereunto; as in order to spiritual cognisance and jurisdiction. As also, to that miscellaneous brood, who, as in hatred to their exteram, entring their ordinations at a wrong dore, or not entring them at all, have as shamefully demeaned theselves in the Priesthood, as they did ignorantly and shamefully decline the title it self, and that honotr which is thereunto due: and have, by those strange fires of sedition and rebellion which they every where offer, under shew of reformation and zeal, approved themselves the true sons of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu.</hi> These are they that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are declaiming against Prelacy, on purpose to gain higher preferment: whilst the name of Bishop is by them declined as an unlawful jurisdiction in in the Church, they are grasping after the thing, and striving to exercise E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Episcopacy and oversight over both Church and State, under the claim of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer from Christ himself received, as his immediate Ministers: thereby shewing, that their slighting of orders is but because they would not be by them confined to Ecclesiastical superintendency onely.</p>

               <p>FRom what hath been hitherto spoken of our Security whilst retaining the fundamentalls of our religion, as men may gather courage to resist such superstitious fears as some would put into them on purpose to draw them to their owne sects, so may they plainly see it their duty (these foundations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid) that their directest obedience which they can (as Christians) in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things give unto that person Christ hath most eminently entrusted, and by whom he is most lively represented, is the strongest argument of performance of their duty and obedience to himself.</p>
               <p>For he being (as the chief <hi>Master builder</hi>) to direct us in all things towards our actual edification, upon these ground works of faith and charity laid in our hearts, may seem to be Gods great accomptant for the sins of the people, and to prefigured unto us under the scape goat in the law: who, as denoting the high and uncontroleable power of his office here, was both to be free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molested in the wilderness of this life, and also <hi>to bear on him all the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and transgression of the people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 16.21.</note> For although Christ himself, (typifyed under the slain goat) do onely truly and meritoriously expiate and make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to God for all mens sins as breaches of Gods law (insomuch as no man can hope for remission of any sort of them without repentance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness in his name made and obtained) yet forasmuch as we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be obedient unto them, both in matters of godliness and honesty, there is no doubt, but the same will acquit us of guilt in all things acted by their guidance: and not contrary to the foundation of faith and love: which is, or should be in our hearts.</p>
               <p>And therefore to this purpose, (as formerly noted) we shall find good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant given from him that said, <hi>Do all things without murmurings and disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>

               <p>And that the Apostle did hereby entend implicite and perfect obedience, may farther appear by the foregoing occasion which lead him to this precept: namely for avoiding of divisions, and <hi>Standing fast in one Spirit, with one mind:</hi> unto the which, implicite obedience and subjection to one head is the onely ready way.

               <p>And that this was meant in regard of power of government intrusted, and that also of that particular deligation of power and trust made to the higher powers in the Church, appears by the occasion of its delivery: having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the foregoing parable and admonition: where the Church, under the notion of the house of Christ (its Lord) is to be carefully watched by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent overseer put in authority by Christ: from whom these Stewards are to expect their reward or punishment, according to their behaviour in this charge.</p>
               <p>Where (by the way) we may note, the Monarchical designation of each Churches government; because the Steward or Master of the house, is still set downe and alluded unto in the singular number.

               <p>And so again, for the other part of the New Testament, namely the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; we are not to conceive that all that was written by the Apostles or such as had inspiration, is now left unto us: for of some of them there appears nothing at all, and of some very little. Nay, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that wrot most, we may think yet wrot more then is come to our hands: even as he had more gentile Churches in his charge, then what his Epistles do mention by their directions and titles. All which (no doubt) would have been divine and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying also, as well as those that are come; had not want of care in those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, or the calamitous condition of those times deprived us of them.</p>
               <p>But now, however we are to acknowledge and admire, the care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God and the Church, in preserving and delivering to us those books and Epistles left; yet, in and by them, we may observe, that they were all but occasionally written: and that no Writer did undertake to set down the whole platform of Christian obedience; or to compose an entire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body of Divinity, but in delivery of these instructions they were still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective: and even as they had particular and separate charge of Churches, so wrote they unto them such instructions and precepts, as they conceived most fit for their proper directions. And therefore we may finde those wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not onely to differ from one another in those directions, but also Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whose Epistles we have written to several Churches, doth in them differ in his directions also; according to that exigence and occasion, which he
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55976:139"/>
foresaw the present condition of that people required.</p>
               <p>For since, at that time, all Churches could not have all his or the other Apostles Epistles (for if they could, the same things needed not at all to have been repeated) it must be supposed, that what was to them already written, was sufficient to instruct them in things necessary to salvation: and that they, in their other necessary Christian behaviours, had direction by <hi>Tradition</hi> from him, or elsewhere; which was the occasion of that frequent admonition of keeping them. And for what might be wanting in both these, he refers them to be guided by the Church, and such as had the rule over them; under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notions of <hi>whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any vertue, if there be any praise, think on these things</hi>: and this most especially he doth, to those he wrot least.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For it is likely, that they that were to be their guides, had been before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the way of Church regiment by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself; so far, as to be able (by tradition) to keep their charge upright, in all things tending to Godliness and honesty; <hi>according to those things which they had learned, and received, and heard, and seen in him.</hi> He,<note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> in remitting Churches for the rest, to be instructed by those their guides he himself had instructed, did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of our Saviour himself herein: who for that <hi>space of fourty dayes</hi> (he was on earth after his resurrection) <hi>directed his Apostles in things pertaining to the Kingdome of God,</hi> or government of the Church.<note place="margin">Acts 1.3.</note> Nor can we finde any of them undertaking, as before noted, to comprise all the particulars of Theology, at such time as they write those their most general Epistles, which were for all mens direction: but kept them (as we may presume) to be delivered to the heads of Churches (amongst other things) by tradition, and so made use of according to the emergencies of their several Charges. But yet the fundamentals of Christianity, were in all their Epistles and Sermons most plainly delivered: the least and shortest Epistle containing in it the doctrine of faith in Christ, &amp; love to one another: and also of obedience to superiours, our necessary guide in performance of them both.</p>
               <p>And that Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> directions in other matters given to the particular Churches, contained neither all expresly that was necessary for them to do, nor what was so generally fit and proper for all Churches as that to whom it was directed (being to others in most things onely usefull upon occasions as presidents) will appear, in that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing a particular short Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> refers them their knowledge of what is farther useful, unto his Epistle written unto the <hi>Laodiceans</hi>: willing them that when this Epistle is read of you. <hi>You cause it to be read of the Laodiceans also: and that you likewise read the Epistle from Laodicea,</hi> Which two Epistles,<note place="margin">Col. 4.16.</note> being reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally recommended to those particular Churches, as of proper directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for them; and the Epistle to the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> being now wanting; is must follow, that both the fundamentals were set downe in all and each of them, and that other admonitions were by the Apostles given upon several occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and considerations: which because they did as heads of Churches then themselves, so, by their making a distinction in each Church, of such as were to rule and instruct, from the rest of the Church (and that under the notion of such as should cause those Epistles to be read, and such as were to hear them read) we may also infer, that though he made the general direction of his Epistles to the whole Church, it was but to make their duty of obedience
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55976:140"/>
higher, when their guides should command them. And so also, when he is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe general heads for the particular abearance of men in each order, it is not his meaning to submit them to their private interpretation of what in them was their duty to perform as Subjects, (and so consequently leave it to their choice whether they would perform any thing of them or no) but to lay on men a stronger obligation to the obedience of their superiours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; since they now finde them to have these general divine directions to that purpose.</p>
               <p>To manifest that these duties of external Christian behaviour, were indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably referred to each Christian head of the Church, and that all in that kind necessary was not set down in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> appears in that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing more plentifully to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hereof then to any other Church, doth not yet profess to have set down all that was necessary: but having, as he conceived, set down what was expedient for them according to the present occasion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11·34.</note> he concludes, <hi>And the rest will I set in order when I come.</hi> Thereby making a plain difference, between his power in those things he was to command them as an head of the Church (in order to their duty of obedience) and those fundamentals of faith and love, which he was to preach to them as an Evangelist; or a difference in what he did as a general preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Gospel, and what he did as their Apostle and Teacher: even as one that particularly had authority over them as Christs Ambassadour, and as being their father in the Faith.</p>
               <p>And that Scripture, and the interpretation and enforcement of the precepts thereof, was committed to the guidance and care of the heads of the Churches (even under the Gospel also) appears by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> commending them unto <hi>Timothy</hi>: to the end that he, as a guide to the Church, might make them <hi>profitable for doctrine,</hi>

And that this power did belong to <hi>Timothy</hi> as their present guide, is made most evident from the uses there set down, all of them belonging to the office of the Superiour: Namely to teach, to reproove, to corect, to instruct: necessarily implying the charge of the Scriptures to be committed to those in authority that were to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently active herein: that the man of God, or the chief Officer in Gods stead (like <hi>Timothy</hi>) may <hi>know how to behave himself in the houshold of God, the Church: which is the pillar and ground of truth.</hi>

And then this searching must not be construed, as if every man had done it in a Bible apart; but they being a Synagogue of the Jewes, the Scripture must be supposed remaining with the chief thereof onely: who are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the searchers and examiners thereof. In whose search the rest of the <hi>Bereans</hi> trusting, it made the search go in the name of the whole. In effect, still prooving, that the interpretation and custody of Scripture was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; but belonged to those that were to exercise, and not such as were to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to authority.</p>
               <p>And that the Scriptures charge and custody was entrusted unto the heads
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55976:140"/>
of Churches, and not vulgarly dispersed in copies, may appear by our not having at this day, any assurance of the language some of the Gospels and Epistles were written in: nor have we any Hebrew copy that we now can relye upon. And all, because the first copy coming to be afterwards transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that language the people best understood, it caused the care of the single original to be neglected; or in time of persecution to be lost by the traditors of those times: whereas, had each one, or many men had their distinct copies, such a total losse could not have happened. And although it may be well thought, that the gift of tongues might have enabled such of the holy penmen as wanted natural learning, to deliver themselves notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in Greek, yet this cannot make it supposable that all of them (the Epistles especially) were so written originally; because their address is not to the Grecians or Gentiles: And that Epistle to the Hebrews and those of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp;c. must imply them to be written in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which was best understood by those they were addressed unto; and who were to be directed by him. Else it were to suppose a miracle wrought to a wrong end; even that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth elswhere dislike; namely the <hi>speaking in an unknown tongue</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> by which he means (no doubt) a tongue unknown to the Auditors. In which respect, to speak or write in Greek, to them that understood not the language, renders the Writer a Barbarian to the Auditor, as well as the Auditor one to him.</p>
               <p>Upon which grounds, I do believe (against them that doubt) that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> was (like the other Gospels) written in Greeks; and that because its general address did require it to be set forth in that language which was most generally understood: but for some of the Epistles, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so perswaded. And if that first exercised gift of tongues be marked, we shall finde those endewed therewith, speaking to every Auditour in his owne language. And although question be made, whether those auditours of divers nations, might not at the same time have been endewed with the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous gift of interpreting and understanding a strange tongue (to avoyd a greater difficulty of supposing all of them speaking at once, or any one speaking several tongues at once (the which Saint <hi>Peters</hi> after-speaking alone may give countenance unto) yet it will plainly appear, that,<note place="margin">Act. 2.14.</note> as that gift of tongues was then used to edification and to be understood, even so afterwards (no doubt) the penmen of holy Scripture made use of the same, upon the like useful occasions, and none other.</p>
               <p>And as for Authors quotation of Scripture texts in this language onely, (none beginning to write till these books had been by the Church all collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one volume, and so put into that one most intelligible language) it proves no more their writing at first in the Greek, then our Saviours and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers quotations of the Greek translation of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> proves the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament to have been written in that language also.</p>
               <p>Not that we would be understood (by what hath bin spoken) as forbidding the publike knowledg of the Scriptures: for even the same reason that makes them chiefly to be trusted to the Church and its head, namly to know the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to govern all others under them, will, in that regard also, make them useful to Fathers, Masters, and many of the Subjects themselves: who by their offices and callings, shall have things or persons under their power and government. In both which respects, if they come not occasionally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern every one, as he may have his Neighbors good or ill under his trust and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55976:141"/>
power, (even in cases remitted by his Superiour) yet will they concern every one in their general precepts to patience, humility, obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which (as the proper and necessary vertues of Subjects, and which must constitute go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) are fit for the notice of all in general; without exception of the Prince himself: who, as, under the power of God almighty, must submit in a far higher degree, then his Subjects can to him.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of which, and other necessary duties, fit to direct us in our charitable abearances, whither in acting upon, or suffering from one another, may also afford sufficient reason why there should be many precepts of all sorts of duties, and concerning all sorts of people, promiscuously set down in the New Testament; notwithstanding that Gods immediate rule was to be inward: even for that our Saviour and his Apostles, having charge and guidance of souls under them, it was needful (for their good deportment sake) that they should leave to them, and unto such as should succeed in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches, (besides the fundamentals) such farther precepts and directions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s might keep them in a steady course of Charity and peace one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; when they found their duties set forth by so good authority.</p>
               <p>For want of due regard whereof, and of that different respect which the Scriptures do carry in their instructions, and for want of that necessary and truly Christian grace of humility, instead of learning and practicing those more proper duties which concern us in our distinct callings and relations (for which onely we stand accomptable before God) we are through pride and partiality too often found to be studious and inquisitive after so much onely as doth concern others, in theirs even such as are above us; for whose faults we are not to answer, that (thereupon) we may appear more fit to teach then be taught, to govern then be governed. And this is not onely practised in the more civil relation of Subjects or Servants against their Prince or Master, but through this misused liberty, a general usurpation is almost every where now made, for interpreting Scripture against the sence and authority of the whole Church, and of our more spiritual guides therein, to whose charge they are most particularly entrusted; from which preposterous proceeding what can be expected, but what sad experience doth witness, even Heresie, Schisme, disorder, and civil broyles, to the scandal of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it self.</p>
               <p>But now, when we finde, the persons in authority to be expressed in the plural number, as <hi>Those that have the guide over you, those that must give an account for your souls,</hi> &amp;c. or else our obedience directed to the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; we are to understand thereby, the head of each Church to be chiefly meant. In which respect, as there were many distinct Churches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon also many heads, (as before shewed) so the Apostle might, in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral admonitions to obedience, put them in the plural number of <hi>those</hi> and <hi>them.</hi> And, as in this sence we are to understand that precept of <hi>tell it to the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> namely to the judiciary head thereof; so also are we to interpret and apply the power of the keyes, and of binding and loosing, to be given to the Churches head, and not the diffused body:<note place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> which can never in all its members meet, nor can otherwise then by their head hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>And hereupon, we shall finde this power to be expresly given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in Saint <hi>John</hi>: where Christ is saying to them, <hi>As my Father sent me, even so send I you</hi>;<note place="margin">John 20·21.</note> thereby giving them authority over their particular Churches

                  <note place="margin">John 20.23.</note> Whereupon we may collect, that as the power of the keyes is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in Christ the Churches universal head, and was by him given to the heads of Churches onely, so it can be in the whole Church or in its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate members, no otherwise then as received from their head: according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, When ye are met together and my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.4.</note> to make it farther evident that the heads of Churches are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the direction of <hi>tell it to the Church,</hi> we are to denote that the power of the keyes in the next verse, was directed to the Apostles in the word <hi>ye:</hi> when it was said, <hi>Whatsoever ye bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven</hi>; for unto them was most of this chapter directed:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.18.</note> the which was the reason of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> interoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him presently hereupon, <hi>How oft shall my brother offend?</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Verse 21.</note>

               <p>Upon which grounds, we may know what to conceive of that article of our Creed, <hi>I believe the holy Catholike Church:</hi> which some would wrest, and make use of to draw mens obedience which way they pleased, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing unto us what they pleased for Catholike doctrine. But we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that this primitive form of profession of Christian faith (therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Apostles Creed) was offered <hi>to,</hi> and taken <hi>by</hi> such as were to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Christian Church, to shew and state their beliefe before their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance; and not to direct their obedience afterwards. For, although to believe in God, in Christ, in the holy Ghost, do, together with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their deity, draw on obedience by just consequence, yet was this form of profession of faith (therefore called the Creed) made but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note their beliefe of their true existence: by which means being received into the Church, their obedience was thence to be learnt. For strange it had been, for the Church to have proposed to men the matter of obedience <hi>to</hi> any, of whom as yet they had no beliefe <hi>in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, when I profess to believe <hi>the holy Catholike Church,</hi> the word <hi>holy</hi> will make it unconceiveable how it should directly import my profession of obedience: and that, not onely because the Catholike Church or Christs universal body, cannot (as before noted) be ever comprehended under one notion and conception, so as to be definitive to me concerning their determinations, but also, because I can never rightly say of the present, or past militant Church to whom I seek for direction, that they are all holy: nor can men that live in a particular Church, be ordinarily able to know what is, and what is not Catholike doctrine, besides that which is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:55976:142"/>Whereupon understanding our belief in, or of the holy Catholike Church, to import our beliefe that Christ hath a true sanctified body, which being so made by means of the holy Ghost in the article foregoing, comes through their union in Christ and his Spirit, to be of one communion from the rest of the world; and so to be <hi>the Communion of Saints,</hi> as in the article follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>So that then, although the Creed (as a Creed) cannot of it self oblige to obedience, yet since the beliefe of the articles thereof, do by consequent bring men to Christs Church, and, out of desire to attain <hi>that Communion of Saints,</hi> doth also farther prompt me to acts of obedience to that Church to whom I made this profession; it will therefore follow, that that obedience which I cannot give to the Catholick Church, as such, must be (to this end) given to that part of it under which I live: since that I cannot otherwise obey the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, then by obeying the particular.</p>
               <p>All which will be cleared by one instance of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>: who (as the present head of that Church) gives liberty to the Corinthians in eating of <hi>things offered to Idols</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.8: Acts 15.28.</note> notwithstanding that the then Catholike representative Church at Jerusalem (and he himself amongst them) had decreed otherwise. Clearly evincing, that the power of binding and loosing, was to reside in each Churches own head; and that they were to perform their obedience to the same party by whom they had learned their Creed; who had been their spiritual father,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.15.</note> and <hi>begotten them in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that this power of the keyes, was not given to the Apostles onely as a collective body of Church heads, and so to the Catholike Church onely, but was also conferred upon the particular heads of the Churches, appears in that it was upon occasion particularly given to Saint <hi>Peter</hi>:<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19.</note> so that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever head or chief governour; should (like him) acknowledge Christ to be the true spiritual foundation and rock, he should from Christ have power also to be herein a rock to others, and to bind and loose. And both places must contradistinguish the persons binding, from those that shall be so bound; and the persons telling, and complaining to the Church, from those that are to hear and have power of redress.</p>
               <p>And as they were in one place spoken to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alone, to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst consistorial parity: so were they elsewhere given joyntly to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles (the then visible heads of Churches) to abate Popish usurpation. For they were not to be commanding one another, out of their Churches, as they might those within them; which was forbidden them in the persons of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedees</hi> Children: But in those equalities, they were (in love) <hi>to serve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>:<note place="margin">Gal. 5 13.</note> and in this their parity obeying the precept of <hi>submit your selves one to another,</hi>

to note that these things could not be spoken of Christians universally (for then received and receiving should be confounded and still the same) so to shew it could not be meant of many in each Kingdom or Church that should by us be thus received, it follows in the singular number in the fifth verse, <hi>Who so shall receive one</hi>; and so in the sixth verse, <hi>Who so shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>But because Christ himself had formerly foreseen, that our owne natural pride and lusts would ordinarily draw us, both to Antichristian disobedience against our Superiours, and unto neglect of the dutyes of love and charity to our neighbours; it was the occasion of his expressions that <hi>he came to send fire on earth, and that he came not to send peace,</hi> &amp;c. For in that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he here saith that <hi>it must needs be that offences must come</hi>; but then,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that it were better to cast from us those lusts and enticements hereunto, although they be as deer to us as our owne hands or eyes, then we should be in danger <hi>of hell, by dispising one of these little ones</hi>; who were by office,<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> to prevent and decide those offences and breaches of charity, which our lusts should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. And that, because they having charge of flockes committed unto them from Christ, <hi>who came to save that which was lost:</hi> so it was also their duty, to regard the strayings of every particular sheep in their foulds: and it came thereupon <hi>to be the will of God, that none of these little ones should parish</hi>: that is, perish by violence and insurrection.<note place="margin">Verse 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The farther proof, that these phrases of <hi>little</hi> and <hi>least,</hi> were parabolically meant of persons to be substituted in Christs power, appears in that (through all the three forementioned Evangelists) the immediate following discourses do set out unto us the plain description of some persons by Christ in that sort owned. Saint <hi>Mark</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke</hi> do it as of one that had no direct mission from him, who yet is by Christ owned, because he did his works of power in his name: and owned also according to Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> under the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression for obedience, as he had formerly set downe to the <hi>little Children, viz. whosoever shall offend,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Mar. 9:42.</note> Nay Saint <hi>Mark</hi> takes in that discourse of him that acted in Christs name and authority so, as he intermingles it with the description of these <hi>little ones</hi> as all one. And to ascertain us that by them he intended his Disciples, and his succeeding deputyes, he directs his speech of receipt to them directly: <hi>Whosoever shall give you a Cup of water to drinke in my name because ye belong to Christ, Verily I say unto you he shall not lose his reward:</hi> and <hi>whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me,</hi> &amp;c. by that means making them and these little ones all one.</p>
               <p>As for Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> he sets downe the description of the Apostles power of the keyes immediately after the discourse of these <hi>little ones</hi>: so that, by setting downe the chief mark of the power of the Churches head next, we have farther instruction that both discourses belong to the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour, in setting downe the office of the Churches heads under these notions of <hi>little ones,</hi> and <hi>little Children,</hi> and of defining their duty of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity answerable thereunto, might have allusion unto the like manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions used by his typical Father <hi>David,</hi> who was usually personated as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55976:143"/>
the Churches head: as we find it expressed in the 131 <hi>Psalm,</hi> saying, <hi>My heart is not haughty,</hi> &amp;c. and again, <hi>surely I have behaved and quieted my self as a child that is weaned of his Mother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 131.1. Verse 2.</note> 
                  <hi>my soul is even as a weaned child.</hi> And as thus he answers for his mind and inward behaviour, so is it to be noted that himself (as the Paragon king) was in his person very little: whereas his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour <hi>Saul,</hi> was not onely haughty, but also higher then others by the shoulders; and so not so fit as <hi>David,</hi> to be one of these little ones by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour spoken of. And indeed this caveat for humility, given by our Saviour to such as were to succeed as heads and guides in the Christian Church, is but the same in effect that was given in the Jewish Church to be put in practise by their Kings:<note place="margin">Deut. 17.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that his heart be not lift up above his brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although our Saviour do thus set downe obedience to the Church heads under the notion of little ones, to take off occasion of their pride; yet that he intended such persons as should be in greater charge then ordinary, appears notably by his telling us (by way of terror) of their power: namely, <hi>that in heaven their Angels do alwayes behold the face of God:</hi> that is, they have in regard of their great trust amongst us,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.10.</note> their eminent guardian Angels appointed. By which we may know how to interpret Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Angels which should be judged</hi> at the last Judgement: that is, that such of them as had been more particularly trusted with the guardianship of particular Churches,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.3.</note> should give accompt thereof to these that had formerly been heads of Churches themselves; as to the Apostles and the like.</p>
               <p>And that we were to distinguish these little ones, or the Churches rulers here spoken of, from her other members (commonly called Children, but without the addition of <hi>little</hi>) will farther appear by the observation of what was spoken of before. For unless we so construe them, I see not how that discourse can be direct, in answer to the Disciples question, of who shall be greatest, that is, whom he would make governor over the rest: which is in three places done. And although he deny them this power over one another, yet doth he not theirs, or others having it over ordinary Church-members: upon condition they must be converted from pride, and become humble and little before God.</p>
               <p>And by the word little thus received, may we interpret that speech of our Saviours concerning <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist: <hi>He that is least in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is greater then he.</hi> For as by the kingdome of heaven we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Church,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.11.</note> (because in heaven it self every one shall not be greater then he) so are we not to understand that every one here, either, should exceed in greatness him that <hi>was the greatest of those which were born of women</hi>: but because <hi>these little ones,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>or these least in the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> have (as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where shewed) received from Christ the honour and trust of binding and loosing,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> (which <hi>Iohn</hi> had not) therefore were they <hi>greater then he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so again, when Christ brings in himself speaking at the last judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he useth the like expressions: <hi>Inasmuch as ye have done it, or not done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it, or not done it unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By one of the least,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40, 45</note> we are to understand such a single person to be meant, as more eminently representing Christ, may (through obedience to him in Christs stead) make charity extensive and useful to all occasions; and not think that Christ made that charity best which was done but to any one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man: or that the particular works there mentioned were all that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But rather, that here (as elsewhere) these additions of least and little
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55976:143"/>
are added in the singular number to <hi>Children and Bret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ren,</hi> that, (together with the distinction of them from other children and brethren) he might both set forth that extraordinary humility that should be in all governours, and might also relate litterally to that mean estate of his Disciples, the Churches present governours: who being probably to be most persecuted of any other, therefore are those instances of charity brought in which become men in that condition.</p>
               <p>That these Epithetes of <hi>little</hi> and <hi>least</hi> (when added to children) do both signifie persons substituted in Christs authority, and was also given to teach humility and love (especially one toward another) will lastly appear by those passages discribed by the other Evangelist Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>: because spoken while Christ is deligating his Apostles, as is related in the 13 chapter and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For in these chapters his speech of <hi>little children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13.33.</note> cannot be taken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then as a proper address to them. By which, and by that fact of washing their feet, we may finde how desirous he is, that that great power he had given them, should not exalt them above one another: but make them ready (by that his example) to do all loving offices one towards another: since none of them could be so great over one another, as he that had so done, was over them all.</p>
               <p>But although here, as elsewhere, he is most copious in putting them in mind of that duty of meekness and humility which becometh their large power; yet that a great power was delegated unto them, appeares in the beginning of the Chapter. <hi>Now when Iesus knew that his hour was come, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Verse 1.</note> knowing he himself could be no longer the living light or guide of the world, he therefore thought now time to delegate his own which were in the world,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> and whom for that service he had chosen out of the world.<note place="margin">chap. 15.19</note> And <hi>therefore Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">chap. 13.3.</note> that is, knowing he had finished the work he had to do, and being to return to him that gave him this mission and authority, he then thinks it time to take care of his Churches charge in his absence, and to go on with his mission of others in his name, as he had been before sent in his fathers name. This in the other Evangelists, runs, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you: and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever heareth you, heareth me,</hi> and the like; but this beloved Disciple, (after his usual manner) coucheth all under the notion of love. And therefore their power or mission is amongst other things parabolically set downe: As my <hi>Father hath loved me, so have I loved you; continue in my love:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">John 16.25.</note> as I have power had from God the Father, as his beloved son, so shall you from me,<note place="margin">c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ap. 15.9.</note> as my beloved Disciples. And this his deputation or mission thus given them, he more clearly expresseth in his prayer: <hi>As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">chap. 17.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>All which, and other considerations before spoken of, (in confirming the Churches power under her owne Ministers) should methinks be sufficient to stop the haste of such, as do so headily obtrude their owne private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture against that which is publike, and made by lawful authority. For unless they can make some extraordinary mission appear, whereby God hath something to say by them, not said before; why should men be so beguiled, as to think them not subject to like passions and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with those that have the interpretation of Gods word already? And truly, their crying out for obedience to Gods word onely, and yet proposing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55976:144"/>
it as such, when guided according to their sence onely, imports none other, then an ayme thereby to engross all honour and authority to themselves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>And therefore, that command appears at this time extreamly necessary; to <hi>put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey Magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</hi>

               <p>TO be sensible of good or happiness is to be living, and to be the more hereof sensible is to be more living. For as there is a positive dignity by sensation it self, that is, of sensitive above Inanimates, so is there a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exellence therein again, arising from degree thereof. Whereby each thing stands in degree of happiness and excellence differenced, by that degree of vigour and intensness in apprehension, and also by degree of steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and continuance in possession.</p>
               <p>Now as experience in the natural course of things doth inform, that in all progression there must be a perfection and summety, so in this case especially; where perfection of degrees must also arise from perfection of parts: even from that more inward and lively sence of happiness and fruition, which the contemplations of its own inherent worth must constantly afford. For as it is unconceivable how there could be a progression in dignity without coming to an acme and perfection, so also is it not imaginable that this perfection can be in any less degree therein stated, then to be causally and originally so: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if this happiness or the sence thereof should depend on the enjoyment of foraign objects and helps (as in man) then, for want of an original of life and perfection, all derivatives must cease also.</p>
               <p>From all which as we may conclude the being of a deity from the necessary progression of life &amp; well being, so also must we conclude that nothing under
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55976:144"/>
God Almighty can be perfectly happy. For as in him alone an absolute perfection of essence can always be found, so it must be to him alwayes so clearly perceptible and known, as to fill himself with such full acquiescence and delight, that, with due regard to his omnipotency, no foraigne want or fear can be supposed any wayes available to impoverish or delete that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which the vision and contemplation of the beatifical glory of himself must, from eternity, make within himself.</p>
               <p>When we contemplate our selves, or our own happiness or perfection, there being many things observable more perfect and happy then we, and through diversion of other objects engaging us to farther hope or fear, and through weakness of comprehension and understanding, being alwayes ready to be so diverted and foyled in our contemplations, it is not to be expected that this unsteady and weak consideration of an object so unworthy as our selves, made within our selves, should leave any such noble and firm character there, as to fill and settle us with any degree of acquiescence and delight, or to bring it to an existent perfection. Whereas, in God, that could never be but perfect, and also knowingly and delightedly so, that resemblance of himself which must from eternity have conception &amp; being in himself, must be supposed even naturally generating the like existence and continuance of such another self, under the relation of a Son. For all cause of extinction or abatement being taken away, that which was from eternity thus naturally begotten, must be to eternity thus necessary continued.</p>
               <p>And easily it may be conceived, that were any one stated in such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable degree of essential perfection in himself, as to have all perfection there centred and confined; and then to be endued with such high and steady degree of understanding and comprehension, as to be hereof alwayes sensible, and herewith alwayes delighted; and then lastly, supposing this person to be alwayes accompanied with omnipotency too, then, as nothing could hinder him from his continual enjoyment of himself, so also cannot any cause of change be conceived; whereby that which was thus lively impressed, should not have like continuance and self existence also.</p>
               <p>A strong confirmation and help to our conceipts in these things may be taken from our selves: who constantly and naturally (as shewing whence we derived it) are moved in the love and delight we take to any object, according to that impress or conception which is inwardly entertained of them: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience telling us that the fruition doth never answer the expectation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it comes alwaies short of the perfection of the <hi>Idea,</hi> it doth prove that that degree of delight ariseth from degree of excellence of the object in it self, and from degree of inward perception thereof. In us, as all knowledge is admitted by degrees at the dores of the sences, according to iuch feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations as the weakness of the sences themselves and the unworthiness of created objects will afford, It is no wonder if, by reason of so large dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, such unsteady and unaffecting impressions do remain, in comparison of what we may conceive to be where all these defects are taken off: especially since, by this foraign way of knowledge (to wit by sence) we are not able to know or appreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd truly our selves, as the divine essence is, by means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual presence and intuition: and so beget, and be possessed with a continual self-love, which is the strongest impression and delight that may be.</p>
               <p>As thus to the manner, so, to the measure of the generation, it will follow, that as this infinite comprehension of God, stood entirely implyed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55976:145"/>
of that full beauty, glory, and perfection of his whole essence, so must the person hereby generated be equally God also: for where the worker and the substance wrought upon are the same, what is thereby wrought must be the same too.</p>
               <p>Now, as it a natural and necessary property of every inteligent and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary agent to be to it self regardful in the first place, and to other things as they stand thereto like and relating, which we call love, so, in this case, that perfect similitude and essential same-ness which must cause the Father and Son with high and continual entercourse off affection to be perpetually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding each other, must, as proceeding from, and bestowed upon persons of such omnipotency and dignity, produce also a third like personal existence; even that of the holy Ghost. Because (as before said) where the subject wrought upon and the worker are both God, that which proceedeth there from must be God also; very God of very God.</p>
               <p>As thus for the coequality of Son and holy Ghost, so for their coeternity: since that perfection of the divine ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce must from the very first be, and be by it self conceived, and also loved, it must follow that these two presons must be also as much without begining as the other. For although, with us, that have our beings and conceptions imperfect and depending upon foraign helps, and by reason that our knowledge was by degrees attained from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of figurate and material bodies as they stand limitted in time and place of operations, it is not to be imagined that any perfect conception should be made in us of a substance so spiritual and sublime, much less any such ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional deffinition or discourse made for the satisfaction of others of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance transcending the similitude and comparison of any other, therefore the best expressions of himself is from himself, saying, <hi>I am that I am</hi>: yet, were all these impediments taken off, we may conceive being and well being to be eternally the same; and that omniscience should necessarily arise from, and accompany omnipresence; and that again, being inseparably accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with omnipotence, it must follow, that to be, and to know, and to will, and to act, are all the same in him, that could never be devided into parts in himself, nor circumscribed nor limitted by any other, in time, place, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, of energy; whereby, as to these personal relations, he should not be from, and continue to eternity the same that now he is: that is, not onely be really the same <hi>three,</hi> but, by this divers manner of existence of these three <hi>ones</hi> in the same one substance, we may, through their union amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, conceive deity it self to be more fixed and setled in unity or one-ness then it would be otherwise.</p>
               <p>From the observation of the manner of existence and working of any thing objected to humane sence, where agent and patient stand circumscribed and limitted by the laws of matter, it must be very heard to deduce any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory conception how these things should be brought to pass. It must needs be hard for us to apprehend how one God should thus be <hi>three</hi>: at the same time truly one, as to the Godhead, and truly three, as to the persons: and this, without division of substance, or confusion of peresons: that he that was begotten should be as ancient as he which did beget him; and againe, that that person that had procession from the other two should yet be as much without beginning as either of them. And all, because created bodies being to work according to those rules which nhe Creator did appoint, to the intent that that end which was by him aimed at in the course of his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55976:145"/>
providence might have a regular and certain effect, it was necessary that they should be ascertained, stated, and limitted, by the laws of number, time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Forasmuch as, if any one or more of them should not be numerically and separately that very one, or that very number more, a perpetual miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and confusion would follow; to the defeating nature in her operations, and to the depriving her of her variety, for want of distinct subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and individuals. And should not natural Agents be confined to time and place, whereby that which is now done, or here done, was not at all times, and every where done, it must then fall out, that things thus left at liberty, must work infinitely to the degree of deity: or else, being impeded by the like unconfined operation of others, all must perish by reluctance and disorder: Whereas God, that had thus by number and measure stated and bounded other things, must be looked upon as unlimitted in himself by those limitations which he puts upon others. That unity, that moment, that point, from whose simpleness the numbers, times, proportions, wherewith other things, stand bordered do take their original and derivation (although they were from him, yet) they are not at all afficient on him, he cannot be confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those confinements he puts on others; but remaines in himself still so much more simple then they, as not to be patible by them. It would be derogatory to him to think him so numerically and determinately <hi>one,</hi> as to say he is but <hi>one</hi>: for that were to say or suppose there were more ones, which this one did not comprehend; and so, he not the whole and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible <hi>one.</hi> No, he is one, as being all: his oneness is from his allness; his unity from his ubiquity. Not seperately and singly one as in relation to another, but as comprehending all things else; he is totally and universally one, and that, without confinement of time or place.</p>
               <p>But however there be coequality and coeternity amongst those three, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in themselves, and in relation to that one divine substance whereof they are possessed, and wherein they do unite, yet, as they stand differenced in order amongst themselves according to their relations, so are they, in their emanations and operations upon men and other Creatures, distinguishable by their order of working also. For whatever is done by God the Father, is done in the Son, and through the holy Ghost: who, as last in order, is neerest unto us in the participations of deity here. For that second person in the Trinity, who in his natural and eternal generation, as God, was begotten of God the Father, when he took our nature upon him, and did in it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the work of our redemption, was then <hi>conceived by the holy Ghost</hi>: by whom also we receive all those spiritual blessings, graces, and favours, which, by means of Christs Mediatorship and merits, are from God the Father to be expected by us, as the earnest of his love in his Son. From whence it comes to pass, that the sin against this person is set downe as unpardonable; as including all the rest: by being a more neer contempt against them all, because none can act alone.</p>
               <p>Lastly although by these divers personal subsistencies in the same substance, we may conceive deity, as to inward operations and respects, to be so fully compleated that no farther generation or procession needed (because under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will stand hereby alwayes satisfied with adequate objects of truth and good) yet as those incomprehensible rayes of love and glory which before all time were mutually and continually communicated by these three most blessed persons (as coming from omnipotent Agents) could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55976:146"/>
otherwise be confined in operation then by their owne good pleasure, so it being the property of glory and goodness to be extensive, and as natural to do good as be good, it came to pass (in time) that that inward contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was at first the generation of him that was the <hi>Image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4.</note> and thereupon of that love which was from them both proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was, for the farther manifestation of the same glory, the cause of all those effects of his love which appear in the whole creation; and of those several inferiour participations of divine resemblance heretofore spoken of.</p>
               <p>In the former way of working, the divine substance it self is wrought upon and communicated; in this, only the attributes thereof are imparted, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to matter newly created. The working of deity in the first way, was natural and necessary: but in this, voluntary. For the Father could not be said to will to beget the Son; nor could the holy Ghost be thought to take voluntary procession from the other two: because none could be said to will that to be done, which at no time was, or could be undone. The cause of the operations in the first case was perfect love, arising from perfect similitude; in this, as the similitude was more imperfect, so the intercourse of affection also was more properly an expression of charity or gift upon objects of want, then <hi>an ayme at f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uition through sence of likeness and same-ness</hi>; the which we may make the definition of love, and thereby somewhat difference it from charity: because the one seeks to enjoy, the other to bestow: though usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are taken for the same, and fall into one another. For that, whosoever loves is alwayes ready to bestow; and none was ever bountiful to any thing unloved, or unlike.</p>
               <p>In declaration of these sublime misteries much more might be said: but, when we have said all we can, it is not to be conceived that the feeble brain of man can ever attain any steady degree of comprehension of that in acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible light: it being more easy to lose our reason in a curious search, then satisfie it in any full discovery. And therefore, our safest course is to confess we know him not: having indeed no warrantable rule for our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein, but what God himself, hath of himself, in the holy Scripture set downe. The which, had it not stiled the second person the <hi>the Image of the invisible God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3. 1 John 5.7.</note>

                     </gap>ness of his fathers glory, and the express Image of his persons</hi>; And so leading us to conceive of the procession of the holy Ghost, I see not how the true personal existence of <hi>those three that bear record in heaven</hi> could have been apprehended.</p>
               <p>As for that hypostatical union of the two natures in that one person of our Saviour (a mystery also necessary in some sort to be comprehended and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) it is learnedly done by others; especially by the pen of Judicious <hi>Hooker:</hi> and is not to our present occasion so proper. But so much I thought necessary to premise in this place, for the better conception of the personal subsistance of deity; by way of supply to what was briefly spoken of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, and its operations, in the entrance of the first book; and what shall be spoken thereof in the last chapter of this book: this being as necessary to be known to state us Christians, as that was to remove us from Atheism: and also for the better understanding the original and nature of love it self, whereof we are now to treat. For hence we may perceive how <hi>God himself is said to be love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4.8. Verse 12.</note> as being the foundation thereof: and that also, <hi>if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is made perfect in us.</hi> The which is not onely true in the natural state, wherein all creatures had existence and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

from the love of God manifested in Christ <hi>by whom he made the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> and had that thereby also recourse back towards God again, by occasion of those natural propensions to mutual love and beneficence seated in men and other things, by means of that blessed spirit <hi>which moved upon the waters</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.2.</note> but also true in the state of grace and regeneration; wherein God the Father was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to love men again as in his beloved Son, when they had now lost that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeness wherein they stood lovely as his creatures before; even by <hi>the love of God shed abroad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> By whose blessed influence we are not onely holpen and directed in our love and obedience upward, whereby to meet the God of love more directly (even to the degree of a miracle-working faith where it is strong enough) but also stand inwardly aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as we are inwardly made preceptive, and participant of this love by the grace of faith, even by having our understandings cleared concerning the reallity of God and his goodness, and of the communication thereof unto us, of which we have spoken in this last discourse, so again, do we stand outwardly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conformable herein by the grace of obedience: even by signal testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our true love to him, by our ready and conformable expression of it according to his direction; of which we shall now speak in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>As the general praise of love is most plainly and largly discoursed of by Saint <hi>John,</hi> so is he most of all copious to shew how love and charity (being the general precept for Christians) are the fulfilling of the law: and how they secure us in a state of innocence. And therefore, commending love to us, he saith, <hi>I write no new Commandment unto you, but that which ye have heard from the beginning:</hi> meaning, from Christ himself, who had shewed that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of charity or love was (as hath been hitherto shewed) the sum and scope <hi>of all the Law and the Prophets:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 John 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again (saith he) <hi>a new Commandment I write unto you, which things is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light shineth.</hi> That is, true in him that hath thus rid us of strict legal observance,<note place="margin">1 John 2.8.</note> and from the darkness and multitude of litteral precepts: and hath enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with so much supernatural wisdome, as to see this one performance of love to be the summ of their meaning: they, without it, not being able to state us innocent: <hi>For he that saith he is in the light, and hateth his Brother, is in darkness even until now: but he that loveth his brother, abideth in the light,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Verse. 10.</note> Which last words point plainly to the stating of our condition of innocence by love: he concluding all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian foundation and commandment in these words; <hi>That we should believe the name of Christ Jesus, and love one another.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 3 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore is this Gospel single light, hinted unto us as a <hi>single eye, which enlighteneth the whole body.</hi> This state of innocence through love,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.22.</note> may be also compared unto the <hi>strait Gate</hi>: both for its singleness of precept, (in regard of those many precepts formerly given us) and for its difficult too: as for loving of Enemies and the like. This is that <hi>wedding garment,</hi> which whilst we have on, we need not doubt our selves true members of, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55976:147"/>
truly fitted for Christs Church and kingdome: but if wanting it, we are then to be rejected and cast out. For without this roab of charity, we shall be ready to devide this his kingdome against it self, by breach of peace and order; this being the <hi>leaven</hi> that must season all we do. This is that <hi>rock,</hi> on which we founding our Christian duties, through faith in Christ, they shall stand unmoveable against the stormes and tempests of the world: whereas else, <hi>prophesie, miracles, mighty works,</hi> though <hi>done in Christs name,</hi> and with never so religious pretences, shall not make him owne us, without its being their ground work. And to this purpose he saith, <hi>If ye keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and abide in his love</hi>: and then he ads, <hi>this is my Commandment that ye love one another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 15.10. Verse 12.</note> 
                  <hi>as I have loved you.</hi> And least any one should think, that this Commandment was but a single precept, and not general, and including all the rest of his Commandments, he farther adds; <hi>these things I Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, that ye love one another.</hi> Where the command of love is put in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number,<note place="margin">Verse 17.</note> as the sum of all the Commands we are to keep, as truly his. So that then, no love to Christ without keeping his Commandments: no keeping his Commandments without loving one another. For as Christ, in his actions, stood <hi>excepted from sin,</hi> notwithstanding his likeness to us in the frailty and infirmities of nature; even because of that perfect love to men, and perfect obedience to God with which they stood accompanied and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; even so is each one in degree innocent, according to that degree of love and obedience they bear towards their brethren, and to him their head.</p>
               <p>And indeed none speaks so home herein as our Saviour himself, both to make <hi>love the fulfilling of the law,</hi> and also to make obedience our secure directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herein: for in three several places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.20. being recorded to give the summ of the Commandments to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by him that should inherit eternal life,</hi> he puts the command <hi>honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.16.</note> as a complement to the other particular precepts. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to banish that pharisaical error of <hi>Corban,</hi> whereby religious pretences had usually been made a cloak to disobedience; he mentions in none of those places, any of these four precepts, which we onely attribute to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the first Table; but puts this command of obedience to Parents last, least it should be taken but as equal, and part of the number of the other six. Not improbably inferring it to belong to the first Table; by which means, they may be presumed to be by us respected under their proper relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods; and not in the equality of Neighbours, to be loved but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily to our selves.</p>
               <p>And then, this command being set downe as last of the first Table, it must be supposed put for the rest: implying, that our love and honor to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, (now absent) is best discovered in what we do to these his deputies present amongst us.</p>
               <p>And take it as of the first, or second Table; yet his words are express, for making this obedience the fulfilling of the law, Matth. 19.19. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, and thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self</hi>: shewing thereby (as heretofore noted) that the precepts of <hi>Do as thou wouldest be done unto, and love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> can never have right proportion and valew, without the authority and coynage of a just and common superiour to us both: by the standard of whose precepts it is to be impartially estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55976:147"/>
For Christ had before recited the particular precepts of our love to our Neighbour: but now he summs them up to be perfected and fulfilled in love; even as that love is to be compleated and directed by obedience to superiours.</p>
               <p>Else when we think our selves least biassed with self respect, and do most really examine our thoughts before we act, how that they are none other but what (with like circumstances) we would be content to have received from him or others, we might yet be deceived. For since first, all the intervening circumstances could not be by us throughly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor what measure of concern they had unto that person and me, and all other parties besides: it cannot be avoided, but that taking the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon mine owne score herein, I must have failed, in doing (through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and mistake) wrong to my self, to that my Neighbour, or to some other. For although I have but don as I would be done unto, as to my judgment did appear, yet when it must fall out, that no one man can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and state all other mens concerns fully, it must follow that judging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrong evidence, he hath made wrong judgement: and so not <hi>loved his Neighbour as himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore all innocence must proceed from obedience: for at the last judgment, when all things shall be truly stated and laid open, and it shall be made appear, how in this or that particular, I did to my self or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an evil which I thought not of, it will not be a sufficient excuse, for me that took upon me to judge herein, to say I was not aware thereof; or that I was ignorant it was at all, or in such measure any harm; or that such persons were therein at all, or so much concerned. For since every one is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like loved as my Neighbour, my intent of loving and regarding, some one or few herein as my self, will not (though rightly done) assoyle me of such failings and dangers, as must hereby happen to others also: by whom (when it comes to be truly stated) I must acknowledge I have not done as I would be done unto: for I would be loath that another should injure me, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of doing right to another.</p>
               <p>And therefore that admonition of Saint <hi>James,</hi> is to be carefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by all Subjects, that in their deportments towards others, would keep themselves unblameable: <hi>My Brethren be not many Masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation:</hi> clearly evincing that guilt sticks so close to all our commerce with others;<note place="margin">James 3.1.</note> that so far as it is not authorised by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or permission of a lawful superiour, it cannot be warrantable: who also cannot be excused of partiality and guilt, otherwise then as having whole and entire interest deputed unto him from God: whereupon, there are not to be many Masters, as heretofore noted.</p>
               <p>And therefore was it not sin in the Israelites,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.39.</note> (<hi>according to the words of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>) to borrow of their Neighbours, with an intent to deceive them: because he that commanded it, had from God (by his office) perfect propriety in the dispose of their actions. For though it might be objected, that they would not have been to dealt withall by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themselves: this was true as to the usage of the thing, considered separate from that authority by which it was done, but not in relation to their equal obligation to superiours in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of obedience. For although they would not themselves have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have been so deceived; yet, in obeying a superiours command, they did but unto him as they would be done unto, had they been in his case. For
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55976:148"/>
he having whole interest, is thereupon to be wholly looked on, as in relation to the performance of the divine precept of <hi>do as thou wouldest be done unto.</hi> For as it is easy, so alwayes just, for a man to distribute and give to others of those things that are all his owne: Whereas he that hath but an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain share, and that mingled with many, must in his decision (through parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and uncertain interest) give a partial and uncertain judgement: and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times falls short of the rules of charity, and loving others as our selves, when he most intends it.</p>
               <p>Nay, if our Saviours words be well weighed, (who gave us this rule) we shall finde publike allowance appointed to be our guidance therein: and that the usage of others, was not left to each ones private judgement. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men of late (out of arrogance, and to valew their single judgments) have put it into the singular number of <hi>do as thou wouldest be done unto</hi>; yet from the beginning it was not so. But when it was set downe as a rule for fulfilling <hi>the law and the Prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.12.</note> it was put in the plural number; <hi>whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ye would that men should do unto you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.31.</note> 
                  <hi>do ye even so to them, &amp;c.</hi> plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no man had warrant from hence to act any kind of wickedness, if he could gaine a third persons consent; but the words <hi>men</hi> and <hi>them</hi> must imply publick approbation, or that persons approbation that hath publike charge.</p>
               <p>When the precept of love is set downe, it being each mans duty to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, and ready to perform to the utmost of his power, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded in the singular number, <hi>thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> For this being not onely in the first place necessary, as the root of that tree on which our outward charitable works must grow, but being also hidden in our hearts, where none on earth can have cognisance, it could not refer to the approbation of others. But because in the outward exercise of this love, I might transgress in quantity, and so (as heretofore shewed) do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to some of my Neighbours, then I would be done unto my self, even whilst I am vehemently loving others as my self, therefore am I not to act by private light, and as a single man in this case; but as having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or leave from that publike person that hath common interest. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this root of love, be onely or chiefly to be watered by the dew of heaven, as having its formal seed from thence alone, yet is the plant it self of that nature, as without the culture of the gardner, not onely to become bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren or adulterate in its fruit, but also by its manner of growth, to disorder and overshadow the rest of the trees of the same garden. Every man therefore is to love every man as himself, as they are to be considered in their general equallity of men; but since under policy and government, we cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally separate from those different relations which the rule of that polity hath submitted us unto, therefore is the guidance of private mens actions in these different relations, to be regulated by him that hath the charge of the whole Kingdome: who is to order every one under him, as the general Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy thereof shall require: and who, according to their joynt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon relations unto him, as subjects, may <hi>do to men as he</hi> (in his publike capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city) <hi>would have men do to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we do not interpret the meaning of this rule against private judging, we make it destructive, and contradictory to the Antecedent, and consequent discourses (used by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke</hi>) of mens taking on them to judge one another, and to spye the moats in their brothers eye: the which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55976:148"/>
things are plainly in those places set downe as bringing condemnation and not innocence. The which innocence, by the precedent context in Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> is placed on implicite reliance and obedience to those above us, for that which we would have done unto us. So that because we are to relye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greatness of the knowledg and care of God &amp; our Fathers in the flesh, therefore no man should presume to be wiser then they: nor, by judging others without their leave, to do by them otherwise then he would be done unto. Wherefore without this interpretation, I see not how the coherence of <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> can be made good. And although Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> have the instance from reliance on God most especially, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> hath it for submission to humane authority: for we cannot think Christians obliged to give to other <hi>askers,</hi> or stand still to their <hi>smiters,</hi> then what are warranted by authority, as elsewhere noted.</p>
               <p>And if we mark the subsequent texts, they will clearly inform us against mens reliance on the obliquity or variety of their owne guidance, by bidding us enter in at the strait gate,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.131</note> (meaning that of obedience) and avoid that <hi>broad gate and wide way</hi> of morality which men are subject to enter at, when they are to act any thing. And so Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> goes on to warn men against these false Prophets, that shall hereafter be so prone to seduce us by their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious precepts to innocence, by reliance on doctrines by themselves brought in: who are to be known by the fruits of dissention and civil war, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none but such fruits can be expected to come from a Tree whose root is not love to their brother, and obedience to Christ. Nay implicite obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too, for though they should Prophesie, or work miracles in his name; yet since these might have been done but out of self likeing and regard one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is nothing but founding obedience on him (as on a rock) that can secure our foundation. For we are to know, that since Christ <hi>the master of the house is now risen up</hi> (and hath finished legal and moral righteousness) <hi>and hath shut to the dore</hi>; that is, <hi>bound up the law and the testimony,</hi> and their meaning,<note place="margin">Luke 13.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Isa. 8.10.</note> 
                  <hi>among his Disciples</hi>; it is not then for men to knock more at that dore of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: But if their works were not done in obedience to him <hi>as Lord,</hi> they were <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> though they called him so when they did them: neither communion with him in the visible Church, nor hearing his Gospel can excuse them.<note place="margin">Luke 13.26, 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the subsequent text in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> joyned thereunto (<hi>for if ye love them that love you what thank have you, for sinners also love those that love them</hi>) doth plainly also shew,<note place="margin">Luke 6.37.</note> that mens private wills and judgements were not to be relyed upon, for performance of that precept tending to love: whose performance that way could render men but still sinners. But we must be made capable of loving our enemies as our friends, by submitting our wills to the will of a publike person, unto whom they are of equal concern with our selves: and so doing by him as we would be done unto, we shall do by all others as we would be done unto also. Else, if we blindly act by our owne judgements, and singly lead one another by our private lights, we shall both fall into the ditch.</p>
               <p>And therefore, we can then onely safely reckon our selves innocent, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted) whilst obeying our Superious direction in commands and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions: and in case none appear, we are to guide our selves the best we may, by applying the said Maxim between our Neighbour and our selves.

given us herein: as having to the best of our consciences and judgements <hi>loved</hi> and <hi>done,</hi> as we <hi>would be loved and done unto:</hi> both in relation to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours owne interest, and also in the upright managing that trust of impartial dealing, by God or our Superiour committed unto us. And this, because his authority is equal in both; and the same to permit as enjoyn. For where authority leaves any thing to be ruled by my conscience and discretion, it is the same as if he had commanded me to order them after the same manner: and it shall thereupon follow, that I performing my utmost devoire therein, am in my actings to remain still innocent, as having but obeyed my Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>And from this necessary referment of the managery of many actions to the power of particular Subjects, and because of the necessary submission of some deportments also to the guidance of fathers and Masters of families, (as proper to their charge and duty) grows the reason why we finde in some of the Epistles and places of Scripture, such general direction and intimation of duty: namely, because those, or some of those precepts, or presidents in them contained, may be upon occasion as we said, usefull to the general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the several persons contained in each Church; when he shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stand by his proper office, or by power and leave from his Prince, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no positive restraint but of God alone. At which time, and at all times when he is not by the Church debarred, it seems highly expedient, that the same person thus entrusted with the execution of affairs, wherein himself or others may be concerted, should have liberty to have his recourse to the Scripture, for the farther enabling him in his demeanor, in things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons submitted to his trust and power: and that upon the same reason and grounds, that were formerly given to shew their sole custody and power of interpretation given to superiour powers: namely for them to have assistance of divine guidance, in execution of their charge of government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
               <p>Upon which ground and consideration, it became in particular manner necessary also, to have the general rules of <hi>do as ye would be done unto,</hi> and <hi>love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> to be commended in common to each ones observation: to the end that each one, having his Neighbours good or harm more or less in his separate power, might by this conscientious rule and tye of examination, be more readily provoked and directed in his sociable abearance. For the rule it self being but a general rule for inoffensive living, by introducing a common and equall sensation, or fellow feeling of each others wants and benefits (that thereupon (as to our selves) the good of others might be sought, and their harm avoided) therefore is it by our Saviour placed as the sum and fullfilling of the law. Meaning, that as God had formerly by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, given particular precepts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the sociable abearance of the nation of the Jewes, so the onely standing divine rule to us Christians now, was this summary direction for the good of Society: whereby preserving the good of our Neighbour, we should also thereby to our power, maintaine the glory and service of God.</p>
               <p>So that the said rules, of <hi>love thy Neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you,</hi> &amp;c. importing generally, as if it had been commanded to all sorts of men to be ready according to their severall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55976:149"/>
stations and degrees, to promote the good, and to ease and sustaine the harms of one another; it must therefore follow, that those persons that have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and whole trust and power in each society, are in the first place to have the interpretation and application of this rule: and so each one under him, as he shall entrust them therein; in order to the good and welfare of that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. For since the care and trust of the Prince is more then that of others, it must also follow, that the application of that rule which is directive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, must be primarily in him too: the subject having onely liberty to guide himself in what he is to act on another, as supposing the rule a fresh said unto him from Christs Minister set over him. Because else (as before shewed) ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall harm may be the consequent of general liberty independently to act by these rules: whereas in our assistances to them, and in our submissive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, (<hi>if we bear one anothers burdens) we shall fulfill the law of Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 6.2.</note> in maintaining the good of society, the end of that law.</p>
               <p>The rule of <hi>do as thou wouldest,</hi> &amp;c. being thus hard to be kept (as from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate direction onely) causeth it to fall out, that our works (as our works) cannot justifie us before God: because they cannot, as proceeding from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate persons onely, have throughly, and on all hands charitable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect performance; but as done in Christ; that is in obedience to his, or his deputies authority: and failing in the faith hereof, or in our impartial dealing with our Neighbours, in things by authority permitted unto us, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that <hi>whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> But if in conscience to Christs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (commanding obedience to him and in him) we do that which may privately make our <hi>conscience condemn us, yet God is greater then our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and knoweth all things</hi>: to wit, knoweth, that as his glory is to be increased by humane preservation,<note place="margin">1 John 3.20.</note> so humane preservation is maintained by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and submission.</p>
               <p>For if we must be judging of morallity, and being under lawful authority, act their commands on others no farther then the supposal of our case and suffering to be theirs will give leave, I would fain know, whether the Judge, and other officers and executioners of civil Justice, that joyne in the sentence and infliction of death on any their fellow Subjects; or whether the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that for press or pay doth the like on his owne country men or others, do either of them imagine themselves in their case; and so acquit themselves, by not being instrumental in infliction of more, then themselves would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain suffered from them? If they do not, nor need not, then doth their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence follow their obedience: even by Imagining themselves to have been in their superiours case, &amp; him their subject: for as then, they would have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience to what themselves had conceived fit to be done, so are they now to give it. In which case (by my obedience) doing as I would be done unto by him that hath whole concern and represents all, it must follow, that I do as I would be done unto by all men else; and so by my obedience have fulfilled the law of Christ.</p>
               <p>Whereupon as we finde <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith imputed for righteousness, and he called Father of the Church or Faithful; so was this attributed unto and made appear in a matter of obedience: <hi>In thy seed shall all the Nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> For although <hi>Abraham</hi> had at other times obeyed, yet was he herein exemplarily the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; because the proof of his obedience was performed in a particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the injury to another and himself, might have been so highly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55976:150"/>
out of private judgement and interest. Whereupon, that which is here attributed to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Obedience, is interpreted by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his Faith: who in the first Chapters to the <hi>Romans</hi> largely sets forth the necessary guilt accompanying legal precepts, not done in Christ; who throughly fulfilling all moral righteousness; our faith and obedience in, and to him, makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us: <hi>for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Rom 2.29.</note> that is, men are now to be justified by love (<hi>the work of the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts</hi>) and not by the observation of the letter according to their owne sence.<note place="margin">Verse 15:</note> For against such, he pronounceth a necessity of such sins, as attended such as <hi>professed themselves wise</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.22.</note> saying, <hi>Thou art inexcusable O man whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy self:</hi>

                  <hi>for thou that judgest doest the same things.</hi> That is, inasmuch as thou takest upon thee to guide others and thy selfe by thine own judgement, thou must consequently break Charity, the end of the law: and so involve thy self in the guilt of thine owne, and others sins, that must follow thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>For now we are delivered from the law, being dead to that wherein we are held:</hi> that is, being released (as heretofore noted) of the penalty of observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legal precepts,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.6.</note> as of immediate divine authority; because <hi>we should serve in the newness of Spirit</hi> (that is by love) <hi>and not in the oldness of the Letter.</hi>

                     </gap>m·</note> For while we were taking upon us this litteral performance, the law of our owne members and concupiscence (pointing at private interests) caused it to prove to us the law of sin, and of death.</p>
               <p>So that then, the law of God being to be served with the mind inwardly, and not by fleshly wisdom, to make it the law of sin, it follows, <hi>that there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus: which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> That is, because <hi>they that act after the flesh</hi> (or take upon them self guidance) <hi>do minde the things of the flesh</hi> (their owne interests):<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>but they that walk after the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> 
                  <hi>mind the things of the Spirit</hi>: that is, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes guided by the fruit of the Spirit, inward love, they alwayes mind the effects thereof: in which they could not err, whilst remaining obedient.</p>
               <p>For else, authority and law onely defining and measuring in particular acts what is murther, adultery, theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and rating accordingly the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereupon due, we should, in our particular biassed interpretations, commit often the same, or worse faults, then those we went about to amend. And this, because God, who from himself and in his owne name gave these precepts at first, gave also a continual succession of Prophets, Urim and Thummim, and other divine ways of revealing his pleasure in their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon doubtful occasions; so that being both wayes expresly divine, their observance litterally (as so) was each mans duty then: but now, being not to be litterally and particularly so construed by private men, they break or keep them, when they break or keep their substance, charity and inward love; and are more or less obedient to Superiours therein.</p>
               <p>And therefore although there could be but one truth, amidst those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent exercises of Christianity between the Jewish and Gentile Churches; yet the Apostles being to promote and encourage Christianity all they could, and Christians again to obey implicitely in all things not fundamental; the one might justly command, and the other be also obedient, although in things differing and contrary: which otherwise in the commanders, must have been
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55976:150"/>
Heresie on the one side or other. And besides, must have been Schism and Scandal in each sort of the disagreeing Subjects, that in absence of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon head, obtruded upon each other their differing constitutions: having no other authority to act, or impose to the dislike of one another, then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their joynt authority; as thereby <hi>holding of the head</hi>:<note place="margin">Col. 2.19.</note> under whom they were to be esteemed but as one, by means of joint communion and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. But when done in just pursuance thereof, error is avoided: <hi>for that a divine sentence is in the lips of a King, and his mouth transgresseth not in judgement.</hi> In the original it is in the future tense, shall not transgress: which I note to avoid the Exposition that might be made against the allowing the judgement of Kings in general to be such;<note place="margin">Pro. 16.10</note> as thinking it only appliable to <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, because particularly inspired above others.</p>
               <p>And this place of <hi>Solomon</hi> is a good comment and confirmation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of like sort: namely, <hi>to punish the just is not good, nor to strike Princes for equity.</hi> Where we may finde, that a Prince in his definition, is held the same with a just man, (as formerly noted in the title of justice):<note place="margin">Pro. 17.26.</note> and that then we can no more punish or accuse the one then the other, for want of justice or equity. Upon which reasons <hi>Elihu</hi> (in <hi>Iob</hi>) brings in that saying, as a truth universally agreed upon: <hi>is it fit to say to a King thou art wicked, and to Princes ye are ungodly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, by the words <hi>shall not transgress in judgement,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that they shall not cause subjects to transgress in their obedience; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sentence is divine, which in the Original imports <hi>divine Oracle,</hi> or <hi>Divination,</hi> as having whole interest by divine deputation and precept: but erroneous it may be, and is in him (as he stands in relation accomptable to God) so far, and so often, as he againe transgresseth his law, who hath whole interest, both in those persons, and him, and all things else. For if he take upon him to prescribe rules according to his owne iudgement, where God hath made positive ones already; or do in those cases left to his care, (through pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or interest) respect himself, or some one party above another, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syect Gods superiour interest before his owne subordinate interest (doing by God as he would be done unto) he doth not do as he would be done unto. For as he would not have his Judges, and such as he trusts do the like by him, so is he not to deceive and abuse Gods delegation; in forgetting that all his power is but usurpation and injustice, when not according to the best of his judgement and conscience, directed to Gods honor above his owne: as also, to the general and impartial good of his subjects.</p>
               <p>So that Subjects justice or justification, consisting chiefly in submission to the judgement of their Superiour, we may well know how to interpret that wise King and Preacher: <hi>be not righteous over much, neither make thy self ever wise, why shouldest thou destroy thy self? Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish, why shouldest thou dye before thy time?</hi> By which words,<note place="margin">Eccle. 7.16. Verse 17.</note> we are not to think that either increase of righteousness or wisdome is forbidden, or increase of wickedness or folly commended, as in themselves; but must apply them unto their manner and object of usage and imployment. For so (in the first verse) he that will be so seemingly righteous and wise, as to think his owne conscience and discretion sufficient and warranted judges of his actions, against, or above that of his Superiour, he will endanger his owne guilt and destruction, by being so <hi>over righteous,</hi> and <hi>overwise</hi>: That is to say, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate useing and applying the rules of <hi>do as thou wouldest be done unto, and love
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55976:151"/>
thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> not left unto him by the higher power. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, being over wise, <hi>that is wise in his owne conceit,</hi> he neglects the precept that said <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother and thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.19</note> and so doth not as he would be done unto. And againe, he that hath not these charitable rules deep enough in his heart, but shall act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in things remitted to him; or shall strain the letter of the law to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his malice or private interest onely; he is <hi>over much wicked</hi> and a <hi>fool:</hi> and, offending against charity, puts himself into the same danger also. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though obedience be in it self matter of Apostolical precept and rejoycing; <hi>yet should we be wise unto that whis is good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 16.19.</note> 
                  <hi>and simple concerning evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For alas the uncharitable designes of self interest, do so often intermingle in what we do, even in order to superiour command; that we shall not need to fear men will not have sins enough to answer for. We are all of us (God knows) so far the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> as to be too prone to yeild to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>tasting of the forbiddin fruit of good and evil</hi> in what is commanded; whereby we lose <hi>the innocence of doves</hi>: and not to be wise enough again, in doing that good to our Neighbour, which is left and referred to our owne discretion and power; whereby we fail of <hi>the wisdome of Serpents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however, if we will be innocent it must be by casting of our owne wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by implicite following Christs precepts for obedience and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our neighbour: and for what we have done otherwise, we must re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>estate our selves in innocence by repentance, even to the degree of little children; who we know obey implicitely, and act without malice. And this is the scope of Christs thanks giving; <hi>that these things were hid from the wise and prudent</hi> (that is such as trusted in their moral righteousness), <hi>and were revealed unto Babes</hi>: that is, to such as (considering the load of legal precepts) should,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25.</note> like men regenerate again in Christ, take his easie yoke upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by <hi>lowliness and meekness</hi> (the two concomitants of obedience) <hi>find rest for their souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 29.</note>And this is the effect of our new birth: whereby being, as the sons of God in Christ, restored to a state of innocence, we come to be freed of the <hi>old leaven,</hi> and that guilt of morality incurred by the <hi>old Adam.</hi> And in this sence, are all those and the like places to be understood, how the children of God sin not: <hi>Whosoever is borne of God doth not commit sin, for his seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him,</hi>

                  <hi>and he cannot sin because he is born of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which places may well allude unto, and are explained by our Saviour himself in his answer to the Pharisees (a people that use to mak religious pretences to discountenance lawful obedience; and would have made their unauthorised interpretations of the law, (in superstitious observation of the Sabboth and some other things) act their militious designes against Christs honour, and their neighbours good) <hi>If ye were blinde</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>ye would have no sin; but now ye say we see, therefore your sin remaineth:</hi> if they had not opposed their owne prying humour,<note place="margin">John 9.41.</note> in the literal morality of the law, against Christs authority, obedience had kept them innocent: <hi>but going about to establish their owne righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.3.</note> For by means of their insubjection unto that manner of <hi>judgement for the which Christ came into the world,</hi> they (trusting to their own may of seeing) <hi>came to be made blind:</hi> whereas others, that pretended not to see of themselves, through obedience to him, <hi>were made to see.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the forementioned places of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> be well consulted, we
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55976:151"/>
shall find the interpretation and guidance of religious precepts and duties left wholly to the supream Magistrate: and that Christ, by this liberty in the great legal injunction of the Sabboth, shews that offices of <hi>Charity, (or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mercy and faith</hi>) are the end <hi>or weightier matters of the law: &amp; mercy better then sacrifice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13.7.</note> And therefore although he aver his owne authority in Church matters, as being <hi>greater then the Temple,</hi> yet he saith <hi>the Son of man Lord also of the Sabboth.</hi> If he had said the Son of God had been Lord thereof,<note place="margin">Verse 6. Verse 8.</note> it had been but to assert what was not questioned: but as he here calls himself <hi>Son of man,</hi> to countenance his deputies, and stop the mouths of such as (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of the weakness of humane authority) would deny the supream Magistrates power herein, so he did before instance what men they are that have it: that is, Kings personated in <hi>David</hi>: and Priests, alluded unto in <hi>Abiathar,</hi> in whose dayes it was done; both of them having sole trust of law. And therefore as they in the law, so he, as a great King and Priest in the Gospel, had this power also.</p>
               <p>Whereupon since the observation of legal precepts (as barely such) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have (as from us alone) any such exact performance as to be justifiable and meritorious; but this being done by Christ, the morality of our works can be justified but as through him: that is, as done in obedience to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who hath bin fully meritorious therein already. Hereupon it must be plicite, where direct precept is; or according to the general precepts of love, in things remitted to us. And this was <hi>the great mystery of Godliness, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the flesh:</hi> through obedience to which manifestation we come <hi>to be justified in the Spirit.</hi> For Christ saith of himself, <hi>as long as I am in the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the light of the world:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 9.5.</note> but being we are bidden to be obedient to our Superiour <hi>Masters in the flesh as unto Christ: and in the Lord</hi> (that is, in his stead) it follows <hi>that he that dispiseth them, dispiseth him that sent them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6.5, 6, 7.</note> And therefore Christians, in their obedience and discipleship to Christ,<note place="margin">Luke 10.16.</note> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to sheep: a creature best setting forth their duty of obedience, by their ready, simple, and implicite following their Shephard, and also the general duty of Christian love and charity; by their inoffensive and harmless deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments one towards another.</p>
               <p>And to prove that this obedience to Christs Minister is to be the pre-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red condition that should justifie men in their Christian deportments, we shall finde that the Apostles, and such as he was to delegate as his Ambassadours, are by Christ not onely called <hi>the lights of the world, a City on a hill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.14.</note> and the like, to shew the largeness of their illumination, but farther to shew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the conformity of our outward deportments to their directions, they are also by Christ appointed to be <hi>the salt of the earth.</hi> And he expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly sayes, <hi>that every one shall be salted with fire</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Verse 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> every mans faith shall be tryed by the fire of afflictions and temptations, and <hi>every sacrifice shall be salted with salt:</hi> that is, as every sacrifice under the law was to be so seasoned; so he <hi>that came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9.49.</note> had now made the precept of love (seasoned by the obedience to those that were to command in his stead) to be the sure way of making each Christian duty lawful: and after the same manner that each Christian himself, was to be made acceptable by his baptism of afflictions.</p>
               <p>And although it were reserved for the clearer light of the Gospel, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that all wickedness proceeded from malice, and other the works of the flesh: and on the other side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that love was the only thing to estate men r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Coincidence of Christian graces.</head>
               <p>HOw the affection of unity is accompanying the whole race of things, hath been abundantly declared (as a metaphisical or supernatural spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation) by such as have not had any other light to direct them in the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then that which meer nature would afford: being drawn from contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her procession in things here below. But, unto us Christians, who have from above been confirmed in the knowledg of deity, and also of its unity, as the ground of our divinity must grow more firm and steady in knowledge of God himself, so will the contemplation of that unity (as considered in him that is the cause of all things) lead us by a plain way of demonstration, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover why in each thing by him made, the same affection should be also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implanted: not only in order of resemblance herein to its Author, but to the formal stating of it such, or such.</p>
               <p>Concerning some of the nearer resemblances of deity in the things of life (which we call individuals) we have formerly spoken; as also of mans above them all. But this affection of unity, is so much more closely accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that it not onely formally constitutes them, but thereby also differenceth them from inanimates: who can receive no formal unity, but what must arise from the definition of their whole Mass: whereas, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of any species of individuals, that natural unity which appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, can have no other true existence or perfection then what was first really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in, and constituted by the individuals themselves: as being the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble properties in them severally abiding.</p>
               <p>As therefore all things, together with their creation and existence from God proceeding, received from him this affection of unity also, as necessarily constituting them distinct from the whole race of things, so, to the end that the Makers praise might yet receive addition and increase, though the increase of the several objects of his bounty and goodness; and that this division of the whole Mass, might not (by civil war and disunion amongst themselves) prove the overthrow of one another, (but that one thing might be a continual support unto the good and preservation of another, and thereby all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to the same end Gods glory), we may observe all those friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts and properties, bestowed by God on natural Agents, as heretofore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. By means of which propensity, and benigne aspect of one thing towards another, ariseth that other affection which we call goodness. So that, when the separate existencies of things (which states truth) are by this affection of goodness made agree in things to their own mutual preservation and to Gods glory also, then doth the prevalence of union appear herein again; as joyning good to truth, and creation to providence; and making the Creatures end, or preservation, conspire to that of Gods, his owne glory: and Gods glory to meet in direct points with their good.</p>
               <p>But now, although these benevolent inclinations of things might suffice to mutual preservation in Inanimates, and such sensitives as had none, or small
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55976:153"/>
cause of division, through largeness of private appetite and will, so, to the end that voluntary Agents (which were most to seek it) might not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to recompence their owne higher sence of felicity from God received, with the ingrateful diminution of his glory in the disturbance of the course of his providence, it was onward necessary, that for maintenance of the same unity (which was made as aforesaid by inward instincts in other things) there should not onely be an inward natural appetite to union implanted (which we call love) but also such outward directions given to them; that through the due observance hereof, their union and meeting amongst themselves might tend to the like end with the other things before spoken of: namely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and maintenance of Gods glory, and their own good.</p>
               <p>All which considerations, will now make manifest the great reason, not onely of that simplicity and fewness of the Gospel precepts, as in order to our more easie performance, and for their approaching so much neerer to the perfection and unity of him that gave them, but also of that plain coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they have amongst themselves: whereby they come, like the whole race of things themselves, (the object of their directions) to unite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire in the common end of all things, Gods glory; and (the subservient end thereof) each particular things natural preservation: For as there is an union in the end, so must there be also in the means and directions leading thereunto. All which we shall declare by instance; it being a thing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly usefull in it self, but also necessary for to understand those many texts, where sometimes love, sometimes faith, sometimes hope, sometimes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or the like, are singly set downe as comprehensive of all duty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection beside: and not constantly any one grace alone After that I shall give farther evidence thereof: by producing some places of Scripture, cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setting out their conjunction and harmony.</p>
               <p>When the threats due to sin or the breach of the law, are by any in such sort resented, as to cause him to have recourse unto the remedies laid downe in the Gospel; or else, when the enjoyments and promises by the Gospel it self set fort, do of themselves invite; then is the first putting forth of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to attend these objects as good, called by the name of <hi>hope.</hi> After which, the rational faculty comes to be set on work, for the entertainment or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the means: which being apprehended as feasable, doth then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the object of our faith; and so of our reasonable appetite called will. For although the sensitive appetite, (as more general and as next unto life or individual being) do readily at first attend every thing (as its object) that is presented under the Classis of hope or fear; yet, when understanding hath had leisure to work, the reasonable will prosecutes no farther, in attainment or avoidance of these objects of hope or fear, then as the consideration of those mediums lying between them and us, makes these objects (by their neerness of approach to us) to be afterwards, in a second measure, hopeful or formidable.</p>
               <p>In which consideration, hope and faith doe alwayes accompany one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and although hope, as more general, do inchoat in order to the end, (namely the enjoyment of bliss and avoidance of torment) yet faith, in order to the means, to wit, our laying hold on Christ) doth so instantly follow, that some have believed these graces to come together: Which may be true in relation to that one divine spirit which (entring at the same time) was the cause to both; but yet it hinders not, but that this spirit might produce its
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55976:153"/>
effects in their natural order, as before shewed. It being aterwards true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that these graces are mutually encreased and strengthened by each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the hope and beliefe, or beliefe and hope of the end, (by its valew) exciting the beliefe and hope, or hope and beliefe of these means that are tending thereunto.</p>
               <p>Which means coming hereupon to be more constantly and fully pursued; hope or beliefe to be therefore accepted, grows by degrees (in each one) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to stronger hope and beliefe that he is accepted. Which beliefe, or strong faith of Gods acceptance and love to us; doth againe increase on-ward, in our love to him. Unto which onely hapy estate, being by these blessed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees once come, then doth hope and faith become silenced and swallowed up by this most high and compleat grace of love: for we now live no longer by desire, but fruition.</p>
               <p>But because, in this life, and whilst we carry this treasure in earthen Vessels, we cannot arrive at any perfection, much less at any degree of continuance and perseverance in this happy enjoyment of God by love, we are therefore (as elsewhere noted) to cherish in our selves all those means, whereby our faith and hope may be kept in or restored unto their pitch and vigour: so that, notwithstanding our many relapses, we may be still reintegrated again to a state of love. In which regard, we are next to consider of that which is the general grace of supply and sustentation to all the rest: namely the grace of obedience.</p>
               <p>For from the efficacy of this grace it is, that hope and faith gather their joynt and mutual strength: even from conscience of our continual actings, and endeavours in performance of the commands and dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ions of God. For these things must follow as necessary consequents of one another: First to obey out of fear to displease, and hope to kept favour; and then farther, still to obey, even as we believe our obedience accepted and available. And lastly, obedience will still increase it self, with that increase of grace it brings: and as it hath perfected our first feeble hope to strength of faith, so will it accompany our state of highest perfection; even our state of love. For then shall our readiness in execution of Gods commands be doubled: because being united to him by this affection, we shall not onely do his will as his, but as our owne too. So that when faith shall fail, obedience shall not: being a grace so proper and necessary to each Creature, that it cannot (in order to its subordinate relation) be truly such without it. And this, not only in the will, but also in act, so far as lyeth in its power. For although none wil deny the omniscience of God Almighty, so far as to doubt his inspection into the most inward thoughts and inclination of his Creature; even to the discerning that proportion of faith and love, which is in their hearts; yet, it being the most natura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for justice, to proceed in rewards and punishments (especially such as outward) according to overt acts, we shall still finde God himself recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing those that were endowed with strongest measure of these graces, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to that publike estimate thereof which they in their life times, by more remarable obedience did make apparent: as our Saviours obedience to the death of the Cross, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> in the death of his son, and divers others examples in holy Writ do declare.</p>
               <p>As for the duties of prayer, preaching, almes, sacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. they are the several objects and expressions of our obedience: through perseverance in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55976:154"/>
which Christian precepts, (as outwardly administred in Christs kingdome the Church) Gods inward kingdome of grace in our hearts, is made to have its efficacy and growth. And as for the Theological vertues of <hi>meekness, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, patience, gentleness, long-suffering,</hi> &amp;c. they may all be comprehended under the aforesaid grace of obedience: serving as necessary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the stating thereof: as shall in their due place be declared.</p>
               <p>From all which, as the simplicity of the Gospel may plainly appear, so will it be farther manifest, how by this coincidence of Christian graces (sum'd up in love and obedience, or in love alone, or obedience alone, (as presuming they cannot be one without another) that men now under Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> are come (as before noted) to be stated in a capacity of Innocence, upon almost as easie tearms as under the first: and how we are again brought to be more resembling his condition, while implicite obedience is our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection now, as it was to him then. To the farther confirmation whereof, we might also add the coincidence of the sins opposite to these graces: as contrarily tending to diminution of Gods glory, and humane good: Even declaring how infidelity and uncharitableness, are ever accompanied with, and heightned from the sin of obedience. But I shal now proceed to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture proofs in these things: and in farther confirmation of the precedent chapter, beginning with some out of the New Testament.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having declared somewhat to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> of his knowledge <hi>in the mystery of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 3.4.</note> doth it, that thereby <hi>all men may see what was the fellowship of the mistery:</hi> that is, both the fellowship of Christian precepts amongst themselves, and our fellowship or communion with Christ through obedience. <hi>Which (mistery) from the beginning of the world hath bin hid in God; who created all things by Jesus Christ:</hi> that is, heretofore hid under the legal observations,<note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> but is now (as the unsearchable riches of Christ) preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gentiles. <hi>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places,</hi> that is, unto the higher powers seated and deputed by Christ, <hi>might be known by the Church,</hi> (that is, by the vertue of illumination and authority, given to them through Christs headship of the Church) <hi>the manifold wisdome of God.</hi> And therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer was, that <hi>Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note>

Where, all wickedness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned after, as subsequent and attendant on disobedience, and by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the disobedient and lawless against the righteous man, we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand obedience and righteousness to be contivertible: For as the <hi>fruit of the Spirit is love,</hi> so the fruit thereof again, <hi>is joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Gal: 5, 22, 23.</note> law of condemnation.</p>
               <p>And this mistical way of accomplishing our innocence, is farther repeated to the Collossians: <hi>that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love: and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the mistery of God, and of the father, and of Christ: in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge.</hi>

                  <hi>Therefore saith the Lord who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face wax pale.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 29.22.</note> In which words God expressing himself under the notion of Redeemer, shews the condition of the Christian Church (the house of <hi>Iacob</hi>) under Christ their Redeemer, typified under <hi>Iacob</hi> himself: namely, that all cause of fear and shame shall be banished, through the succeeding glory of the Christian Church. For so it followeth, <hi>But when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him</hi> (that is, such as are begotten to him through the power of mine inward Kingdom) <hi>they shall sanctifie my name: and shall sanctifie the holy one of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Vers. 23.</note> shall walk righteously and obediently according to their calling. <hi>They also that erred in spirit,</hi> that is, such as were not yet thus inwardly guided but were led by multitude of litteral precepts, <hi>shall come to understond</hi> (that is, to know this right way of sanctifying me) <hi>and they that murmured</hi> (that is, such as were made stubborn by relyance upon their own interpretations of legality) <hi>shall learn Doctrine</hi>: that is, shall learn the doctrine of obedeince,<note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> a fit lesson for murmurers.</p>
               <p>As this Office of Teaching or Instruction, is to be understood here set down as in the first place proper to Christ (<hi>who was anointed to preach good tydings</hi>) so,<note place="margin">Chap. 61.2.</note> because this could be but in small measure done and supplyed by himself (at least amongst the Gentiles, in the glory of whose Church it is to be understood that of the Jews was prophesied) it is therefore to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55976:159"/>
that Christian Princes are to be his chief deputies in this office of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction also. For as they (under him) <hi>Shall build the old wasts, and raise up the former desolations</hi> of the Jewish Church, by this advancement of Christs kingdome amongst the Gentiles:<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> so <hi>These strangers shall stand and feed the Churches flock,</hi>

               <p>Nor can it appear otherwise then reasonable and necessary, that those that are to be in the seat of judgement under Christ, should have in chief the power and office to teach and instruct, as well as to censure and reform. Which, although not fit to be personally practised by Kings, in that sence of preaching as now understood (especially having under them persons in holy orders to that purpose separately ordained) yet is that general Office of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to be esteemed so properly their right, as that (for the matter and measure thereof) it is alwayes subordinately to be executed by others. For as they are to be the keepers of both tables, so upon extraordinary and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant occasions, they may also (no doubt) as Gods Ministers entrusted in chief with the advancement of his glory and service publikely and personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also, perform that Office under the Gospel, much more rightfully then good <hi>Josiah</hi> under the Law. Who, to his great commendations, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly done the like,<note place="margin">2 King. 23.2. 2 Chron. 34.30</note> 
                  <hi>In the ears of the Priests and Prophets, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both small and great:</hi> and yet was the custody and interpretation of the Law much more appropriate to the Priesthood then, than now.</p>
               <p>Nay indeed this Office must both be in the same person, and in the first place setled also: or else I see not how they should have power or ability to reprove, in such things where they had no power or right to constitute and ordaine. And therefore we may observe, that the first Mission of power which our Saviour gave, was under the notion of this Office of Preachers or Evangelists: and by vertue thereof, and obedience thereunto, did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles at first claim obedience from their Churches in other things; as shall more fully appear anon.</p>
               <p>But to return, so much of the prophesie as concerns the Church her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and prosperity, is to be interpreted as not made good fully in Christ himself, nor in some time after: that is, whilst the Church was so under per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, that those deputies of Christ in the seat of judgement, had not power and honor enough to preserve the members from shame, or fear. But it is to be compleated <hi>unto the residue,</hi> or latter time of the Church: when God shall more eminently appear like a Crown and diadem: in being the spirit of judgement and strength, to them that have the crown and diadem. That is, when <hi>Christ as King shall raign in righteousness,</hi> and <hi>his deputies of Princes shall rule in judgement:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 32.1.</note> 
                  <hi>then shall a man</hi> (the Prince in Christs seat) <hi>be for a hiding place from the winde</hi> (of divers doctrines wherewith they were formerly tossed) <hi>and a cover from the tempest</hi> (that is, of persecution) <hi>he shall be as rivers of waters in a dry place:</hi> That is, (from the spirit of <hi>truth now met in the seat of mercy and judgement</hi>) he shall cause instructions <hi>to flow forth as waters in a dry land:</hi> and by means of strength (to him that is to turn the battle to the gate) <hi>he shall be as the shaddow of a great rock</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> even for strength and defence to the Church, formerly wearied with persecution. And so the Prophet goes on, to shew how the eyes and ears of them that yet see and hearken to his instructions, shall be reclaimed from their former rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and come to understand knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55976:159"/>By this word <hi>man</hi> set down in this second verse in the singular number (saying, <hi>A man shall be,</hi> &amp;c.) we may gather, first, that there should be but one at once in each Church that should supply the place of a rock and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of judgement: although, in respect of the whole number of Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in the Catholike Church, they were to be <hi>Princes</hi> in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, under him the Churches universal head and King of Kings. And then again; this person being set down under the notion of <hi>a man,</hi> will denote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that it could not be meant of Christ himself neither.</p>
               <p>But this (as before said) shall chiefly come to pass, after the former Palaces of the Jewish Church <hi>shall be forsaken</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 14. Verse 15.</note> and by means of the <hi>spirit from on high,</hi> to be powered on the Gentile Church, <hi>judgement shall dwell in the wilderness</hi>: that is, in the Gentile Church, formerly a wilderness,<note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness remain in the fruitful field:</hi> meaning the now flourishing Gentile Church. <hi>And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effects of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness shall be quietness and assurance for ever.</hi> That is, by means of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness looking down from heaven,<note place="margin">Isa. 32.17.</note> and so causing righteousness and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to kiss each other, <hi>The Church shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places:</hi> that is, the Church by the means of this blessed protection of kingship,<note place="margin">Verse 18.</note> shall be no more in danger of persecution as before.</p>
               <p>These blessings of peace and prosperity, to come to the Church by means of Gods <hi>judgement and righteousness given to the King and the Kings son,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 72.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>All which prophesies were to be fullfilled, after those prophesies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christs humiliation in his own person should have an end: and also his own prophesies concerning those miserable times of calamity that should (for sometime) befall his Church after his departure. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it is, that he is come to send fire on earth and a sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> meaning persecution: and also to set men in neerest relations at variance one against another: meaning that for fear thereof they should betray one another. For if we be not regardful of the true times of compleating the prophesies of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal peace of the Church, we shall be at a loss to finde their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For I conceive the prophesies of universal peace (as of <hi>beating swords into pruning-hooks,</hi> &amp;c.) to have accomplishment at the general peace, when Christ the Prince of peace came: and our Saviours prophesies of his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches persecution, to have an end in <hi>Constantines</hi> time. After whom, I look on the Christian Church, in her relapses under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apostate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in a temporary trembling motion: till she fix in her state of quietness and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</p>

               <p>Nor need there farther instances be given of that simplicity and coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gospel Precepts, and how that Faith and Love, or <hi>Faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love,</hi> and Love made useful by Obedience, are asserted in the New-Testament, as necessarily, and onely fundamental; since, if the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be diligently examined, they will be found the usual drift of them all. So that as salvation is sometimes, and in some places promised to such <hi>as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel,</hi> so in other places, to such as <hi>obey the Gospel.</hi> Faith uniting us to Christ, and Obedience uniting us to his Church. He that with prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of this Doctrine, shall read the holy Scriptures, shall finde the difficult
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55976:161"/>
places thereof to assent to a ready opening and interpretation; offering themselves to unlock easily with this Key: it being the door of entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to most of the mysteries thereof, which are usually turning upon these hinges.</p>
               <p>Which plenty and readiness of discovery, as it hath been the occasion of my passed tediousness in these Discourses, so must it be the excuse also; both for my want of order, and also for any repetition that shall be found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For as the known benefit arising by peace (through obedience) made me attentive to such remarkable Texts as did confirm this duty, so these Texts again, by the abundance of matter accompanying them and leading to that subject, caused me both to fail of method, and to transcend my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bounds in the Treaty hereof. And yet, to avoid this tediousness, I have neither undertaken to Comment on many places (neither in Old nor New-Testament); and in some of those I do undertake, it may be observed that I have but cursorily glossed: leaving the farther discovery to each mans easie observation that will attend it.</p>
               <p>I know many will look strangely at the first, upon this Doctrine of mens innocence by implicite obedience in all we do: that is, to Christ himself in things fundamental, and which formally state us Christians, and to our Prince (his deputy) in all things necessary for the security and advance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But when the scope of Scripture, and the good of Peace and common Charity (thereby, and no way else to be attained) shall be well considered of, the apparent benefit, will in reality (I hope) exceed the seeming novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For without it, how shall we be able to ground and settle our selves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a constant course for Unity and Agreement, where private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (under the colour of Conscience) shall not be able to interrupt Gods appointed way of providence, by setting him to act against himself? Even to interrupt and abate of that glory which should be given <hi>to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi> by not providing for this <hi>Peace one earth, and good will towards men:</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that heavenly Hymn sung at the birth of the <hi>Prince of Peace.</hi> And if such a thing as Government must thereupon be acknowledged neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and that obedience again is a duty necessary to estate Government; then must there necessarily a difference follow (in point of guilt) between him that performs it, and him that doth it not: and so consequently he that hath been more implicite and ready in his obedience, must be confessed to have better performed it, then he who hath therein but observed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of his own sence and Conscience, and not that of his Superior.</p>
               <p>Nor can I see, how men, generally granting Superiors to be accountable for the sins which were acted by vertue of their commands, can thereupon avoid the acknowledgement, that as this guilt lights on them because the other obeys out of sense of duty, so must it proportionably abate in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyer: unless they can make obedience no duty at all, or (that which is more absurd) can make men never the juster for having done it.</p>
               <p>But so hard a thing it is to overcome that thirst of rule and insubjection that is naturally graffed in us, that some objections must always be expected to shake off implicite restraint, and to leave us still to the liberty and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our first Parents, in examining the Ground and Reason of each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, before we come to act. It faring with men, in the rendring of their obedience, as it doth in their Charity. For although none will deny that Charity lies upon him as a duty, even as they will grant that Obedience doth
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55976:161"/>
also, yet when we are to act this Precept of Love or Charity we shall finde interest and covetousness, so to sway us in making of Objections against such as do really need it, that it will in the end amount to very little: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as in like manner Pride and Interest are always ready to defeat the duty of Obedience; by one objection or other against the person commanding, or the Command it self. Thus, Children and Servants, being told of those Texts of <hi>obey in all things,</hi> or the like, will presently answer, that, by <hi>all things,</hi> must be understood onely things lawful: <q>For else, our Father or Master may command us to do contrary to the Laws of our Prince and Country; he may command us to Kill, to Steal, &amp;c.</q> And the like answer we must also expect from some who live under the notion of Subjects, but have no minde to be so: to wit, <q>That no man is bound to such implicite obedience, as is by me formerly set down; nor the subject obliged to obey his King commanding contrary to the Law of God and Nature.</q> And then, assuming to themselves a liberty to know, interpret, and apply these Laws, they have made that Precept of <hi>obey in all things,</hi> equivalent to <hi>obey in nothing:</hi> since that I do no more for him, then I would have done for a friend that should have entreated me: even to have satisfied his desire as far as my own Conscience or judgement did lead me.</p>
               <p>But they have not well considered, that as the reason why Children and Servants cannot follow implicite directions, is, because the Prince their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Superior, hath nowhere left the Father and Master to this liberty, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obey in all things, or the like, but on the contrary, doth expect immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and particular obedience from them, as Subjects, to many of his Laws: which, had he not, but had bidden them to <hi>Submit to those that had the rule over them, &amp; to do all things without murmurings and disputings,</hi> &amp;c. It cannot be doubted but an implicite obedience to their Parent or Master would have excused them against their Prince: inasmuch as in all those cases, where no reservation was expresly made, obedience to them was but obedience to him.</p>
               <p>Nor have they well considered the condition of humane frailty; which is, and will be, while man continues in this vail of misery, obnoxious unto sundry unavoidable inconveniences and mischiefs. It is not for men to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy their happiness can be in any thing so stated here, as not to be lyable to cross and adverse accidents: all they can do, is to bow and submit to that way and course by Providence appointed them, and where these things are least to be feared.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to those that shall object against the degree of arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness we have assigned to Princes, <q>What if Kings shall command their Subjects to commit murther, or lye with another mans wife, or the like:</q> We may make answer by another Question; Whether they think it more probable that those things should come to pass and be acted in Civil war and Anarchy (the usual remedy of this fear) when each man is left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perform what he is by natural inclination provoked unto, or when their actings, are, in that case bounded by one that can have no such self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delight therein. Where there is a King set up with due power, that can have no pleasure in any mans revenge or lust, it is not supposeable that this one person shall be alike prone to command in that kinde (nay, even to any one person) as that, the neerer provocations of Anger and Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55976:162"/>
where no irresistable power is, should universally instigate to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in order to that liberty in which each one is left.</p>
               <p>If men do really hate these and the like evils, and do accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the most sure way should be taken for their avoidance (for to do it in such degree that they shall not be supposeable to happen is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) they should then (me thinks) not countenance those maxims and courses that tend to Rebellion and Civil war. For, where it is but possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that under a Monarch equally obeyed, some things may be, at some times commanded, in case of insurrection and Civil war, it falls out of necessity that such things must be often, and more generally perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>And where, in the first case, it can never happen but with some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and remorse of the thing as evil, (whereby through Conscience or sense of honor the execution may be prevented or mitigated) here Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it self comes many times to be so blindely engaged, that each disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing party is ready to believe that their revenge and rapine against each other, is but as done against Gods enemies; and so is both duty and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him. In which case, to spare out of any natural or moral relation of Father, or Master, or the like, is all one as to prefer worldly respects to divine, and the love of men to that of God: too sad experience tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, how men, in this case, are wont to heighten one anothers rage by the abused applycation of this or such like Texts. <hi>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully: and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for fuller satisfaction in these scruples, men are to consider that as Murther, Theft, Adultery and the like are in themselves Vices notoriously destructive to humane preservation and peace, so in the eye of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it was found necessary, not onely to forbid them by express Laws and Precept from himself, but also to substitute amongst men such living Magistrates as should have the charge for the interpretation and enforcing of them. To say that any man may commit Murther, Theft, or the like, and yet commit no sin, were not to speak like a Christian; but then again, to say that the determination of what is, or is not Murther or Theft, is not left unto him that is to interpret and enforce this Law, is as erroneous and unbecoming a subject. When <hi>Moses</hi> commanded to <hi>slay every man his brother,</hi> and to borrow of the Egyptians rayment, Jewels <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> that were to look on him as the keeper and interpreter of the Law, thereby Obedience to him assayl'd both of Murther and Theft. For as these Laws (as we said) were made for the good of Society, so is their definition and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enforcement entrusted to him that hath share of each Society. In which consideration it may often fall out, that the putting of some to death by publike command, is necessary to the saving of more from being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered upon private revenge; and the confiscation of some mens estates, the ready way to secure other subjects in a more quiet possession. And if those that are by Princes in these kindes to be imployed as executioners of Justice, are not obliged to enter into the examination of the legality of the Precept or Sentence whereby any is bereft of life, liberty, or estate, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of those great inconveniences that might follow such delay or refusal; why should not Subjects in the general be held excusable by implicite obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence also? For it is nowhere found but the Subjects of the one sort do
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55976:162"/>
stand equally, and as strictly obliged as the other; and therefore, if the Prince his particular employment of some certain of his subjects this way, did, for his very Precept sake, tye them to stricter obedience, and also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them therein; what and if another subject should upon occasion be willed to act this part? What and if as many subjects as should make an Army should be called together to execute his commands upon such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of others as could not be awed by the ordinary way of Justice, (for an Army is nothing else but an extraordinary leavy of men for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vindication)? Are subjects in this case to refuse listing, till they be farther satisfied in the justice of their Soveraigns proceeding then what his Declarations doth intimate? Or may they afterwards susped execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every new Command, until they be fully satisfied in the justness thereof? If this be thought unreasonable, as the ready was to defeat all Military Discipline, so must it likewise be held destructive in Civil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings also; which is but a more stationary and setled Army; as the Army is a more moveable Commonwealth, in a more warlike posture: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience being the Life and Soul of both.</p>
               <p>But, if the Prince, upon some Reasons known to himself; command any of his Subjects to carry a Reprieve, or be otherwise instrumental in the saving of any person condemned for Murther, or Theft, or the like, is that person, that hath the life of this man now in his power, to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend or deny the prosecution of this Precept, because, for ought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him, the condemned party is not guiltless? If the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned party shall be saved by his Obedience to his Prince his Command, and shall afterwards commit more Murthers, or Thefts, or the like; on whose score score shall all these light? For it is (certainly) as well a fault to <hi>justifie</hi> and acquit the <hi>wicked,</hi>

Which case, well applyed and considered, will inform us that it is not Justice (as it is truely and really so) but that, in these kindes of determinations, we are carryed away with the natural sense of pity, and sense of honor and vulgar reputation: inasmuch as it appears more noble to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the acts of mercy and benificence, then in punishments or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations.</p>
               <p>But if after all this, the truth of what hath hitherto been delivered finde but slow belief and practise; it is not to be wondred at. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering first, that the thing it self is a mystery; <hi>even hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto Babes:</hi> that is, to them that (like Babes and Sucklings) can be content innocently to relye on Christs sincere milk of the Word, (his Precept of Love) and to draw it from the Breasts of the nursing Fathers and Mothers of the Church. To these humble souls, will God give his Grace: but will resist the proud in their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent speculations. For how is it otherwise to be hoped, but that since men do fancy themselves to have sufficiency of discretion and integrity, (which all more or less do) so proportionably, they shall also balk all guidance but their own; or (which is all one) such onely as themselves like of? For, since the Reason why I decline the others guidance to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theirs, is onely because I first found their Principles, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55976:163"/>
were such as were agreeable to mine own judgement or interest; it must then be granted, that I follow therein but my self, and also obey none other. They therefore that can well be content to acknowledge that Faith in Christ is necessary for making us capable of the blessing of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, will yet make a stand to confess it to be solely that Faith that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love, or is always ready so to do: and that then, as we cannot be Members of Christ otherwise then as by being Members of his Church, so neither of his Church, otherwise then by obedience to that power therein residing in his stead.</p>
               <p>But now, for Conclusion of this Discourse, we will see how far these things stand good and justifiable in the very light of Nature also: to the end it may finde readier entertainment, when they shall appear reasonable in humane prudence, as well as divinely positive; both that there should be an inward Plantation of Love and Charity in the Creature, to serve towards mutual affordment in the work of Providence; and that, to make this love effectual to the same end, there should be Order and Regulation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: lest through the pursuance of benificence separately and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly undertaken, the contrary might be produced. For as we have in this whole work propounded Scripture and Reason for our onely proof and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, so in this particular (as well as in all the rest) it is our endeavor to let men see the agreement of those two: and that Scripture is nothing but Reason enlightened and rectifyed; and so bringing sundry sorts of truth more neer to our understanding.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of Charity as it stands in Nature.</head>
               <p>AS some there are, who in their height of admiration of those many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent endowments and Prerogatives of mankinde, have left unto us their Eloquent and abundant discourses of his perfection and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; so others again there are, who in contemplation of his many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, pravities, and imperfections, have been as excessive in their pathetick expressions of his misery and wretchedness. And observe whom you will that write of this Subject, and do consider man in a separate condition, and you shall finde them falling into intemperance on one hand or other. Not that man is not the same he was, but the object of the comparison they still make unto him, having between him and them such large degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or meaness of beatitude or goodness, we need not wonder, if from such different conference, man arise with such like different censure and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For one sort comparing him to God, or such things as are in their speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick degree more happy or perfect, it cannot be expected but that from such a comparison he should arise other then a Creature of low and most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition and esteem. The other again, comparing him to other sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Creatures below him, must in contemplation of those many abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his (in Understanding and Will) above them, and of his more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Image of his Maker in the appetite of good, make their Discourses high in his comendations.</p>
               <p>But however his Felicity or Vertue, be thus abased or extolled, we cannot but justly esteem him positive in both: and that, though from God he differ most highly in all things in degree of perfection, yet in reality of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, he doth most remarkably retain his image and favor; and that in both kindes.</p>
               <p>As for that state of felicity which is proportionable to his degree, and proper to him as a man, none can make doubt of, that attentively considers him: nor can those miseries that befall him, be ascribed to other then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental causes; and not as arising from his natural incapacity.</p>
               <p>And let this pravity and corruption of manners be again weighed, and they will for the most part be found accidental, and unnatural also: insomuch that there is no man (nay no sensitive) that hath not his Will wholly averted from evil, as known to be such.</p>
               <p>And further, since nothing can be sin or evil, but wherein mine own or some other Creatures prejudice is reached, (to prove it is not primarily na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in us) it is to be noted that there is no Creature, but doth unfainedly and continually covet the good of both. And although the good and benefit of others, be (for reasons heretofore shewed) in case of present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition post-posed, yet are they positively and continually existent in our Wills: even so, as there was never Creature in the world, that did, or could, considerately, and unprovoked by self-respect, act, or intend the harm and prejudice of another.</p>

                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:55976:165"/>Which natural quality of Love and Charity, (belonging unto sensitive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and Creatures, as such, and according to their approach to divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, and that degree of Will and Understanding which the divine fountain of these things hath made them partakers of, in order to be the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting instruments in the course of his Providence, appears most eminently in man; as having most of God in him: that is, of this love and desire of benificence. And although Women and Children, (for want of intention or understanding sufficient) do not place their Love and Charity on so high and worthy objects as men, (unto whom the true ends of Society and honor are more apparent), yet, that this affection of love and benificence is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perpetually existent in them, is manifest by their constant exercise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of towards Dogs, Birds, Monkeys, and the like. Nay, we shall finde girls (that cannot in judgement reach so high as those) providing apparel and food for their Babies, with most high and great indulgence: as supposing they do hereby as really pleasure and benefit these, as their Parents do them. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve we again in them, what aversion they have (on the other side) to the doing of harm: even so, that from the time they do once begin to know what death is, they will not be induce to kill any thing: especially, if it have not been represented or made known unto them as a Creature very harmful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: at which time, their appetite of more general benefit may well be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to lead them thereunto. And when any doth carelesly and in sport kill innocent Creatures, it is onely want of remembrance, and full apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the true loss and suffering thereof: for had we not by incogitancy and custom been led thereunto, a man should no more kill a Fly, then a souldier without other engagement would kill a Man.</p>
               <p>Nay farther, that vindicative prosecution of other things, (as it hath its aim in Justice, and intends natural security) is a part of our divine resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: and that pravity of our Wills therein, may seem to arise from the want of right understanding of right and wrong, and of the true intentions and provocations of others to our prejudice: and not out of premised purpose of harming them, without self-respect. For it is no more possible for any man, to intend another any ill, otherwise then out of self-consideration, then it is for him to un-man himself.</p>
               <p>The particulars of our failings, and deviations from divine exemplar in harming of other things, (so as to cause sin) is therefore chiefly incogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:cy: either harming them ignorantly, or above the measure of the harme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>So that self-respect, is so far from being the sole fault that misleads us in the punishment of other things, that it is all the warrant or reason we can have for doing it. Nay so far as we do it not, we are then transgressors of Natures Law: being then onely become unlike to God our pattern, when without, or beyond, just self-consideration, we neglect their good, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their harm.</p>
               <p>And as the state of things did thus stand good in point of Nature and Reason, so still, God <hi>having given every man charge concerning his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> and bidden us <hi>love our neighbors as our selves,</hi> it alters not the first end and intention of loving my self best, but rather directs a way to it, when it doth by consequence make others good to be mine. As for example, God having now, by the Light and Precepts of Religion, reserved to himself all execution of injury and revenge, and (the better to provoke our reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Wills to the obedience hereof, and to the entertainment of patience,) having annexed promises and threats of highest nature, to encourage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us herein, it will follow, that since divine command is now stept in, the case of benefit arising by private revenge stands altered in true Reason; and will, (if pursued,) prove a ready course to bring upon my self the like, or greater mischief it strived to inflict: by making me lyable (in that regard) to the vengeance of an irresistable and all powerful deity. Whereas, if I love and serve God, or do good to my neighbor as my self; as God requires, I shall thereby, most assuredly do and seek mine own good, as Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns.</p>
               <p>Now, as all Sensitive Agents have (as we said) so much of God in them as to have a continual readiness and inclination to acts of beneficence, (as may appear by their readiness in acts of pity and succor) so man hath it most as most resembling him: Insomuch as there is not any one, but had he unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and irresistable power, would make it his whole endeavor (af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor can he act or intend the harm of any thing as it stands a Creature in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but onely as in consideration of its inclination and readiness to harm o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: which must still carry on the proof of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s general intention to benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial performances. Nay, in our most firce pursuits of revenge against any one or few, it is still by us designed and intended, as a way to acquire advantage to the atchieving a more high and general benefit to others. For let all our endeavours be observed, (for the attaining power or riches, beyond personal use or expence), and they will be found of direct intention that we may thereby be able to lay obligations on others.</p>
               <p>As this (I say) will be found true in the first intentions of all such as do set themselves for the gaining any eminence of honor or greatness, so from hence, we may discover the ground of that peremptory desire and presumti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of success, that each one concludes should answer the reasonableness of their own designs. Which, as it is made good use of by Fortune-tellers, in their constant promises of good luck, so is it the great cause of State alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: even because each one, being to himself more presuming of his good intentions and deserts, then of the contrary, he is thereupon more ready to entertain hopes of increase by change, then fear of miscarriage therein, from the examples of other mens misfortunes happening upon like occasion: of whose good intentions he could have no knowledge at all, but might well have observed them, to have done both imprudently and ill. In which, or the like enterprizes, being again by the will of others hindered, hence it is also, that those passions, first of Anger, and then of Revenge, do in each one: arise namely from the testimony of his own Conscience, of the benefit and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his own ends by him designed, when he shall be seated in his power. For although Custom of Revenge, do (like Custom in all other sins), beget many times prosecution, even out of the pleasure thereby onely arising, yet this must be ascribed to the pravity of unbridled Custom, and not as growing out of pure Nature; which hath in each Creature primarily placed a desire of beneficence; even so eminently and apparently, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm, that in the worst of actions which was ever yet perpetrated by any, the project and design of good and beneficence was still in intention: and that, that very act of Revenge it self, was but executed as proceding of discontent in being therein hindred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:55976:166"/>Where is then mans fault, if it be not in the Will to good, but for want of knowledge which he could not remedy? Nor seems the disturbance of other things to be his fault either, since they first make a disturbance to him, and what he doth is but to remove it, that thereby the intended good may proceed? Yes, he hath his fault in them both: even because, through plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of present revenge, he neglects to consider of the prejudices and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of other things through his means; and this in most things he hath abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to do. In which course if he fail through want of knowledge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it excuses not, but adds to his fault: because (as heretofore declared) he presumed upon the guidance of his own knowledge herein.</p>
               <p>Another fault is want of equity; in fancying his desires and actings high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then the poize of his equality with other things would bear: and from thence comes his injustice, in ballancing distributory and vindicative prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. For man being placed amongst others his equals, cannot, but, with the same appetite that leads him to affect himself above others (in regard he knows his own good intentions and not theirs,) come also in his acts to be unjust to others; and this, because he must be partial. For, taking upon him to be judge and director, according to this particular light and interest, he must in his proceedings be unjust. Whereas onely God Almighty, that hath whole, and equal interest and knowledge in all things, and is not capable of personal injury or wrong (otherwise then by having his Creatures wronged) cannot in his punishment of his Creatures be unjust: because he doth it for their sakes; in that he had the onely consideration of their general benefit the cause and measure thereof. But man must be so far partial and unjust, as he is patible in the cause he judges, or differently interessed in the parties.</p>
               <p>And were any like <hi>Adam</hi> at first, put to be amongst all sorts of Creatures so far below him, where his actions without impeachment might take place, and in whose benefits he had entire and equal share, he would no doubt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in all things with great justice, according to his measure of knowledge. But because there is no man, but (let alone), would be like a God also over all his fellows; and would (if his wish might take place), arise from one degree of eminence unto another, until he had gotten absolute power of conferring all benefits and receiving all honors; it became necessary in stay of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that might hereby grow, for God to come in with his positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of lowliness, humility, brotherly love, and love to our neigbour as our selves. Whereby we come to be put in minde, that as the honor and thanks of beneficent actions, is onely at his dispose that is the fountain of good; so others are of as great concern as our selves: none having farther power of acting therein then from God received. And that however this appetite of search of honor and pleasuring others, were divine and useful, we should notwithstanding (in the particulars wherein anothers interest is concerned as well as our own) not proceed without leave of him that hath whole inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
               <p>For if men can at all be differenced from one another in their actings, in respect of good and bad, just and unjust, (so far as to make them warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or not), it must arise from the difference of that additional light and warrant they shall be helped to from without and above themselves. For since all men (as bearing Gods Image) are by that higher part of their minde (which we call Synterysis) universally and continually assenting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55976:166"/>
to the general Rules of Justice and Probity (which we call the Laws of Nature) if they be not by others farther helped in the exercise of these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, (at such time as they come to make them frameable to use), it will happen, that since each single person did from divers instances and inductions of his own framing and collection, raise and conclude these maxims to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, they must also diversly, as well as fallibly, demean themselves, when they come to descend to the particular application of them, in those emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies which concern our moral duties and sociable abearances, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted.</p>
               <p>As for example, all men of ordinary discourse and reason do knowingly and unfeignedly assent to those general moral maxims, of God to be worshipped and served, Parents to be honored, Theft, Murther, Adultery, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be punished, and the like: yet since this they do, as thereunto lead from their own several observations, of the mischiefs following or to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the contrary practises or neglect of these things, it must follow, that as men come differently to raise these conclusions, so must these prejudices and prepossessions differently byass and direct them again, when they come to refer back and apply them to particular use and action. Whereupon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all men do agree to the reasonableness of Gods worship and Service, and the punishment of Vice, and reward of Vertue; yet will it be hard to finde any considerable number directly to agree wherein, and in what sort this worship is to be manifested: and so again, how to state and bound each Vertue or Vice, and to proportion their just rewards or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>In which regard, as a divers ability, interest, and prepossession, will make men disagree in what is Adultery, Murther, Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and how far punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; so may the like considerations generally cause aversion, from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining other moral maxims as necessary as these: nay more (indeed) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their support and foundation. As for example, in that of implicit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. For as publike preservation and good doth depend on the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and punishment of Vertue and Vice; so doth the same again, depend on the maintenance of his Authority that is to have the trust therein: And therefore by right reason, should this have been set down in the first place, and next to our obedience to God, had not thirst of licenciousness made men (in all conclusions and maxims of subjection and obedience) to fancy the greatest number of restraints and qualifications, to be observed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of such Superiors whose places themselves should never probably act, (as to Princes or the like) and on the contrary place more implicite obedience towards Parents, Masters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Offices themselves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did, or were likely to supply. As if those that had the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and trust, were upon good reason to have the least power to see the same performed.</p>
               <p>But these things seem naturally to fall upon us: for as every man doth submit to Government in general, out of consideration of his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate good to be therein enjoyed; and not out of care advance the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, otherwise then in order thereunto; so must it again fall out, that in all deliberations for the manner or measure of exercise thereof, that form of administration should be still chosen, that in each parties judgement affords to himself most full and free enjoyment: placing his first respect to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55976:167"/>
his own particular, and regarding the publike but in order thereuto: from whence such difference of judgement in forms of Government do arise. And from hence also it comes to pass, that the Subjects in Polarchies are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (upon experience) more complaining and desirous to return under Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy again, then they were at first to abandon it: even because they now finde themselves deluded, and defeated of that share and degree of Power and Government, which they upon their princes removal did before vainly expect.</p>
               <p>By all which it will appear, that intention of good according to our own light, cannot estate any guiltless, for then all would be so: but publike good must arise by joynt submission unto one Judge of common good. Else it will prove that this strong desire to do good, will be the continual cause of harm. For malice it self being but in order to envy and revenge, if men are no farther enclined to such like prosecution (as before noted) then as being hindered in their own way of doing good, it must then follow, that to do good disorderly is the ready way to be malicious. For though the will to good must always reside in private and separate persons, yet the understanding and direction thereof, must be conform to such as are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: and the judgement of such as are under subjection, is to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in knowing what, but not why to obey.</p>
               <p>By which means we shall preserve and maintain undenyably that which is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e most general and highest step to Providence and general benefit, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publike peace. Whereas pursuing our neighbors benefit according to rules and ways of our own framing, the truth of our private speculations towards beneficence, can be but as contingent (if not more) then that of Authority: and must by the distraction of mine own and others obedience, (through exemplar encouragement for each one to follow his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ways and acts of benoficence), unavoidably defeat all publike good and Charity: in defeating the bond of peace, that unity of direction that should have led thereunto.</p>
               <p>For upon the same warrant I follow mine own, or others private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against publike command now, I may do so again: as often as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or really conceive, my neighbors good to be thereby encreased. And the same liberty being taken by others also, what can follow, but that men differently acting and obeying, according to different Consciences and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, they must force difference to arise amongst themselves in their services one towards another: to the final overthrow of Charity and publike good?</p>
               <p>As for example, I, that am unknowing or heedless of the good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of strangers and such as are more remote, in comparison of those neer me and such as I converse with; and which must again, make such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between those which are of my neighborhood, in respect of that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent affection I shall cast towards them, as they have in particular friendships and kindnesses deserved at my hands, or do in affections or interests simpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize and comply with me; cannot thereupon, but out of this my unequal regard, dispense so unequally of my Charity, that those I know not shall have no share or provision at all, and of those I do know, either through contrariety of humor, or thwarting of designs, some will come to be esteemed and prosecuted as enemies: even for that they stood contrary in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55976:167"/>
affection or act, to that way or course I had resolved on, or put in practice for the advancement of the good of those which I esteemed more: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my particular kindred or friends. Whereupon, another (again) that held greater relation or friendship to those I slighted or disesteemed, was thereupon induced, from the height of my more fierce and private love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the promoting the good of these above others whom he loved bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to labor (on the contrary) the hindrance and harm of them above others. By which means it shall come to pass, that each subject in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar shall be truely wanting of his due measure of Charity and beneficence, in execution and enjoyment, whilst, through private design and power, the same is onely measured and practised: even, to the overthrow of all true Charity, and publike peace also.</p>
               <p>The which considerations well weighed, might methinks perswade any to the obedience of Christ in his deputed Minister, for direction of their Charity. Namely to consider, that since love and propension to acts of beneficence, were placed in us for publike good sake, and for that of others more then of their own; it is therefore reason, we should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be therein guided by the publike direction of others also. Whom obeying according to Christs Precept given to that very end,<note place="margin">Phil.2.14.</note> of <hi>doing all things without murmuring and disputing,</hi> why should we doubt <hi>of being blameless and harmless the sons of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> and having really loved others as our selves, and so performed the moral Law, since we have submitted to act according thereunto?</p>
               <p>Wherefore the summe of all is, <hi>That God made man upright,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles.7, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>but he sought out many inventions.</hi> And that therefore publick good acted by private direction onely, is always evil: and the more intently and confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so done, the more evil. That private equity, is publike iniquity. That that natural former inclination to beneficence, which leant on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our dark fleshly wisdom, ayming at, (and so corrupted through) original pride and presumption of our own managery, is to be now aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: and <hi>we renewed in the spirit of our mindes through love</hi> (and its fruits) <hi>Meekness, Gentleness, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. Which inward root of love, as it comes from God onely, so is it at his onely dispose: being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by obedience to him, or Officers holding direct Authority from and under him.</p>
               <p>By which means, we may perceive how Nature comes to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Grace; and how that natural and original intention to beneficence that through our fall was defeated by pride, comes to be made useful by the Gospel light and directions of Obedience, Humility, Long-suffering, Patience, Meekness, Gentleness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this inward root of love being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to bridle us against envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitable actings against others; even so far, as according to the light of our own Conscience, (not otherwise authorized) we are to <hi>abstain from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.22.</note> By which means God that could never act contrary to to himself, or to the defeating of his own work or end (which could never be but perfect, and in it self worthy of preservation), doth by Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store and rectifie what in our fall had been corrupted. Thus that love which Nature provokes me to express out of inward delight, Religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns and directs me to execute according to explicite precept. That good which, for Honor or Vertue sake, I seek to act as a moral man, I must now, for Duty and Conscience sake, re-inforce and prosecute as a Christian.

That degree of beneficence, which in nature I might arbitrarily and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently dispense, according to mine own relations of Family, Friends, or the like: I must now, according to the tye of conscience and subjection, distribute indifferently, or according to such rules, as he that hath publike charge shall direct.</p>
               <p>For our state of innocency consisteth more in negative, then in positive acts; that is, more in being harmless, then beneficial; because innocence (or abstinence from harm) is always a praise, and compatible to all men (inferior as well as others) but to be positively beneficial, is the attribute and sole honor of the Fountain of good; and is to mankind no otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable and proper, then as impowered and deputed from him, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his stead. And therefore is <hi>Lord</hi> said <hi>to be the fulfilling of the Law, because it worketh no ill to his neighbor:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom.13.10.</note> And, in that Chapter, as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Higher Power</hi> is most strictly enjoyned, and may be understood compleating the Precepts of the first Table, and so inclusive of that Law of, <hi>Honor thy father and mother:</hi> So is the <hi>love of our neighbors as our selves,</hi> set all down in negative Precepts, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, our justification, and the forgiveness of our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and sins against God, is made to depend most on our forgiving one another: which was chiefly hinted at in that perfect model of Prayer, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us:</hi> Heaven it self being the reward of our innocence, not of our merit, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot without derogation to Gods honor, take on us to act in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of beneficence without him. And so again, the Devil being the father of malice, the more we take upon us to act therein, the more we shew our selves his servants: Of which his delight in malice, contrary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of love, we have a plain instance in Witches, who spend their whole power in things destructive and mischievous, being wholly swayed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of revenge, which as it did at first grow from being crossed in their own designs, so they had beneficence in their aims. And therefore, so far as any is malicious to others (that is, is wilfully set to prosecute his own ways of doing future good by present evil) so far hath he listed himself under this Destroyer, and thrust himself out of Divine favour and protection, by renouncing Divine obedience;<note place="margin">1 John. 3.14.</note> whereas others may know they <hi>are passed from death to life, not only because they love the brethren</hi>; but also for that they are obedient to Gods minister in the manner thereof.</p>
               <p>For without God, every one may be truly said to act, that hath not from him as great and full direction and authority as was in his power to procure, even in that particular in which he acts; but doth relie only on such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral directions, as were (for ought he knows) not proper to the cause in question: And so not being by Gods Minister interpreted and warranted, as to license therein, he must remain still, as much as before, without true warrant to act on another; and the other again, without just cause of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at his hands. For since both of these, having from Reason and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alike power to judge, interpret and impose upon each other, he must be concluded to have been most innocent, and obeyed God most, that hath most obeyed his Vicegerent, and stuck to his direction therein. And this, because the positive Precepts of Scripture and Religion, coming only to supply, and make more applyable those general and ambiguous rules of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason, to which end determinate Interpreters were again put to see
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55976:169"/>
the meaning of these Scriptures applyed to these cases and persons unto which they are proper) it must thereupon follow, that as those that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to judge cases by the light of nature only (without regard therein had to Scripture) cannot in so doing be guiltless; so also they that undertake to be their own judges from the immediate rules of Scripture, and do balk the the direction of the authorized Intepreter and Keeper, they must thereby become lyable to guilt also.</p>
               <p>So that now, to sum up all these Discourses concerning love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is still to shew how men under the second <hi>Adam,</hi> stand (in respect of works) in a like condition for innocence as they did at first. For as then, the only Precept was to forbear tasting of the knowledge of good and evil, even so it is the only Precept still. For so much (in brief) our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour explains, saying, <hi>For judgement am I come into this world, that they which see not, might see; and they that see, might be made blind:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 9.39.</note> And again (as before noted) answered those that presumed to derive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Righteousness from their own light. <hi>If ye were blind ye should have no sin: But now ye say we see, therefore your sin remaineth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 41.</note> The which and other places, are certainly plain enough to convince any whom <hi>The God of this World</hi> hath not blinded to their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>And however formerly amongst the Jews, where God was immediate Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and by plain litteral Precepts did set down his pleasure to be observed by each one in particular, the differencing of obedience into active and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive was useful; that thereby upon occasion subjects might perform their duties to God and his Vicegerent also; as also it was before the higher Powers were Christians; yet now, unto Christian Subjects, that have not from Christ rules set down for their external abearance one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (but they are to be taught his commands from his Deputies and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors) the case is otherwise, For so the words are, <hi>Teaching them to observe whatsoever I have commanded you</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> not what I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. So that, when subjects are by their Christian head now commanded to be actively obedient in any thing, they are then disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent if they are not so; because where doing is required, their doing to their power, and not their suffering, must shew their obedience. For as I cannot find that the Crown of Martyrdom was promised to any, but such as were persecuted for the name of Christ, or Christianity (which in Heathenish persecutions was to come to pass) so cannot I tell what other title then that of Rebel,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.18, 22. Mark 13.9, 13.</note> to give to such as oppose or resist their Christian Prince.</p>
               <p>Nor can I find what other reason to give for that expression of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, saying, that God <hi>hath given him authority to execute judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 5:27:</note> 
                  <hi>because he is the son of man,</hi> then thereby to shew how God, in his recess from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of earthly judicature, doth not take upon him to set down rules for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obedience, immediately from himself, under the Gospel, as formerly under the Law; but mediately, by humane instruments; &amp; that as the salvation of our souls, and also of our bodies, was committed unto him that had taken our whole nature upon him (and so he might be called the Son of man as well as the Son of God) so this salvation of our bodies (which is the object of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Society, and of all things pertaining to judgment and morality) being not by him to be personally managed, it must be done by these more
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55976:170"/>
eminent Sons of Men, each Christian Prince. And surely, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours frequent assumption unto himself of this expression, <hi>The Son of man,</hi> is not to be construed impertinently or casually done; so will it clearly explain, that as God hath referred all judgement to him, that contains in his own person the radical excellence of our nature, and that because <hi>he is the Son of man:</hi> even so (and to the same end) are these other more eminent Sons of men to be in matters of judgement obeyed in his stead. And if the method and order of dispensation used by that great and wise Creator and Disposer of all things be duly observed, we shall finde, that as in order to continuance and preservation of men (both personally, and in their kind) he hath not only implanted those natural provocations to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure heretofore spoken of, but also that natural readiness to acts of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and kindness, as now declared: so, to prevent all such abuses as might arise through the exorbitant or irregular use of things thus naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed (and likely thereupon to be as violently coveted) we may also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Divine bounty and providence, to be as continually intent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in restoring and assisting of us, being lasped, as at first to create and state us happy.</p>
               <p>The food which we take, as it hath in it self personal respect only, so hath it in each one a proper way of judicature to determine both of choyce and satiety, as well as of appetite and hunger. In those other inclinations that have aim beyond the party acting (the one for bringing men into the world, and the other for preserving and advantaging of them, being there) they also, by divine appointment, are to have their publike rules of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and limitation, set down by those Societies of men wherein they are to be exercised; lest else, the means might prove distructive of its own end. For I that in nature, and as a man, could not more kind-like, or meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously imploy my self, then in such like actions, may yet, by intemperance or partiality in prosecution, prove my self to be in these things more highly ignoble and vitious, then in any thing else.</p>
               <p>As for those rules and restraints put upon mens acting in the first sort, by the appointment and limitation of Wed-lock, or for avoiding of unchaste acts, none do doubt of the fitness of positive direction and evidence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in order to publike benefit, although against the good liking of the obeyer: Whereas, if publike good were rightly known, and weighed, the other, that hath a more high and general influence thereupon (even as it is more continually practicable by each person) ought also much more to have its directions and confinements set down by publike appointment; for else it may happen, that that more particular regard towards those of mine own family, and other relations; which might at first arise from the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage tye, and that precept of a mans providing <hi>for his own family,</hi> might from too eager love fixed on some, contract by consequent, as great hatred and neglect towards others, whereby to destroy in the street, that which was thus carefully preserved in the house. For as it is observed in the food of our natural bodies, that the greatest and most dangerous surfeits do arise from the inordinate and irregular use of that which is in it self most wholsom and best; even so in the politick frame, there is nothing which more usually, or with greater danger, doth procure the disturbance and dissolution thereof, then this arbitrary application of our loves, even when we as men, do so far follow our own natural tye of affection and interest in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55976:170"/>
the placing of our good deeds, as to be neglectful of that our more high and near kindred and relation we have towards them as Christians: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as that common and equal affinity of <hi>Brotherhood</hi> and <hi>Fellow-members,</hi> is always to fill us with due readiness to be beneficent to all, so must it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and differenced in choyce of object, and degree of exercise, by Laws and Rules received from him that hath the common Headship and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency herein.</p>
               <p>And if such a liberty to dispute the warrantableness of commands, should be left as some men do insist upon, strange it is, that amongst all those large and express Precepts for general obedience; as, <hi>Obey in all things; D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> all things without disputing, &amp;c.</hi> that no destinction of duties into civil and religious is ever made, nor exception set down of unlawful commands. But if men could but a little separate themselves from their own humors, and that conceitedness of their private abilities in judging good and bad, they would then find the judgement and interpretation of these things, must be supposed left to their Christian Superior, or else large volumns should have been left, comprizing in every particular what duties and actions were to be held Civil, and what Religious; and what lawful and what nor; because otherwise, the liberty of disputing of these things, would render men truly obedient in nothing; and thereupon also make the said Precepts vainly given.</p>
               <p>And having so far shewed how the Precepts of General Good and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity stand pointed out in Scripture and Reason, as the duty of each one in particular, and under the pain of most heavy guilt and punishment; and how it is best effected by obedience; it seems now requisite, to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing also of those benefits and advantages which will hereby acrew, even unto the particular persons that imploy themselves herein, and out of duty undergo those difficulties and hardships which usually attend this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: As of Patience, Humility, Gentleness, Meekness, Long-suffering, &amp;c.

               <p>HE that shall well consider that great and sudden growth of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen Empire, shall never be able to stop his admiration therein, till he consider withal, the prevalence of those enchanting promises of sensual delights and rewards, in that Religion offered to the Sectators thereof: For while <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself, is standing (like the Devil) on his high Mountain of Prosperity, and offering <hi>the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 4.8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>to such as would fall down and worship him:</hi> Who can expect other event, then such a crowd of followers? when, on the other side, worldly peace and prosperity was not only not promised, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary prophesied to be the usual lot of such as should list themselves in Christs service. For as our Saviour was content to become vile in all worldly esteem himself, so did he plainly profess, that <hi>the Disciple was not to be above his Master</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 10.24.</note> and that <hi>whosoever would be his, must (thereupon) take up his cross and follow him</hi>; that is, follow him in meekness, patience, long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which doing, they should not yet be so unhappy (even in this life) as worldly and ordinary judgements might conceive. For as in him, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of humbling and subjecting himself (in obedience to God) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with as great eminence in honor,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and a name above all names:</hi> So to us, that shall be obedient and subject to him, and such as shall command in his stead, those present pressures, which the practise of these graces should cause,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 14.7.</note> will not only be sure to be rewarded with <hi>an exceeding and eternal, weight of glory</hi> hereafter, but even here also, the unprejudiced and sound judgements of men, may from the practise of these vertues discern a present benefit to arise: and that, not only to mankind in general, but even to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who shall conscionably undergo them as his duty; who shall find <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to have the reward</hi> (as well as promises) <hi>of both lives; as well of this, as that which is to come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>All which will be plainly made good to them, in the judgement of any that hath but so far pierced into the true state of things, as to find that happiness consisteth in the measure of enjoyment and content; and not in the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our covetousness and anxiety. Therefore, as we formerly noted (in the Prophesie concerning the flourishing estates of whole Regions and People in general) that the promise and designment of the Jews or others for having of Kings, was when they <hi>should possess their land, and dwell therein</hi>; so in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the firm and real possession of each single Christian,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.14.</note> that former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of the prosperous condition of the Church under the Gospel, is made good; namely, <hi>that the meek should inherit the earth</hi>? for although som haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and turbulent persons have more of possessions under their present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,<note place="margin">Psal. 37.11.</note> yet canot they in any true sense be said to possess &amp; inherit them, becaus labour in acquisition, and fear of loss, together with the distraction which the thought of other acquisition and conquest must produce, and above all want
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55976:171"/>
of faith in God (and so assurance of good enjoying them) will all of them render these men (at best) but unsteady usurpers.</p>
               <p>For as we cannot say of any whole people: they are in a true state of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and dwelling in any Countrey, which is by them but newly acquired, and that by force; and unto which claim is openly laid by others, or in the possession whereof they have no agreement amongst themselves; even so, single persons are then to be esteemed true Inheritors of their earthly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, when they have assurance it is because their hope is in God: even that it is sent unto them from him, by means of a just expectation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor; and can in a pious degree of humility, acknowledge, <hi>It is not by their own bow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 44.6:</note> 
                  <hi>nor by their own sword</hi> (that is, not by their wisdom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance gotten) but through the bounty of that Eternal Fountain of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the giver <hi>of every good and perfect gift.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 1.17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is that estate of Christian Fortitude and Perfection, which now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the glorious rayes of the Gospel, comes to be so clearly shewn to the sons of men. It is through this assurance and grace, that the patient and meek can in the midst of all violence, find themselves <hi>more then Conquerors.</hi> For first, having confidence of Gods care of them in all things through Christ (<hi>so as to make all things work for the good of them that love him</hi>) as they cannot (on the one hand) but think themselves highly in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>that hath given unto them not only to believe,</hi>

                  <hi>but also to suffer for his sake</hi>; so can they not, but from this measure of affliction plainly gather, that he reckons their Christian grace of patience at such a great perfection, as to call them into so great sufferings: For as <hi>he will lay on his children no greater burthen then they can bear,</hi> so thereupon they cannot but in a double Obligation, acknowledge themselves tyed to Obedience and Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>In the old World, where little besides the light of Nature was left for direction, how did the violence of those <hi>Men of Renown,</hi> work to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of themselves and others, in their erronious prosecution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and happiness, under the maxims of <hi>Quicquid libet licet.</hi> Under the Law, men were brought to moderation, <hi>An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</hi>: but this looking still with a face of revenge, was to be perfected by Precepts from the only Patern and Doctor of Divine Wisdom and Perfection, Christ himself: <hi>I say unto you, love your enemies, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.44.</note> A Lesson and Direction of such truth and concern in it self, for and towards the stating and possessing, even of temporal felicity and peace amongst us, that should we consider it abstracted from that authority whence we had it, yet would it for its own sake deserve our entertainment, and that in the eye of bare natural reason and policy.</p>
               <p>For we cannot consider men in their commerce one with another, at any such constant rate of goodness and perfection, but that interest or insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, will ordinarily lead them to the envying of one another: In which case, if it should be allowed each person (according to his presumption of the right thereof) to proceed to revenge and self-repairation, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of peace? And although for peace sake, the Law provide against ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal private prosecution, by appointment of a common Judge; yet, while the root of mischief is remaining within, how oft will power and craft find evasion, to act its own malice to publike disturbance? besides, that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which this restless passion must breed in the party possessed with this
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55976:172"/>
Devil, not otherwise to be cast out or cured, but by this command of Christ himself.</p>
               <p>And although to the most wise and learned amongst the Heathen, God would not afford any through light herein; yet may we discover and admire the prevalence of that truth, which should enable them with such large spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and progression this way: so that as well in Philosophical Doctrine, as Heroical practise, they could discern and prefer it as a complement and crown to their other vertues. For what had Pride, Revenge, or Arrogance (with their turbulent deportments) to do with Prudence, or in the seat of Justice? How could those things lead to temperance, which were even in their own nature intemperate? And since vertue and felicity, must be in the even temper of the mind; how shall we find them, where these passions (by their abode) have first overthrown all moderation? And so lastly, if the end of Fortitude be to overcome evils, what other way shall we so assuredly do it, as with such fortification of our minds; whereby they shall not so much as seem evils at all, but rather blessings and benefits? Whereas (alas) to others, who are ignorantly and impetuously whirled with the thirst of honor, riches, or worldly pleasure of any sort; how often must those crosses and thwartings (in their attainment and possession) which they must encounter from the hands of Competitors, render them through revenge, anger, and discontent, not only most afflictedly defeated of that particular, but through sense hereof, deprived of all their possessions else.</p>
               <p>Or could you fancy a person (like <hi>Solomon,</hi> uncrossed of all that could in this world be asked; yet he (as in his experience and true wisdom) shall tell you (as if set up on purpose) <hi>That all is vanity and vexation of spirit</hi>; nay, all of them in their fullest glut,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.17.</note> falling far short of the shortest moment of that content (much less of that steady lasting content) which his meek and pious father took, in <hi>that gladness which God put into his heart</hi>; and that <hi>in comparison of other mens corn and wine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 4.7.</note> or any other temporal felicity. When God gave him peace, it was (by reason of his meek and grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance) made to him <hi>the blessing of peace:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 29.11.</note> nay, when he came to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, this (as it wrought faith in God) <hi>he acknowledgeth it to be good for him also</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.75. Phil. 4.11.</note> For he had well practised the state of Christianity, <hi>in whatsoever estate, he was to be therewith content:</hi> And as he stood in his God thus steady <hi>like a tree plant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <note place="margin">Psal. 1.3.</note> he beheld the ungodly (in their unbottomed condition) <hi>driven to and fro like chaff upon the face of the earth:</hi> neither had they (like him) <hi>a father in heaven,</hi> to seek daily bread from; but it was first their curse and unhappiness to have no trusty and steady support for food (but to <hi>seek it in desolate places, wandering up and down)</hi> and then also,<note place="margin">Psal. 59.15.</note> 
                  <hi>to grudge if they be not satisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or let us suppose again, any person at the higest pitch of power, so as to be able to recompence all those his conceited injuries and displeasures which must befall him with revenge; yet how shall we ever find this remedy, to do none other then encrease his disease? For while he is taking it, how much trouble will this passion put him into, and yet be both as unsatisfactory then, of having done it full enough, as afterwards (even out of the natural sense of pitty) how vvill he find himself troubled vvith perpetual reluctance, of having done so much? For vvhen he shall be restored to his reason again, he must find, that vvhilst he hath been judging another, he hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning himself. For vvas not the harm done by another, given as the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55976:172"/>
reason of this revenge? well then, since hereby he hath not, nor cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the harm or loss, it must fall out, that so far as he is punishing him, he is arraigning himself: First as rebel to God, in dethroning him or his sole Prerogative <hi>Of repaying with vengeance:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.35.</note> And then (having by the very act of revenge it self broken the Precept of love) what juster punishment can he expect, then that, as he hath with high and malicious contrivance plotted and acted the harm of another, and that only as in the Devils stead (with express desire and pleasure in mischief, without expectation of repair to himself) so should he be left to the reward of that Master he hath so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully served.</p>
               <p>And then farther, this act of revenge is so far from abating or allaying the pressing tortures of this passion (which un-erring truth justly calls <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling with mischief)</hi> that it necessarily encreaseth it:<note place="margin">Psal. 7.14.</note> For the more and higher it works, the greater discontent and murmure will it draw down from the friends of the oppressed. And then, since none can in this case want friends and pittiers, this must again (by new objects) give occasion of new anger, and therewith of new revenge. Whereas accustomed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, not onely enables us in the enduring of present sufferings: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is (by its habit) the true and onely relisher of all blessings when they come: no otherwise, then abstinence or course food is too dainty fare afterwards: which is but loathsom to persons glutted therewith. For all pleasure being absence of pain, as health is of sickness; and arising there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be encreased according to present sense of contrariety, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that as sense of pain and want did precede, so will sense of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and possession (in measure) succeed: patience equally enabling us to sustain evil with less grief, as to entertain good with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>In which respect, we may well find how those Gospel Promises came to be made good, of, <hi>Whosoever hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wise, or children, or lands for my sake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 10.29.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels: he shall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houses, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come eternal life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 30.</note> Which words (with persecution) plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew us, that separate persons can have such large restauration made good to them in this life by no other way, then by that formerly set down: which (if rightly weighed) will be such a high recompence indeed, as if each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian formerly deprived of these things for Christs sake, or each Christian subject now deprived for the Gospel of peace sake, had, or could have had, these things in kind restored.</p>
               <p>All which well observed, would make the condition of Kings and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not so much desirable by Subjects and Inferiors; even for that the fare and usage proper to them (which in regard of scarcity with us, we call dainty) is, by reason of commonness, with them more loathsome then ours; whose freedom they often envy, being themselves so enclosed and imprisoned with set order, and multitude of ceremonies and attendants, that they esteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves then only at liberty, when they can most imitate and practice the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our condition.</p>
               <p>But the weakness of this passion being so well found in natural reason and example, I may leave it as a common place sufficiently treated of. For how many and eminent are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ese instances (even amongst Heathens)
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:55976:173"/>
of such as would not acknowledge their Prosecutors power, or their own weakness so far, as to prove by repine or desire of revenge, that they were more then they could bear: and did therefore usually leave this pusillanimous part, to be acted by the weaker tempers of women and children.</p>
               <p>But as for Precepts this way set down in Scripture, I believe, that, next to the Doctrine of Faith in Christ (which must precede, as well as be accompanied with these vertues) these Lessons of Patience, Humility, &amp;c. will be found the chief drift of the Gospel: if not the only Precepts, that private persons can of their own judgements relye upon: they proceeding from the same Precept of Love and Charity. These teaching us how with Charity to suffer from others: as the orher doth, how to be inwardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in my actings towards them.</p>
               <p>For as, <hi>Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning</hi>; so was it done, that <hi>we, through Patience and comfort of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> (that is, through the Precepts and Examples thereof, therein set down as practised, and the comfort and reward thereof thence also arising) <hi>might have hope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15 4.</note> and encouragement to the performance of the like duties: that through the grace and goodness <hi>of the God of patience and consolation,</hi> we may be hereby enabled <hi>to be like minded one towards another, according to Christ Jesus</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 5. Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es 1.2.</note> And so, be, not only actively charitable, whilst (in things in our power) each one shall not <hi>seek to please himself, but his neighbour:</hi> but also, the same example will teach us to be passively charitable too, by our readiness to submit to authority, the only way to the peace and unity of the Church;<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> that therein with <hi>one mind, and one mouth, we may glorifie God, even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However I cannot tell, whether (from these lights) I have given sufficient reason or no, for casting off revenge and disobedience, and entertainment of patience and humility; yet sure I am, that I can by mine own good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence say, that as I become every day a more true Disciple of my Saviour, even by <hi>willingly taking up my cross and following him</hi>;<note place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note> and that, as I do more and more consider, that slander, persecution and all worldly afflictions, when suffered for, or in a good conscience (which may be best known by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and wickedness of the persecutors) are not only testimonies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity (in order to his predictions that way given) but also of Gods more especial and fatherly favour (<hi>that chasteneth every son whom he loveth</hi>) So do I more and more encrease every day in true comfort:<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.6.</note> Even from the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance I thereby gather of Gods protection and care of me; and that in a far higher and more setled degree, then any revenge by my self formerly taken could afford.</p>
               <p>Nor can I, or any man else (that considers these usuages of God with a well measured judgement) but thereby find advantage to arise even in this worlds consideration also: It faring no otherewise with men in the behalf of their Reputation and Honour, then in consideration of worldly estate and fortune. For as he that will always be living at the height of his fortune, will be so much the nearer to poverty, by how much he is more expensive and in the sight of envy, and yet have no more true inward content then others; even so, such as live in the height of reputation, must be subject to the same diminutions and hazard: for when those faults which really all men must more or less have, or those which meer envy shall discover, shall be divulged
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55976:173"/>
to the world; he cannot then but be rendred, both to other men, so much the more ill, by how much he hath formerly been held more good: and to himself (hereby) so much more miserable, by how much he deemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before more happy. Whereas he that is really good, cannot but be always in a thriving and prosperous condition; although that steady course of vertue and honesty which he walks in, may through difference of the common practise of the World (as making God and his Neighbours good his aym, and not Covetousness or Vain-Glory) make him to differ from the rest of the World in his Deportments, and so for a time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please.</p>
               <p>For a time I say: For as men can never wholly banish truth, so this mans innocence and integrity, cannot but by degrees appear; at which time, the very height of former calumny, will redound to his encrease of reputation. And, all men being ready to take occasions for extolling their own abilities in matters of extraordinary discovery, they will from hence, take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the more to set forth and admire this mans Merits or Innocence; even for that others have heretofore so much leaned to the contrary. Which Commendations again, growing to this party by continual encrease and degrees, and those deserved; must thereby render him also in point of reputation, both continually prosperous, and likewise steady therein.</p>
               <p>But, if it fall out otherwise, and that Gods love to us, above the rest of the world, shall be made farther appear by their unjust and oppressive usage of us in matters of our estates, or by the dislike and rejection of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by such as are riotous or factious; as we have hereby fresh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our selves, in respect of our Christian Faith and Assurance (in order to Gods promises made that way) so may we also reap true inward content, even in point of Heroick Resolution and Prudence: out of the consideration, that this their mislike of our cause or carriage, arose not from any well grounded estimate of justice or vertue. Vulgar justice being many times nothing else but the effect of Bribery, Importunity, Friendship, or the knotting together of some party for the preferring some such mans cause as hath insinuated himself into most favour. The which cannot be expected from him that hath his confidence so much in God and the goodness of his cause, that he cannot, he dare not, distrust provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so far, as not to resolve on and prefer a noble suffering before an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prevention.</p>
               <p>And so again, in point of civil behaviour, and in that reputation which is to be expected from mens sociable deportments, so little regard is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had to the general and publike benefit of society, that the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Breeding, Comity, Urbanity,</hi> or the like: are often times but the flattering compliances and endearments of some sorts or orders of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects one towards another, whose usual issue is in a Faction. And the ordinary way of winning worldly friendship and esteem is, either by open applauding each others abilities and courses, or else by such profession and insinuation of our services and affections towards them, as to give occasion upon all opportunities (even out of self-regard) to commend their friends, and their abilities, as esteeming themselves commended in these that so much own and approve them. Whereas he that is truly conscientious of Gods Service and his Neighbours, so farre as to place them above Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55976:174"/>
shews, dares not undertake this kind of serving himself by his neighbors ruine; but will watch all seasonable opportunities to perform the office of a true friend; by expression of such deeds and Councels, as shall advance other mens benefit in the first place, and his own honor amongst them in the second. By which means, as I shall really do the part of a true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-man and Christian, so shall I never want the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thereof; as of having truly served God, and my neighbour; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to the world it were not otherwise apparent, then by my suffering for both.</p>
               <p>And the like condition (no doubt) will be found in all dutiful sufferings, by all that can lay aside <hi>all malice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>hypocrisie, guil, anger, and evil speaking</hi>; and can as new born babes (with patience and humility) commit <hi>all to him that judgeth righteously</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 25. Verse 3.</note> even these (I say) if <hi>they have but tasted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> and found the fruits of that blessed and promised Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, shall quickly feel the sting of worldly afflictions, so taken out by him that hath undergone and overcome them for him, that, in the midst of Prisons and Confinements, they shall sing with more real solace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in their magnimous sustentation of any injury or Cross, then their adversary can do in the infliction of his revenge. For be it never so great, yet when I (by my patience) have proved my self Superior in all that his malice could reach unto, I shall thereby, at once, both repel his strokes, and also return them upon himself, to the redoubling of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and revengeful torment; even to see himself thus miserably defeated by my resolution: When, as on the other side also, he cannot but deny his own want of courage and true fortitude, in being so highly sensible, or affected with a mistaken, small, or occasional injury, as to lead him to this fruitless reparation.</p>
               <p>And then further, <hi>Patience having had its perfect work,</hi> so as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to suffer the spoiling of our Goods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.34. Rom. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>but even to glory in tribulation:</hi> it will estate men in a condition of outward felicity also. For as none but children, are satisfied with the strokes which are given to the stones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which they fell: so when (besides insensibility through patience) our adversaries shall perceive us advantaged by such misuage, he will then leave to do us evil, even for fear of doing us good.</p>
               <p>And as thus in single persons, so will this height of fortitude, be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially found the steady and true promoter of Political and State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as well as of all vertue besides: For how can Justice, Honesty, or any true vertue be duly expected, while terror of any sort shall stand up to amate the Actor from Execution? And since in wordly Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, the gain of one must be the loss of another; and since again, the fear or hope of rewards from great and rich men prevails most, will not hope of gain, and fear of opposition continually endanger justice, and bring on the oppression of the poor? For say men what they will, no man (as a natural man) can have that degree of fortitude, as not to be many times awed by political greatness, or personal courage. And could we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some person informidable, so as (in things of inconcern to himself) he could dare to act according to the true sense of Justice; must it not still follow, that when again his interest is mixed therewith, the same want of true fear must render him as partial to himself. So that, in a meer natural man, you cannot so place fortitude as to make it always a Vertue: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55976:174"/>
he that hath God in all causes for his second and Judge, (<hi>making him his onely fear)</hi> as (on the one hand) <hi>he will not fear what flesh can do unto him,</hi> so, (on the other side), will he always fear what he doth unto them.</p>
               <p>By which means being habituated to a steady Vertuous deportment in all his actions, he shall finde honesty (even in this worlds respect) to prove the best policy. Inasmuch as, all advantage and gain (in that kinde) ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing according to the value of trust and employment, his approved fidelity and integrity will so far advance him herein, as to make honor and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment attend him as his due. The proof and discourse of all which, (as the sure Crown and reward of Devotion, Humility, and Patience) takes up (by Precepts and Examples) the greatest part of Holy Writ it self: as if on purpose to shew us, that its chief aim were to exhort and encourage us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And the humble and devout searcher of the Scriptures shall be sure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to return empty of this blessing: whereas he that is not <hi>grounded in love,</hi> but carries with him the spirit of Pride and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontention, returns usually ten times more the Childe of the devil then before.</p>
               <p>But that which most of all is the occasion of this present discourse, and comes neerest our present business; is to let Subjects hereby see, that that degree of submission and Patience I had formerly commended unto them, was a state of happiness as well as duty: and that especially for Christian subjects towards Christian Princes. Against whom, Anger, Malice, and Revenge (in all their degrees) must most of all be laid aside. Whatsoever we suffer from them, we must look upon as coming from him that set them up in this high power: and who hath <hi>their hearts so always in his hand, as to turn them which way he pleaseth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 22.1.</note> either making them instruments of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon us, or tryals of our trust and Patience towards him. Whereupon, we cannot more lawfully think of retaliation and resistance towards them, (against <hi>whom there is no rising up</hi>) then against God himself:<note place="margin">Prov. 30.31.</note> for in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we the reward <hi>of suffering wrongfully,</hi> if we allow them not a power of doing so; and that beyond any warrantable restraint of ours. Those evils that come from the hands of others without Authority from them, I may prevent or resist as mine own discretion and Conscience shall direct; with consideration had to the Precepts of Love and Charity: and in this kinde we commonly make a Vertue of necessity. But where lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth impose, the ties of publike Charity and Obedience do both lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; and although I may do my best by petition or perswasion to alter his Will from prosecution, yet can I not at all use mine own will for resisting him therein.</p>
               <p>All which will not prove of great difficulty, to him that shall remember his Saviours prophesie; <hi>that in the world we should have afflictions:</hi> and that promise also annexed therewith, <hi>in me ye shall have peace.</hi> This man I say,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.33.</note> 
                  <hi>in hope of that high price and reward which is set before him, will be ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his race</hi> with all cheerfulness.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.12.</note> And while he is running to that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goal, it will be easie for him to read the hand of Providence to be many times writing and engraving Characters of temporal advantage also out of those malicious plots of his enemies: no otherwise then as it was with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph:</hi> who <hi>through envy being sold</hi> and put from home, was thereby deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from famine, and brought into a richer soyl, and greater preferment elsewhere: whereupon he might now have power to express true goodness,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55976:175"/>
in returning good for evil. And, upon a discreet examination, he shall also generally finde, that these Crosses were but the effects of love; and put in his way, like so many pauses and stops, to delay or divert him from some course he had headily undertaken; which in the pursuit would have proved more destructive to him; either in his spiritual or temporal condition, then are those opportunities and advantages which divine Providence hath now brought him unto.</p>
               <p>Oh thou admirable and blessed Grace of Charity! How dost thou, by thy due exercise, at once both make us good and happy? as well in exciting us to acts of beneficence, as delighting and rewarding us for doing them. To call thee a moral Vertue is too low: thou art them all, and their Crown. For, in order to humane preservation, (and of all things that have sense and will) thou art of as large and necessary extent, as is that Vertue of Union and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, which is the preserver of the whole worlds Fabrick besides. Nay in us thou art the same Union and Sympathy; under the name of Love, doing the same thing: that is, hereby preventing the destruction of voluntary Agents, as that doth of all natural ones: and so being not onely (like that) provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence her right hand, but also so much more above it, as thy execution is more above it in difficulty, and the object of thy imployment more noble. How much below thee stand all other Graces and Vertues! Even so far, as to be of no use without thee; like as thou also art (again) so much more worthy, as thou art more thy self: that is art more extensive. For when by any of them alone, I chuse to exercise any moral duty, if thou take it not by the hand, how will self-respect byass it to pride? Or, if without thee I imploy my zeal, it will be found little other then a gilded trifle, or <hi>a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of that which costs me nothing:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.24.</note> as being commonly but the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an hours time or less; which I had beforehand so ordered, as to have nothing else to do therein. Or, did I exercise my devotion in real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of part of my deerly esteemed estate; and that in Alms or building of Temples, or the like; how will that present requital of foreseen honor, make me usually a willing dispenser of my fortunes, even <hi>to be seen of men:</hi> and that, either by thanks from the poor, or by having my name set or known in the Temple: by which means, carrying a face and design towards pride, how will it take off from that freeness which should Crown Devotion? But when, against my will, (it may be) all my fortune, and that which is yet dearest, my good name is now snatcht from me, (and that by my profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enemies) and I can yet be joyful as well as patient, hence, together with the difficulty, must arise the highest pitch of honor. Difficulty did I say, nay impossibility; for naturally it is so: inasmuch as in so doing, I do make contradictions both true at once. For if my deprivation or suffering be in a thing I esteem not, or am not sensible of, what need, or use of Patience? And if I must be willing to suffer, what I am unwilling to suffer, as it can onely be done by a miraculous and divine help, so the Vertue thereby wrought must be most highly divine also. How is a natural perfection put into a non-plus herein? My injury must be the reason of my patience, my wrong of my forgiveness; nay more, I must in the highest measure be actively charitable to this my known enemy, even because he is so: expressing it in the highest degrees; feed him, cloath him, (if he want); and above all, pray for him howsoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:55976:175"/>Compare that which great ones deserve with this, and you may call it Pride and Arrogance. For with what ease do they sit and command; and then assume the atchievement of publike Utility and Peace as proper to themselves, when alas the true burthen and thanks for these things, rests on the part of the obedient. For what use of power but through submission? and how soon without Patience, would prosecution of revenge set whole Kingdoms in a civil flame: whilst revenge should thus generate, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on him, call for his revenge on me? Therefore as Charity is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server and establisher of other Vertues and Graces, so is Patience, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the true tryal and establisher of Charity. For Kings and great ones, have their honor and power but from this relation of subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and so far onely as they have first submitted their Wills to God, and are themselves obedient, and truely passive under his Authority and command, can they have true power to act upon or command others, By which means, patience under subjection, will prove the best Jewel in their Crowns; as well as a Crown to other Vertues of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Nor can Princes be excused from the personal exercise of this Vertue of Patience also, by being sometimes sharers in <hi>those chastisments,</hi> which must testifie them <hi>to be sons and no bastards:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.8.</note> And that not onely when their own <hi>iniquity shall be punished with the rod of the children of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.14.</note> (that is rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion), but also when they (according to the Will and appointment of God) <hi>shall fill up that which is behinde of the afflictions of Christ in the flesh, for his bodies sake which is the Church.</hi> Not that they can add in merit;<note place="margin">Coloss 1.24.</note> but like as every particular Christian must estate himself in Christ and his Church by their following him in sufferings and obedience, so must great ones measure herein be higher then others upon occasion: even as their honor and reward is proportionably more eminent, in regard of that great trust of the Church put into their hands. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and other holy and eminent members and guides of the Church, did formerly by their particular and more remarkable sufferings and patience in, and for their separate Churches, more fully and speedily fill up that measure of wickedness which unto their oppressive and persecuting adversaries was by divine permission allotted, and thereby the sooner call for Gods Vengeance on them, and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the relief of that Church for whose sake they suffered: even so, each separate Church may be supposed to have its measure of temporal afflictions more remarkably and fully compleated by the afflictions and sufferings of its own head and guide in chief, whereby, the sooner to move God in compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their sufferings, as of the whole, to regard and relieve the distresses of that particular Church in their temporal sufferings, no otherwise then as Christ, as head of the Catholike, did by his sufferings, generally merit sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation both temporal and eternal for the whole Church his body. And therefore, although the <hi>sons of Zebedee</hi> were not able to drink so great a a draught, nor suffer in so high a measure, as being to have but a subordinate and particular charge under our Savior, yet that they <hi>were able to drink of that cup,</hi> and should also bear a share in this <hi>Baptism,</hi> is there ascertained: when as yet the entrance and admission into Dominion and Power, as <hi>on the right hand and left hand of Christ</hi> in his Church,<note place="margin">Matth. 20.20; &amp;c.</note> should be left to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Providence, as heretofore declared.</p>
               <p>But now, it is not every Patience, or dull insensibility under every afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is to have this honor and reward; but that Patience most properly that is accompanied with the duty of Obedience. For I may give all I have
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55976:176"/>
to the poor, nay my body to be burnt, and yet be but charitable to my self, in design to mine own honor. But when I am so taken up with the good of others, (in order to my love of him whose image they bear) that (in sure token thereof) I can forgive all injuries, and them also that did them; here is Charity upon Charity: which (in care of publike Peace and Good) <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth long,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>is kinde, envieth not, is not puffed up, but beareth all things.</hi> Which expressions, as they properly betoken the Vertues of such as are to be subject to Authority, so may they serve to expound to us those sayings of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whosoever <hi>shall smite thee,</hi> &amp;c. namely that the right use of Patience is thereby meant; even Patience under Authority, and not any stupid neglect of our own safeties. For so in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> it is, <hi>whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15.35.</note> &amp;c. Whereby we are to understand, that those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are not to be resisted that come from men on our right hands: that is, are above us. And so again, <hi>Whosoever will sue thee at Law,</hi> &amp;c. to him we must with Patience give our Cloak also,<note place="margin">Verse 40.</note> if Law will take it away: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby <hi>compelled,</hi> we are to do for any man more then he shall ask.</p>
               <p>And these Gospel Precepts, carry but the same meaning toward Patience and Humility under Authority, as <hi>Solomons</hi> prudential Precept formerly did: <hi>if the spirit of the Ruler rise up against thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>leave not thy place: for yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pacifyeth great offences</hi>: and all because of that relation of obedience we stand bound unto, in regard of his Authority that thus commanded us. And therefore, when we finde these Graces of Humility and Meekness set down and commended unto us, they are to be taken as necessarily implying the duty of obedience: inasmuch as they are the onely proper Vertues of such as are stated in the relation of subjection. For this Vertue of Patience is as necessary to the constitution of things voluntary in the relation of Patients, towards the receit of the Vertue of that Agency which from the Governor is to be acted on the governed, as is the endowment of other natural Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Properties on inanimates, to make them susceptible of that effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which on the part of their Agents is required also.</p>
               <p>Whereupon Patience comes to be a Vertue of such great influence, and concern in the establishment of Charity, (making the Precept of love use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to humane preservation and Gods honor,) that sometimes it supplies the place of Charity, and is joyned to Faith in Christ, as the other fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal requisite to salvation: nay sometimes goeth alone, as the most sure ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work thereof, and true token also of Christian Faith it self. For so runs our Saviors admonition, <hi>in patience possess ye your souls.</hi> And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose saith Saint <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 21.19. Jam. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>the tryal of your Faith worketh Patience:</hi> and then, (to shew the perfection that follows Patience), he adds, <hi>but let Patience have her perfect work,</hi>

                  <hi>that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> having set forth <hi>our access to God through Faith,</hi> after adds, <hi>and not onely so, but we glory in tribulation also: knowing that tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience Hope, and Hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts; by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost which is given us:</hi> that is, Tribulation and Patience, do uphold and supply that fundamental and saving Grace of love,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.3, 4, 5.</note> which is wrought within us by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>And as in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> we are exhorted <hi>to be followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As generally thus amongst mankinde, Patience is added to Faith to make us inheritors of the Promises, and a necessity of compliance with Christ in sufferings, <hi>that we may be also glorified together,</hi> so,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17, &amp; 2 Tim. 2, 12. 1 Tim. 2.15.</note> unto the particular of women, is Patience added also: <hi>she shall be saved by childe-bearing, if she continue in the Faith.</hi> By which words, as we are not to understand that none but Child-bearing women shall be saved, or that the others should not be sharers also of these common sufferings incident to the rest of mankinde; so may we perceive this particular instance of Childe-bearing put, both to set out Patience in the highest degree of suffering known amongst us, and also (being put under the notion of Childe-bearers), may be taken as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending such as are married: who being subject to husbands may farther serve to shew, that this Patience is occasioned from that degree of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bondage, which God (by reason of their appointed subordination) had put them under, when he said, <hi>In sorrow shalt thou conceive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy desire shall be subject to thy husbands.</hi> So that then, each one that <hi>travelleth in pain</hi> under this yoak of bondage to the Laws of Superiors, by reason of, and for punishment of our corruption,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> is to submit to the pleasure <hi>of him that subjected the same in hope:</hi> and <hi>to reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us, when we shall be restored to the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</hi>

               <p>Nor need we wonder <hi>why immortality and eternal life,</hi> should be promised <hi>to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor</hi>; and (on the contrary) <hi>indignation and wrath unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth</hi>; if (besides the benefits arising to mankinde by this Vertue (formerly spoken of), we also consider its efficacy in advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Praise and Honor of God amongst us also. For where Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Humility are practised (as all outward strife ceases, so) general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment will arise: Wherupon, Kings, as well as subjects, being recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally pleased in having, and yeilding ready obedience, men on all hands will have cause to Thank and Praise their Maker: whose greatest delight being in the good of his Creature, and their grateful acknowledgement thereupon, so is their murmuring and affliction to him most unpleasant: as abating the sense of his goodness and praise.</p>
               <p>From which grounds, we may easily discern the Reason, why this Vertue
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55976:177"/>
should be so especially commended to us by that great <hi>preserver of men.</hi> So that since it was necessary, that in token of our zeal and love to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, something of difficulty should be enjoyned; what in the eye of his all-seeing Providence more fit then this? whereby, as his glory is upheld by the establishment of the Kingdoms peace here, so are the Patient them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (besides the reward of his Grace in this life,) to receive the deserved Crown thereof in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now, <hi>lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees: and seeing also we are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight,</hi>

               <p>By this proper note of persecutions and afflictions, left unto us as a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by him that was the <hi>Author and finisher of our Faith,</hi> and that once so highly suffered for us; we stand, in a peculiar manner, not onely distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the rest of the world, as in testimony of the truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion above theirs, (who, as an Argument of their humane device and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are still closing with Nature in promises of sensual delights), but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true and sanctified use of these afflictions again by the several members of the Church, each Christian professor therein comes to be a more true Disciple and Christian one then another. Inasmuch, as my being by my profession and belief a Christian, cannot of it self make me a true one: because it may be a thing not of my choice, or bestowed on me out of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Grace and Election: but happening (for ought I know) from no other ground or assurance, nor having other reason or influence, then the hazard of birth or Education.</p>
               <p>Had I been born and educated where other Religions are professed, I had, in all probability, been even such an one in belief as they; and those others of those Religions, had (doubtless) upon like change been of mine. In which case, as I should have thought it hard that they, for their good fortune of being Christened when I was Circumcised, should be thereupon rewarded and I punished, so cannot I reasonably now think that as regeneration must be something else then this, so also that that Baptism that must purge out the old man, must be (where it may be had) something else then that of outward washing; the Baptism of the <hi>Holy Ghost and of fire,</hi> must be added to that of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea and baptism of afflictions, rightly applyed it must also be. For that else, it may be again, that as they came but occasionally upon me, so was I by my own natural constitution and softness of temper drawn both to the search after God by these afflictions, and to the Patient enduring of them. It may be ignorance or inability to resist or avoid my sufferings in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am now in, makes me, as in a kinde of Melancholly revenge, appeal to Heaven for reparation: and, for want of natural fortitude dejectedly to yeild, and sit down in some Stoical contempt or melancholly retirement. If so, what praise can I expect for my seeming neglect thereof, when it was but what I cannot overcome and avoid? In which doing, I may also naturally
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55976:177"/>
reap inward satisfaction, and so far flatter my self in this my degree of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and well-doing, that I may go yet one step farther, and receive consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and content by my endurance of those things, and be yet no true parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <hi>of that baptism with which the Captain of my salvation was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I finde not my self still ready for fresh encounters, and that out of sense of duty and publike regard, as one that is <hi>strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all Patience and Long-suffering with joyfulness</hi>; but do now hide or cloyster up my self from being any more publikely bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to others,<note place="margin">Col. 1.11.</note> onely because I am afraid I shall be thereby prejudiced my self, and be rendred obnoxious again, what do I but thereby acknowledge that I am both privately affected in being thus regardful to my self alone, and also to be as poorly spirited; since I am so over mastered by their weight that I can endure no more.</p>
               <p>And as Patience may in it self alone be an uncertain sign of true Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, so may faith also. For if, in many a Christian, we should examine the ground of this too, it would be found grounded on Nature also: even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it should be so strong as to submit to martyrdom. For since I, in another Religion, or another in mine, might have so dyed, had we been so brought up, it can in it self evidence little of the truth of that duty we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess: but oftentimes may have issue from peevishness or stubbornness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to Love or Obedience. And certainly, to suffer for disobedience to Christian Authority, can scarce deserve the honor of Martyrdom, onely due to those that undergo it for the honor of Christs Name. For that Childe deserves little pitty, that would rather die under the rod, and perish by famine, then accept of such wholsom food as is appointed him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; onely because it is not such, or so dressed, as to be altogether suitable to his present fancy.</p>
               <p>Nay, neither is love only a sure sign of this Regeneration: for this also may proceed from natural propension; and respect to <hi>honor</hi> and thanks may make us Charitable, as well as Martyrs. Whereas he that is the true Christian, and fitted with grace of Regeneration, is never <hi>slothful</hi>; but stands always <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in works and labour of love:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.12.11.10.</note> because <hi>God who is not unrighteous</hi> will not <hi>forget</hi> to be continually assisting him with his grace of perseverance here, or reward hereafter; therefore he sits not down disconsolate under the burthen, for he knows who hath called him to the combate; and he will be thereupon always ready to entertain it. He was not, he knows, born for himself one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: nor can the sense of injuries to himself draw him from being publikely beneficial: even although he get nothing but reproach for his labour: as knowing, that, through this difficulty also, his reward will be higher. He, he is still looking into all these things with the eys of love and publike Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whereby he stands always magnanimous and resolved to undergo any thing for the good of those that bear the image of their Master, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to such rules as those that have publike charge under him shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</p>
               <p>For each true Christians love and patience, must, through his obedience to the head of his own Church, make useful that general end of humane peace and preservation, for which Christian Patience was by Christ himself enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the whole Church, and therefore he sits not down sullenly and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, like a stubborn childe, under his task and duty, that will act no
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55976:178"/>
more because he cannot do as he likes. Because he findes himself crossed in what is enjoyned him to do, or in the measure thereof; he will therefore, by way of murmur and regret, run into the extream thereof. Because he hath been in the world crossed, therefore, like those children that are fallen out with their play-fellows, he will hide himself and play no more.</p>
               <p>And as thus his Patience could not have continued and been rightly steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Charity, so neither Charity without it. It is not, as we said, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very natural propension and voluntary beneficence that can, of it self, be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the labor of love:</hi> for that may be the pleasure of love: and Pride may be its Parent. But when nature shal be holpen by the grace of obedience, when that Patience that was enjoyned for publike benefit shal also wait on publike direction, then comes he to give a lively testimony of the Grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. For he knows he may decline harm, but cannot duty: Nature obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to one, Religion to the other. Where he is <hi>strucken on the right cheek, where the spirit of the Ruler doth rise upon him he must not leave his place,</hi> the performance of Loyalty and Service to his rightful Superior, although that he know that through false information he is for the present bent against him; as know, that he is thereunto called by him that <hi>hath his heart in his hand,</hi> and can turn it which way he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>Therefore now, when I shall have so far subdued rebellious Nature, as to submit unto, and undergo my task with patience, not as out of necessity, but out of duty: When, our of no other reason but because God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, I shall obey what is enjoyned me, and what I might with my first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, finde Arguments against, in a presumptuous <hi>knowledge of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; then it is that the <hi>strong man</hi> begins to be <hi>bound by a stronger then he.</hi> When, in the exercise and expression of my Love and Charity, I suffer not my self to be swayed by interest or natural propension in the choice of the object or apportioning of my love, but can be content, as being in Christ now <hi>born again,</hi> and through Grace become <hi>a new creature,</hi> to love all men as bearing Gods image, and more especially Christians and such as are <hi>made conformable to the image of his son,</hi> and that without the exclusion of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehension of enemies, or differing from me in judgement or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then it is that I may esteem my self <hi>renewed in the spirit of my minde,</hi> and may gather a well grounded assurance of particular mercy and adoption for that: as Christianity is by this sign of the Cross differenced from other Religions, so may I by this my discreet and obedient taking of it up, assure my self that more then Nature or Chance hath confirmed me herein. For if, in love to Christ and the Peace and welfare of his Church, a Christian can be for a while content to be in subjection to these his <hi>Fathers in the flesh,</hi> he thereby gives the best proof, that he will much more be willing to be in <hi>subjection to the Father of spirits and live.</hi> Even to that God, who as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the acceptance of his endeavors,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.10, 11.</note> had assisted him with his Grace of illumination and perseverance herein, and thereby assured him of a blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease and <hi>restoration into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, when he shall have fought his fight and finished that his course</hi> of cleansing, which was by divine Providence appointed him in the Purgatory of this life.</p>
               <p>Not that we would be hereby thought bounding that inexhaustible <hi>riches of Gods mercy:</hi> as though it stood confined to these or the like means, in the appointment of particular mens salvations; but as setting down the best proofs of a true and well grounded Faith; where these things are practicable.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55976:178"/>
For although Faith cannot be good without Works, nor Works without Christian Obedience, yet God forbid we should exclude infants from salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for want of them. I say therefore, that there is no true confidence and <hi>glory save in the Cross of Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 6.14, 15, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>and I unto the world:</hi> even until I come <hi>to be a new Creature,</hi> by <hi>bearing in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. And as many as walk according to this rule,</hi> that is, endeavouring to reform the rebellion and stubbornness of the world by their own exemplary Patience, <hi>Peace be on them, and Mercy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and upon the Israel of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the passed discourses, we may gather how corrupted and depraved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes to be perfected and restored by Grace: we may see how that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way we had, with other natural Agents, of glorifying God in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and pleasures being forfeited, we come now, through endurance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, to arive at such a state of delight (abstracted from sensuality) as to be enabled in the condition <hi>of new Creatures,</hi> to honor him in a supernatural way; in such measures as naturally we could not do.</p>
               <p>For we taking on us our own guidance, and so not being content with the enjoyments of what delights natural sense did outwardly afford, (common to us with other sensitives), and also not trusting to general Providence like other things, but rather to our own contrivances and stocks of Propriety, could not be rightly said in the exultations of pleasures thence proceeding, to be thanking and praising God like them: who, in their simplicity of not undertaking to know the particular Author of their benefits, or have stores of their own, did (as his Creatures and workmanship) expresly, though not intentionally praise him in every thing they did: but then most, when (as sensitives), in their singings, playings, and other ways of rejoycings, they did most eminently confess and acknowledge his bounty and goodness, by this their more lively resentment of benefit.</p>
               <p>In regard whereof, namely of our proneness to derogate from God through conceit of our P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oprieties, we may finde reason why in the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, (where promises run in a temporal strain) there should be such frequent admonitions of rejoycing before him, with the first fruits, and best of them. For as else, we in our pleasures had but thanked our selves, so this being done, we are then to provide <hi>what our souls lusteth after:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 12.6, 7, 12.21.</note> and the more we rejoyce before God the better.</p>
               <p>But this course and way of honoring God, seemed not yet refined and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted enough for cleering us of the old leaven: and therefore in the Gospel our Saviour will have us wholly renouncing this trust to Propriety, and with the Sparrows and Lillies of the field, trust for our food and cloathing to general Providence again. How this may be done, <hi>by using them as if we used them not,</hi> hath been partly heretofore shewed: by declaring that we should not reckon our selves such absolute proprietors, as to serve Mammon more, or equal with God; but should esteem our interests in them but so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionate and usu-fructuary, as not to take off our obligation of thanks to God in every particular we receive.</p>
               <p>For, when I can so forget and relinquish my trust and relyance on mine own Propriety, as to count every new enjoyment to be as a new favor from God received; I shall then be freed from Idolatry to Mammon: and while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining willing to relinquish my Propriety to Gods Ministers dispose, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Gods service or publike good, I may then reckon all lawful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55976:179"/>
and pleasure thereby attained to be sent me of God. And so by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king worldly things instrumental for the encrease of my joy in him, I shall then make good that saying of <hi>Solomon, There is nothing better for a man, then that he should eat and drink,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor: this I saw was from the hand of God.</hi> And so again, <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy</hi>;<note place="margin">Chap. 9.4:</note> 
                  <hi>and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth thy works.</hi> We may then <hi>rejoyce, and again rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> when our moderation should be thus manifest:<note place="margin">Phil. 4.4:</note> and (having banished from us the afflicting cares of things of this world), place no other regard to them, then as to things that were first obtained from God by <hi>supplication,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him with <hi>thanksgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore now, (for our spiritual way of pleasing God by our pleasures), how great cause have we to acknowledge and admire that goodness and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his, that whilest he is extolling his mercy, in not taking the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our inability of praising him expresly and sufficiently enough in every particular pleasure we enjoyed, he had contrived this way of satisfying his justice without our destruction, or subversion of the course of Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly established. For since in these pleasures that arise in us after our state of Regeneration, it cannot be said that they come from depraved Nature, or a cause barely Natural, (because effected in us by that which is rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto, namely from what is in it self painful and troublesom) it must therefore follow, that in the pleasures and contents we now express (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this renewing of our mindes,) we must in them praise God in a most spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and divine manner: as being now again freed from the corruption of the old <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this new birth the Holy-Ghost is our Parent: by whom, (presenting unto us the promises of the Gospel);<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3:</note> we come, by the immortal <hi>seed of the word to be begotten unto a lively hope.</hi> Which hope, causing us more and more to adhere, and be incorporate into Christ, comes then to be called Faith: By which, we may say we come to receive our quickening and vivify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. After which, we may call afflictions, persecutions, &amp;c. the throws and pangs of child-birth: and those hands from whom we have them, we may call our Midwives. When we are brought into this new Kingdom of the Church, then is the Grace of love, to be that food and nourishment we are afterwards to receive, and grow by: at least it must serve us as that spiritual stomach, whereby all things must be digested to our use and benefit. Which time of new-birth, being the time for <hi>casting forth this strong man armed by a stronger then he,</hi> makes it to each one a time of more remarkable trouble: not so much for the quantity of affliction, as the strugling conflict made within us; by that spirit now raging most, when he is to be thrown out.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; for there is in all of us states and degrees of weaning, necessarily following afterwards: by the sufferings whereof, we come by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, farther to shake off those remaining corruptions of our former Nature: until, being, at last, so <hi>throughly rooted and grounded in love,</hi> as to be spiritually united to God by our blessed Mediator, we come then <hi>to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.13.</note> In which second <hi>Adam</hi> our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Eden</hi> (or pleasure) is now as innocent, as it was at first, to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden before his fall: the reluctance and curse of the Creature, (that is, the punishment of our sin) which would not let us enjoy pleasure the natural way, proving now the instrument for possession of pleasure in this way. For
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55976:179"/>
they, having their sting and venom taken out, come to be but bruising of our heels; by the goodness of that God that causeth the intended malice and mischief of them to light on the heads of that Serpent and his Agents. For when the old <hi>Adam with the affections and lusts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24:</note> 
                  <hi>hath been so throughly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in us,</hi> that we can neither look on our sufferings as ills, nor their Authors as enemies; we may be able then to say, <hi>that the life we now live in the flesh we will live by the Faith of the son of God, who loved us, and gave himself for us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But now, although it be our parts always to be ayming at this mastery and perfection, (in which regard our life is compared to a race or warfare) yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have in death concluded our sufferings and conquered our <hi>last enemy,</hi> we shall never be able (with the Captain of our salvation) to say <hi>it is finished</hi>: but must, (whilst we live) be subject to divers fresh assaults and encounters: one while provoking us to presumption, (<hi>through abundance of revelation</hi>), one while to despair, (<hi>through thorns in the flesh</hi>) in such measure, that we shall need to be still taking to our assistance, not only the inward weapons of humility and love, but the outward exercises of all such religious duties and performances, as may again strengthen these Graces, or any way direct and incourage us in a steady course of recovery by the degrees of hope and faith; and so re-estate us into the former degree of adherence: until <hi>this faith, the substance of things not seen, shall grow into the fruition of God by love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5.21. &amp;c</note> 
                  <hi>the bond of perfection.</hi> For our unskilfulness in the word of righteousness, will make us (like new born babes wanting milk) need to be continually atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on our Apostolike keepers and interpreters <hi>of the Oracles of God, to have the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God</hi> again and again laid: and to have <hi>the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement,</hi> again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain preached.

               <p>And so also although Prayers, Preaching, Repentance, Fasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (nay the Sacraments themselves) are but Ceremonies compared to that final ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Religion (Gods Praise and mans Salvation, and are not in themselves fundamental) yet, since this love can never be to perfect in this life, as not to put us in need of these helps for apprehension of these divine truths, and also to keep our mindes fixt and intent on our duties, and since neglect or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them may be damnable through disobedience: it seems therefore now expedient, that something should be said thereof, and of those errors of Idolatry and Superstition, which do usually attend their wrong administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>NExt unto Atheism, that would wholly substract Deity, is the error of Polytisme, that by division would so confound him, as through irregularity and confusion in our practice, his real and true service should be defeated. For although the Atheist do only profess not serving him, yet doth the Idolater (by multiplying and adulterating his appearance) so multiply and disguise both his person and his wil, that in the end, we are not able to know, what is truly the one, or the other.</p>
               <p>Nor is this crime and error of Idolatry subject only to outward and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly representations, such as did usually accompany Gentilism: But inasmuch as honor and adoration are to be the end of our knowledge, and because again the goodness and soundness of this adoration will take admeasurement and proportion from the truth and worth of that Divine Existence and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is by each one conceived, it must also follow, that men are to be accounted more or less Idolaters, as that Image of God conceived in their minds is more or less truly representing him. For he being not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any of our bodily senses, or otherwise known to mankind, then by the effects of his being, to wit, his goodness, power, wisdom, justice, and such operations as must properly denote him, it must therefore come to pass that such as shall fail or mistake in the apprehension of these emanations, and shall attribute unto him such works or way of energy, as are neither worthy of him nor proportionable unto him, are thereupon to be accounted Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous.</p>
               <p>As for example, such as having not rightly conceived and observed God in the continual and general expression of that his most eminent attribute of goodness and mercy, nor well considered, that true glory and honor doth arise from the generality and extent of benefits, nor (indeed) well understood the true import of these phrases of <hi>Election, Predestination, &amp;c.</hi> and how, and what works do, and do not save, are ready, in a hasty partiality to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to judge him, like one of the vulgar, as exercising only his power and greatness in the acts of Election and Reprobation; and that, not only in prejudice of his wisdom, as being guided by no discrimination in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some before others; but, in prejudice of his goodness and justice, as thereby rejecting others of equal merit and condition. By which means the Image these men have conceived will come to be truly an Idol, by having <hi>eyes and see not, &amp;c.</hi> and thereupon so much below, even the vulgar; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they, in their sentences to life or punishment, would have respect to merit or demerit, so far as possibly they could perceive or forefee them, and not proceed therein, as in a kind of lottery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:55976:180"/>And as these and such like false representations must introduce Idolatry within, by means of a shorter or unstable impression: so when men come to adapt and proportion their outward Service and Worship, it must also come to pass that the same must be defective, false, or frivolous, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much more or less superstitious, as they shall be more or less unknowing of God or his will, and shall be therein onely guided by particular fear and fancy.</p>
               <p>Upon which ground, we may finde reason why Almighty God (both in reference to his own honor, and for estating men upright and blameless in their religious duties) did always either himself appoint some established form and rule therein; or else authorize some person under him to do it, and not leave it to the hazard of private and single mens devotion, whether to be done or no; nor to their differing judgements, to fancy what variety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction therein they pleased. By which doing, not only Gods continual and constant Worship, will be more secured and uniform, but men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue more free from the guilt of Idolatry and Superstition; whilst they shall not be thus let loose to private contrivance of what the passion of fear shall suggest, but be therein guided by the will of Gods publike Minister: whereby they must, with the performance of their duties of obedience therein to him, be acquit of the sin of Superstition towards God also.</p>
               <p>Under the Law, as all the outward forms of Worship and Service were by God himself instituted (and so expresly set down that none could doubt) so was there a strict injunction given against any alteration, even of that very part of his Service which seemed most Ceremonial. Which happened not solely for that God instituted them (because we find <hi>David</hi> and other good Kings making alteration in some things of like institution) but this perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness arose from the continuance of that end which at first gave them insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and being. For so far as they were typical and representative of Christ or his Church to succed (of which sort most of them were) it must follow that till Christ were come, any alteration in them made (as of unfitness for publike use) were none other then to accuse God himself of weakness that had enjoyned them.</p>
               <p>And, as upon this ground, the High Priest and Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> stood in many things, independent of the Authority of their Kings, even so also, because much depended on the preservation of that Jewish State (as in order to have it continue until our Saviour should come to put an end to that Church) God therefore, (even after the establishment of Kingship) reserved to himself a Super-intendency of their State-Government also; and had his Prophets to declare his pleasure upon all great and exorbitant occasions: lest otherwise, their transactions with their Neighbours, or misgovernment at home, might prove so destructively prejudicial, that his own purpose might be defeated by their ruine.</p>
               <p>After the time our Saviour himself appeared, and had the whole <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid on his shoulders,</hi> these offices were wholly resigned up unto him;<note place="margin">Isa. 9.6.</note> and so from him, who was <hi>King and Priest after the order of Melchisedec</hi> (and who was <hi>the Prophet</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> foretold of <hi>to be raised up like him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 18.15.</note> and <hi>which was anointed to preach glad tidings</hi>) they come to be by him conferred in chief on his adopted sons, the several heads of his Church;<note place="margin">Isa. 61.1.</note> and so at last to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the anointed Christian Monarchs, vvithout such reservation as God had formerly made in the Jewish Church, in reference to his Theocraty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:55976:181"/>If we look for the knowledge of these things in the practice of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christian Church, we shall not find any separate jurisdiction or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity claimed, either in Priestly or Prophetical way, but what was subordiate, if not appointed by the Apostles, the then Heads of the Church. The which is plainly intimated by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (who had in many things presumed against the authority of his Apostleship as their Head) <hi>Though ye have ten thousand Instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel; wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.15, 16</note>
               </p>
               <p>For although many of these their Preachers or Instructers, had (no doubt) by their Doctrine won many particular souls amongst them to the faith, and so might be called the spiritual Fathers to those persons; yet, since they (generally considered as a collective Church and body of men) had first been instructed by him, and were also the <hi>Seal of his Apostleship in the Lord</hi>:<note place="margin">Chap. 9.2.</note> They (under the notion of <hi>Sons</hi> of the Church) could have but one spiritual Father, no more then natural sons could.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, having signified to them his Power of Super-intendency, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a relation that might claim sole and undeniable authority (as their general Father or Head) he then tells them of his practise thereupon: <hi>For this cause I sent Timotheous unto you, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>who shall bring you into remembrance of my wayes which be in Christ, as I teach every where, in every Church.</hi> That is, I have sent him by my Apostolical Authority,<note place="margin">Verse 17.</note> to take the charge of your instruction in my absence: because he knows my manner of Doctrine and Worship, which I have established in other Churches, by vertue of that power which Christ gave me.</p>
               <p>And so he goeth on, reproving such as had demeaned themselves proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against his Authority, under colour of their office of Instruction, or as <hi>Waterers to what he planted</hi>: And thereupon says, <hi>The Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power</hi>; that is, he would not <hi>regard the speech of him that was puffed up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 20. Verse 19.</note> 
                  <hi>but the power.</hi> For although they might preach in Christs name, yet if they had not power from that Supreme Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which Christ hath intrusted with his Churches Power, their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was nothing; as elsewhere he says, <hi>How shall they preach except they be sent?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Indeed, those Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> are very intent and copious in the defence of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Authority; and the six first Chapters are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bent that way, and carry an especial reproof against those Schisms and Divisions which had hapned amongst them for want of this unity. Whilst some would choose one Master-builder, and some another; and that with such vehemence of affection, as Idolatrously to neglect or forget Christ himself, whose Deacons they were. And whilst others, as Superstitiously again, would balk those Ministers of Christ set over them, as thinking obededience no where due but to him alone.

               </p>
               <p>In the next verse, he comes home to what was the drift of all the rest: <hi>These things brethren, I have in a figure transferred to my self, and to Apollo for your sakes; that ye might learn in us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note>

For difference in power must come from God; if it come from below, it will cause divisions and puffing up one against another: <hi>For who maketh one man to differ from another</hi> (but God) <hi>and what hast thou that thou didst not receive; now if thou didst receive it why dest thou glory,</hi>

                  <hi>as if thou hadst not received it</hi>? that is, since Christ hath given his power in the Church to us in chief, and to all others as subordinate, why should they act without us, as though they had not received it from us? Why should you, in your popular fancy of underived power, thick to raign as Kings without us? For although we have suffered our selves to be accounted weak and despised, that ye might be strong and honorable, and also to try if by any means we might win you; yet it is not to deny that we have (as your father) just power to command you:<note place="margin">Chap. 4.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>And therefore is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> faith, <hi>I praise you brethren, that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you</hi>; even as I, the Disciple or Follower of Christ, have by vertue of my Mission from him appointed you. Not (as some would have it) follow me no farther in any thing then you find me following Christ; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this had been to overthrow all he had said before, and to have given new toleration to schism, under pretence of following Christ: For if men be not followers of those their Supreme Heads that are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Christ, but will make divisions by honouring God their own way, then will the Author of peace be made the Author of confusion; whilst some (in their publike worship) <hi>have a Psalm, some a doctrine, a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Interpretation, &amp;c.</hi> to the overthrow of all true publike worship and service,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.26.</note> for want of uniformity. No otherwise, then if the same person, in the manner of his return of thanks and service to God, should be distracted in himself, and not wholly intent on the thing he is about; for as there are private benefits for which we are separately to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, so are there national ones to, in which our prayers and praises are to agree by publike appointment.</p>
               <p>And this is the reason, why, writing to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> of our publique duties of praising God, he presently enjoyns them submission, as the only means to make it right and uniform: <hi>Speaking to your selves in Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord</hi>;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.19.</note> 
                  <hi>giving thanks always for all things unto God the father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting your selves one unto another in the fear of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 20. Verse 21.</note> which is the same with <hi>let every soul be subject unto the higher power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are of God</hi>: And so he goes on, to state obedience in all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Christian relations;<note place="margin">Chap. 6.1. Verse 5, 7.</note> that is, of wives, children, and servants, <hi>as unto Christ,</hi> and <hi>as to the Lord, and not to men</hi>: But by his beginning with the duty of wives, and staying so long upon it, we may well conceive him to have herein a particular drift, to set forth, under the figure of womens obedience to their husbands, as their heads, each Churches obedience to its Husband or Head under Christ; who is the head of the whole Church his spouse: of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>As for the authority of that office of Priesthood (so far as related to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and legal Ceremonies) none make doubt of its abolition under the Gospel:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Whose Ministers</hi> (or Preachers) <hi>being now Ministers of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not of the letter,</hi> themselves can by no pretence, as heretofore shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, claim external jurisdiction and obedience.</p>
               <p>As for the other office of Prophet, it had indeed a continuance for some time in the Christian Church, whilst it was in its weak condition, as a necessary means to give them and their guides direction what to do in their continual distresses. Thus is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> bands, and ensuing death prephesied to happen in those times. For as there could not, under a good space of time, be a sufficient number of able persons found
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55976:182"/>
to receive Ordination, and so to be disposed of for the peculiar care of Churches, as now (but in this their unsetled and weak condition, Christ himself (by the means of the promised Holy Ghost) being necessitated extraordinarily to endue men with several gifts, for general edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the absence of humane learning it was no wonder if this gift of prophesie, did many times come along therewith; since all proceeded from the same spirit.</p>
               <p>Yet although this gift of prophesie, were thus necessary to be held up from Christ, for the support and direction of his Church during her weakness and infancy; yet being usually accompanied with the gift of Doctrine and Instruction also, it afterwards came to pass, that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and Doctrine did come to signifie the same thing; as in that place where it is said, <hi>No prophesie of scripture is of private interpretation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.20.</note> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the predictions themselves were but instructions for those they were addressed unto, how to guid themselves according as those events should happen: So that, it being but instruction in an object and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness more remote, it was no wonder that the notion of Prophet came afterwards to signifie the same with the Preacher;<note place="margin">Acts 13.1. Acts 21.8.</note> as also the word <hi>Prophesie</hi> the same with Doctrine: even as the Minister or Deacon, to comprehend the like function of instruction also.</p>
               <p>But however, even in those times, there was still subordination; nor was it in the power of those Prophets, or any other, to take on them to settle any Doctrine, or Church order, against, or without Apostolical leave; namely, the leave of that general Father or Head of the Church, under whom they had received their first Christian foundation; and who was thereupon (as a Master builder) to have power over each work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that undertook their spiritual edification. As was intimated to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>; where S. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of this abuse, in the practices of such as had ventured to build on that foundation without leave which he, as head of the Church, had first laid: saying,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the grace of God given me, have I laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every man take beed how he buildeth thereupon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this right of Government and Authority, to be given to those persons from and under whom they had been taught and brought to Christianity, we may find noted in those two forementioned places to the Hebrews; where the first admonition, for obedience (to <hi>such as have the rule over you</hi>) is given under the notion of <hi>such as had spoken to them the word of God.</hi> But then, having put them in remembrance of them,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.7. Verse 17.</note> he afterwards speaks directly, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, &amp;c.</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that Christian education gives an unquestionable right to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian obedience.</p>
               <p>Nay, in those very Doctrines which the primitive Prophets (for the present) taught, they were censurable by the rest of their fellows, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this higher authority had confirmed it. All which, in the Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> may be further understood; where S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use of his Apostolical authority, in ordering those of that rank how to make use of those many gifts they had received unto edification: for they (it seems) being proud of their manifold dispensations,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 33.</note> had made the <hi>God of peace to be the Author of confusion,</hi> which caused him to fall upon that objurgation, <hi>What, came the word of God out from you, or came it unto you only</hi>;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55976:183"/>
that is, received you not the word from us? why then should ye not be obedient to us as well as other Churches, to whom we have preached it also? he therefore says, that <hi>the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 32.</note> that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, for conclusion of all, and to keep unity, and make <hi>God the Author of peace, and not of confusion,</hi> he disclaims any private mans gift to be able to disanul his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and therefore further says, <hi>If any man think himself to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things I now write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.37.</note> that is, let him confess my Apostolical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Christ received, whereby I have power to order the Churches affairs; or else he doth but think himself a Prophet, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, when indeed he is but puft up by his own fleshly minde of vain glory and ambition.</p>
               <p>And this subjection of inferior Prophets or Teachers under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, unto the chief Prophet or Head of the Church, is doubtless to succeed, and be continued upon the same ground it was formerly given to <hi>Moses</hi>;<note place="margin">Acts 3 22. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore we may observe, that Christ being not able in his own person, to perform and supply all that measure of preaching and instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction, which should be continually necessary for the edification of his Church; and it being again necessary, that there should be, for order-sake, certain persons more eminently entrusted herein, it is the reason why, as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> sets him down in the first or chief place, <hi>Anointed to preach,</hi>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55976:183"/>
Teachers under the Gospel, then formerly under the Law; where, if any would take a prediction upon him, if he could not bring a present mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle or <hi>Sign</hi> sufficient to win belief, he was censurable by the <hi>event it self.</hi>

                  </note> But if any undertook to direct in matter of Doctrine, the Law it self was still to be judge of the goodness thereof; and he taken but as a private man, unable to overthrow the authorized sense thereof, without he brought attestation of Divine Authority, higher then that whereby it was founded. For to tempt the people to Idolatry or Service of other gods, was amongst them made Capital, as before rehearsed. And so no doubt under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel (in the Primitive Church) although there were not standing Schools and Orders of Priests and Prophets (as amongst the Jews) yet was the tryal of that spirit they pretended unto, referred to the examination of the like extraordinary spirit in others; even as all other of their illuminations and doctrines were (for confirmation) censurable, according to those Principles of Christianity, which the Apostles the then Heads of Churches had from our Saviour received; and so had again (<hi>as Master-builders</hi>) set down for the peoples edification; against <hi>which,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>although an Angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven should teach, they were to be accursed.</hi> But because these Precepts and Doctrines of our Saviour, were neither so numerous, nor by him so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly set down as the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but left in trust to the Heads and Guides of his Kingdom the Church; it therefore came to pass, that the inferiour members of the Church, should be much more subject then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, to these their Teachers directions, even because they were not else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be learnt.</p>
               <p>Nor should it seem strange to any, that the power of these Functions, formerly clipt away from Monarchy, should thus under the Gospel be restored; by vertue of deputation from that Supreme Head of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, <hi>The first born of every creature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colos. 1.15. Rom. 8.29.</note> 
                  <hi>and the first born amongst many brethren</hi>: since they were anciently annexed by God unto the Prerogative of Birth-right, and so seated (<hi>Paterno Jure</hi>) in the Master of the family: as in order to enable him in his sole Government and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for so we read of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> prophesying, and of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and other the Patriarchs sacrificing.</p>
               <p>But when the numerousness of the Church did require to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an adopted Father or Head, although the absoluteness of his trust was somewhat pared by the division as aforesaid, yet both of them were to be generally subordinate to this one Supreme Power: for so although the Priesthood went to <hi>Aaron,</hi> even as he was the first born, and because that Function was to be settled for continuance, yet was <hi>MOSES to be to him as a god.</hi> In whose time,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.16.</note> as being the first that had the stile of <hi>K I N G,</hi> we read of the first that had the title of <hi>PROPHETS</hi>; and these remarkably set to be such as had part of <hi>Moses</hi> spirit put upon them; namely, those Seventy appointed to help in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Against which Right of Kings (as Heads of Churches) although some have hitherto disputed, as being blinded by the fallacious distinction of duties into Ecclesiastical and Civil, and thereupon thinking the juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in matters of Religious cognizance should rest in others, as more rightful Successors to Apostolical power; yet can this Church jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55976:184"/>
and superintendency of Priestly and Prophetick charge, be by no good reason pared away now: For that the same person, who as Christs Deputy, is to succeed in the Supreme Power of each Church, and the jurisdiction belonging thereunto, must also be acknowledged to be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly successive therein (by vertue of, and in respect of that union and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these powers, primarily in Christ as great Head of the whole Church, and by him resigned and entrusted to that person that presides and represents him in every part thereof; to be by him wholly managed as under the relation of his Deputy, and not as due to the particular Stiles and Titles of <hi>Apostle,</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> or as <hi>King</hi> only. And we can no more rightfully now seclude Kings from any part of this entire trust and power, then we could Apostles formerly.</p>
               <p>And if we will observe it, they shall be found sitting down in the same right of claim that those Apostles themselves did; namely, the natural and prudential claim of possession; the particular persons of the one sort, having, from Christ, no more open designation then the other. For this is the natural derivation of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from him that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the original of all existence and being; and so also comes it to be the right of each Christian chief man, by derivation from him, that, by pre-excellence, is <hi>the man, even the man Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which deserves our grateful observation, as done in great favour to mankind; to wit, to silence those many disputes which might else have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen about the Kings right to command, and succeed not only in Church matters, but in Civil also. Whereas now, the Apostles (the first Heads) claiming their right of Headship by the rational way of possession, as Kings do theirs, it makes the Titles of future Heads (so succeeding) to be legitimate that way also: This we shall find verified in many places by the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; who is exercising this Authority most, and over most Churches; and yet could least claim particular designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Three of these places we have lately mentioned; the first was, where he claims his Headship over the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the Paternal right of <hi>Primier Seisen; I have begotten you through the Gospel</hi>; which Kings (as Heads) may say now; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.15.</note> 
                  <q>You are to be subject to me, inasmuch as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Gospel, and your Christianity, from under me and my autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being my subjects before you were Christians.</q> The most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference herein, being, that the former Christian Heads (coming to govern by the sword of the Spirit chiefly, and so by it to make Christians of such as were under the material sword already) made their claim of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power from their instruction, even as attested by miracle from above: Whereas the now Heads of Churches; being usually to govern such (as subjects) that had been by their Predecessors made Christians alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are (in case of dispute one with another) to be differenced in their right of Headship over those that are to obey, by the ordinary way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; even by the material sword of conquest and possession. And as the right and exercise of civil power, was then made subsequent, and annexed to the manifestation of Priestly right, so now Priestly power is to follow, and depend on that of Regal.</p>
               <p>The next place we may observe was like to it; claiming jurisdiction over
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55976:184"/>
over them,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.10.</note> because he (as a <hi>Master-builder) had laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, in the place last mentioned, he claims jurisdiction over their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets upon like reason; <hi>What came the word of God out from you</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.36.</note> since you received it from me, you ought to be subject to me.</p>
               <p>But this he makes to be most clear, when, in the ninth Chapter, he would set forth his claim of jurisdiction most fully, he yet makes this his only avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able title: For in <hi>that he was an Apostle, or free, or had seen Jesus Christ</hi>:<note place="margin">Chap. 9.1.</note> Was none of them arguments to entitle him to their Headship, more then any other Apostle, nor so much neither. For, however, these things might dignifie the person, yet it was actual seisure and possession, must estate him Head of <hi>Corinth,</hi> more then of any other Church. And therefore he adds, <hi>Are not you my work in the Lord</hi>? And so pursues that Title in the next Verse, <hi>If I be not an Apostle unto others,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 2:</note> 
                  <hi>yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine Apostleship are ye in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto all which, if we shall add the right of mans dominion in spirituals over the woman,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.12, 13</note> by him settled upon the same right of primogeniture (as formerly noted) it will make the right of Kingly claim of succeeding Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship most apparent.</p>
               <p>And if it were free for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to claim equality with the chief of the Apostles, in answer to such as thought his Commission not so high, because he was not conversant with Christ, like them; how much more may seisure entitle Kings now, against such as can claim no such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>Therefore (to return) as Prophets were first mentioned in the time of him that was first Stiled <hi>KING</hi>; so, to make it farther clear that this gift and power did originally belong to the person of the Monarch or chief Governor, it is also observable, that the first established and really anointed King (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Saul</hi>) had with his Unction from God, this Spirit of Prophecy poured on him also.</p>
               <p>Unction from God, I say, for that this only did confer power from the fountain of Power, as heretofore noted; the other material unction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the hands of men, serving but sacramentally to confirm people in their duties of subjection to that Authority which from heaven alone could be received. Which material Unction, being in that regard necessary to be applyed to the persons that should Hereditarily hold that established office of power, yet it hindred not, but that such other particular persons as were by God occasionally or extraordinarily empowered with any gift for the good of men, might be still really, and truly held and reputed as Gods anointed. In which sense we are to interpret that saying, <hi>Touch not mine anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and do my Prophets no harm</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 105.15.</note> Given to such as exercised their power by Patriarchal right, before Kingship under the Law; as also other phrases of Unction in the New Testament given to such as by means of some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gift in teaching and instruction exercised Church power in an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical or Priestly right, before Kingship under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Upon which grounds, we must say also of the first Heads of Churches, the Apostles and such like, that although they could not (because of their subjection to heathen Kings) make much use of their power in Government over mens persons, yet were they as heads of Churches thereunto as rightfully
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55976:185"/>
empowered, as if they had been Kings, and had had material unction; the power (as before noted) belonging to Christs Vicar, and not to the notions of Apostle, King, or the like.</p>
               <p>But in after times (amongst the Jews) when the Power and Office of Kingship did succeed, those former Unctions of power did now resolve and unite into this, which was of highest eminence above any other; and this stile <hi>of Gods Anointed,</hi> was appropriate to Kings. And although those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Functions, of Priests and Prophets (as parts clipt from the entire trust of Monarchy) were therefore formerly sharers in this Unction, and so were sometimes materially anointed also, yet, for that their anointings did signifie but some particular reservation of trust, it might make them sons of oyl, but could not confer on them the eminent stile of the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi>: Which in the first place was due to the Christ, that had all Power given him, and next to his Adopted Christs in the Church.</p>
               <p>And therefore we shall observe in Sacred Story, that those Kings that were most upright in their Offices and Trusts towards God, had least of their power shared by these other anointed persons. Thus will you find <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and other good Kings, not only in Supreme power, and exercising their Authority without impeachment of these other anointed Officers, but also, some of them prophesying themselves, and using authority over the Priests. Whereas in the times of <hi>Jeroboam, Ahab,</hi> and such like, you shall find the Prophets in greatest power, and most intermeddling; and to that end was <hi>Elisha</hi> anointed: And also, to warn these Kings and people, from taking such courses as might draw down Gods vengeance to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and so proceed to the overthrow of the Monarchy of that Church, before the appointed time that the great Monarch of the Christian Church, should change that former way of administration.</p>
               <p>And as we before noted, the first stiled Prophets to be such as were sharers of the unction of power of the first stiled King; and that the Kings, <hi>Saul, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> had also this spirit of Prophesie, in testimony of their right thereto, for enabling them in their Offices of Government, so shall we find this spirit of Jewish prophesie, to expire with the last person that had this unction of power remaining; namely <hi>Caiphas</hi> the high Priest; being the last person that succeeded in that Church in the Seat and Authority of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Law. For so it is plainly there set down, that he <hi>Spake not this of himself, but being high Priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should dye for that Nation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 11.51.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so again, this his Prophesie is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards plainly set down to be the same with Counsel; where it is said, <hi>Caiphas was he that gave Counsel to the Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 18.14:</note> 
                  <hi>that it was expedient that one man should dye for the people.</hi> And if we make not this Prophetick Office and Trust a part of Monarchical and Kingly Function, and so for some time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted by the High Priest, I see not how any footsteps or remains of the Government and <hi>Scepter of Judah,</hi> could be found visibly continuing until the coming of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>So that now, since the time of Christs uniting these Offices in himself, and thereby also abolishing the necessity of any fixed Ceremonial Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of any external Priestly jurisdiction separate from that of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch; and again, by the division of the kingdom &amp; government of his <hi>Church,</hi> amongst so many heads subordinate unto him, that there need not, as amongst the Jews (where was but one nation) be any distinct settlement of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick 
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55976:185"/>
to direct against the overthrow of kingship therein, there seemed no such use of reservation: because, if one or two should through iniquity or indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fail, yet all could not. Therefore, it cannot now be reasonably contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, that the power of each Churches jurisdiction is wholly centred in the person of each Christian Prince, by deputation from that supreme head thereof that was Priest and Prophet as well as King.</p>
               <p>The full proof of this connexion will appear by due consideration of that place of <hi>Moses</hi>; where he, (recounting again Gods recess from Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and instruction, as from himself, and commending the peoples desire herein), promiseth that God will <hi>raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren like unto him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 18.18.</note> from whose mouth they shall receive all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. By which words of <hi>a Prophet like unto me,</hi> we are to understand a chief Ruler or King like unto <hi>Moses</hi>; for the notion of Prophet, seperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, was never rightly given to <hi>Moses.</hi> And so doth <hi>Nathaniel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this Prophet to be the <hi>King of Israel.</hi> And generally,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.49.</note> so did that whole Nation expound it also: as may appear by the peoples readiness <hi>to make him a King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 6.14, 15.</note> when they perceived he was <hi>that great Prophet that should come into the world.</hi> Whence we may plainly perceive, that, as to be a Prophet in chief, imports to the same as to be a Governor in chief, so is the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in chief to be reputed and obeyed as the Prophet or instructer in chief: Prophesie signifying the same with Instruction, and Instruction being proper to persons in Authority.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if the Apostles and other heads of Churches in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, had this power over persons miraculously gifted by God, and whom themselves had not set up in Authority; (being extraordinarily by God Called and Ordained thereunto) How much more may the heads of Churches now claim it over such as have not extraordinary revelation from Heaven, nor any Church jurisdiction but what is from themselves derived.</p>
               <p>For these may now challenge, as supreme Christian heads of each Church, the re-union of that power which was separately by other Christian heads en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed whilst they were none: and, upon the same reason of infidelity that made their former Christian subjects deny them obedience in some things, they are now, (being Christians) to claim it as entire to themselves. And therefore, as we before noted, the Apostles and such like former Christian heads to have sole rightful power whilst the King was not a Christian, and that he was but an usurper in what he did in the Church, so, they being now Christians, it follows that all that intermeddle without their leave, are usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers also.</p>
               <p>From all which, and what hath heretofore been said in the Argument, we may easily conceive how to determine concerning Apostolical succession: in right whereof, those of the Romish Prelacy would at this day take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves supreme and independent power in Church affairs: even because the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had so in relation to their contemporary Pagan Kings and Magistrates; and would, on the other side, leave to Christian Kings onely civil coercion and Authority; because so much, and no more, was formerly possessed by Infidels. We shall therefore say, that where the Bishop is (in his City or Diocess) the supreme Christian Governor, (as to many of those Ancient Bishops and Patriarchs it happened before Kings were Christians, and at this day, in <hi>Rome, Collen, Trier,</hi> &amp;c. is practised) there, and then are they to lay claim to direct Apostolical succession: as having none on earth their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55976:186"/>
in Ecclesiastical power. But when, and where that City or Diocess is but part of a greater Church, united under a Christian head superior to these particular and inferior heads; then, and there is that chief Bishop or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer of that Church to be held the rightful successor of Apostolical power; and the other Bishops to be subordinate unto him: even as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were formerly to St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted, but as this office of Ecclesiastical super-intenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is to be acknowledged as of Divine Right, so may Bishops (so far as their power is extensive) account themselves the Apostles successors therein: which as it will estate them in rightful power to govern the Presbyters and others below them, so will it again subject them to their head in chief: even to him, that is the more direct and entire successor of Apostolical jurisdiction. From whom, (in that regard) they are to derive their personal Ordination (or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment into determinate jurisdiction and power); even as <hi>Zadock,</hi> the type of Evangelical Priesthood, received his from <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Type of Christian Kingship: although the act and Ceremonies of Consecration are to be, under the Gospel, as formerly under the Law, received from those of the Priesthood onely; in acknowledgement of divine constitution of that Function.</p>
               <p>But for this omission of Princes in assuming their right upon their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he may easily see the reason, that shall consider that great splendor of the Roman Emperors, and that poverty and more mean condition which the Bishops and such like Church heads did at first live in: who, being at that time well studyed in their Masters Precepts of Obedience and Humility, had so little strugled for jurisdiction or riches, that there might seem rather scorn to take, then desire to assume and engross what they had. And, it may be, more fresh sense of Piety and Devotion, might make these first Christian Emperors willingly rather enlargers, then detractors from men of such pious and harmless conversation. The which might make them also less studious of those inconveniences which might grow from hence afterwards; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themselves, but all other Christian Kings: who, from their examples, were often made believe, that their highest expressions of devotion was to be measured by their advancemene of Christs Church, meaning Clergy-men: and that also, by taking the Jewels out of their own Crowns, and therewith embellishing their Myters. Whether this omission were begun, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued through ignorance, pride, or blinded zeal, is not so certain, as is that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity which from thence hath arisen: namely of Kings having no more power in the Church allowed them being become Christians then they had before: nay and less too, since some of these will now put in for so great a share,</p>
               <p>But it is to be considered, that as the admonition was then most proper, of <hi>fear not them that can kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. in respect that Pagan Kings had not Ecclesiastical coertion so was the distinction of duties and obedience into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Civil, then most proper also. The which will upon the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son come now to be united: because of the union of that person command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Christ in chief in both.</p>
               <p>And therefore, had the Primitive Christian Princes well examined Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> distinction of his own and others Apostolical jurisdiction, they would have found in them the whole rights of their Crowns comprised: when he said,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let a man so account of us as Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55976:186"/>
mysteries of God.</hi> Under the first expression of <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> (or his Deacons or Deputies) they shall finde Magistracy and more Civil power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Christian persons and actions within their Church contained: in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all power given over the way and manner of Gods outward worship; and also the chief charge and care of Preaching or Instruction. Which makes St. <hi>Paul</hi> proceed in the description of his Stewards Office onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he undertook little in the other.</p>
               <p>For since it was the most natural and reasonable course, to lay down Rules and Instructions for men to follow, before any outward execution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by Rewards or Punishments (in observing or neglecting them) could be established, we may finde good reason why our Saviour did dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his Authority to those first Fathers and heads of the Church, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that power they should from him receive to represent him herein: saying to them, <hi>all power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth, Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all Nations, &amp;c. teaching them to observe all things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have commanded you,</hi>

                  <hi>and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world.</hi> And, it must be acknowledged a thing reasonable, that since the actions of voluntary Agents must have issue from their understanding, that therefore, in order to that obedience which was expected to follow, there should be appointed a powerful way of instruction to precede. Which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of instruction, although it did for this cause precede, yet since Christ had promised the continuance of his presence or power with it <hi>unto the end of the world,</hi> as knowing it to be at all times necessary for him that is to have the charge of Government under him, we cannot but resolve that this Office of Instruction or Preaching is to be held and exercised by all others but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, and in dependence of that present head of the Church: who holds, amongst other Unctions, a deputation herein in chief from Christ himself; who was <hi>anointed to preach.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the first heads, the attestation of miracles, which gave them Authority to be hearkened unto in their message of Instruction, gave them thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, upon all necessary occasions, Authority to be obeyed as Heads and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors. In the last heads, as Conquest and the ordinary ways of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth design the Governor first, so doth it therewith also estate him in the right of supreme Instruction, as necessary thereto. And surely, they that would deny the necessary conjunction of these two essential parts of Government, that is of the Indicative and Vindicative, not allowing to the same person as well a power to direct how to live and do well, as to punish for doing otherwise, and all because he doth not personally execute this Office of Instruction, but leaves it to others, may upon like ground deny his right and power in condemning and punishing, because the same is performed by others also.</p>
               <p>From all which we may see the Kings Title and Right now, as <hi>Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Steward,</hi> to order things pertaining to his Worship, as well as we may finde that the Title of each individual Prince to this Office of Gods Minister and Head of the Church doth rest now upon the same evidence of right, which each person hath to the enjoyment of his own propriety in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty from others. For as God made such and such Creatures for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use of men, so did he institute such and such Offices for their use too: In the vacancy of which Offices, there lies an equal right to the next possessor upon the same natural reason, as there doth to the next possessor of Land,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55976:187"/>
Cattel, or any other goods, which have for the present no rightful proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>And if any should think the Christian Prince now debarred from claim to Apostolical succession and power in ordering of Church-discipline and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, according to the exegencies of times and places, as the Apostles, by their Traditions, formerly did; and all because they are not now, like them, miraculously inspired and assisted; they may, upon the same reason, even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the use of preaching and instruction to be by any now exercised also; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, by some miraculous attestation and proof, those separated to that Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can evidence their Call and Authority herein to be more then ordinary, and to have been conferred on them by hands as holy as those of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles also. But, as this more express appearance of divine assistance &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of persons, is not now to be expected or relyed upon, so neither, (in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) can it be brought as a bar to the divine right of execution of the one, more then another; nor to regal super-intency in both.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as we have formerly shewed the necessity of our submission to the Prince his guidance in our outward observation of that Law of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self</hi>; so must we conclude it much more necessary, that that form and manner of service, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to express our devotions in fulfilling that Precept,<note place="margin">

               <p>For if the authorized worship of any Kingdom, should be subject to be sin or scandal to any the subjects of the same kingdom, and professing the same Religion also, then can God never be outwardly worshipt, nor any Religion publikely exercised, but the parties must commit sin in doing it: because some or other will still be of a contrary minde; and so take offence and scandal thereat. And therefore, scandal must ever arise from the fewer number to the greater. For although the use and continuance of some Jewish and heathenish Ceremonies, were in the Primitive times scandalous; they were not called so because Jews or Heathens used them, but because a few men (having now included themselves in the common profession and number of Christianity) would therein dissent from the common practice of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which ran otherwise. And then again, since God himself doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the whole outward form of expressing our Love and Praises of him, and that he doth, it is yet recommended for execution to the supreme Magistrates trust, it must follow, that so often as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his Rule, we must be scandalous; and in danger of error and sin.</p>
               <p>And to this purpose we shall finde Saint <hi>Paul</hi> very express, when he gives the Romans warning to avoid scandal or offences; saying, <hi>Now I beseech you brethren mark them which cause division and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For if (as before proved), obedience be a necessary duty to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved towards the making our Love and Services to our neighbors effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it must be concluded much more necessary and expedient, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in keeping up that which is the end thereof, the glory and publike worship of God. And therefore as it would seem absurd in our actions, to drive at such an end which we did never intend to perform and enjoy, (as it would be to be always practizing Offices tending to mutual preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that thereby God might have the greater number of Praisers, and yet never practice this duty of Praise and Worship), so must we thence infer, that in, and towards the stating and exercise of this duty, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is most especially required; as to the meritorious and final object of all the rest.</p>
               <p>So that, if, by means of our obedience to Christ in the Church, (his Kingdom here upon earth,) there be not an uniformity kept up, in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exercises of all those duties that serve for the advancement of Gods Kingdom in our hearts, and for setting forth his Worship and praise for benefits received, that Unity and Coition of the Christian Grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For however it may be allowable to each single man (as best sensible of his own enjoyments and wants), to thank God or pray to him privately, in such manner and words as himself findes most warrantable and behoofeful; yet, must it be acknowledged reasonable, that all those publike forms of Worship and Praise, whose practise is necessary for constituting each place an unite and distinct Christian Church or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, should be at the dispose and appointment of that publike person onely, who under Christ is the supreme and entire head and Representativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For these things have a natural and necessary coherence: the Unity of the end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Coition and Unity in the means; and that again requires uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the directions themselves, as well as Unity in the person directing: all of them to be made useful by the Grace of Obedience before noted. But because much dissention hath hitherto) arisen about that Officer or person
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:55976:188"/>
we are to give the obedience unto, in regard of the different names of power in Scripture used. We will speak something farther here, of that Coition or succession of this supreme Officer now under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>This we shall finde briefly done by Christ himself, when he is impowring these several <hi>little ones.</hi> Where he begins with those that should first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him, namely such as should presently succeed as his own Desciples and followers:<note place="margin">Matth. 10.40.</note> 
                  <hi>he that receiveth you receiveth me,</hi> &amp;c. Under which (no doubt) the first Apostles were to be comprized: who, in regard of their mean worldly condition, might sometimes be objects of Charity also; even to the receiving <hi>a cup of cold water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next object of our obedience is set down under the notion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>he that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 41.</note> Under this notion we may comprehend Episcopal, or Patriarchical power succeeding; which had power of instruction, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of jurisdiction: the which was reserved for the last more glorious Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer <hi>the just man,</hi> or <hi>righteous man: And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man,</hi>

                  </gap>nt: no otherwise then in the Jewish Church, it at first was unto <hi>Moses</hi> their first King. For so we shall finde it plainly delivered concerning <hi>Aaron</hi> and him: <hi>Thou shalt speak unto him</hi> (meaning <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Aaron) and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth; and will teach you what ye shall do:</hi> Which is the same with being a <hi>spirit of judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 4.15.</note> or <hi>Mishpat:</hi> and of being <hi>in the mouth of their seed, and seeds seed for ever,</hi> before spoken of.</p>
               <p>And then follows the subordination of the Prophets: <hi>and he shall be thy spokesman</hi> (or Angel) <hi>unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be, to thee instead of a mouth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and thou shalt be to him as a God.</hi> And in the first verse of the seventh Chapter, he is expresly called <hi>Moses</hi> Prophet: <hi>Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet</hi> or Angel. The which doth plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew the Coincidence of Christian Authority, under each Christian King and Monarch: to make useful the coition of the means before spoken of. For he, as the last most glorious deputed Minister to Christ amongst us, is to claim our obedience in his name; in all things done towards the stating of Charity: and, as <hi>Steward in the mysteries of God,</hi> is to be obeyed in all our outward religious deportments.</p>
               <p>Nay, that very Argument of mysteriousness and profoundness in matters of divine truth and worship, (which some would urge in bar to the Kings inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling in causes of Religion as the true <hi>Steward of the mysteries of God),</hi> is by the wisest King and Preacher, made to be the proper glory and part of his Office:<note place="margin">Prov. 25.2.</note> saying, <hi>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honor of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:55976:188"/>
Kings is to search out a matter.</hi> In which words, <hi>Kings</hi> being set in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number,<note place="margin">Prov. 25.2.</note> makes it appear that this of liberty searching into the mysteries of God, was not reserved to <hi>Solomon</hi> onely, but was belonging to each King as Gods Vicegerent on earth. Nor was it so set down as to denote that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual King could personally attain to such ability: but to shew that each King being Gods chief Steward, that therefore those things which by means <hi>of his Seers and Prophets</hi> under him were performed, should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted to the <hi>honor of the King:</hi> as being done by him, because of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to his supreme Authority therein.</p>
               <p>And those persons that are most subject, to inveigh against publike forms, as Will-worship, Superstition, and Scandal, are themselves the onely men that are truly guilty of Will-worship and Scandal, by relying on their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Wills and Judgements, and preferring their own devises and forms to the practises of all others; whereby to introduce general offence and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. And so again, when they refuse to joyn with others in their publike services, out of the fear of superstition in giving too much; and do choose to proceed in contrary or negative performances, this, as being induced and carryed on by superstitious and ungrounded fear to displease, offends in the worse extream, and turns to be true Superstition indeed. And I verily believe, that men are generally more superstitious in avoidance of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, then they are in observing them: for this is Superstition upon Superstition.</p>
               <p>For the truth is, if publike reason and appointment be excluded in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forms of Gods Service and Worship, then, since himself hath appointed no form to us Christians (as such), he can now have no right external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship given to him at all: which (doubtless) for honor sake, is eternally due to him as God; and, by way of gratitude, to be returned from us. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew it to be a thing necessary to be done, yet knowing also that we now have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, (as useful presidents for general dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in what we are to do) that is, since we have all that light which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given to any people; if these, and those many general Precepts since given cannot be sufficient, together without great helps of natural learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reason we now enjoy, we are left without all excuse.</p>
               <p>And if we mark the gradations of Gods immediate appearance to man since the beginning in these instructions, we shall finde it to decrease by degrees, even in this particular also, as mans instructions and reason have grown to be more. To <hi>Adam</hi> and the Fathers, he was often directer in the way of his Worship, as the Father of the Family: that is, <hi>Viva voce.</hi> After mankinde encreased, he ruled as King, by positive Laws. After which, as men grew more and more knowing of their duty, he withdrew his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate appearance by degrees.</p>
               <p>And if men will consider things without vulgar prejudice, it must be acknowledged a course both rendring God highest Praise, and us conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently most benefit. For since all our Worship and Service of him, must be so much the more acceptable as it shall be more voluntary; and since it must be by so much more voluntary, as more agreeing to our understanding; it must thereupon also be an addition to his Worship and Praise, when, being left in the manner and measure indefinite, we know it our duties to do it continually and all we can; then
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:55976:189"/>
if in performance of his positive commands, we should have rested, as having throughly performed our whole service. As we see it come to pass in the examples of the Jews, Scribes, and Pharisees, that had their literal appointed Worship and Ceremonies; how ready they were to acquiess, as having performed all their bounden duties; and to neglect the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al serving and honoring him, even in weightier matters.</p>
               <p>And again, when God doth not prescribe his own outward Worship and manner of service, we may farther acknowledge our benefit herein; even for that our occasional breaches are not now so highly dangerous to us Christians, as formerly to the Jews. Amongst whom (upon that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) how frequent shall we find the crime of Idolatry laid to their charge; encreasing not only from the malicious instigation of that wicked Serpent, always most ready to wreath himself into our fancies, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ways to break those Precepts God doth most immediately command; but by reason also of the aggravation of their offence, in the least deviation from things to commanded, without due license and Authority. Whereas amongst Christians, where God is not immediate in these injunctions, but (only requiring the measure thereof to be <hi>with all our heart, with all our mind, with all our strength</hi>) hath left the manner of doing it to the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, there cannot be such danger of that kind of Idolatry about the manner of celebrating Gods outward Worship: But our danger of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is chiefly in the measure; that is, in preferring <hi>Mammon</hi> before him, or looking with such affectionate eyes on our own proprieties, as to make <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness to be Idolatry.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.5. Coloss. 3.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By means of leaving those outward Forms to the Churches power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and contrivement, God is not (again) so subject to have his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness and All-sufficiency mistaken; by mens thinking that he hath need of these, or any the like things: And so also are we more like to avoid, the danger of Idolatry and Superstition, which should be incident to be given to such things as should be by him immediately chosen to that purpose.<note place="margin">John 4.23.</note> For when we (who are now instructed, that his <hi>true Worship is in spirit and truth,</hi> and that these outward Forms are but to mind us, and make us perceptible of the inward graces they signifie, and to strengthen in our selves, and confirm in others, our real and hearty acknowledgement of his deserved praise and glory) do thereupon choose, from instance of what is most honourable in our esteem, to set forth our thankfulness in the esteem of others; this, as it cannot be to subject to Idolatry, so must it be more lively and fervent, in expressing and raising our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And therefore we may observe, that whilst God did prescribe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner of his Worship and Adoration, it was in such things and ceremonies as had highest esteem amongst men; and it was (in common acknowledgement) a good rule for examination of fitness herein, by comparing it to the usage and esteem of persons of highest rank amongst our selves,<note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note> saying, <hi>Offer it now to thy Governor, and see if he will accept it.</hi> And with these very Kings and all else, it was rule of honouring him with our substance: Which they did with most wonderful expence, giving the world thereby to understand, the high value they esteemed him at. When<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.24.</note> 
                  <hi>if they should have sacrificed unto him of that which cost them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:55976:189"/>
men might well have judged they had served <hi>Mammon</hi> better then he; and so through Covetousness have commited Idolatry, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted.</p>
               <p>And let men (with <hi>Judas</hi>) cry out whilst they will, <hi>Wherefore all this waste?</hi> yet,<note place="margin">John 12.4:</note> since the measure of our praising and setting forth Gods glory in the sight of men, must arise from the rare of those outward expressions we do to that purpose make (for our inward hearts none can measure other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) when we offer or dedicate (therefore) things <hi>vile</hi> unto him, we then (instead of exalting him) do the best we can to dishonor him; as too often we find it.</p>
               <p>As these considerations, prove the leaving the form of Gods outward Worship to man himself, as the most likely means to have it thereupon to. be oftenest practised, and so his heart kept aright in doing it; so will it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear farther reasonable, that it be the peculiar charge of that <hi>(the) man</hi> that hath the whole trust of each Church where the same is to be done, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he himself, being greatest, cannot but be best able to judge what Solemnities are fittest to be given, for advancement and expression of the praise of one so great as God is; and must be also most able, to see the same performed publikely and in decent manner.</p>
               <p>Nay, his very doing it, will advance Gods honor in mens esteem, above the doing it by others, as far as his dignity is above that of his ordinary subjects: Which may seem one main reason for instituting Monarchy; namely, that by the contracting the power and glory of a people into one person, God may by him be more entirely and eminently honoured in his publique Worship and Service. For as the institution of a Church, and the reason of Gods more particular bounty and presence to them above the rest of mankind, was (as heretofore noted) from the consideration of the encrease of Gods glory, through their more remarkable way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing their service and gratitude for so high favours; even so also may we think, that this extraordinary dignifying of some persons in the same Church above others (and so of one person especially above all the rest) was also (through his more high and remarkable dignity and obligation) to have himself more dignified in his Worship, proportionable to the quality of the person doing it. And therefore as we shall never find God Almighty deputing or impowering above one person in chief as his Representant to the people, either in declaring what his Divine Will is, or for seeing the same executed: So this may be the reason also, of those many more strict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions for Kings duties to God, and of those more particular examples of punishing and rewarding his zeal or neglect, as if it had been that of all the rest.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we will set down this rule, That where the Supreme Magistrate is a Christian, there all our outward deportments, for expressing our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods command in serving and honoring him, or loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, must be subject to his direction; and whensoever done against it, we cannot, but (by following our own wills) be in danger, not only to commit Superstition and Idolatry, but Rebellion also. Whereas, doing these things according to inward devotion, and that also guided by the duty of obedience, we cannot be culpable of either of them. For although there may be Ceremonies (as we find in some Churches)
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55976:190"/>
which may seem to lean that way; yet I see not how the obedient member should in the exercise of his devotion according to the Institution of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, have the guilt of Superstition charged on him, for performance of such duties as truly are Superstitious, more then for what is not; since he had no more liberty to institute, or examine the one then the other. For however superstitious fear or misguided zeal, might cause the Authority of that Church to erre in the establishment of them; yet can it not be the fault of him, whose part is to obey in all things, but not to direct in any.</p>
               <p>And (for conclusion) we shall again say, that as all the other good and happiness of each Kingdom, must have existence and vigour from the truth and sincerity of Religion therein publikely practised, and the truth and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of this Religion and Gods Worship therein, must again be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ours and others knowledge and esteem, by frequent exercises of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whereby to cause it to take impression) we must also set it down, that as to give unto God no outward Form of Worship at all will resolve into Atheism, so (in the same Kingdom) to do it publiquely more ways then one, will resolve into Polytheism; which, if not Atheism, will soon turn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. The which, experience too clearly shews to come to pass, in those places where (publike Forms being decryed as humane inventions (and too full of Superstition) private men, led with true Superstition indeed (that is, with private conscience and fear) do severally stretch their inventions on such few insignificant Ceremonies and Forms, as being themselves of no esteem in our sense, must consequently render that devotion they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press to be in the end so also; and, in the mean time, involve us into all those civil disturbances, which are wont to be deserved and attended by scandal and breach of Charity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Of Antichrist.</head>
               <p>ALthough those two Offices of Kingship and Priesthood, be by none denyed as necessary for him, that is to protect and redeem us from all enemies and afflictions temporal and ghostly; yet do mens prejudices in unwary disjoyning them, and eclipsing the one by too sole reliance on the other, make both of them many times uneffectual; and by too much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting and bending our belief and endeavors, in pursuit and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, under that capacity only we list to fancy (as nearest our own aims) we hazard, or deservedly lose that whole benefit, that can acrew but to such onely, as do wholly own, and relye upon him in both.</p>
               <p>Thus the Jews, that had their promises running always in a strain of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral felicity, were subject to interpret and expect, all the Prophesies of Redemption and Restauration, to run in the same sense also: This prejudice sticking so close, that those very Disciples that waited on our Saviours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and had both his life and doctrine witnesses to the contrary, yet they became so wholly intent hereon, that because it failed but a little in the present expectation, their hopes in him as to the other, seems wholly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and overcome: For so <hi>Cleophas</hi> (having told how the chief Priests and Rulers had put to death and crucified our Saviour) saith, <hi>But we trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it had been he that should have redeemed Israel:</hi> This over-hasty,<note place="margin">Luke 24 21.</note> and too great intention of Christs exercise of his Power and Kingship here, making them <hi>slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets had spoken,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 25.</note> and so inconsiderately pass over the necessary performance of his other Office of Mediatorship; not considering how that (in order thereunto) <hi>Christ ought to have suffered first, and then to enter into his glory</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 26.</note> not well considering that death and hell were the first grand enemies he was to conquer; and so upon his humiliation, to proceed, as the way to his exaltation.</p>
               <p>On the other hand again, amongst Christians (that do not so litterally lay claim to those particular promises made to the Jewish Nation) the other Office of Mediatorship, which he performeth as the only High Priest, comes because of its nearer concern in our spiritual benefits and good, so wholly to take up the conceits of many, that the name of Christ seems drowned in that of <hi>Jesus</hi>; not well considering also how by omitting our acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him and his power, we hazard the receipt of those his benefits, which stand promised on that condition; namely, how <hi>those that would not that he should reign over them</hi> here, <hi>are counted his enemies</hi>;<note place="margin">Luke 19.27.</note> and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect share of his Inheritance, nor to remain with him hereafter.</p>
               <p>Which speech, being by him uttered just upon his going to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to take possession of his temporal Kingdom in right of his father <hi>David,</hi> may well instruct Christians against their usual prejudices, in acknowledging Christs exercise of temporal power, onely because he doth not personally appear therein: For so it is set down; <hi>And when he had thus spoken,</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:55976:191"/>
(that is, declared his right to raign as Christ) <hi>he went before, ascending up to Ierusalem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the manner of Christs raigning, we have spoken in some places before: both to shew how he denyeth the personal exercise of his Kingship amongst us as yet, and how again he doth it by Deputies or Vice-Roys (as sub-Christs under him) in several places of his Church; reserving so often to himself the stile <hi>King of Kings</hi>: Thereby declaring, that as all Crowns and Scepters are now derived from him, so are they hereafter to be laid at his feet.</p>
               <p>But though, in regard of the particular incredulity of the Jews, with whom he only conversed, he bend his most frequent arguments in confirmation of the necessity of the other Office, yet this is always asserted too, or remains undenyed. And therefore, when his Disciples (full of Jewish prejudice) <hi>ask him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the Kingdom to Israel:</hi> He denies not his own right, in exercise of temporal power over his Church; but strives to inform them, that the time of doing it was their mistake. For Christ being (as aforesaid) to perform his first Office by suffering here, and the other not till he enter into his glory; he therefore answers, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father hath put into his own power</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
                  <hi>but ye shall receive power, after that the holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Ierusalem, and in all Iudea, and in Samaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and unto the utmost part of the earth</hi>; whereby it appears, that the time appointed by God for the exercise of compleat Monarchical power in the Church was not yet come; and therefore he tells them of that power that should in the mean time be exercised by them.</p>
               <p>Of which Apostolical power we have spoken somewhat before; and therewith shewed, how their Government was Monarchical, and that by reason of Unction of power from Christ, they had the right to be his chief Deputies in all things in each Church where they did preside, although their modesty, and the Heathen Magistrates usurpation, would not suffer them then to shew it.</p>
               <p>And if we mark the precedent discourse, Christ may be found giving them this real power of Headship, proportionable to that degree of glory the Church was then in: For it would have been strange, for a distressed, and despised Church, to have had a glorious or high tituled Head. So that, although that sort of glorious Kingdom, which they fancied, could not yet be restored to the Church, yet that they should in the mean time be his sole Deputies in the managery of this Kingdom, appears in that he was with them forty days, giving them commandment, and speaking of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God; and so he bids them abide at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for the promised baptism of the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Luke 24.49.</note> or <hi>to be endued with power from on high:</hi> The which we may conceive to be the Unction of Church power, because this promise is made a reason of this their demand about the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: <hi>viz. When they therefore were come together, they asked him saying, Lord wilt thou, &amp;c.</hi> And his answer is negative only, to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exercise thereof as yet; but affirmative to their doing it by that power which they should receive from the Holy Ghost: Whereby, and by the words <hi>Witnesses to me,</hi> we may well understand represent me in my power, both of doing and suffering; according to that Commission which he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where gives them:<note place="margin">John 20 21.</note> 
                  <hi>As my father sent me, so send I you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:55976:191"/>So that the sum of all is, that as it behoved him that was <hi>the head to be made perfect by sufferings</hi>; even so his Church to arise to her glory, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the glory of Kingship, by such degrees of sufferings, as her great King should be pleased to appoint.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, how unlike soever the means seemed to them, yet should the advancement of his Kingdom thereby be to his greater honor; that could give them power by sending of the Holy Ghost, to be witnesses and promoters thereof. And therefore as God before (in the Theocrity) appeared in setting up the Church of the Jews, so Christ in the beginning, acts more powerfully from Heaven in his, it seeming a thing unreasonable to make a recess, and to give over his miraculous assistance, until the work it self had attained such height and strength, as to be fit to be performed by Deputies; and that in a Monarchical form, according to the patern of Government used in Heaven it self.</p>
               <p>But it is like, that the Apostles had more confidently made this Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, upon mistake of our Saviours speeches unto them: First,<note place="margin">Luke 12.32. Chap. 22.36,</note> 
                  <hi>Of giving them the Kingdom</hi>; and afterwards in bidding them <hi>now provide themselves of swords:</hi> As if their former way of dependance on extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, were to be now abandoned, and this Kingly way of acquisition and administration to be by them exercised. And that they thought this way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to themselves, may appear by their present shewing him two swords, and of S. <hi>Peters</hi> hasty using one of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>But the Kingdom in the first place promised to these <hi>his little flock,</hi> or <hi>flock of little ones, was the Kingdom</hi>; that is, the Kingdom of Heaven, and not any glorious Judicature here, more then he their present Master had: No, they were <hi>first to seek the righteousness of the Kingdom of God</hi> after the same way their Master had done:<note place="margin">Matth. 6.33.</note> which as it was most proportionable during the Theocraty, so should it be to them more glorious, then the <hi>Royal Robes</hi> of any <hi>Solomon,</hi> even then those more majestick robes which succeeding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings should wear: To which purpose, they might have considered his former designation of their manner of Glory and Judicature, wherein he he saith, that he that <hi>serveth, should not expect to be greater then he that sitteth at meat.</hi> And that therefore, <hi>they who had continued with him,</hi>

                     </gap>. Verse 28.29.</note> 
                  <hi>as his companions, should have a kingdom appointed to them, as his Father had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one to him</hi>: and not have their time of Judicature, till the last judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at which time, they <hi>that had followed him in the regeneration</hi>; that is, had here mostly executed the Offices of Evangelists, when <hi>the Son of man, should sit on the throne of his glory, they also should sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</hi>

               <p>So that then, their exercise of Kingship being to be like that of their Master, namely, by <hi>witnessing for him and his Gospel in Judea, &amp;c.</hi> as he had already <hi>witnessed a good witness before Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <hi>so making up what was behind of the affli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.36</note>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55976:192"/>
upon the glorious establishment of his Church under his glorious Deputies. At which time, his Vice-roys should be in a capacity to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others by these swords; and were not (under pain of tempting God) again to grow altogether careless of supplying themselves, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer labourers were.</p>
               <p>And that his meaning herein was prophetique and future, they might have gathered by that which followed, saying, <hi>That the things written must yet</hi> (or first) <hi>be accomplished in me</hi>: that is, <hi>as he was numbred amongst the transgressors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.37. <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                  </note> so must he himself suffer as one also. Which <hi>having had an end concerning him,</hi> then should the power and eminence of his Church so arise by degrees, that through the glory of his succeeding deputed Christs (which exercised their dominion in his name) the rest of the prophesie should be made good unto him; <hi>viz. That God would divide him a portion with the great,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 53.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and that</hi> (by these his Deputies swords) <hi>he himself should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the spoil with the strong</hi>; that is, when <hi>he shall have made his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed</hi> (meaning more especially these his adopted Sons) and, by means of their ministration, <hi>he shall prolong his days</hi>; that is, in exercise of temporal Kingship. And thereby, <hi>the pleasure of the Lord,</hi> concerning the Churches temporal salvation and glory (as well as eternal) <hi>shall prosper in his hands.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Apostles mistake in the forementioned demand, was in the <hi>time and season</hi> of Christs more majestick appearance in the exercise of Kingly power in this kingdom of the Church by God given him, and not in the true right he had thereunto.</p>
               <p>Their mistake also was in fixing their thoughts too strictly on the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Nation; as if <hi>Israel,</hi> in the litteral sense, and not the whole Church had been the Kingdom to be thus dignified and advanced by his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>These mistakes they were also the rather led into, in regard of those many promises made in particular to the Jewish Nation; and also, for that those promised blessings were always exemplified under the person of <hi>David,</hi> whose natural son they knowing our Saviour to be, it made them to expect he should thereupon be himself the executioner and undertaker thereof; and so to be actually seated <hi>in the Throne of his father David,</hi> as it was before promised to the blessed Virgin. Yet if they had withal consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that other prediction concerning our Saviour made to <hi>Joseph,</hi> namely, <hi>that he should save his people from their sins</hi>; they would not then have gone about to make the execution of his Office of temporal Jesuship, precipitately to defeat that other his Office of saving souls. But our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that knew best his appointed time and manner for performance of these offices, executed first the higher and greater work in his own person, and leaves the other to be brought about and executed by Substitutes anointed under him: <hi>He upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and sate down at the right hand of Majesty on high.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which regard, although every member of his Church were equally his seed, and equal to one another in reference to that Mediatorship (which was consummated in his own person, without other future assistance save that of the Holy Ghost) yet, in regard of the Prophetick and Kingly part (or the part of Instruction and Government) which was to be compleated
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55976:192"/>
by Humane deputation, they were again severally dignified and differenced one from another; and so might be unequally esteemed his seed, as they stood in that respect nearer in relation unto him, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.12.</note> And as this difference is to be observed, <hi>that we be not like children</hi> (without a Father) <hi>carried to and fro of every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> so is it to last till Christs second coming;<note place="margin">Verse 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that we come to the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the glory of the Church (this Kingdom of God given unto Christ) being to arise by these means and degrees, it is the reason of that petition of <hi>Thy kingdom come.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 8 10.</note> Which importing (no doubt) its encrease and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here (in order to have his name more hallowed and honored thereby) may be well interpreted to signifie our desire that this Church may arise at such a degree and state of eminence, that it may be proportionable in splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and dignity, to admit the true Idea and Platform of Regiment used by God himself: Not as if the measure of Gods Omnipotent power should be then encreased, but that the manner of execution thereof in the Church should be also more conform; namely, <hi>That his will may be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>For although before it, Christs Will and Law (for the matter of them) was as truly (if not more) performed in the Apostles time, and by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church then afterwards; no otherwise, then in the Jewish Church, Gods service was generally more unstained before Kings then afterwards; yet, as amongst them, the accomplishment of Gods aim and promise of having a place to put his name in, was made the object of their desires (as therewith importing their own promised happiness also) so in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church you may find reason why it should be commanded us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our desires to that of Gods; and that, besides the matter of our own inward devotions and charity (whereby we severally and privately perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his will) we should desire the manner of performance of it, to be outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorious and uniform also: that it may answer, as near as may be, that ready service which Angels do in heaven.</p>
               <p>For if we <hi>hallow and glorifie his name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.9.</note> and do also acknowledge his <hi>power and kingdom on earth, as it is in heaven,</hi> we shall (no doubt) then best <hi>do his will in earth, as it is in heaven.</hi> Whereupon concluding also,<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> that the first petition of hallowing Gods name, is to be explained also <hi>on earth as it is in heaven</hi> (because we have no need, nor warrant to doubt, or wish the doing it in Heaven) it is farther evident, that the petition of <hi>Kingdom come,</hi> must relate to the Churches future prosperity; according to whose splendor and greatness, God himself and his Kingdom may be rightly said to be more or less <hi>come</hi> or present amongst us, even as he is more or less majestically r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore, we being to ascribe <hi>all kingdom, power,</hi>

                  <hi>and glory unto him</hi> (without wresting from him the right of <hi>his everlasting kingdom amongst men</hi>) we may explain this petition of <hi>Thy kingdom come,</hi> in our Gospel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of prayer, by that petition of the Jewish Churches prosperity, included in their injunction, <hi>To pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This our commanded Petition, pointing at the glory and encrease of the Church, and particularly under Kingship, may also well be understood as proportioned and answering the many Gospel-Promises made to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and those particular promises also, heretofore made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other the Church Fathers and Founders; namely, that their encrease of race and posterity should be crowned with the blessing of Kingship also, as we have formerly noted.</p>
               <p>So that, besides the expression of our desire that Gods honor (by the encrease of his Power and Kingdom amongst men) may be advanced, (which we are always to seek before any thing that concerns our selves) this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the encrease of the Churches power, was inclusive also of our own benefits; as secretly importing a request for the abatement and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those grivous persecutions which the power of Heathenish Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity did then inflict; conform to that natural desire of our Saviour himself (so often repeated) <hi>Father,</hi>

                  <hi>if it be thy will, let this cup pass from me.</hi> From which persecutions, as they were to hope release answerable to those many Prophesies formerly made of the Churches prosperity and eminence in Power, so were they to pray that God would bring it to pass, by <hi>setting the mountain of the Lords house, on the top of every mountain, and above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him</hi>; that is, by advancing Christs Kingdom and Power to such height, as it might be of highest eminence amongst men. By which means (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all those many oppositions made in the beginning by Pagan Kings and others) God would perform his promise, of, <hi>Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill</hi>;<note place="margin">Psalm 2.6.</note> that is, advanced my Churches power to such hight, that the members thereof may now be sensible of those many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Peace and Prosperity, which under Christs glorious Kingdom they were to enjoy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>So that, although Christ and his Gospel appeared to the Jews as under a cloud, yet while <hi>they were all baptized unto Moses</hi> (Christs Minister)

                  <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come</hi>; that we should not murmure against Christ chief Minister, and so tempt him as they did.</p>
               <p>And that murmuring against Gods Minister, is by God reckoned as against himself, farther appears, in that it is said, <hi>All the Congregation murmured against Moses, and against Aaron</hi>: And in the 11 Verse, God says, <hi>How long will this people provoke me, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 29 Verse, <hi>How long shall I bear with this evil Congregation, which murmure against me: I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel which they murmure against me.</hi> So that now, all Government being committed unto Christ the second Person in the Trinity, they that oppose those Anointed Powers that act under him as <hi>Christi,</hi> are to be deemed opposers of him as <hi>the Christ,</hi> even as those former opposers of Gods Substitutes were called mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murmurers against Cod, while they acted under the Notion of <hi>Elohim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although every opposition of Christs chief Minister in Church-Authority, may (upon former reasons) be esteemed done in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Christ, yet shall we not find the term of Antichristianism set down til after our Saviours Ascension. For until he had revealed himself, so far as to institute and authorise Officers under him, and they again to hold and exercise their power as in direct acknowledgement of him, the opposition of these Officers could not be formally that crime of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism, which we may call the Gospel term for Rebellion: And is the resistance of Christs Kingly power, excented by himself or his chief immediate Officer.</p>
               <p>But because himself was little seen herein, as never partaking of the visible and material unction, the Scripture usually makes that sin to be the rebellion against the Christian Monarch, by any inferior person or order of men. For although the opposition in the primitive times made against this flourishing State or Kingdom of Christs Church (set down in the Prophesie of the <hi>Psalms</hi>) is to be interpreted against Christ, (where it is demanded, <hi>Why do the Heathen rvge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 2 4.</note>

And therefore they do but shew us, that first conspiracy of men of all sorts, which should be the forerunner of those more notorious Antichristian plots, which should afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from such as professed his service; alter such time as he hath been by God <hi>set on his holy hill of Sion,</hi> or the Church) and that many of these Kings had made their acknowledgements unto God and him;<note place="margin">Verse 12:</note> According to the Expression (there used) <hi>of kissing the Sonne.</hi>

                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:55976:194"/>Whereupon, divers of the Penmen of the New Testament, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the sundry oppositions of this deputed power, do call the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so doing Antichrist; a word proper for such as oppose persons anointed. Which as in the first place is due to <hi>the Anointed, the Christ of God,</hi>

               <p>And thus much we shall find plainly discovered unto us in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the talents; where Christs trust of his Kingdom and Power here committed to Deputies (during his absence to possess another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) is set down upon the occasion of the prejudice of such as thought, because of his going to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
                  <hi>saying, we will not have this man raign over us.</hi> Where we may see Antichrianism stated and defined; that is, when such as are members of Christs Church, or his Citizens, do so far express their hatred unto him, as to deny his deputed Christs to Raign, or have power over them. And therefore, after he hath taken the accompt of his Deputies trusted talents, he then comes to censure these Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Vice-gerents, just as if they had been so to himself, saying, <hi>But these mine enemies which would not that I should raign over them, bring them hither, and slay them before me.</hi> And that this sentence was directly intended to such as refuse this his power in his Deputies,<note place="margin">Verse 27:</note> and not of his Deputies disobedience to him, appears, in that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> setting down the like Parable of trusted <hi>talents</hi> (but without mention of the particular fact of the Citizen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that now, who <hi>is a lyar, but he that denyeth that Jesus is the Christ? he is Antichrist that denieth the father and the Son.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John. 2.22.</note> It is not said he that denieth the Holy Ghost; or he that denyeth Jesus, that is the belief of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viourship; for this being wrought inwardly by the work of the Holy Ghost, it maketh its denial or refusal more properly the sin against the Holy Ghost, casting Christ forth from within us as an unholy thing, but, offending against Christs regency or power over us outwardly, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends also against Charity; and so by destroying Monarchy or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hinders our wel fares here, as infidelity doth our welfares here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>And that this mysterie of Antichristianism is <hi>the denial of the Father and the Son,</hi> and that in regard of power to be exercised by persons here below, and from them sent and empowered, may be notably ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from these very words of Mission and Delegation, which Christ always used at the empowering of any from him, using stil these speeches or the like;<note place="margin">Luke 10.16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me, and he that despiseth me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:55976:194"/>
him that sent me.</hi> In which, there being always mention of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of power from the Father and the Son, and never from the Holy Ghost, it comes to pass that Antichristianism is plainly opposition in the execution of such power as is from God the Father, and Christ delegated. In which delegation, because Christ is to them the immediate Donor, it therefore takes the name of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism</p>
               <p>For these being <hi>anointed and established by God in Christ,</hi> although they are not to personate Christ <hi>in having dominion over ther faith</hi> (as being the object thereof) yet are they to personate Christ <hi>in claiming their obedience in all things</hi>; and so <hi>forgive also, as in the person of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.21: Verse 24. Chap. 2.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>lest Satan should have advantage over them</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> as seeming to be done out of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal power in themselves, and not as acted in Christs Name and Authority.</p>
               <p>So that now, the means of accomplishment of our welfare here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Christ reckoned as his service (under the notions of Love and Charity) and our obedience to him therein, making us participants with him of what he meritoriously did in obedience to God, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Moral Law for us, it follows, that as we deny the Holy Ghost in denial of Jesuship, so also God the Father in denial of his Christ-ship. For all things being ours through Christ; and as through him that was both God and man, all mankind came to be capable of the benefits and favor of the Godhead; so single men, being members of particular Churches, through obedience to particular Christs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, come to be participant of Christ also; and of those benefits promised to the whole Church his body under the condition of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Again, as by faith we lay immediate hold on him the second <hi>Adam,</hi> for forgiveness of original sin, so by obedience to him and his Church, we attain the benefit of his obedience, and remission of actual sins. In the first way, by our particular offerings to him of inward faith and love, we are all of us (through Christ, made Kings and Priests to God on our own behalfs; in the second way, we (as members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches) must have for what we do, warrant and direction on from other Kings and Priests, having therein Authority from him.</p>
               <p>Nor are Kings Supreme Deputies as <hi>Christi</hi> only; that is, because their oyl and unction is ever in Scripture distinguished from what is ordinary, but they are also his most immediate and eminent Deputies, for execution and accomplishment of his Jesu-ship: (I mean so much of it as concerns the Churches temporal safety) which was part of that work which (as King) Christ was to do; as appears by that his speech, <hi>The son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 99.56.</note> But because it could not be personally compleated, by (that <hi>the son of man</hi>) himself, it must be presumed entrusted to those; who to that purpose, are so often in Scripture eminently adorned with this title of <hi>Saviour.</hi>

               <p>But to know these things the better, and the persons defined, we will more particularly take notice of two places, set down amongst many in the New Testament to this purpose.

               <p>
                  <hi>He opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or is worshipped</hi>; that is, sets himself above Kings and Monarchs; so <hi>that he, as God, sitteth in the Temple of God,</hi>

                  <hi>shewing himself that he is God</hi>; that is, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being God of the Temple, or whole Church, he hath so far insinuated, under colour of Gods own right here, that he should reign over orher Gods as a very God indeed: The Preposition <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And, that the person here set down under the notion of <hi>God,</hi> should intend Christian Monarchy (as the only anointed person under Christ) may be presumed, for that the appellation of <hi>God</hi> is only properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>the Ruler of the people</hi> in the singular number; denoting there can be but one God in each Church ruling at once. And whensoever we shall find this notion of <hi>God</hi> applyed to any other, as to the <hi>High Priest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 23.5.</note> it is because they had part of this unction of power, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore noted. And in regard thereof, we may see reason why the notion of <hi>Gods,</hi> should be then put in the plural number, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of the Ruler; that is, because the first standing power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature and Government, was put in the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> whose plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in jurisdiction and power over the people made the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And therefore that Precept of <hi>Moses, Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22.28.</note> is to be applied and interpreted as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the same persons by him designed for their judgement and Government;<note place="margin">Deut. 17.9.

               <p>In this sense, we may also conceive <hi>Moses</hi> giving the name of Gods to

present ordinary Judges: even because their respect might not be more called into question then the others. By that means, <hi>putting upon the more uncomely parts the more abundant honor:</hi> and not preposterously preferring ordinary Judges, (as such) before him that was single in Authority, and the supreme <hi>Ruler of the people.</hi> So that <hi>Moses</hi> (having for honor-sake), given this appellation of <hi>Gods</hi> to those that were at that time indeed so, (because they had their power immediately from him, and had none but him above them), he could not without tautology, have after put the name of <hi>God</hi> in the place of Ruler: And he might besides, by placing this <hi>Ruler</hi> (or King) last, have the like respect towards his singular honor above them, as <hi>David</hi> gave to God, when he stiled him <hi>a great King above all Gods.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Upon all which considerations, we may finde reason why St. <hi>Paul</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted) should now under the Gospel, apply that former admonition of <hi>Moses</hi> unto the <hi>Ruler</hi> of the people onely: as knowing, that there is but one now in each place that is to have this appellation.

But as the Emperors power should decrease, <hi>then shall that wicked one be revealed:</hi> that is, shall appear rising up in glory in his place: and shall put all the Arguments of the <hi>many Antichrists</hi> into method, adding unto them more of his own.</p>
               <p>In which course he shall prevail and continue,<note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> until <hi>he shall be consumed by the spirit of the Lords mouth, and destroyed by the brightness of his coming.</hi> That is, after his revelation and full height, he shall consume and waste by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Arguments drawn from Scripture, and other illuminations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the spirit of truth, which was promised from the Lords own mouth, to be sent for a comfort and guide to his Deputies in the Church; and shall at last be destroyed by that eminence of Majesty and power, which shall be manifest when the great King himself (at his second coming) <hi>shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels (in flaming fire),</hi>

                  <hi>taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know not God: and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> That is, when such Christians as will not obey Christs power revealed in the Gospel, shall be equally punished with <hi>such as know not God</hi> at all.

               <p>Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> next description whereby we are to note him, is, <hi>that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working,</hi>

               <p>This thing is also further evidenced, by their prevailing in <hi>their deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of unrighteousness in those that perish.</hi> Because that in <hi>this mystery of iniquity, unrighteousness</hi> prevailed by its deceivableness: that is, not as unrighteousness, but as having put on <hi>a form of godliness,</hi> he deceived those that perish under pretence of zeal.<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> And that, <hi>because they received not the love of the truth:</hi> that is, received not the truth in love, but wresting it through their temptations to Pride, Ambition, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they made it the instrument (in this Antichristian hierarchy), to their own and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions; through breach of Publike Charity, and through placing their Christian obedience on a pretended, and not on the true Deputy of Christ.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Vers. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and belief of the truth and his Gospel,</hi> they had been so establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a way of salvation, as to be freed thereof: exhorting them to <hi>stand

fast in the Traditions they had been taught, whether by word or Epistle.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And that we may know the purport of these Traditions, (here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and that it may appear that matter of manners and external beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior were but traditionally delivered upon occasion, and not to be of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal precept to all Churches as positively divine, he tells us their sum in the sixth verse of the next Chapter. <hi>Now we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that you withdraw your selves from every brother that walketh disorderly; and not after the tradition which he received af us.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 3.6.</note> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that as <hi>God had called them by his Gospel,</hi> (or by means of his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and begetting them as a Father) <hi>unto sanctification of spirit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth</hi>; so was it necessary that obedience and observance of his Traditions, should be used as a means to continue, and manifest this sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and truth in them: and so make them of the number of those that <hi>obey,</hi> as well as <hi>believe the Gospel.</hi> For as we are to conceive, that this phrase, <hi>our Gospel,</hi> was not to propose to them <hi>another Gospel</hi> then that of Christ,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.7.</note> so are we not to conceive it to be by chance or idely done: but to teach them, that since they had believed it as from him delivered, so should they obey it as his, and not as any other mans. And by setting forth himself, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel also, under the term of <hi>our</hi> (in the plural number), we may further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that the intimation of his just Authority was intended, by the usage of that proper expression of persons in supreme power. Whereby also we may learn, that guidance of manners, as well as Doctrine, was by Christ at that time committed unto the hands of the Apostles: which makes him here (as elsewhere) command in his name.</p>
               <p>But, more especially to our present purpose, we may learn by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> setting down the Gospel of Christ in this place as his, and by making their obedience and belief thereof as the cause of their avoidance of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,<note place="margin">Verse 31, 14.</note> that it plainly denotes that this sin is Christian rebellion or disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as before noted. For indeed, the Gospel, as a Gospel, is the object of Faith and salvation, by the offer and proposal of one who, having taken our sins and infirmities upon him, hath already performed the work of obedience for us: and is not, like the Law, binding to any thing of burthen or hardship as directly in it self, but as in the hand of those that had and have the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation thereof, and shall be therewith entrusted: that thereby, as in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our belief and thankfulness for so great mercy, we might be ready and fitted to obey as Christ and King here, him whom we profess and hope to finde as a Jesus and Savior hereafter.</p>
               <p>These and other signes, have been heretofore brought by many to evince the Pope to be <hi>the Antichrist:</hi> for indeed, in him and in his See, have all the other Antichrists hitherto centred and confined their opinions: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but petty ones to him. But most of these interpreters, having the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his erroneous Tenents in Religion onely in their eye, did bring in these civil usurpations but as proofs to that, by the by: as though, because the Pope offered to joyn Merits, Free-will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the work of salvation, he had therefore been Antichrist, and not rather an Anti-Jesus then an Anti-Christus. Not well marking, how these and other his Doctrines of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, Infallibility, Indulgencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not for themselves; but, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary train, did wait upon the advancement of him in his Antichristian humor of setting himself <hi>above all that is called God.</hi> Being useful (as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55976:197"/>
hath told us) for recovering money and strength, towards the seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and possessing himself of that his usurped power, as well as this his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should, and did prevail to the same end also; namely overthrow of Kings: and that under all those fair pretences of Reformation, Liberty, Law, Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Aristocracies, Democracies, and the lesser Antichrists had made in their rebellious contrivances.</p>
               <p>True it is, that corruption of manners, or the <hi>deceivableness of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> as well as Heresie of Doctrine, or <hi>belief of a lye,</hi> do follow (as a necessary train), this sin of insubjection to Christs Authority: and so make <hi>the Antichrist</hi> deservedly to be stiled <hi>the man of sin, and son of perdition.</hi> And this may be the reason, why the name of Antichrist is not by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> given to this great one: even because he should appear in the latter age of the world; wherein the consequences of heresie and corruption of manners, should be more notorious in him then was (their first main cause) the sin of stubbornness and rebellion: which by that time, should (through possession and blinde devotion), have gained to it self a shew of right. It faring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise (in this respect), with the application of this Gospel term of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, then it formerly did (under the Law) with that other proper name of Rebels, <hi>viz. sons of Belial.</hi> For as that, (in after times) came, (from the experience of that concomitant degree of lewdness &amp; vileness which always attended disobedient and ungovernable persons), to be applyed to persons notoriously wicked, as well as to such as were formally Rebels; even so, in this latter age, it is no wonder if the notion of Antichristianism be otherwise used also, then in the strict sense of insubjection. Like as the vertue and grace of obedience, (upon a contrary reason) is in usual speech made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of all, or any other commendation; unto that person unto whom it is given.</p>
               <p>And that he was called Antichrist in opposition to Unction and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government, may undeniably appear by that which hindred him from taking upon him publikely this power: namely, the Roman Emperor. For had his Antichristianism consisted in such Doctrines as had concerned Christian Faith onely, why should the Emperor be at that time a let therein; liking them one no better then another? But because the Apostle saw such Doctrines set on foot, as would overthrow Christs Regency in his Deputies afterwards, he calls it <hi>the mystery of iniquity already working</hi>; and concludes the onely let to keep it from being actually in the person of <hi>the</hi> Antichrist, was the Emperors present possession. And this was the reason why the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Session of the Pope in this Authority, is called <hi>Antichrist revealed:</hi> even as the broaching of the Doctrines tending thereto, was called the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of iniquity,</hi> or Antichrist <hi>working</hi>: aim, and possession of jurisdiction, making him properly Antichrist in both; and not Heresie in Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Having thus far shewed, in brief, how Antichristianism consists in opposing Christ, that is, in regard of his Regency; it must farther follow, that since this opposition cannot be to him now in Heaven, otherwise then as done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as are anointed under him here, (which are to act in his name and Authority), that thereupon Antichristianism is to oppose Christian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs: who onely now are anointed as proper immediate Officers under him: and who are holding their Office in the Christian Church, according to prophetick designation of what should befal her in her flourishing condition: namely,<note place="margin">Psalm. 45.16.</note> to <hi>have sons whom she should set as Princes in all Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:55976:197"/>And this farther appears, according to that model of the Christian Church in the eight last Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> where the Priesthood also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing designed, the chief of them is put under such a Name and Notion as may minde them continually of their duty of loyalty and submission to Princes: since from a King, their predecessor <hi>Zadock</hi> was first preferred to that Office as heretofore noted. And to take off Presbyterial parity from this Antichristian hope of Regency; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the 34 Chapter, (reproving and setting forth the mischiefs arising from their Anarchical rule), prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies <hi>that God will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them; even his servant David:</hi> Which as it was to be understood first in Christ himself,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.23, 24.</note> as coming of <hi>Davids</hi> natural loyns, so to be executed by his adopted sons of oyle in the several Territories of his Church.</p>
               <p>We shall finde this future condition of Monarchy prophesied plainly by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> to accompany also the flourishing estate of the Church: saying, <hi>their Nobles shall be of themselves, and their Governor should proceed from the midst of them:</hi> that is, shall be my servants also. <hi>And I will cause him to draw neer, and he shall approach unto me:</hi> that is, as I have the hearts of Kings in my power, so will I guide his: <hi>for who is this</hi> (or who else is this) <hi>that engaged his heart to approach unto me saith the Lord.</hi> Where,<note place="margin">Jer. 30.21.</note> noting <hi>Governor, He,</hi> and <hi>His,</hi> to be set down in the singular number, we may infer <hi>Monarchy</hi> to be meant. And then follows Gods more remarkable owning his Church, when his <hi>Kingdom</hi> shall be thus <hi>come</hi> amongst us: <hi>and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The like we may observe done largely by <hi>Isaiah</hi> in the 49 Chapter; both to express the increase, and flourishing estate of Christs Church, to arise and recover by degrees from its former distress, and also that this should come to pass in the time of Christs adopted sons, and through that glorious addition of kingship following the Gentile Princes entertainment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and acknowledgement of their fealties unto him. <hi>The Children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, the place is too straight for me, give place to me that I may dwell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 49.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Then shalt thou say in thine heart, who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my Children and am desolate: a captive, and removing to and fro: and who hath brought up these?

               <p>The like we shall finde in the 60 Chapter: <hi>the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightness of thy rising.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">Isa. 60.3.</note> 
                  <hi>the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls: and Kings shall minister unto thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> 
                  <hi>For in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall thy gates be open continually, they shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring unto thee the wealth of the Gentiles: and that their Kings may be brought, &amp;c.</hi> Which, and many more places,<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> (shewing the glory and increase of the Church under Kingship), must be understood to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in Christs adopted sons; since in his own person he had (while he
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55976:198"/>
lived),<note place="margin">Isa. 53.2.</note> 
                  <hi>neither form nor comliness:</hi> and (as to these things), was <hi>despised and rejected of men: a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and we esteemed him not:</hi> performing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in himself (as after followeth) the work of Jesuship, and so healing his Church <hi>by his wounds and stripes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, as we are to interpret those many promises of prosperity, (made to the Church in general under a Jewish figure), to be accomplished in the prosperity of the Christian Church; so must also many of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promises, made of the Churches Kings in the name of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> be interpreted of Christian Kings: Else we shall not know how to make good <hi>those sure mercies of David:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 33.21. &amp;c. Psal. 89.27, &amp;c.</note> those many Prophesies that his kingdom should be established <hi>for ever in his seed: and that his mercy should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam.7.15.</note> 
                  <hi>as it did from Saul, who was taken away from before him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same again repeated 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.13. promising, that as his Temple should be built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> (who was a Type of Christian Kings as <hi>David</hi> was of Christ) so God says,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 17.13</note> 
                  <hi>I will not take my mercy from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: but I will settle him in mine house, and in my kingdom for ever:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and his Throne shall be estaalished for ever.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> himself did so understand it also: and therefore said, <hi>Now O Lord let the thing that thou hast spoken concernig thy servant, and concerning his house be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished for ever:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> 
                  <hi>and do as thou hast said.</hi> And so he proceeds with a reason for establishment of that Government: <hi>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever: saying the Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of thy servant be established before thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 24.</note> And in the next verse he intimates the manner how it should be: <hi>For thou O Lord God hast told thy servant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 25.</note> 
                  <hi>that thou wilt build him a house:</hi> that is, supply it by adopted Children: for so the word, <hi>wilt build,</hi> must import beyond <hi>Solomon</hi> already born.</p>
               <p>Therefore, understanding and interpreting, the conditonal promises made to <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> to extend and have been fulfilled in their own person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al loyns according to Nature, and these by default on their part to be cut off; and understanding again, that succession of perpetuity and the glorious Promises of the Church, to be made good in <hi>Solomons</hi> typified sons (the Christian Monarchs), these seeming contradictions may be easily reconciled; as having been both made good. And it is observable (by the way), that the expressions used verse the 14. shew that the kingdom of God here is the Kings, (as before shewed in the Petition <hi>Thy Kingdom come),</hi> and that again the Kingship of Kings is Gods: for so the words run, <hi>I will settle him in mine house, and my Kingdom for ever: and his Throne shall be established for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> to the end <hi>that Gods will may be done in earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since (for the far greater part of the time past,) we cannot find as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said these Promises fulfilled to the natural or direct seed of <hi>Solomon</hi> or <hi>David</hi> in the kingdoms <hi>of Israel or Judah,</hi> we cannot without great partiality and prejudice but conceive that they must (typically) be accomplished in Christian Kings: in like manner, as we are to understand, that the many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Jewish Church and Temples happiness and perpetuity, are to be made good in the Christian Church: answerable to that prophetical description of the Christian Church (under the Jewish fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) made by <hi>David</hi> himself:<note place="margin">Psal. 122.5.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. For there are set Thrones of Iudgement,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55976:198"/>
the Thrones of the house of David.</hi> Where the names of Thrones, being twice set in the plural number, must signifie succession of Kingship: which coming to Christ as naturally <hi>Davids</hi> son, and to Kings as Christs adopted sons, it follows that the opposers of them, do oppose Christ; and so are Antichrists.</p>
               <p>And without the like interpretation, and taking in the adopted Christian Kings, (as with Christ typified in <hi>Solomon Psal.</hi> 72), it will be hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, how many of those Prophesies of prosperity and outward greatness here and in other Prophesies given to Christ, can personally be made good in him: considering that mean condition Christ himself lived in amongst us; where he was so far from expressing, or exercising any thing like the <hi>Throne,</hi> or <hi>judgement of a King or Kings son,</hi> that he <hi>had not whereon to lay his head.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 8.20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But there can be no more better Commentator of the meaning of these Promises then <hi>David</hi> himself: who in his last <hi>words</hi> cleerly explains to us,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23.1.</note> that they were prophetick to those <hi>Thrones</hi> which should be established un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Types of him and <hi>Solomon</hi> by Christ and Christian Kings in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church; and not by him, and his direct natural seed in the Jewish Church. For there we shall finde him confessing, that he was but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of these things that should after come to pass; and not the present object, otherwise then in type: <hi>the spirit of the Lord spake by me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and his word was in my tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards we shall finde, that that perfection of the Ruler he speaks of, belongs to his typified son Christ, and not to himself: because it speaks of a perfection, and an extent of Dominion, which he in his own person was not capable of. <hi>He that ruleth over men,</hi> or is appointed Ruler over mankinde, (which <hi>David</hi> nor his natural race as Kings of the Jews could not claim to be), <hi>must be just: ruling in the fear of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
                  <hi>And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun ariseth: even a morning without clouds: as the tender grass springing out of the earth, by cleer shining after rain.</hi> All which are expressions of excellence which <hi>David</hi> could not personally essume:<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> and therefore he adds, <hi>although my house be not so with God, yet he hath made me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure: for this is all my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatin, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> although neither I, nor my present more natural house do thus grow; yet it is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that it shall be accompplished in my typifyed son Christ, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings after him. In him, from whom all Crowns are derived, and in whom all Justice is originally inherent, is this Prophesie in the first place to be fulfilled. And then, by vertue of that Unction which those other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti</hi> shall have from him all the world over, they also shall be enabled, in their several jurisdictions, to <hi>rule over men in the fear of God:</hi> and, by vertue of their derived power, <hi>be as the light of the morning, even as a morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clouds when the Sun ariseth:</hi> or after this Son of Righteousness is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risen: and be <hi>as the tender grass springing out of the earth, by cleer shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after rain:</hi> that is, that cleer shining light of Justice from him impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, shall in them spring up like tender grass, in their earthly administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And then he foretels the state of Antichristianism to follow, and that under the Jewish notion of insubjection and Rebellion, <hi>viz. Sons of Belial,</hi> (or men without yoak): <hi>but the sons of Belial, shall be all of them as thorns
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55976:199"/>

                  <hi>and the staffe of a spear.</hi> That is, as he that will meddle with cutting down of Thorns, must have his person defended against their prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were with Iron, and also must have a staffe or fork to manage them with, and not his bare hands, so, prudence must direct Christian Princes, to have in readiness <hi>Davids Chelethites</hi> and <hi>Pelethites,</hi> and the assistance of their Militia, (typified under <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>a spear),</hi> and <hi>then they shall be utterly burnt with fire in the same place:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> that is, these Thornes of rebellion shall be consumed.</p>
               <p>That Christ and the Christian Kings were in these Promises meant, appears yet more fully by that Promise which God makes of the prosperity of his people at the same time; which could not have likelihood of accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Jews. <hi>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will place them that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more: neither shall the Children of wickedness afflict them any more,</hi>

                  <hi>as before time.</hi> Which Promise was not made good to the Israelites, whom the Assyrian and other Nations did so many times afflict, and whom the Romans did utterly subdue and remove; but was made good after the time of Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: in that this Christian Church was ever more glorious and strong, then to be oppressed by her enemies. And so <hi>David</hi> himself farther instructs us: acknowledging these things spoken <hi>of his house for a great while to come.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In this fore-recited Prophesie, and those whereto it alludes, it is farther observable; that, as it, is the first that speaks particularly and largely of the perpetuity and glory of the Church, so doth it also of the kingship that should be therein: coupling them so together, as to make it apparent, that, as the glory of a Church and Nation doth arise by Gods vouchsafeing to own them, and by having a place amongst them, so this owning them, and this place, is still accompanyed with the Promise of kingship: nay made subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereunto. For so we finde, that while <hi>Moses</hi> is directing the people to go with their hard controversies (or appeals,) from the ordinary Judges unto <hi>the Iudge that shall be in those days,</hi> (meaning that future Government of kings,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.9.</note> which immediately follows in the same chapter) <hi>he appoints them to go up unto the place which the Lord their God should choose.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 1.</note> Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, that when God would have his Church most eminent, by having a chief and eminent place amongst them; he will also have one most eminent Officer to be his servant in establishment thereof; who may also more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously represent him therein.</p>
               <p>All which, as it appears in the examples of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> so doth the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> cleerly manifest it: shewing, <hi>That God chose no City out of all Israel to build an house for his name, before he chose David to be over his people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 8.16.</note> And therefore, because the good intention of <hi>Davids</hi> heart to build Gods house could not be performed by him, God promiseth <hi>to raise up to him a son, that should come forth of his loyns, and that he should build this house to his Name.</hi> Which son of his we cannot think otherwise of, then <hi>as having his kingdom</hi> purposely made glorious and <hi>established,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 19. 1 Chron. 17.11.</note> for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Gods glory by this work. And therefore, <hi>it was not a work
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:55976:199"/>
which God required to be done by any of the former Iudges:</hi> but the height and glory belonging to each Church and Nation,<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> is to be accomplished un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the most glorious instrument.</p>
               <p>And, by having this future regard to things, we may finde those Gospel promises of restitution or reward, (which could not in kinde be made good to the Primitive persecuted Church and the oppressed Christians therein), to be made good to the Catholike Church, and the generality of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under the protection of Christian Kings since. Namely, that, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of those former losses, the Church hath since been rewarded, (both in respect of increase of possession, and degree of continuance), <hi>with an hundred fold, now in this time of houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon, we may make the whole issue and interpretation of this forementioned. Promise to be, that Christ (typified in <hi>David</hi>), is represented as desirous out of his zeal to Gods house, to be as active and forward as he can for advancing of Gods own glory; and also for the promotion of his Churches happiness; represented under the figure of the Jewish Temple. But because he (in regard of those Victories he was to make over sin and death) was in his own person disabled to perform it, (even as <hi>David was for the wars which were about him on every side,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Lord had put them under the soles of his feet</hi>), therefore is he, by God the Father Promised (in the person of <hi>David</hi>),<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.12.</note> 
                  <hi>When thy days shall be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,</hi> (that is, when thou shalt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished the days of thy flesh, and by being seated at the right hand of thy Father, shalt have thy <hi>foes made thy footstool</hi>), then shall God make good <hi>the word he had spoken concerning him and his house,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 25.</note> 
                  <hi>to establish it for ever.</hi> That is, in accomplishing the glory of the Church under his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted sons, (the Christian Emperors and Monarchs); as the glory of the Jewish Church and Temple, was setled under <hi>Solomon,</hi> and not under <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words <hi>for ever,</hi> we are also to understand Christian kingship to be promised to last till the worlds end, notwithstanding all opposition: as we may finde them typified under <hi>Solomon the Kings son,</hi> in the seventy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Psalm: where the flourishing estate and increase of the Church, is foretold to continue to the glory of Christs name, by reason of these that held their Crowns of him. <hi>His Name shall endure for ever: his Name shall be continued as long as the Sun:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 72.17:</note> 
                  <hi>and men shall be blessed in him: all Nations shall call him blessed.</hi> That is, each Christian Monarch (from him anointed), shall be as a Son to continue his Fathers Name for ever: meaning so long as the Sun and Moon shall endure. For if this Psalm had intended, the setting forth of the continuance of Christs own Name, as the second person in the Trinity, and not in relation to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ or King, (to be accomplished by Christian Kingship,<note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> in the submission of the <hi>Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles, that shall bring him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents),</hi> then this limitation of earthly time had not been so proper, as now, if it had not foretold of something, wherein (more remarkably) <hi>the whole earth should be filled with his glory:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Verse 19. Verse 3.</note> by the glorious appearance of these his Deputies, who <hi>shall</hi> (on <hi>their several Mountains and little hills</hi> in his stead) <hi>be judging the poor of the people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> 
                  <hi>save the Children of the

needy, and break in pieces the Oppressor:</hi> whereby, the <hi>rod of his power out of Sion</hi> being generally manifest, <hi>men shall fear him so long as the Sun and Moon endure:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> Whereas in respect of his own personal Dominion over his holy Church, it shall be truely for ever: and longer then the Sun and Moon shall endure.</p>
               <p>And again, those acts of protection here set down, are the proper Offices of Kings or Gods on earth: as appears by the like duties, appointed for them to do in the 82 Psalm: <hi>defend the poor and fatherless, do justice to the afflicted and needy, deliver the poor and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</hi> All (in effect) declaring, that God being unto them <hi>a spirit of judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 82.3, 4. Isa. 28.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and putting a divine sentence in the lips of the Christian Kings</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> did prophesie), they should now by their due and diligent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Offices, bring all these things to pass: and so <hi>make righteousness and peace to kiss each other.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 85.10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore now the glory and prosperity of the Church, (Gods house and kingdom,) being thus promised under the blessing of kingship, we are to esteem them Antichrists or sons of <hi>Belial</hi> (most especially), that do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Kings. And by those words of <hi>David, the man that toucheth them must be fenced with iron, and the staffe of a spear</hi>; we may understand this opposition chiefly predicted to happen from within her self; when the Church shall have arisen to that strength to be thus fortified. That is, when Christs succeeding deputies (as he foretold to his Apostles), should have taking to themselves both Purses and Swords: and so (under Kingship) make use of those Swords, and that Mammon: at which time, although forraign force should harm the Church no more, <hi>yet sons of Belial</hi> should.</p>
               <p>And into the onely hands of these deputies of Christ any may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them put, that shall mark this speech at both times particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly directed to his then Deputies, the Apostles; and shall farther observe, how these things could be accomplished by those persons that were not to fight; but (<hi>in their prosecutions), to flye from one City to anothher.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Who were, for attaining their Kingdom,</hi> that is, in attaining the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>to sell what they had and give Almes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12.33.</note> and so provide <hi>Treasure in Heaven that faileth not.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their case of more immediate divine protection, <hi>they could not serve God and Mammon</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 6.24, 25</note> 
                  <hi>but were to take no thought for their life,</hi> &amp;c. But now, because we have before spoken of that prediction of the swords, we shall here speak something more of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he said to his Desciples, There was a certain rich man which had a Steward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.1.</note> &amp;c. Which whole Parable, sets plainly out unto us, an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to happen to Gods Stewards in his houshould the Church, in regard of their trust: but whether that more immediate way of protection and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation given to the first Stewards, were the sooner taken from them for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal default (as the Parable may seem to denot), is not so much material. But we may observe this alteration plainly told to come to pass: <hi>and I say unto you make unto your selves friends of the Mammon of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> In which words the command of making this friendship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to them that had not been unjust Stewards: and that could
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55976:200"/>
neither fail themselves, of the continuance of Gods extraordinary trust and assistance, and had again a caveat against the trust to this Mammon, it must be understood as a direction and warrant, what those future Heads of the Church (whom they did personate) were to do, when these former mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous assistances <hi>stould fail.</hi> At which time, for the preservation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace and Good, it might be commendable and lawful for the latter more glorious deputies to support their dignities, by keeping back part of those revenues which were in the hands of their subjects; since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the whole was undeniably in that their great Lord and Master, whose steward he was. And as for the <hi>everlasting habitations,</hi> it is to be meant that the Church and her future Heads, should by Gods assistance relieve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this way unto the end of the world; as in the words <hi>For ever</hi> (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly spoken of) hath been noted.</p>
               <p>That Parable where God suffers himself to be put under the notion of an unjust Judge, will farther clear to us that the meaning was to foreshew that alteration; and not the whole withdrawing of trust and protection, as through abuse. For there it is noted, how God in his recess should seem not to hear, because not so apparently and presently, avenging and protecting as formerly; insomuch, as infidelity should generally infect the earth at Christs <hi>coming.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> And therefore this great friend of the Church having brought her to a state of self-subsistance, may be supposed to have shut to the door of miraculous assistance, which was formerly granted to those his persecuted children (now at rest with him) and will answer (many times) but to importunity only.<note place="margin">Luke 11.7, 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And to shew that this alteration was not substraction of trust of Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, it is after added, that the future Stewards fidelity in their trust of this Mammon, shall make them as acceptable as those that were formerly trusted with goods of more Divine Nature: <hi>He that is faithful in that which is least,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.13.</note> 
                  <hi>is faithful also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now, the glory and protection of Christs Church, being conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and made subsistent by that of its Head, and the glory of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of its Head, being now to be maintained also by these helps of swords and mammon; it follows, that as any do go about to bereave them of these trusts (by God and Christ put into their hands for the good of the Church) they do also thereby rise against the Church, and oppose Christ himself; and so are Antichrists.</p>
               <p>And if we look to experience for proof of these Prophesies, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more plain, then that as Christian kingship did increase in glory or number, so did the Church (Christs kingdom) increase also; and that again, as those <hi>Nursiing Fathers</hi> of the Church, were (through the insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oppositions of those <hi>many,</hi> or <hi>the Antichrist)</hi> eclipsed or lessened, so did heresies encrease, and the truth decay. Our own present senses being able to witness, that where this unity is lost, in the person that should repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Christ in the administration of power, there also is unity of Doctrine lost, and schism is also brought into the Church, as well as confusion into the State.</p>
               <p>The which needs the less to be wondered at in us, on whom the ends of the earth are come, if we consider what befel the Jews themselves, <hi>when there was no King in Israel.</hi> For although <hi>they had the oracles of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them</hi> (that is, they had not only more aboundance of divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,<note place="margin">Iudg. 17.6. Rom. 3.2.</note>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:55976:201"/>
but had God himself also (by his Priests and Prophets) always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give them express direction in all doubts, as from an oracle) yet how plainly doth the instance of <hi>Micahs Idols</hi> tells us, how subject each one is at such times to fraim to themselves (not only new forms of Worship, but) new gods of their own devising and setting up. Which by little and little, may come to be taken up and countenanced by their divided authority, as that was by the <hi>Danites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 18.30.</note> who had many equal to and under them, to be seduced by an evil example, but none above them, to keep them and all others conformable.</p>
               <p>All which (well considered) may instruct us of the reason of our Saviours dark answer (to such as had no minde to believe him therein, when he saith, <hi>My kingdom is not of this world.</hi> This was true first, in that this worlds kingdom (being not to be compared to his Kingdom in heaven with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) did not (therefore) deserve comparatively to be called <hi>his,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 18.36.</note> or had in that esteem, which they that made this question did think of. And then, we must understand this denial not to reach to his right of Kingship, or Super-eminence in the Church and Kingdoms of this world, but to the present execution thereof by himself; that (probably) being the very cause of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> demand. Unto whom, he having been (by some) reported as <hi>King of the Jews,</hi> and he beholding his present mean condition (so unlike that of a King) it made him scornfully ask, <hi>Art thou a King then?</hi> aswel as afterwards,<note place="margin">Verse 37.</note> scornfully write that he was so. And therefore our Saviours answer can import no farther abnegation of his Kingship amongst us, then to his own personal execution, meaning not to be by him immediately man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged here now, but by Deputies, whom he shall own and empower as <hi>King of Kings.</hi> Whereupon he also saith, <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son.</hi> And he is so far from renouncing his true being a King,<note place="margin">John 5.22.</note> and title hereto, that he says, <hi>I am a King</hi>; and that the <hi>testification of this truth</hi> (meaning his right in this Office) <hi>was the cause of his coming into the world</hi>; adding, <hi>that every one that is of the truth, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his voyce</hi>;<note place="margin">John 18.37.</note> that is, he believeth and obeyeth him accordingly.</p>
               <p>So that we are to interpret this denial of our Saviours Kingship, to be upon the same reason at this time done, as <hi>he had formerly charged his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had wrought all those <hi>miracles to evince so much,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.20. John 20.31. Matth 7.6.</note> yet would he have them carefull <hi>not to cast pearls before swine</hi>; that is, he would have them to be wary, in declaring his Divinity before unbelieving Jews, as himself was now reserved in publishing his Kingship before a scornful Roman; lest he being so straitly bound to another Master, might be but the more moved thereupon, to turn upon him with reproach.</p>
               <p>And therefore they that think that Christ did deny his true Kingly Right and Office, by that answer, <hi>Thou sayest it</hi>; may also, by the same rule say, that at the same time he did also deny himself to be <hi>Christ the Son of the living God</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 27.11.</note> because he also answereth to that question made by the high Priest,<note place="margin">Chap. 26.64. Verse 65.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou hast said it.</hi> But in this place (being newly spoken before the other) he may be conceived to have made answer enough for both; and so to adjoyn that time of fuller manifestation of his external regency and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was the occasion of their demand; namely, at that time when he,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Son of man shall be sitting at the right hand of the power of God.</hi> By which means his Deputies shall be endued with power of earthly dominion; and at that time also when he shall make his own personal appearance <hi>in the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55976:201"/>

               </p>
               <p>And therefore, although the Prophet <hi>Zachery</hi> (speaking of the restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, and their receipt of the Gospel) would have them seek peace after truth; that is, prefer that truth before all worldly blessings; yet, where this truth is once received, there peace is to be preferred to lesser truths; according to good <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> saying (now settled and confirmed in Gods Worship) <hi>Peace and truth shall be in my days.</hi> The like was promised to the Jews in their restauration, or rather to the Gentile Church,<note place="margin">Jer. 33.6.</note> 
                  <hi>abundance of peace and truth.</hi> And to doth holy <hi>David</hi> also, put mercy before it in his blessing to <hi>Ittai,</hi> saying, <hi>Mercy and truth be with thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 20.19.</note> And other graces and blessings are elsewhere more often put before,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15 20.</note> then after truth.</p>
               <p>Nay, of such advantage to the preservation of truth it self and of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy of life this grace is, that we shall find it put first, as the way to that, <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking diligently, lest any man should fail of the grace of God.</hi> That is, lest failing of the usual concommitant and conveyer of grace, ye should,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> through the lack thereof, lack grace also. <hi>Lest any bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby may be defiled.</hi> Where malice, hatred, &amp;c. (the attendants on war) being also set down under the name of bitterness,<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> we are warned to avoid them by keeping peace: for else, these malicious bitter prosecutions, will not only outwardly trouble, but inwardly defile us. And to let men see that, by this peace, the civil peace is meant, it is called <hi>Peace with all men</hi>: And again, to let them see it is wrought by patience chiefly, it follows the large commendations thereof set down in the twelfth to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However (to make answer to some that would have us endanger both peace and truth, by putting the name of truth always in, to prevent peace)
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55976:202"/>
we have made instances of <hi>Peace,</hi> being put before truth, and also before <hi>Holiness</hi>; yet the truth hereof is, they are so coincident and depending one upon another,<note place="margin">Psal. 85.10.</note> that <hi>Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other</hi>: They do become inseparable in themselves, and are so inseparably our duties to follow and practise, that we can never truly do the one, whilst we are not highly regardful of the other also; and must then be guilty, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (as some do) a very uncertain discovery of truth, to a certain loss of peace, and so (under colour of new <hi>Gospel-light</hi>) lose the benefits <hi>of the Gospel of Peace,</hi> and make it cease to be an Evangel or <hi>glad tidings.</hi>

               <p>And if men would consider what hath been hitherto spoken, concerning Gods owning the Seat and Throne of Christian judgement now settled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us; and so being (according to his promise) <hi>A spirit of judgement to him that sitteth in judgement,</hi> they might thereby perceive, how (amongst other things <hi>of salvation and glory</hi> which should come to the Church) that <hi>mercy and truth are met together,</hi>

                  <hi>and that righteousness and peace</hi> (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) <hi>have kissed each other</hi>: So that now, <hi>truth shall spring out of the earth</hi> (as from this earthly Throne of judgement) by means of <hi>righteousness that shall look down from heaven</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> according to the former Prophesie of that good King and Typical Head of the Church, made concerning the Churches fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state and prosperity; where it is set down that God hath now given his own <hi>Mishpat</hi> (or rule of right judgement) <hi>to the King</hi> (Christ himself) <hi>and his righteousness</hi> (or justice) <hi>to the Kings Son</hi> (Christs adopted sons of oyl) that so,<note place="margin">Psalm 72.1.</note> in these, there being these unions of <hi>Mercy and truth,</hi> and of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and peace,</hi> they may be enabled <hi>to judge Gods people with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and his poor with judgement.</hi> And having thus far spoken of <hi>the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi> according to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> description; we will again re-assume, and speak farther of the <hi>many Antichrists,</hi> mentioned by S. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the liveliest discovery of the one; and S. <hi>John</hi> only names the other, yet are they both of them (as Ring-leaders in the breach of Charity and publike Peace) the subject and occasion of many Precepts in holy Writ; the admonitions and examples that way given, taking up a very considerable part thereof; and being (for the greatest part) the object and aim of what our Saviour either did or suffered. For as this general good or charity, consisted in, or at least had dependance upon, the reciprocal duties of commanding and obeying, so are we from him furnished with Precepts and Examples of both kinds: To this end he rides to the Temple, and there, by exercising his authority over the Temple, (the type of the Christian Church) as a King, he leaves example and authority for the higher powers to demand subjection; <hi>not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake,</hi> and that <hi>either to Kings as Supreme,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.5. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>or to others as sent of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this end again (as being the harder duty) he not only sets down those many Precepts of Humility, but in his own Person becomes the patern (to all admiration) of Patience and Long-suffering: <hi>We being to learn of him to be lowly and meek,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth.11.12.</note> and in the testimony of our Discipleship unto him, <hi>to take up our cross and follow him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note> Which we must testifie chiefly, by our follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in our deeds of meekness and patience under subjection; patience and subjection differing from one another no otherwise then in generality. For I may do many things whilst a subject, which sort with mine own liking, and wherein no patience is required: but I can do nothing as patient, but where subjection must be presupposed. But ordinarily, patience doth define and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55976:202"/>
constitute true subjection, as vertue doth the vertuous. And as heretofore shewed, Gods glory is the end of Charity, and Charity the end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and subjection; so is subjection the end and aim of patience: for what need of patience in what I may avoid?</p>
               <p>That the formal cause of Antichristianism is insubjection to Christian Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, S. <hi>John</hi> makes plain, saying of the <hi>many Antichrists</hi> of his time, <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 2.19.</note> 
                  <hi>they would have continued with us: but they went out that they might be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that they were not all of us</hi>: that is, they were like such as receive seed amongst thorns, <hi>Go forth and are choaked with cares, and riches, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this life</hi>; and so minding division and separation, they do (for their sakes) overthrow Charity, and <hi>bring not fruit to perfection.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But nothing can, to my thinking, be a clearer evidence, that this sin of Antichristianism is the same with Rebellion of one or more Church members against their Christian Head, then to consider that we shall never find this phrase of Antichrist set down by any in the plain terms, but by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> the only person whom we shall plainly and expresly read of, to be in that sort opposed and disturbed. For although S. <hi>Paul</hi> by his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>others, puffed up against him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>(who had raigned as kings without him)</hi> might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (through the sense of <hi>the mysterie of iniquity already working</hi>) to speak so largely of <hi>the Antichrist</hi> to come,<note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> yet doth he not name him as doth the other: Who is recorded to be notoriously opposed by <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> in his jurisdiction and exercise of Church power: <hi>in not receiving or submitting unto him, and as loving that pre-eminence,</hi> which was only due to the other,<note place="margin">3 John 9.</note> their sole Head, <hi>And not being content therewith,</hi> that is, with his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, <hi>doth neither himself receive,</hi> or take into his care and protection, <hi>the brethren,</hi> such members as have no head: and so doth not make his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, lawful, as over a charge of his own, <hi>but forbiddeth them that would</hi>; that is, such as would come to S. <hi>Iohn, and casteth them out of the Church,</hi> or takes upon him to excommunicate,<note place="margin">3 John 10.</note> where he hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>This fault he warns his beloved <hi>Gaius</hi> against, under the general notion of <hi>evil</hi>: as though it might be called <hi>the evil,</hi> as being the occasion of so much evil. By which <hi>evil</hi> we may know he means Antichristianism, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that doth it, <hi>hath not seen God</hi>; that is, hath not God, or the fear of God, by not having or receiving us, and the doctrine of Christ, namely, that <hi>Christ is come or present in the flesh</hi>: And so <hi>denying the Son, he hath not the Father, because he and his Father are one:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 John 7. 1 John 2.3. John 10.30. 2 John 9.</note> 
                  <hi>for whosoever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is farther highly observable, towards the clearing Antichristianism to consist in the breach of Charity or Love (even by defeating the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of through disobedience) that these two fore-alledged Writers, that do most speak of this crime in direct terms, are themselves the most plentiful of any, in pressing and commending this duty of Charity or Love, The latter of them (Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved Disciple) making it the chief ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his whole Epistles; and is (by occasion hereof) found to be more often stating and discoursing of Antichrist then the other. Who yet, by reason of his more frequent conversation amongst the Gentiles, and those subjected unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, had occasion most to speak of, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that <hi>great man of sin</hi> (the Antichrist) that should hereafter (in the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55976:203"/>
Churches splendor) <hi>axalt himself above</hi> her glorious heads, <hi>called gods,</hi> even as S. <hi>John</hi> again (being more confined in his charge) had more occasion to speak of those lesser Antichrists, that (for the present) opposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his fellow Heads; whom, by reason of their smaller eminence in power, he writes unto under the notion <hi>of little children,</hi> as shall be shewed anon.</p>
               <p>But although we have not in S. <hi>Jude</hi> the name of Antichrist, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most his whole Epistle sets forth his description, and particularly by that mark of separation; wherein he doth also refer back to these and like former admonitions herein given from the Apostles: <hi>Remember</hi> (saith he) <hi>the words that were spoken before, by the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>

                  <hi>and were already entred.</hi> For how else should we conceive that defiling of the flesh, should be thus put properly to accompany <hi>dispising dominion, dignity, &amp;c.</hi> if it were not, that, through Christs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation in power in these our <hi>Masters of the flesh,</hi> our dispising them, came to be dispising of him. The which their Antichristian humour of dispising dominion, is also hinted to grow from the same root of insubjection we formerly noted in <hi>Isaiah</hi>: that is, as men would be there tasting the strong drink of Morality, and Divine Precept upon Precept, they should in the end be found of no farther assurance, then such <hi>as dream of meat, and behold he is empty, &amp;c.</hi> So these, that (through temptations of fleshly Pride and Lust, should despise Dominion, in hope to gain thereby power to act without control, should be found <hi>silthy dreamers</hi> also.</p>
               <p>And as lust and concupiscence is the usual parent of stubborness and rebellion; so is that a parent to these again; as <hi>heretofore noted in the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of iniquity.</hi> And to euince so much, and clear these places or S. <hi>Iude</hi> to intend the crime of <hi>Antichristianism,</hi> he, in his first description of these <hi>defilers of the flesh,</hi> makes it the same with S. <hi>Iohns</hi> other descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichrist, which we shall speak of anon; where they are noted to have been such people as did profess the same faith with others, and that were not manifested to be against Christ, but by deserting Apostolical Communion or Authority.<note place="margin">1 John 2.19.</note> So here, S. <hi>Iude,</hi> writing of <hi>the common salvation,</hi> and desiring Christians <hi>to conttnd for faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55976:203"/>
to the Saints</hi> (that is, the faith that is accompanied with patience,<note place="margin">Jude, ver. 3.</note> humility, &amp;c.) he tells them that <hi>certain men are crept in unawares</hi>; that is, they are such as professing the same common salvation (or the same Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus) do thereupon creep into our Communion unespied.<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Although their Antichristian departure or separation, be not here set down as by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet, because we cannot think them blamable for being of their Communion, it is to be necessarily supposed as the cause, for which, <hi>these ungodly men were of old ordained to this condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; and then the reason of their Antichristianism is plainly set down,<note place="margin">Jude. ver. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Turning the grace of God into lasciviousness</hi>; that is, using Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>as a cloak to maliciousness</hi>; they shall proceed to the fact of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stianism, <hi>denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">

               <p>And the two instances following, of the stubborn Jews, and revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels, do farther manifest that Christian insubjection, was the fault which S. <hi>Jude</hi> did here forewarn and reprove. And the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Angels being set out to us, <hi>as such as kept not their first estate, but left their habitation,</hi> he gives us a farther paralel of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Antichrists, <hi>they went out from us</hi>; that is, they left that first estate, or habitation they had under Christs Government, as Angels left that they had under God.</p>
               <p>Then S. <hi>Iude</hi> proceeds: <hi>But these</hi> (despisers of Authorities) <hi>speak evil of those things which they know not</hi>; that is, they know not, or at least will not consider, what is the end or good of humane society, and how the same is preserved by subjection and obedience; <hi>but what they know natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (as bruit beasts) in those things they corrupt themselves.

               <p>But more particularly he afterwards sets down the nature and practises of these men, that by their unsociable dispositions shall make <hi>perilous times in the last days,</hi> when he calls them <hi>lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 2, 3, 4.5.</note> Of all which this latter age hath had but too true and sad experience, to be the fruits of those that are still <hi>putting on a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and denying the power thereof</hi> in their lives and actions: even whilst they are truely found lovers of themselves and their own pleasures more then God, by their covetousness and pride, being lead to blaspheme and dishonor his name amongst men by their daily disobedience to their Christian Parents and superiors: and thereupon also to be unthankful and unholy in their lives. And while they stand partially affected to one another under the notion of more spiritual brotherhood they come to forget all natural ties and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55976:204"/>
to the breach of all Truce and Commerce; and also by being make-bates, incontinent, and fierce in their despightful usage and censure of such as be good and peaceable, they shew themselves to be Traitors, heady, high-minded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when they are set down for such <hi>as creep into houses</hi> (plainly shewing their love to Conventicles and private Meetings), and there <hi>leading captive silly women laden with sins,</hi> that is, such weak dispositions as are by them frighted with their Sermons of damnation, and also such as are <hi>led away with divers lusts,</hi> or listening after novelty of Doctrine, such as are <hi>ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6. Verse 7.</note> they are yet more lively set forth. For how should truth or obedience be known when these men are ready with their seditious incantations to oppose and resist <hi>the ground and piller</hi> thereof, <hi>the Church,</hi> and that publike Ministers of Christ that should uphold it, after the same manner <hi>that Iannes and Iambres</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>withstood Mosses.</hi> Being <hi>reprobate concerning the Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> or having but a false and reprobate Faith, for want of that true <hi>tryal of Faith, the work of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and work of love</hi>; and so <hi>being not able to endure persecutions,</hi> they shew themselves to be none of those <hi>that will live godly in Christ Jesus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 12.</note> but evil men and seducers, <hi>waxing worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</hi> But our comfort is in the confinement of their prevalence,<note place="margin">Verse 13. Verse 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>they shall proceed no farther,</hi> that is, no farther then with such silly Auditors; <hi>for their folly shall be manifest to all men as theirs also was:</hi> they shall be discovered in their plots against Christs Ministers, as those that formerly opposed Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now farther, to prove that Antichristianism is not onely denial of Christ as God, but also the denial of him or his power in the flesh, (that is, as before shewed denying of dignities and fleshly power under him), we will note a little of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> other description of him. <hi>Every spirit</hi> (saith he) <hi>that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: and the same is the spirit of Antichrist.</hi> And again he saith, <hi>Many deceivers are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, who confess not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4.3. 2 John 7.</note> He saith not, was come in the flesh, but in the present tense, <hi>is come in the flesh</hi>; and therefore cannot mean Jews or Infidels, or such as openly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed denyal to Christian Doctrine in matters of Faith; but such, as professing the Doctrine of Jesus Christ, did overthrow it by consequent: especially in matters of Charity; and to endanger the <hi>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of that full reward,</hi> which this Doctrine of Christ,<note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> or Doctrine of love (by practise of charitable submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our masters in the flesh) would bring. When at the last day men shall have sentence according to the charitable Offices one towards another: and, in justification of those that have been obedient to Christ in the flesh, <hi>he (as King) shall answer and say unto them, Verily say unto you, inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25 40.</note> 
                  <hi>ye have done it unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under which notion of King, he taking upon him to vindicate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of such as he had deputed in the exercise of his Kingship amongst us (until <hi>himself shall come in his glory with all the holy Angels, and shall sit upon the Throne of his glory</hi>) makes it farther manifest, that the very title of Kingship was to be the most usual and eminent stile of his Deputy. And therefore, under the expression <hi>of the least of these my brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 40.</note> (distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these his brethren from other his Christian brethren, (as heretofore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted),
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55976:205"/>
he makes the exercise and expression of our love or Charity, which should be performed to him or his body the Church, to take measure and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation according to extent of that respect and obedience which we have done to these. For they being made instrumental <hi>in the day of Christs</hi> earthly <hi>power,</hi> as well to make <hi>Sion</hi> or the Church <hi>the rod of Christs strength, whereby to rule in the midst of his enemies,</hi> as to settle his Worship <hi>in the beauties of holiness</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 110.2, 3.</note> it will therefore come to pass, that as to be against them is to be against him; so also it must be granted, that what we have done by their direction in matters of love and obedience, is as if we had done it by his.</p>
               <p>For if we cannot otherwise (litterally) conceive, that to do these things to the <hi>least</hi> Christian, or but to <hi>one,</hi> were in themselves such high services unto him, otherwise then as that <hi>one,</hi> and that <hi>least,</hi> were the Representatives of many, or all, even so, understanding those particulars of Charity or love (there set down), to stand for the whole duty of love, (the which these Deputies of Christ were to make useful to all in general and each one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, by being our directors, according to that Talent in power and trust, which their proportionable charge in each Church did require), we may then well conceive, how, as Christ is not to be wronged but by his Members, so then most, when the wrong is done against such, as being more neerly his, their wrong must be more neerly said to be his; and so reputed Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism.</p>
               <p>And although the ordinary rank of believers, be not in this place distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from his Deputies (under the notion of <hi>Citizens</hi>) as they are by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> (which might have regard to the Jewish Nation, who more generally were to refuse the Authority of his substitutes, which the Gentiles should be but partly guilty of, and partly not,) yet may we discern a distinction made by their separate sentence: beginning with his servants that had Talents of great trust first, before the general judgement of the rest. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve also, that in approving or condemning them, under the notions of sheep and goats, (the one a Creature full of inward love and innocence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal most tractable and obedient to their shepherd, whereas the other was contrary,) that as well the necessity of outward obedience, as inward love was intended.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ,</hi> (that is, obeyeth him not here as King, as well as hopeth in him as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>hath not God: but he that abideth in the Doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 John 9.</note> That is, he that acknowledgeth the power of the son, as to that end anointed from the Father, doth therewith acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Fathers power also: but he that denyeth him that <hi>is sent, denyeth also him that sent him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> even as denyal, or overthrow of Kingship, is (to our power) to overthrow the King of kings power also, who gave them these their Offices.</p>
               <p>And farther, to shew that Antichristianism here meant, is not opposition to Christian Doctrine as such, they are called <hi>deceivers,</hi> that is, such as did make profession that way, for how else could an open enemy deceive? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing yet more plainly to be such, by St. <hi>Iohns</hi> former description: <hi>they went out from us,</hi> &amp;c. meaning they had been of the same outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>And that Antichristianism is opposition to the precepts of love, and not
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:55976:205"/>
matters of Faith, appears also by St. <hi>Iohns</hi> former description: where the spirit of Antichrist being said <hi>not to be of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.3.</note> he afterwards makes Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism to consist in disobedience: <hi>he that is not of God heareth not us: hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> And then goes on with the description of who is of God: <hi>beloved let us love one another, for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God: he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love.</hi> Which last words,<note place="margin">Verse 7. Verse 8.</note> do knit up the mystical perfection of Charity: and shew how from that all things are united and take place. For from the love of God, his Creation and benificence to Creatures did proceed: and through the inward plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Charity and love in Creatures, providence towards them had its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also. And again, all Creatures, according to its measure, (in themselves received from God), came to be more or less participant or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of him: that is, God-like. And therefore, <hi>if God so loved us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> as not onely to estate us happy, but to restore us fallen, <hi>we ought also to love one another.</hi> For since <hi>no wan hath seen God at any time,</hi> (that is, cannot person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally requite him) <hi>if we love one another</hi> (that is, his next image in our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) <hi>God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfect in us: for he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 12. Verse 16.</note> And then follows our innocence thereupon: <hi>herein is our love made perfect,</hi> (that is, brought to its issue) <hi>that we may have boldness in the day of judgement: for there is no fear in love:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Verse 18.</note> that is, no fear of future torment; because of their Faith and assurance, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered through present obedience.</p>
               <p>And if we consider the persons unto whom more particularly this descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Antichrist is addressed, (as most concerning them) it will give us full light and confirmation herein. For the warning hereof is particularly given to the Apostles, (or heads of Churches) under the notion of <hi>little Children:</hi> a loving term, which this beloved Disciple useth to difference them; in imitation of <hi>his Master</hi> (as formerly noted,) <hi>saying, Children, it is the last time,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And that the persons comprised under this notion of <hi>little Children,</hi> were different from others, whom he therefore stiles <hi>my Children,</hi> and <hi>my Beloved</hi> &amp;c. because he hath begotten them in the Faith, appears,<note place="margin">3 John 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> in that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting particularly to <hi>Gaius,</hi> salutes him under these notions.</p>
               <p>And the matter comprehended under these different addresses, will (by its difference), shew the difference of persons thereby meant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we finde <hi>little Children</hi> spoken to before Fathers, it must shew some of higher rank: for if we should have thought him, to have proceeded with the instruction of the lower rank first, then, <hi>young men would</hi> have been spoken to next, and Fathers last of all. But by writing to those little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren first, twice over; and that under such descriptions and representations as were to them most proper, must shew that they were different persons from <hi>these Fathers and young men:</hi> and from those he calls <hi>my little Children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 21.7. Chap. 3.2. Chap. 4.17, 13,</note> 
                  <hi>Brethren, Beloved,</hi> and the like: all which are indifferently used when he is to express those duties which may generally concern all men.</p>
               <p>And because some of those admonitions and duties, may also concern all in a second degree, which are given to the heads of Churches under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of little Children,</hi> therefore do we not finde them set down in restrictive terms. And this, not onely in regard of that common engagement to mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al love and obedience, (they as others are concerned in), but also, in regard
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:55976:206"/>
care is always taken, not to make the difference too plain: whereby persons in Authority might be too proud, or the mystery of Antichristianism too much revealed. Which may be the reason why our Saviour (speaking of these things), would not give St. <hi>Peter</hi> a direct answer, when he asked, <hi>Lord speakest thou this Parable to us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12.41.</note> 
                  <hi>or even to all</hi>; but goes on with the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of their duties, <hi>as Stewards or Rulers over Gods houshold:</hi> not letting them know their own power (it is like) till after his Resurrection; that he <hi>spoke of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when he says, <hi>My little children I write unto you that ye sin not,</hi> and then tells them that <hi>if they do,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1. Verse 2.</note> 
                  <hi>they have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> we are to conceive them to be such as he had newly converted to the Faith, and so needed instruction to know that <hi>Christ was the propitiation of sins.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the others,<note place="margin">Verse 13. John 14.7. Chap. 16.25. Joh. 13.10. Chap. 15.3. 1 Joh. 2.12.</note> because they more fully <hi>had known the Father,</hi> (according to Christs former Promises), might be said (by vertue of that washing they had from him, and many exhortations made for loving one another and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commandments), to have <hi>their sins forgiven for his names sake:</hi> or to be more remarkably sanctified by the promised spirit of truth, and by Gods word to be left in their trust.</p>
               <p>By which means also, they come to have higher degree of illumination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mystery of Antichrist, according to the following words; <hi>but ye have received an Unction from the Holy One,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and know all things.</hi> For no doubt, (in the number of all those truths they were to be guided into,) they should have the revelation of this mystery more then other men: which was (it is like), some of those <hi>many things Christ had to say unto them,</hi> which were not fit for their knowledge,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.12.</note> till after Christs Ascension. At which time they might be supposed to expect revelation from the Holy Ghost, in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concerning Christs Glory; according to that Promise, <hi>He shall glorifie me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
                  <hi>for he shall recive of mine, and shall shew it unto you:</hi> which we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to import, something of eminence and power, by the following words, <hi>all things that the Father hath are mine, therfore said I, he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> Twice (we see) the word is used of <hi>shew it unto you:</hi> whereby we may conclude it was not the Unction of power onely, but of Revelation of something concerning the exercise of that Power and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And this may be farther evinced by the following words: where his departure is made an Argument of his greater manifestation unto them. <hi>Again a little while and ye shall me, because I go to the Father:</hi> that is, as at by my departure ye shall be sent by me,<note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> as I was sent by my Father, so shall ye also have farther knowledge concerning your Mission, and of those cross accidents which shall accompany it. In which respect, this spirit of truth shall be to them also a spirit of joy: when they shall be enabled to endure those indignities from the world which shall come unto them by reason that Christs name is more remarkably set on them, then on others.</p>
               <p>And therefore, since this anointing could not but teach them of these things, (in the next mention of <hi>little Children</hi>), these heads of Churches are spoken to by way of exhortation, to be notwithstanding abiding in him, that is, to be keeping themselves (like good Stewards) in the just execution of their charge, according to his commandment: <hi>that then when he shall appear, they may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming:</hi> as expecting his sentence of <hi>well done thou good and faithful servant,</hi>

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55976:206"/>
then shall they continue in the Son, and in the Father:</hi> That is, the Power and Unction from them received, shall be both their director and protector. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that former saying of our Savior to his Disciples, <hi>if ye keep my Commandments, ye shall abide in my love: even as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his love.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As for the next verse, it contains also an assurance to them of uprightness, or justice in the execution of their Offices, whilst they continued as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Children to him that was the Fountain of Justice or Righteousness.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.29.</note>

                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:55976:207"/>And although it be no wonder for worldly minded men to be inclined to Antichristianism, (for covetousness is commonly the root of this, as well as all other evil) yet it is to be presumed, that (through Christs assistance) <hi>those little Children have overcome them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4 4.</note> that have no higher a support, then that Prince of the world, to whom they do homage for these things: and so need not be wondred at for deserting obedience to Christ or his Deputies, through their service to Mammon.</p>
               <p>For we are to conceive, that as this Tempter at first tempted our Saviour himself,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.9. 1 John 4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>to fall down and worship him for these things,</hi> so are his members eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day enticed by these worldly ends, to deserting of Christ also: and to yield homage to them, rather then to his Deputies and Ministers. But that this despising of Christs Ministers, is deserting of God and Christ, and so is Antichristianism, appears most plainly by the next verse: <hi>We are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us: he that is not of God heareth not us; hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> That is, by disobedience to Christs Deputies, the spirit of <hi>lyers</hi> or Antichristians is to be known: for as every one that teacheth any Doctrine, without the leave of these heads (whom Christ hath particularly promised <hi>to be with to the end of the world</hi>) is a <hi>deceiver</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> so, if his Doctrine be against their representation of Christs <hi>in the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 John 7.</note> he is <hi>an Antichrist</hi> also.</p>
               <p>The last mention of little Children is to warn them against this idolatry of covetousness: saying, <hi>little children keep your selves from Idols.</hi> That is, since <hi>the lusts of the flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 5.21. Chap. 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>the lust of the eys, and the pride of life (being not of God)</hi> are to be most avoided by you that represent his Authority, so will Covetousness and Ambition work greater mischief, being sought after by you that are in high places, then it can do by others. And therefore, are they strictly and particularly charged by our Saviour against this Vice of Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, upon his giving them their first Mission: <hi>provide neither gold, nor sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>

                  <hi>nor brass in your purses</hi>; and the like.</p>
               <p>Answerable thereunto, was that admonition by S. <hi>Paul</hi> given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the head of the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church under him;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8.</note>

At that time espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when things expressing humility and poverty, did best become the mean condition of the Church, and her present little heads.

               <p>And that the <hi>not hearing of us</hi> (before mentioned) is the denyal of God and Christ, and is formally the crime of Antichristianism, will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by consideration of those many places, where Christ, delegating his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:55976:207"/>
and the seventy with power to personate him in the power of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> doth acount their refusal to be his: <hi>he that shall deny me before men,</hi> (that is, deny me by denying my Authority in you), <hi>him will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Which,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.33. Marke 8.38. Luke 12.9 &amp; Chap. 10.16.</note> and the like speeches implying, that himself (being now in Heaven), cannot otherwise have his Authority <hi>denyed in the flesh,</hi> then by denying obedience to his Deputies, it must consequently prove disobedience or denyal of them, to be denyal of him; and so Antichristianism. And the like must be understood of every other succeding <hi>little one</hi> in the Church or <hi>Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> namely, that <hi>whosoever shall receive one such little one in Christs name, receiveth him</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 18.5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>but whoso shall offend,</hi> &amp;c. shall have a punishment denoting the greatness of the sin of Antichristianism.</p>
               <p>But now (at last), to appeal from discourse to matter of fact, we may with great grief finde, both the description of <hi>the Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>many Antichrists,</hi> but too plainly made good in our days. How is this falling away from the life and power of godliness, accompanied with the sad consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of destroying Kings more now then ever? How doth <hi>the Antichrist</hi> prove himself more and more, as well <hi>a man of sin</hi> (by his Doctrines) <hi>as a son of perdition,</hi> by his many encouragements to,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.3.</note> and practises of rebellion and civil war: and in eclipsing and subjecting of Monarchy? By <hi>whose</hi> cleer revealing, we may think <hi>that the day of Christ is at hand.</hi> For now,<note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> more then ever, <hi>is Nation risen against Nation,</hi> &amp;c. and not onely so, but to make good <hi>that a mans enemies shall be them of his own house,</hi> how doth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of this son of perdition, prevail in setting up Civil wars in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
               <p>And I would to God, that many that have taken pains in discovery of this man of sin, had not been themselves partakers and guilty of the same sin of Antichristianism also. It is not enough to cleer themselves, by crying whore first: for let the Pope be the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> whilst he will, yet if they joyn with him in this Doctrine of Antichrist, it is not their leaning their heads ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way can excuse the mischief and effects thereof: whilst (like <hi>Samsons</hi> Foxes) they joyn with him in their tayls, by throwing abroad those fire-brands of Civil war, wherewith all Christendom is inflamed. By which, they prove to be the <hi>many Antichrists</hi> (heretofore spoken of); and to be real friends to that <hi>son of perdition</hi> also. So that as <hi>we have heard, that in the last time Antichrist shall come; even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know it to be the last time.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John. 2.18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For as <hi>he that did let</hi> (to wit the Roman Emperor) was by little and little <hi>taken out of the way</hi> (or his seat), <hi>and as the man of sin</hi> therein, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did set up and reveal himself; how many Antichrists did (under Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies and Democracies) set up for themselves also in sundry parts thereof? How have they since encreased, in encroaching not onely thereon, but on parcels of the Dominions of other Christian Kings besides? And as it is the nature of sin, (and particularly that of rebellion), to encrease and steal on us by degrees (like <hi>witchcraft</hi>), mark we (with grief and astonishment), to what height and temerity we are now grown herein. So that (at this day), men are not content to pare away from Kings some parcels of their Dominions, but now they think fit, (yea and duty) to take all: and would have it every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where believed, that while they can but pretend Christs service, and so (with a fair <hi>Corban) be sitting in the Temple of God,</hi> they must be all that while do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55976:208"/>
his will: as though Antichristianism were not a sin of fact; or that to be against, and for Christ were the same thing.</p>
               <p>In that which hath been hitherto spoken (in the description of Antichrist), if I be not throughly convincing, it is not to be wondred at; considering the prejudice which every reader will have against it: he being in some kinde or degree or other, guilty in act or desire, of the encroachment of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himself. And next considering, that the thing it self is both set down to be, and accordingly delivered to us as a mystery. But yet, since the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and prophesie of his coming, was to warn true Christians of his danger, it is our duty to be intent to finde out whom this mystery doth concern. In which doing, the mystery it self is made (by the good providence of God) our best help, to discover the persons that prevail by this mystical working: that is, not by open opposition against God or Christ, but by being secretly against them, whilst sitting in the Temple, and pretending to be most zealous and religious.</p>
               <p>Such were the persons, and such were the practices of the Pharisees at first, against the person of Christ himself, under colour of serving God. A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so bewitching unwary mindes with their legal pretensions of sanctity, that all Christs miracles could not be sufficient to convince his divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And such are the persons, and such are the pretensions of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, and followers, the Antichristian zealots of our time. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>the Antichrist,</hi> (under shew of religious power over the whole Temple) doth bare-faced trample on sacred Authority, how cleerly may we (and with grief) behold, this <hi>form of godliness</hi> always most closely put on by the many Antichrists now, when any of Christs Deputies are to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Inasmuch, as there is not an Antichristian attempt, which Christ is not brought to ovvn, under some religious pretence or other,) by these kind of men: vvho novv (against his Vicegerents), conform themselves unto all the examples of those that at first most opposed himself.</p>
               <p>Thus shall we observe this <hi>generation of vipers,</hi> (and who (like vipers) are ready to gnaw out the bowels of the Church and State that bred them), to be hypocrites like them: that is, <hi>they say and do not. They binde</hi> (like them) <hi>heavy burthens and grievous to be born,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and lay them on mens shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</hi> Even so,<note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> how <hi>is line upon line, precept upon precept,</hi> added as fundamental in Religion:<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> that under a cloak of sanctity, <hi>greetings in the market-place,</hi> (that is, popular applause) may be gotten: <hi>that they may be called of men Rabbi, and to have the chief seats in the Synagogues, and the uppermost rooms in feasts?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> How ambitious do we still finde them, to have honorable places and esteem in meetings? But as for loving room at feasts, I think our Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Pharisees, will with their formal <hi>long Prayers,</hi> put down any ancient Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee: even to the <hi>devouring of all widdows houses they can creep into.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How do our Pharisees resemble old ones, <hi>in compassing sea and land to make Proselites?</hi> How do they again, in pressing some superstitious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">Verse 23. Verse 24.</note> and thereby failing <hi>in Judgement Mercy and Faith?</hi> How do they resemble them in <hi>straining at a gnat, and swallowing at a Camel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all, (as if by divine Providence permitted, to shew of what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction the Antichristian Pharisees of our time are), how is the <hi>Corban</hi> and the Sabbath, (the two old Pharisaical marks of Devotion), re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rained and pressed still by Papists and Sectaries: with such Superstitious degree of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:55976:208"/>
that they would have men think that their Church and Sabbath, were inclusive of all Sanctity and duty besides. But truely, when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (in the last of these), how often the strict observation of the Sabbath hath been by Christ and his Apostles reproved, and never once spoken for in the New-Testament (it looking like a command appropriate to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be kept <hi>in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 3.15. Deut. 5.15</note> being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kept till then) and that it should yet remain a mark and cognizance of what these men are (that so much pretend to follow him) we cannot but wonder at their imprudent choice, in not laying their formal devotion else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, then on that fatal badge.</p>
               <p>But, while they are thus drawing neer God with their lips, and honoring him with their mouths, in their works they deny him; and make it manifest that it is Mammon they serve. For, all the while they are so clamorous for a day for God to rest on (because it costs them nothing), they will not allow him a house to rest in, because that will yeild them something. Our Saviour (with that other <hi>man after Gods own heart</hi>) could say, <hi>the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up,</hi> when as these mens zeal doth everywhere eat up the houses themselves. Our Saviour <hi>drove the buyers and sellers, and such as made Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice, out of the Temple:</hi> but these bring in such as are to make Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Temple. And, while they are <hi>thus taking to themselves all the houses of God into possession</hi>; and, with sacrilegious hands, robbing him and his Ministers of all those honorable Monuments of Devotion and Charity wherewith their more pious and holy Ancestors had made Christ and his Religion honorable in the eys of the world, these men, in relation <hi>those bags they carry</hi> and adore, are (with <hi>Judas</hi>) crying out <hi>wherefore all this waste</hi>? A Barn, and a Cobler, are, in thir esteem, places and persons good enough for the service of that great God <hi>before men,</hi> whom, in a hypocritical zeal, they so much pretend to reverence and respect. And while we are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly serving <hi>our Father, in houses of Prayer</hi> dedicated to his Worship, they are serving their Father and their <hi>God, their belly,</hi> in places of like dedication: a Dining-room or a Kitchin; on a Table for an Altar, and with a Cook for a Priest: and yet all this while, that they are thus <hi>without God in the world,</hi> and <hi>denying Christ before men,</hi> they would be apprehended as the onely heirs of Heaven, and so inwardly and heartily addicted to their service above others, that it cannot at all break forth into action of Love or Obedience. As though holiness and righteousness were contemplative graces onely, or that any one could be a true and worthy member of Christs Church who endeavored not his praise <hi>before men,</hi> but were by their disobedient and unsociable lives a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to that Religion which hath the highest Reason and morality in its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any in the world.</p>
               <p>How is that old pharisaical Tradition of <hi>washing of hands, pots, cups,</hi> &amp;c. imitated by the select tones and phrases of our modern Pharisees? whereby (as by a sort of canting language) they take liberty (with their predecessors) at once to commend themselves, and condemn others: as if in this kinde of devotion (because they devised it) all Religion were to be put. By this light, and rule of distinction, do our Pharisees (like those of old),<note place="margin">Matth. 7.3. Luke 18.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jude 19.</note> 
                  <hi>spie the moats in their brothers eys.</hi> And as those of old could boast <hi>they were not as other men,</hi> so <hi>these be they that separate themselves</hi> now: rashly judging all that are not of their crew, to be worldlings, ungodly, malignant, reprobate, and what not. And that themselves are not thus carnally minded, they do most evidently declare by fact; for after, by their devout pretensions, they have seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:55976:209"/>
in that earthly dominion and power they did seem to despise, they will thrust out these their ungodly and worldly brethren out of their legal estates and possessions, as being but usurpers in that right of the creature which is peculiar unto themselves.</p>
               <p>Which Antichristian fatal badge of <hi>separation, and going out from us,</hi> me thinks they should have prudently declined also: not onely because they finde it so often reproved, in their predecessors by our Savior, but also by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; admonishing them to <hi>ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and to walk therein</hi>;<note place="margin">Jer. 6.16, 17. Verse 21.</note> as the sure course to <hi>to finde rest for their souls.</hi> But since they have refused to <hi>walk therein, or to hearken to the watchmen by God set over them,</hi> and are thereupon run into a mutual course of <hi>stumbling and perishing,</hi> by following their new and private speculations, I see not why any conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man should be scandalized with their obloquy: since it is but equal, or short of what their predecessors gave our Savior himself.<note place="margin">Mat. 11 19, &amp;c</note> For as this (on the one hand) will prove us Disciples of Christ, so (on the other hand), will it prove them Disciples of the Pharisees.</p>
               <p>Yes, the true successors, and imitators of those hypocrites of old, are all these whom we daily finde extolling themselves above others, by models and rules of distinction of their own framing. For as of old, those that were rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious against Christ and his Gospel, are by the Evangelical Prophet set down saying to others,<note place="margin">Isa. 65 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Stand by thy self, come not neer me, for I am holier then thou</hi>; even so now, how do our late Pharisees vilifie and abandon, under the like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Publicans and sinners, all that are not by themselves cannonized for Saints and Holy? For it is not now the being members of Christs body the Church; alas, that's a common grace; but being of their gang therein, that can truely sanctifie. No, that glorious appellation of Saints, in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament given to the houshold of Faith in honor of the Master thereof, even to <hi>such as were sanctified through Faith in Christ,</hi>

No, but, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them formerly, sanctity was appropriate to the Circumcision, so, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians, because <hi>every one that nameth the name of Christ should depart from iniquity,</hi> therefore it came to pass that a <hi>believer</hi> and a <hi>Saint,</hi> came to signifie the same.</p>
               <p>But let not us now take this ill: for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and other of Christs own Disciples, (because not of them) shall not be by them called Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: no not so much as Mr. <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. Whenas, if any Author is mentioned by them, he hath the addition of Mr. as Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> or the like. And their excuse for not doing it, is the greatest Argument of their pride: which is, because the Apostles (in their parity) used not to give these titles to one another: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they not to give it to them neither. Concluding (as it should seem) that because they had now attained an equal pitch of sanctity with them, they might thereupon say <hi>our brother Paul, Peter,</hi> or the like.</p>

To him that hath the Keys of Heaven and of Hell, we must leave the judgement and distinction of those persons and their qualities, that are fit for the one or the other. Whereas to us, that cannot discover the hypocrisie of persons, nor tell who in the visible Church are of the Communion of Saints, and who not; it is no ways safe nor becoming, to make these arrogant and deceivable distinctions: so as to call some Saints, &amp; count others cast-aways, in regard of any secret tokens of Grace and Salvation by our selves disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Mystical Delivery of some Divine Truths, and the Reason thereof.</head>
               <p>SOme there are, who contend very seriously, and with many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make it appear, that that work of Creation which is to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary apprehensions, set down to be the imployment of six days, was wholly effected in one; chiefly perswading themselves, that the contrary assertions of allowing six days time was derogatory to the Almightiness of such an Agent as was occupied herein. In those that oppose them, there is as much invention used to shew why we should keep our selves to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of six days work; and that the litteral sense of that story could import none other. And truly, were I to judge, I should assign to these last the greater hold of truth; as not deeming it a diminution to the sufficiency of any workman, that is not bound by any thing besides his own will, to be as long, or as short a time as he pleaseth in the finishing of what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes; especially, since it is not therewithal set down, that he had not abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do it sooner. For, if the dispatch of the Creation in one day, should have argued Almightiness, more then in six, then, they should have left him but one hour, or rather but one minute for the doing thereof; if they must suppose him measuring his Almightiness in his operations, by the time of their production.</p>
               <p>Therefore, as the only will and good pleasure of God Almighty, was at first the cause why all things were by him at all, or in such and such manner created, so was it also the only rule and guid, that set measure and form to the way and means of their preservation, and so consequently was it the reason why the several species of creatures came to be endued with such friendly aspects and inclinations, as that they prosecuting the same naturally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually should therewith also, preserve and promote the good of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures. Which affection, although to that end, common to all, was yet only necessarily and insensibly to themselves, imposed on the lower sorts of things; when as the most noble race of creatures, which had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to him, had also so much knowledge and will implanted, as to enable them, not only to be so far apprehensive, as to be expresly thankful for these favours, but also to furnish them with power for farther acquisition of things delightful and good, and of avoidance of what was contrary, as hath been heretofore observed.</p>
               <p>In which course of liberty and freedom of will, whereby the welfare of voluntary Agents comes to be referred to their own demeanor and guidance, God makes another manner of condition with us men, then he did with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: For the Angels that fell, he hath so abandoned in his justice, that they cannot rise; and these that do stand, he hath so surrounded with his grace and providence, that they cannot fall. For they sinning actually and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, or else, after the same manner continuing upright and obedient, could
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55976:210"/>
not but from his justice or goodness, expect personal sentence accordingly; whereas to us men, that sinned by imputation, as transgressing in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals and representatives of our kind we (in our separate persons) are neither irremediably censured to punishment, nor yet to mercy or reward. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though traduction made eternal death liable to all (<hi>even to such as had not sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression</hi>) yet forasmuch as we had not (like our first Parents) personally so sinned,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> God appoints us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means and way of deliverance, whereby it should come to pass, that none should suffer for the fault of <hi>Adam,</hi> in his actual disobedience against God, but such as should personally afterwards incur that guilt of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by renewing it against his Son Christ Jesus; nor should the bite and contagion of that <hi>Serpent</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> prove mortal to any, that should with the eye of faith, look unto this <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> for cure.</p>
               <p>But then farther, some of mankind being for their original fault (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) in justice to be punished, and some again in mercy to be freed, it stood not agreeable to Gods impartial rule of administration, particularly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point and prosecute any peremptory and unavoidable means of distinct saving of all those persons which shall hereafter be taken into mercy, because even thereupon the rest (who could in <hi>Adam</hi> be looked upon but with equal guilt) must have been unequally punished; but it became expedient, ordinarily to leave them free to the contrary. As therefore, that medicine or plaister, which is made for any disease, doth not cure by being, but by being apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so (in this common cure of mankinde) it became expedient, that Christ should (for application) be freely offered to all; that each mans destruction might be from his own fault, and the means of salvation not forcably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on all that are saved, to involve the rest in inevitable ruine: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we read of a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardned, or a <hi>Paul</hi> particularly chosen by God, for some special and extraordinary uses (and to shew Gods freedom and power over his creature, as the Potter over the clay) we must not take it as his ordinary course. No more, then when (in our fortunes and affairs of this life) we find God sometimes making use of his good pleasure and power, in more remarkably blessing and countenancing some particular Nations or persons more then ordinary, we are thence to conclude, that the good or ill fortune of each Nation in general, or each person of that Nation in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, is not usually to be ascribed, as left unto the guidance of their, and his own judgement and will. Which thing (well considered) might silence much controversie in point of Predestination.</p>
               <p>But now (upon the grounds before shewed) it appearing fit that this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means of salvation, should be in such manner set forth, as all should not accept, although offered, nor none with just excuse deny, we shall find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why the name and notion of <hi>Mystery,</hi> is so often applied both to the Gospel, and Christ himself: and why our Saviour was so frequent in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables.</p>
               <p>Doubted it cannot be, but that it stood within the compass of Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness to have made such inward preparation of mans heart, and to have so encreased the light and evidence of divine truth (both by continuance of miracles, and increase and plainness of discourse) that it had been impossible for any one to have denied his assent and obedience thereunto: For so even the unbelieving Jews, and malicious Scribes and Pharisees that could not be convinced and brought to acknowledgement of the truth by those many
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:55976:211"/>
other miracles wrought by our Saviour, are yet professing that if he would (shew one of their choosing,<note place="margin">Mar. 15.30, 32. Mar. 27.42, &amp;c.</note> that is) <hi>Descend from his cross and save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self they would then believe on him also:</hi> Whereas now, by this offer of salvation, in such a way as cannot by all be accepted or refused, his mercy and justice, in saving or punishing part of mankind, are both preserved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality.</p>
               <p>For thus, when we find the Gospel preached to any particular Nation or People (whereby God may have a Church, or Company of men more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly serving and praising him) it is yet so ordered, that the necessity of particular and definite persons believing unto salvation, follows not thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for that the many resplendent beams, of divine light and truth in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture contained, do so dazel and divert mens understandings, that they prove for the most part unable, truly to make use of, and distinguish that direct beam, pointing at their most necessary duties: but pleasing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the forms of godliness, lose the true vertue and power thereof that should bring them to heaven. When as, on the contrary, such sorts of people to whom so much hath not been given, and have not so well known their Masters will, shall, by obedience to the substance of the Law written in their hearts, prove themselves better Disciples of the two. For these, having never refused or opposed, as the others have, must therein be acknowledged as for him, whilst not denying, or against him. And so, because (in works) all we can call our own is absence, of ill; therefore faith being the gift of God, absence of dis-belief frees us from condemnation, where it is with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence accompanied.</p>
               <p>Upon which grounds, it should follow, that men in their future condition, should be distinguished into three ranks; that is, first, such as through actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faith in Christ, attain remission by repentance, and participation of the reward of heaven, through imputation of good works done in his obedience. The other, of such as dis-believe him; or else, not knowing him, do (besides the miss of heaven) pull upon themselves the deserved punishments of hell; by breaches of charity in those punishments they bring on others. The middle rank may be supposed of such, as, missing the desert and reward of heaven (through want of actual faith in Christs merits) do yet avoid the punishment and condemnation of hell, by observing the substance of the Law, which is love; and avoiding those crimes that accompany actual and known disobedience and breach of Charity.</p>
               <p>From which it might be farther gathered, that had man continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, hell had not been for punishments of his charity, nor a heaven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the reward of his faith; but being then led by the light of his uncorrupted nature, as it would h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e kept him from guilt, so the good he did (through charitable propension) being by her light done too, and she having her object of benefit not higher then here below; he could not merit beyond an earthly Paradise, had not a divine person (by owning our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as his) made them more highly rewardable. For so in the Gospel, shall we find our Sentence at the last judgement running according to works: and as works also done to, or against our Saviour himself; he answering, <hi>Inasmuch as ye did it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.40, 45:</note> 
                  <hi>or did it not unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye did it, or did it not unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because now, all men are more or less harmful, and transgressors of the moral Law, or Law of Providence, this third middle condition is quite
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55976:211"/>
taken off: And as men stand differenced in degrees of reward and punishment, answerably as they have been faithful and charitable, or otherwise: So, there being none that can say of himself, he is at all times free from unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness, it follows, that all without Christ, must be liable in degree to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture punishment also,</p>
               <p>These things thus stated, we may find reason, why, as there is a hell and heaven prepared for mankind, so those qualities and conditions leading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, should rest for the most part in his own power; and that, as God is not to be accused for those punishments of the wicked, in what he doth to the glorifying of his justice, so, that the rewards of the righteous may be the more to his honor, in their services and obediences towards him, he will have it done with, and through as great difficulties as humane frailty is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, <hi>even making his strength perfect in their weakness</hi>; least they do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as lead in too plain a way,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> it might be objected (in prejudice to Gods glory in their obedience) as the Devil did to <hi>Job; Do these serve God for nought,</hi> hath he not put them in such a condition as they could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? To which purpose (as <hi>Iob</hi> in the fortunes of this world, so) we, for tryal of our faith, are suffered to have tares and false lights, sowed amongst us by that wicked one, that we from thence escaping, might arise more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the praise of the goodness and power of that God, to whose glory and service we directed it: and to the greater condemnation of him, that in so great a light fell away.</p>
               <p>Nor yet can there be any ground taken from thence for any such impious conjecture; as that God proposed these lights and truths to his Church as in mockery: and with direct intention of rendring them ineffectual through obscurity; and not, as truly and sincerely therein, purposing their benefit and salvation. For we may confidently affirm, that the discovery of the errors and inconveniencies of Atheism, Antichristianism, Uncharitableness, Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, &amp;c. are in nature, and many places of Scripture so plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: and the contrary truths and duties so evidently exprest and asserted, that it were not possible for any man (whom licentiousness hath not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, and pre-possessed with the spirit of Infidelity, Rebellion, Malice, Stubornness, or the like) to be ignorant thereof upon any reasonable inquiry. But if the corruption of our depraved nature, helped on with the malice of that wicked one (most forward to sow his tares in the field of the Church, and most ready to enter the places thus swept and garnished) do so common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep us from discerning those truths and duties, which we are so loath to find and conceive to be such, it is not (as before noted) to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at.</p>
               <p>And, to come nearer our own present business by instance; if there should have been set down in Scripture such plain Precepts for settling the office and power of Monarchy, as should have necessarily and universally, driven men to implicite obedience to that Government and none else, it would not only have overthrown our liberty, and rendred all men equally good and bad, as aforesaid, but also have endangered the loss of Gods honor (the end of mans conservation) whilst it thus, for peace sake, went about to confer it too closely and absolutely on his deputy; on whom (as in a kind of Idolatry, men might else come to fix those express returns of thanks and praise, which to God himself were only due, as to their fountain and original. These les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons intending as well to enjoyn obedience in subjects, to whom all places of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55976:212"/>
obedience must be understood, as to take off arrogance in Princes, and so each one to learn their own parts, not that of others.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when we shall find Christ so obsure in his description of the Kingdom of God or heaven, and of his appearing, as to give occasion to some to think the words altogether to imply Gods inward Kingdom, or Christs coming to judgement at the last day, and not his glorious appearance in his Kingdom, the Church, it is not much to be admired to be miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, and that construction always made use of, by such prejudiced minds as are loath to examine how then it should be true, that the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>should desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and should not see it</hi>:<note place="margin">Luke 17.22.</note> it being unconceivable, how they should not see his second coming to judgement, or not be partakers of his glory therein, as well as of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts here.</p>
               <p>Upon which grounds we may also find reason, why our Saviour was so close and reserved in all those places, where he hath occasion to speak of that power he was to delegate and leave to his Apostles; even so, that he not only forbears to put their Authority under the plain notion of obedience, and doth it under the more familiar terms of <hi>hearing or receiving</hi> (saying, <hi>He that receiveth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 10.40. Luke 10.16.</note> 
                  <hi>or heareth you, heareth, or receiveth me:</hi> But also, whilst he is giving them this power, he doth so intermix it with such other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses (that may seem, or are common to others also) that the Apostles themselves could not (it is like)understand the plenitude of their own power, until after his Resurrection; that <hi>he had particularly spoken to them of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God:</hi> Which things, being the proper duties and instructions of the Apostles only,<note place="margin">Acts 1.3.</note> was the reason we find him not mentioning the like to any other person.</p>
               <p>And when, by reason of this obscurity, S. <hi>Peter</hi> is asking whether them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>or all</hi> are spoken to, he neither gives answer I, nor no; but (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted) goes on with the description of the duty of their Offices,<note place="margin">Luke 12.41.</note> under the notion of <hi>Stewards.</hi> Which office, although it must of consequence draw on eminence and power in Gods houshold the Church, yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the duty thereof in such expressions as might concern others, as well as themselves.</p>
               <p>But, when there, or in other places, he is instructing to humility most, we are to conceive it done because the Authority of this office is most subject to tempt to pride and oppression. And where we find him so frequent in giving admonitions to mutual love, and particularly, so often giving his Apostles warning for <hi>loving one another,</hi> and so expresly, <hi>forbidding them to seek to exercise Authority one over another</hi> (as it cannot be construed as excluding their just authority over such as are under them,<note place="margin">Mat. 20.26 Luke 22.26.</note> so) this admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be conceived of high import to the peace and good of his whole Church: Which might else, by the disagreement of these several Heads, in their divided jurisdictions one against another, draw on perpetual wars, by their ambitious seeking to encroach on their frllow Stewards Office and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not resting content with their own Charge.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Gentile imitation,</hi> or striving to obtain a sole Monarchy in Christs whole Church (as formerly the Greeks,<note place="margin">Luke 22.25.</note> Romans, or others had done in the world) hath been (as experience tells us) not only unsuccesful to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, but always of high mischief to Christendom. And therefore, if this seasonable admonition of mutual service and love one to another do oftner
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55976:212"/>
and more plainly appear to be given to the Apostles, then the description of their power, there is good and plain reason for so doing.</p>
               <p>We may also find reason from hence, why the Apostles themselves were so mysterious and dark, in declaring their own great Power in the Church. So that S. <hi>Paul</hi> having been put to it by his stubborn <hi>Corinthians,</hi> doth yet do it as in a mystery: for fear of arrogating too much to himself, and through his too great eminence in power, to prove more obnoxious to the rest of the world, and more scandalous to his new Believers. Therefore, saith he, <hi>These things brethren I have in a figure transferred to my self, and to Apollo for your sakes: that ye might learn in us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>not to think of men above that which is written: that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as he had mysterously thus avowed his own power, and still used <hi>meek and loving</hi> intreaties; whereas he might have <hi>come with a rod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 18, 19, &amp;c.</note> in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his <hi>power in the kingdom of God,</hi> it was out of jealousie of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God of his honor, by thinking of men <hi>above what was written</hi>; and to leave them also an example of greater humility; since he that was chief amongst them took no more upon him. Having also, by this abatement of himself (who as an Apostle was their chief Head) an aim to reduce them from Schism, caused through their esteeming too highly of others that were <hi>puffed up,</hi> and yet had no Mission; nothing <hi>written</hi> for their so doing, as he had; who was endued with power to command them <hi>in the Lord,</hi> or in <hi>Christs name</hi>; according to the <hi>written</hi> texts of, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me, &amp;c.</hi> So that we may see, the mysterie of their duty of obedience to Christs Minister plainly inferred, when by forbidding <hi>to think of men above what is written,</hi> it must be supposed their duty, to give what <hi>is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without this way of interpretation, and by consideration and regard had unto the Dignity and Authority of <hi>Christs Ministers, and the Stewards of the Mysteries of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 1.</note> it will be very hard to make the word <hi>For</hi> to be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the said sentence, <hi>That no one of you be puffed up for one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: Because we are to conceive, that although <hi>faithfulness be required in Stewards,</hi> yet it being not (as heretofore noted) subjected to <hi>mans judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> but to Gods, whose Stewards they are, the people are therefore to refer their censure of their Superiors power or prudence to him that is the Guide, as well as the Searcher of their hearts. When Christ, at his second coming, <hi>shall bring to light the hidden things of darkness</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Verse 3, 4.</note> shall discover the reason of this mystical way of empowering his Substitutes; and shall then also, <hi>by making manifest the counsel of hearts,</hi> convince men that many things were by their Superiors done upon good counsel and consideration, which they, by hearkning to private Doctrines and Guides, might mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construe, and so be led into schisms and seditions, whilst they shall be thus <hi>puffed up for</hi> one another (as they stood each one distinctly conceited and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in their several Congregations and Heads) and thereby come to be really and effectually <hi>one against another</hi>: in respect of that breach of publike Peace and Charity which this factious proceeding and dis-respect to one Head must produce.</p>
               <p>And of this mystical delivery of his authority, we shall farther instance in one place, as particularly remarkable, for setting the power of each Churches Head in such a way, as not to be subject either to rob God of his honor, or to give scandal, by his own claiming authority to himself in too
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55976:213"/>
plain a manner. He having praised the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for <hi>keeping the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances delivered unto them</hi> (whereby they had shewed themselves Disciples,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.1. Verse 2.</note> or <hi>followers of him as he was of Christ</hi>: he then adds (to take off all shew of boasting) <hi>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God:</hi> That is, I would not be understood as claiming this obedience in mine own name, but as under Christ, <hi>the head of every man</hi>: that is, more especially of every man thus exalted in power. For as we cannnot interpret Christ to be Head of every single man, so as to exclude the whole sex of women, no more can we think, that in regard of power and subjection one to another (which is the scope of what went before, and what follows) that every man stands in like relation to Christ. But that, although all single men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (so far as they are Christians) are alike his members, yet do they differ as they stand in their Oeconomy, relating as Ministers and Members in each particular Church.</p>
               <p>Therefore we cannot conceive, that all this serious discourse should be litterally taken; as driving at nothing but womens covering their heads, or of mens being bare-headed in time of praying or prophesying: as if God cared for the one or the other, as in themselves: But to shew, that (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the drift of the former Chapters) there ought to be order kept in all our publike services; and that also, this order and uniformity is to be directed by obedience. So that by <hi>Man,</hi> we may understand the Head of each Church; and by <hi>women,</hi> the members thereof, and most especially those of the Clergy; who are (as wives) to be directed herein by their husbands: And <hi>Praying and Prophesying,</hi> we may understand put for the whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward service.</p>
               <p>That this was only Parabolically spoken of women, with intention that (under the instance of their subjection to their husbands) general subjection might be inferred, will appear in that the woman is herein proposed as doing that which she is not permitted to do; that is to prophesie, and especially publikely.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.34.</note> For so we shall find him presently saying, <hi>Let your women keep silence in the Churches, for it is not permitted unto them to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 35.</note> 
                  <hi>as also saith the Law; and if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to speak in the Church,</hi> In which place, the occasion of the speech was also the same; namely, the avoidance of Schisms, by having all things <hi>done decently,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 40.</note> 
                  <hi>and in order</hi>; that is, by means of subordination and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, of the <hi>second and third ranks of Prophets and Teachers,</hi> unto Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Authority,<note place="margin">Chap. 12.28.</note> which is the <hi>first,</hi> and so established by Christ also.</p>
               <p>Again, it will appear parabollically put, for that the tokens of subjection there put down, are not pertinent to set forth the subordination of women to men (litterally taken) but are mysteriously proper to set forth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of each Church to that husband, unto whom in Christ she is marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For being bare-headed, did not signifie Power and Freedom; nor being covered, signifie servitude, but the quite contrary, both in the sense of those times and ours. But if it be supposed not fit, for the Head of the Church to <hi>pray with his head covered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>for dishonoring his head</hi>; that is, Christ, from whom all his Authority is derived; even so again, by covering, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publike Church Rights and Orders, each Church is not then to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed left bare, and at liberty in these things by her Head, as the Head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55976:213"/>
is by Christ his Head: But that she is to observe them as her covering,<note place="margin">Verse 6.</note> or else renounce her obedience by <hi>being shorn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, apprehending the duties of obedience and subjection to be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied under signs contrary, we may observe, <hi>that the man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the glory of God</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">Verse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> in his head he is more particularly representing his Authority and universal Headship, in respect of his Government and Power amongst us. Which his glory, being to arise from that subjection and obedience which these below do give unto him, therefore <hi>the woman is the glory of the man.</hi> And when it is said,<note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The man is not of the woman,</hi> it is meant the Commander and his Power is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the commanded: <hi>But the woman is of the man,</hi> meaning the subject from the Subjector. And so again, when it is said, <hi>The man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man</hi>;<note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> it is to be taken as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to their respective duties of commanding and obeying only; and as thereby causing Gods encrease of glory, by being more eminently glorified by persons in Authority. For else they themselves (nay in their relations too) are not for one another, but for the glory of God.</p>
               <p>But to make God the God of order here below, <hi>The woman ought to have power on her head because of the Angels:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> that is, each Church and her Angels, ought here (by their obedience) to acknowledge the power of their own Head (claiming it to Gods glory as his image of Authority) even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Heaven, God hath the like done to him by his Angels or Ministers, and doth therefore require, that the like subordination be observed by those members, which in each Church serve as Angels to minister unto his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent the Head thereof.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, the Apostle explains how the Head and his Angels (or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) are to be reciprocally supporters of each other. For <hi>in the Lord</hi> (that is, in the execution of Church matters) the King is not to act without his Bishops, nor they without him: <hi>even as the man is not without the woman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> 
                  <hi>nor the woman without the man in the Lord:</hi> And therefore, after the pact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fashion the Commanders and Obeyers (in their reciprocal relations) are not to shut out God: but the Superiors themselves should be careful to attribute that honor to God, which they do by his power receive, because all <hi>things are of God.</hi> For looking upwards to the honor and end of the work,<note place="margin">Verse 12. Chap. 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>neither he that planteth, nor he that watereth are any thing, but God that giveth the encrease.</hi> And looking downwards again, to the object of their imployment, the whole Church, <hi>All things are theirs also, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, and they are Christs, and Christs is God</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Chap 3.22, 23.</note> all things return to God, as having his glory the last end of all power, even as himself was the only efficient thereof.</p>
               <p>In the three next verses, the necessity of each Churches observance of appointed order in her publike service to God, is farther implyed and urged as consonant to ordinary reason: <hi>Judge in your selves, is it comely for a woman to pray unto God uncovered</hi>; that is,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.13.</note> for subordinate men and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to frame what Forms of Worship they please. <hi>Doth not even nature it self teach you, that if a man</hi> (in Authority) <hi>have long hair</hi> (that is, be subjected in Church Orders) <hi>it is a shame to him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
                  <hi>but if a woman have long hair, it is a glory, for her hair was given her for a covering</hi>; where on the other side we may find,<note place="margin">Verse 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> that all tokens of subjection are proper for Inferiors, and that especially in Church Rites and Ceremonies, being

               <p>This Allegory is largely continued, and set forth in his Epistles to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> taking occasion there also, to press it in the like behalf of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and obedience, and in particular, about publike Church Orders.

But plain it is that the Apostle doth expresly there set it down not to be meant litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but <hi>as a great mysterie concerning Christ and his Church</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 32.</note> and so leaves none but the following Verse, to set out expresly the mutual duties of man and wife; <hi>viz. Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular, so love his wife,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 33.</note> 
                  <hi>even as himself: and the wife see that she reverence her husband</hi>; that is, although I have before appointed each Church to be in subjection to her Head or Husband, as the whole Church is to Christ, its Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; so now I do litterally intend to direct you in these conjugal duties. All which the words <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> and, <hi>In particular,</hi> do manifest; by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it off from the other discourse, and appropriating it to this; implying, that before he alluded to another thing; even the general relation between each Church and its Head, but here, of the particular relation of each man and his wife.</p>
               <p>And by this means we may know how to unfold the mystical delivery of the power of each Churches Head under Christ, which else (by stubborn persons) might have seemed so great a mysterie, as not to be conceived far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extensive, then of the Catholique Church her obedience to Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. A thing not to be otherwise performed then by each Churches obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its own Head in his stead, as heretofore declared: nor at all avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to stopping of Schisms and Divisions, by settling of Order in each Church, which was the drift of the admonitions, but rather to encrease them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.12.</note> as heretofore noted also: Where <hi>the followers of Christ himself</hi> are reckoned amongst other Schismaticks. Nor need we much wonder why the Apostle, in setting forth the duty of Obedience, should personate the wife; and allude unto that relation more then any other, since we shall find this perfect obedience to be first enjoyned to wives; and that, not only to be given upon most strict terms, but as done upon reason foregoing; and upon the first promise of prevalence of Christ and his Church, as the <hi>seed of the woman: Thy desire shall be subject to thy husbands, and he shall rule over thee.</hi> So that as the general rule for Civil subjection was first given under the notion of <hi>Father and Mother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.16. Exod. 20.12.</note> even so also, the mystical Precept for Ecclesiastick Subordination and Obedience, was at first intimated, and since continued, under the notion of <hi>Husband:</hi> Thereby inferring, that although, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to these Oeconomical relations, men in Orders stood not naturally so subjected as others, yet should their more Religious and Sacramental tye thereunto, incite them unto such demeanor of themselves in Gods <hi>Houshold the Church,</hi> that they may evidence themselves men of Orders, whilst serving and obeying the God of Order, by submission to this their spiritual Husband, in such degree and manner as he appointed.</p>
               <p>The case therefore thus standing, between the fear of robbing God of
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55976:214"/>
his proper glory, and the fear of destruction of men (the instruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) by Civil war, as we may see good ground for divine permission of those many changes of Families in Christian Monarchies; to wit, least too much should be arrogated by them in right of succession, or derogated from Gods honor by that continued obedience given to such a race only (which by Gods appearance in a remarkable change is taken off) So also we may finde reason, both why the Direction and Precepts for Monarchy and Obedience should be so many (as in maintenance of so necessary a duty) and why again they should not only be sometimes darkly delivered, but why also, there should be some scattered examples, that seemed to speak the contrary, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to stand in the Scripture without express censure.</p>
               <p>Thus shall you find <hi>Amaziah slain,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And so farther, as there may be examples picked from Scripture, of some Prophets reproving their Kings, without any express mention of their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God so to do (which might yet be evidently enough presumed) so are there such now to be found, as, by vertue of their Priestly power, would from thence gather warrant for their boldness to vent their open reproofs in the face of Majesty, pride or interest carrying them so headily herein, as not to consider that the very calling and spirit of these Prophets was both extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and miraculous, and their power and office, as heretofore noted, was instituted to the very intent of being extraordinary Monitors towards the preservation of that Nation and Kingdom. And therefore if some find <hi>Isaiah</hi> set down as coming to reprove <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> without such express direction as <hi>Nathan</hi> and others had, they will be thence collecting, that those of the Clergy may do the like now; without marking that it is afterwards by <hi>Isaiah</hi> declared as a message to come extraordinary from God, and not by him pronounced by vertue of any Text of the Law.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, since we shall never find those of the Priesthood, who were the Statute-Officers for instruction and interpretation of Law, offering to reprove any Prince; and yet it is plain that these Laws have been by their Kings manifestly broken (as in the prohibition of multiplying treasure and horses, and other things) it is most apparent, that there can be no just claim to any such Authority for reproof challenged by any of the Priest-hood now, having no pretence of claim to higher Authority then those formerly. And
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55976:215"/>
therefore from all these and like instances we may (in truth) as soon gather arguments for Rebellion, as others do for Drunkenness, Incest, or Adultery, from the facts of <hi>Noah, Lot, Judah,</hi> &amp;c. which are all set down without reproof.</p>
               <p>But in the discovery of this, and other sins, as there is still plainness enough used, to enable him <hi>to hear that hath ears to hear</hi>; so darkness sufficient, to <hi>let him that is filthy be filthy still.</hi> Which was the reason of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, when he said,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.7. Verse 6. Chap. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>we speak the wisdom of God in a mysterie:</hi> but <hi>not so to them that are perfect, but unto them that perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor need we wonder that these and such like presidents, should prevail with men now, amidst their many worldly temptations, when our Saviours own Disciples (as before noted) would have had him been imitating <hi>Eliah</hi> by fire from heaven, in the pursuit of this revengeful and resisting humour. So that, when we finde the particular instances of <hi>Jeoiadah,</hi> or the peoples sole, or more remarkable intermedling recorded as instrumental in setting the Crowns on <hi>Jehoash</hi> and <hi>Azariahs</hi> Head, made (now adays) by Priests or Subjects) as good arguments to wear them when they have doneour; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration will be well abated, by consideration of that degree of self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and prejudice, which prevails with men usually, to search the Scripture and its examples, to serve as proofs of those things they like already, and not to submit their wills to be guided by it: In which respect it is no wonder, if we <hi>come forth ten times more the children of wrath then before.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For in this case, it will fare with men, balking plain Precepts, and seeking to find Gods pleasure to be in some other places of Scripture signified more consonant to their aims and interests, as it did with <hi>Balaam</hi>: who, being tempted with riches and preferment, and <hi>loving the wages of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> did thereupon make a demur upon Gods plain Precept, <hi>Thou shalt not go with them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 22.12.</note> and doth therefore upon another enquiry: find God saying, <hi>Rise up and go with them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note> Even so I say, such as come with pre-possession to search the Scriptures, as being blinded with ambition, covetousness, or the like, and are thereupon willing to find God Almighty contradicting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                  </note> shall never fail of an answer <hi>in the night,</hi> contrary to the plain Precepts they received before, the which their worldly lusts and engagements shall make them readily obey <hi>in the morning,</hi> without farther search, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did.<note place="margin">Verse 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, in that plain Precept of <hi>Honor the Lord with thy substance, &amp;c.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness will prompt them with Texts of limitation and excuse against <hi>all this waste,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. The true Worshippers are those that worship in spirit and truth,</hi> and the like. Whereby, under colour of rendring the Church more <hi>glorious within,</hi> the former <hi>cloathing of wrought gold and needle work,</hi> shall be thought unbecoming a <hi>Kings Daughter.</hi> And so again, to elude those plain texts of, <hi>Let every soul be subject,</hi> and that <hi>for conscience sake</hi> also, and the like, the text of <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others will readily be embraced as limitations of their duty, by such who being resolved on a course of stubbornness and insubjection, may thereupon think they do still yield obedience to their Prince, whilst they obey him in such Civil matters as they shall think fit: even as they may think they serve and honor God well enough, whilst they say they do it inwardly and in the heart, and so may carry some flattery of conscience along with them, like unto <hi>Balaam</hi>: who thought he might now go, so long as according to Gods

direction, yet in such cases, where a plain Precept is transgressed, even so plain that every vulgar capacity, like <hi>Balaams</hi> Ass,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.15, 26. Jude, ver. 11. It is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in both these places <hi>Balaam</hi> is ranked amongst the hypocrites and rebellions.</note> may <hi>reprove the madness of the Prophet</hi>: for men to think of venturing upon their own interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and think they can stop soon enough in their rebellious journey, must be always dangerous: as rendring them subject to be beguiled by the <hi>Prince of the ayr,</hi> instead of an <hi>Angel of Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we are by so much the more in danger of abuse and misinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture, by how much the design and advantage thereby to arise is more general, as leaving none to contradict, or bring us to rights there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; as doth too evidently appear in the interpretation of all those Texts where insubjection is aimed at. For each one being himself a subject, and having a desire and interest towards encrease of freedom, it is to be expected that all wayes of plausible addition should be still found out for advancement of a speculation so pleasing to all. Whereas in the divided interests and opinions between Sect and Sect, the violence of one is kept in moderation by the fear of his opposite; who will be sure to use all the skill and diligence he can to detect him of error, and to extol his own contrary tenent; even so that an indifferent adjudication may be made between them.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if we put not <hi>on the whole armour of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes 3.16. Ephes. 6.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and have not our feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace</hi> (that is, with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and poorness of spirit) we shall <hi>not be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil, nor his stratagems devised,</hi> to the breach of Charity; <hi>nor be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked</hi>:<note place="margin">Verse 16.</note> Those many arguments which he and his children of disobedience make use of for setting whole Kingdoms, on fire by Rebellion.</p>
               <p>But because many now under the Gospel, have been the more drawn into these, and other errors in matter of their practise, out of their mistaken li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in the imitations of some such presidents as they find in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recorded without reproof, it will not be amiss to discourse somewhat of their and our different conditions; that so, making it appear how their doings might be lawful in such things, and how it comes otherwise to pass in ours, we may then take off the ground of so much abuse.</p>
               <p>After man had taken on him the knowledge of good and evil, he stood thereby obliged (as heretofore declared) to the performance of all such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite pious duties as were requisite for Gods service; and all such vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moral actions as were advantagious for the good of others. And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it under the Law these were abreviated, and under the Gospel contracted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into one Precept, yet until that time it still remained so much their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that men were more or less good or evil, as they more or less kept, or violated these Rules. And from thence it again followed, that those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to <hi>Adam,</hi> as in the state of innocence, and those threats sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced on him as lapsed, remained, for rewards and punishments, different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due and proper to his race.</p>
               <p>The first great transgressor in this kind was <hi>Cain,</hi> in the cruel slaughter of his brother: and on him and his race (as now exiled from Gods more particular care and right of the Creature) we shall find the first curse of ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility to be again particularly laid. And so himself understands it; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his answer,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, &amp;c.</hi> But when <hi>Seth</hi> is born, and his
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:55976:216"/>
first son reckoned, you will presently find, the distinction of the righteous seed from the other:<note place="margin">Verse 26.</note> and that it is said, <hi>Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord</hi>: And then, we may next gather him and his, for this cause estated in the right of their Fathers promises, as the other was of his Curse: For it is after said,<note place="margin">Chap. 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>That Adam beg at a Son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth</hi>: So that he being represented in his Sonship to <hi>Adam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very same expressions of <hi>Image and likeness</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> was made <hi>the Son of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.26. Luke 3.38.</note> we may conclude their undoubted propriety.</p>
               <p>But when afterwards these <hi>Sons of God</hi> began to mingle, and learn the vices of the other, then by degrees did the whole world become corrupt: and had been universally involved, in natural death and destruction by flood, had not <hi>Noah</hi> (as a person <hi>upright in his generations</hi>) found favour with God,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.9.</note> and to stopped specifical ruine. So that we are henceforth to look, that those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to mankinde in <hi>Adam,</hi> should be renewed to him and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous seed.</p>
               <p>Amongst whom, we may again find this separation made, and men still to be distinguished, in regard of more eminent acts of Justice <hi>and Iudgement,</hi> until the promises come more remarkably to descend, and be conferred on <hi>Abraham,</hi> and on his seed: that is, to the particular Nation of the Jews. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom, those common blessings of nature, were so often particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, as if they were their onely right: whereas we shall find little men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Holy Writ of the rest of the world, other then as in relation to their affairs with this peculiar people. In which, we shall find them blessed, as they were to them more kind, or punished or destroyed, as to them more malignant: as the utter overthrow of <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and the compleating of those many prophesies, against all Nations that had any ways distressed them, makes it plainly to appear.</p>
               <p>These considerations being well weighed, we may find reason for that right which the Israelites had unto the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> We may finde a good right they had unto the <hi>Egyptians</hi> goods. And of that right also which <hi>Moses</hi> had of being <hi>a god unto Pharaoh,</hi> in demanding liberty of him for the Israelites departure: to wit, because these things were done and enjoyned in the name of that God that was supreme Lord of all, as it was both to the Israelites and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> evidenced by miracles. And so we may find a good right <hi>Iacob</hi> had unto the <hi>Amorites</hi> goods too, although his sons had unjustly taken them away (because done without his authority) and so of divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instances, which would be by men (now adays) reduced into practise; not considering our different conditions, and how our Saviour (the second <hi>Adam</hi>) took not on him to restore, or establish the rights of any particular People or Nation, but dyed for all mankind: and that in him, the right of the creature became equally and universally restored. For that now, the wall of Separation being taken down, there is no distinction in these things, between the posterities of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> or <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi>: but as the Christian duty of faith, is of a more spiritual allay then that former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, so is their promises of a higher nature also. Insomuch, as we shall not find any where in the Gospel, that there is warrant given to make these things the object of our aims or hopes, as to the Jews was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done, but rather to the contrary. Whereupon we may say, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Church or particular members may (as additional blessings to the <hi>righteousness of the kingdom of God</hi>) expect these blessings to follow, yet have
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55976:216"/>
they no such particular right, as (for gain sake onely), to dispossess the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est infidel. And much less can particular Christians, under colour of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by themselves made, have right against one another: and so make God, the Author of Peace, to be the Author of Confusion and Civil war.</p>
               <p>And as the Scriptures and their meaning are thus difficult, and subject to misinterpretation, in regard of the temporal promises made in the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, so are the more spiritual promises of the Gospel and New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (for want of due regard to alteration of times and difference of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons), made the occasions of much abuse and disquiet also: through mens hasty and partial interpretations of all things, as relating to their particulars, and to their own benefits onely.</p>
               <p>To avoid which, we are to observe a difference of persons: and to know, that whereas our Saviour usually addressed his speech to his Disciples, (as those he chiefly intended to teach, because they should teach others), so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those speeches concerned them as present Teachers and Guides chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not their successors: as that place, <hi>fear not little flock,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Luke 12.32. Verse 33.</note> and the directions following it, <hi>sell what ye have and give Alms,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Some again, concerned their successors and not them: as those places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, <hi>of taking the swords, and making friendship with Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some things again, concerned both them and their successors: as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keys, <hi>whatsoever ye shall binde on earth, shall be bound in heaven:</hi> and the power of Mission and Instruction, as, <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me,</hi> &amp;c. thereby making a necessary difference between such as should teach and govern, and such as should learn and obey. Which distinction hath been of late so little considered of in the world, or rather so preposterously practiced, that those that should be, by their places, obeyed as Governors and Teachers, are now made the only objects of Discipline and Instruction. For there is not the meanest Subject or Artisan but are daring to censure and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect both Prince and Priest in performance of their duties: as if these Texts <hi>Do all things without murmuring and disputing, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>obey them that have the guide over you,</hi> &amp;c. had been purposely spoken to Kings and Preachers; that thereby they might learn submission and attention to their Subjects and and Auditors.</p>
               <p>Some things were spoken that concerned other Christians also, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the first place, as <hi>whosoever will be my Disciple, let him take up his Cross and follow me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And lastly, some things are generally set down, as concerning all men; as the Doctrines of Faith, Love, Humility, Patience, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although men may differently be concerned in the outward exercise of them, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore related.</p>
               <p>As concerning such Promises and Precepts, as had different regard to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians through alteration of times, we shall finde some that concerned the primitive Believers, and not those that followed in the latter age: as in those glorious signes promised to accompany Believers, <hi>to cast out devils, to speak with tongues, to heal the sick,</hi> &amp;c. The which,<note place="margin">Mark. 16.17, 18</note> and other miraculous assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and ways of inspiration and illumination, heretofore promised and granted to such <hi>as should ask in Christs name,</hi> and had <hi>but Faith to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a grain of Mustard-seed,</hi> some in these latter times,<note place="margin">John 16.23. Matth. 17.20.</note> have been vainly boasting of; whilst others, have as disconsolately expected: and for want of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55976:217"/>
them, been ready to think they must want Faith also. Not rightly weighing, how necessary these miraculous signes and wonders were to be then shown, for the honoring Christs name from above, which was as yet had in so little repute here below. Insomuch, as, for that very cause, we shall finde the gift of miracles granted to him that <hi>cast out devils in his name:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 9.49.</note> who, for ought we finde, pretended neither to follow, nor at all to believe on him. Nay, to shew these extraordinary endowments were not sure signes of Faith, we shall finde our Saviour condemning them that had them.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.22, 23</note>
               </p>
               <p>But when his name should be the most glorious of any, and his Church should have attained that degree of strength and learning, as to be able to provide for its own safety and illumination in an ordinary way, then came the time again, when (upon the contrary reason), these endowments to private persons ceasing, we are to construe some admonitions as chiefly proper to Christians in the last times, and to happen when his service shall be an honor: as are these Admonitions, to beware of (pretenders to new lights,) such as shall say,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo here is Christ, and loe there is Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And having hitherto so largely endeavoured to prove our Assertions out of the Texts of the holy Scriptures, and having done it with such strength of evidence, as to me seemeth of value to convince any that hath real and firm belief that they are truely proceeding from God; or that rather, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any God at all; it seems lastly necessary, for conviction of both these sorts of men, that is, open Athiests, and such secret ones, that confessing a God and the Authority of Scripture, (the better to serve their own turns thereby), do yet in their works deny him, to say something for conviction of Deity, and the daily exercise of divine Providence amongst us. The which, shall serve by way of addition, to our first enterprize therein at the beginning of this work: which, for haste to other things, was but cursorily there handled.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. Of Athiesm.</head>
               <p>AS the Nature of all kinde of vertue is to be operative, so, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and extent of operation, is the proportion and extent of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be measured. For, neither to do by help, is so powerful as to act alone; nor to do one or few things, as many or all.</p>
               <p>Again, as extent of ability is best measured by extent of operation, in the objects it undertakes, so is the proportion of vigor by distance in execution: even as that loadstone that can attract at greatest distance is best; and that fire that can heat or burn farthest of, is so also.</p>
               <p>And as potency and vigour, are to be thus measured by distance between Agent and Patient; so much more, when that distance shall be so encreased, as the presence of the Agent shall not sensibly appear, as to the present work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a weak or unlike thing, (having of it self no effectualness thereunto) sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l by its power, be made the Author of his proper execution. Thus, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> knifes point empowered by touch from the Load-stone, or an Iron or oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r thing heated by fire, do in such degree draw and burn, as if the Loadstone or fire were present; it must undeniably, argue more strength in that case, then where, without personal presence, the same could not be performed.</p>
               <p>And, (to proceed in examination and comparison of the causes of things according to distance), if there could be found, a Load-stone or fire of such efficacy, as to have empowered or heated any Iron to such perfection as it should have continued that vertue without itteration; or could again one Load-stone or fire, without so much as touch but only with one efflux of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, have at distance so strongly impowered all iron, that each piece and part thereof can now, (as of an inherent and proper vertue of its own), effectually and perpetually burn and attract, without farther immediate communication with its first cause or original power, it should then happen, that the power of that power must be acknowledged so much greater in it self: although its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiousness herein, must (through its distance in operation), be in a manner wholly concealed and clowded from our knowledge. Even as in our sports, that gamester that can make one Bowl or Ball strike another, and that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in such certain places successively, as to cause the last of them to rest or move as he desires, is more to be admired for his power and artifice, then he that can do it but with his hand: and he most, that can do it at greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and with most itteration and repetition of successive stroaks, in the Bowls or Balls.</p>
               <p>After the same manner we may conceive of Deity, making one thing the cause to another, for the effecting of that course of providence he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In which doing, his working in, and through all intervenient causes and occurrents, without being seen in any, and making them to do it with so great ease to himself as not to be seen therein, must discover as well his real being, as our ignorance in not conceiving it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:55976:218"/>For to fix and fasten those effects we daily behold as issuing onely from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, chance, or I know not what occult quality, (without through light into Deity and Providence, as the prime cause), is as if one cast at Dice or Bowls, were more from chance then another: and not necessarily depending on, and following that strength of casting, and those occurrences of bounds, rubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as others: but these having turns beyond our expectations or notice, we put them on chance; because we cannot see through all that variety of intervenient causes that must make them such.</p>
               <p>For as the several motions, and change of place in the particular Cards, in shuffling, and cutting, if leasurely demonstrated to us, would make those dealings we count most strange and depending on chance, seem most reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; even so also, (were we artificial enough), when the hits of a Bowl or bound of a Ball is shewed us, we might by estimation and measuring the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, know and measure the cause, and say, that Bowl or Ball that did it, must come from such and such a point, and be projected with such and such a strength. In which regard as we finde such different abilities, even amongst our selves in the comprehension and practice how these things are or may be effected, so may it easily be conceived that, by degrees of proportion, he that could not be by any defect impeded in notice or comprehension, no more then in act and execution, must have both his existence and providence made apparent hereby: for as the Bowl or Ball have no power to act of themselves without our impulsion or a forraign mover, even so the Elements of which they are composed, cannot without the influence of a Deity, be reasonably presumed to have power to move and act also.</p>
               <p>Although these instances of fire, of Load-stone, and of sports, may serve to bring to our conceits something of the manner of appearance of Gods Omnipotency in his works of Providence and Government of the world, yet, being themselves but created bodies and vertues, they must in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vigor, (even in that kinde wherein they so much excel all other things), be infinitely excelled by that power that caused it: and that, even by the same reason of ability of power before mentioned, namely working at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er distance. For as the Load-stone doth excel in vertue of attraction, that of the touched knife, (as being thereof the formal cause) so must that again which was the cause hereof in the Loadstone, excel in power that also; (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, being the cause of other things besides); and so on, till we come to the universal cause of all things and their Vertues: who, as the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the immediate effect and execution, must proportionably, have the prime, and highest degree of energy and power ascribed unto him.</p>
               <p>And then again, although absence from present execution prove distance, and distance prove power in that cause which is the cause of any thing, yet, because unto men, the inward and formal causes of effects are seldom known, but our knowledge is meerly experience, (that is to say, from the experience of so many constant effects proceeding from such or such an immediate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, to conclude that to be the sole cause thereof). It is therefore hard for us to look beyond that present cause: (especially if its cause had but few ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and those hardly remarkable), and so to look on, till we come to God the cause of all.</p>
               <p>As for example, could the effect of the Load-stone upon iron, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners Needle, have been to invisibly repeated, as no man could have by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense known it to be the cause, we should (beyond all peradventure) from
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55976:218"/>
the constancy of effects proceeding from the same Needle, have imagined it the sole cause thereof.</p>
               <p>So then, we, that can neither from true inspection into the formal Nature and activity of heat, and of the influence of the superior bodies, nor susce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibility of the lower Elements, as severally mingled, tell from thence that such and such species must be produced; or that again cannot tell, that these principles we finde in Nature, were necessarily to be such and so many, for maintenance of the effects of unity and propriety of place, (as those were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for maintenance of Creation), we (I say), cannot be wondred at, for not being able to forejudge more, or other species in Nature, then those we know by sense; and that also, in productions neerest us. And since in our most ordinary and familiar sports (as aforesaid), we cannot judge of events, although their true causes be within the compass of present sense, we are still less to be wondred at, when ignorance and doubtings shall often arise of a cause so far of: which is never, but by way of miracle, made the Author of any immediate effect. Whereas, in truth and plain reason, this Ascension and Progression of causes, must (as elsewhere declared), end in an omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Author: whose power is more rationally to be concluded the prime and sole cause of all things, as standing in that supreme order he now doth, then if he should be acting beneath; and of but one thing at once.</p>
               <p>And as he is more admirable in his own Throne of power, ordering all things by his sole word and command, then if he should descend to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally doing of every thing, so, (could we rightly consider it), any one thing, is (in it self) as miraculously and powerfully wrought, in that kinde of efficiency which we call ordinary, as when done in an extraordinary way. So for example, if wood should have been by God endued with power to draw Iron, or one Iron to draw another, as now the Load stone doth, would not the ordinary effect that way, have made the Load-stones attraction as great a miracle, as it seemeth for wood to do it now? And if none can give reason, why other things should not have as great attractive force as these, why should it not be a greater proof of Deity, to be constantly powerful in all and every operation, then to be so but now and then: which is all the proof that miracles have?</p>
               <p>And therefore, as men of riper judgement and experience, would much laugh at the folly and weakness of such, as (beholding the Mariners compass) do ascribe the effect of the Needle to some hidden quality, or secret proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty residing in it self: and as again, the ascribing and occult quality unto those operations of the Load-stone, (without farther knowledge or derivation of its cause), is but a (shift of ignorance, as the setting down of all other hidden cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are; (each thing having a cause beyond it self, so is there none <hi>but fools that say in their hearts,</hi> or really think, <hi>there is no God:</hi> because they cannot discern his efficacy through, and beyond intermediate causes. And they are (at most), but middle witted men: for that, albeit they can (from a little farther experience), tell of Causes above the lowest degree of men, yet are they not wise enough to search farther.</p>
               <p>So that Athiesm is always bordering on folly and narrowness of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension: being nothing else, but a stubborn relyance on present sense: as from the certainty of effects in things we ordinarily behold, concluding those Causes within reach of our observation to be the most supreme. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thinking that if a voluntary Agent were in those things universal Cause
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55976:219"/>
and Author, he would (as fancying his inclination by our own) be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally appearing for his greater credit-sake amongst us: and make his present operation serve to direct our acknowledgements unto him. Not duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that it would be so far from encreasing the worth, as it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the actors disesteem: as arguing decay of the Vertue of Agency, if the supreme and higher Cause, should (for want of strength otherwise), be forced immediately to work on a lower effect: for that, (hereby again) the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Cause ceasing, (by becoming an intermediate one), it must follow, that as Causes were fewer, Effects and Creatures must be fewer also. And when all is done, that supreme Cause that is now intermediate in operation, would by its constancy in so doing, be as far from discovering a Deity, as the other was before: unless they could imagine, that for their onely satisfaction sake, causes of things should not have been constant and uniform, but on purpose various, to have drawn on their notice.</p>
               <p>Again, if God Almighty should have been disabled to the degree of an humane Artificer, and have been ineffectual farther then where his own hand hath been express, (as is the workmans in making the Watch), then it must next follow, that either Creatures must have been so few and perishable, as Watches made by one hand, or else they must have supposed, this Agents power advanced to such degree, that, as a Monarch can manage a Kingdom by his Laws, (so as the same needed not to be afterwards guided by him, but by instruments obedient to him), or as the Artificer can frame and contrive a Watch, to go for as long time as he pleaseth, (so as the same can now go without his appearance) in like manner, there should be also such procession of the first cause of operation and motion in these things, as they shall be infinitely continued. If this course could have gone on, this first Cause would have been a God: because his operation and existence must have been eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. But on it could not go to any degree of eternity; inasmuch as all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive operations and motions must be finite and determinate: in regard that that end and rest, which caused motion through desire of approach, must cease it, having now attained it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to make things continue, there must be a circulation of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Effects allowed: whereby, each individual thing having attained that proper end, (for which its last Cause or next Agents produced it in Nature), must return into its first matter, through corruption and alteration of its last specifick forms; and be ready to obey the more general Causes in Nature, and the Laws of that matter which is most homogenius unto it; in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence to the next more proper and powerful Agent. Even as in the affairs and atchievements in kingdoms, (although the hands of the lowest sort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Officers is most immediate in the work, yet these, having their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the next general Officer, and so he again from next above him, till these Officers (growing higher and fewer), do at last terminate in the King, as Fountain of all their power; so,) any of those next perishable individual Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers deceasing, that formal power that made them such, returns to the hands of those next Officers above him: who constitutes others, and those more or fewer in these places, as they finde the exigence of that Kingdoms affairs call for in relation thereunto: no otherwise then as (with us), a Constable dying, the Justices (as the more general Officers), do by vertue of their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and derived power, constitute new in the place. In which course, as the affairs of the Kingdom, is ordinarily managed without the Prince his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55976:219"/>
or again, the spring can move the several wheels of the Watch, without particular touch of any but that next him; why may there not, nay why must there not be a Deity; to be the first mover in things of this universe? Who, (according to his good pleasure), ordering that the appointed continuance of this world, should be maintained by perishable individuals, hath in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (to that end) ordered that the corruption of one thing, should be still progressive to the generation of another. Why may he not again (in the doing thereof), be yet as far, or more removed from our notice in ordinary operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the cause of Government, or the motion of Watches (or the like), is hid and unknown to the weaker sort of people, and to other Creatures below us; and are of them thought to proceed from no farther cause, then what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense can discover?</p>
               <p>For should the King be as much hidden from our bodily sence, as God is, and should we again know no more of the Commissions and powers granted to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices in each Kingdom, then we do of the Laws of matter and internal forms in Nature, it would be as hard to apprehend any prime Agent above those Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Kingdom, as to conceive the power and existence of Deity in the world. A supposition that may be well made good, if consideration be had of those strange conceits of the form and figure of Kings, which are entertained by some ignorant people, that as yet never saw any, nor heard them described. And the reason is the same, for our ignorance in appearance of Gods operation in Creation, Providence, and natural Causes, as is for the ignorance of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, in the knowledge of the Causes of political or artificial produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with us: unless we shall impiously, as well as arrogantly conclude, that we should have knowledge in this life in such perfection, as to see him intuitively: as Angels do now, or as our selves shall do hereafter.</p>
               <p>Of the reason of the present course of Gods proceeding in many particulars both of Creation and Providence, we did speak in the beginning, and other parts of this work: in which we declared the divers sympathies and natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensities wherewith Vegetatives and Inanimates are indued: all of them ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to specifical, and mutual preservation and Providence. We also shewed, how Sensitives were provoked by the affection of pleasure, (naturally implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them, and accompanying things beneficial), to be continually active in pursuance of what was to themselves: and others behoof-ful. We also manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, how rational Creatures (by the affection of love and desire of beneficence, and by the thirst of honor accompanying them as their reward), were provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked also unto the like continual endeavors towards mutual good and preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All of them infallibly concluding that there must be an Author or prime Agent, of such universal concern, and such continual care in constituting and ordering these things, as to be their original Cause, and perpetual guide and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port according to the method of his own good pleasure.</p>
               <p>For should there not be these natural propensions to love and pitty, nay to acts of justice, and of submission therein to others, as to honor Parents and the like, it would come to pass that through that too great thirst of self-seeking heretofore spoken of, and through anger and envy of being crossed therein, no one man would now be left alive: inasmuch as there is no man but is by one or other so much hated as to cause his death to be heartily desired, were not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold hinderances by divine Providence and appointment put in, to keep off ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
               <p>And in this regard, was may also collect another strong proof for Deity and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:55976:220"/>
Providence, from that awful and reverential respect which is by each one born towards Authority. For experience every day tells us, that those very persons that are come to that height of daring, as to challenge and enter the field for a lye, an abuse to their Mistress, or the like, (where, besides the equal hazard of their lives in present, they must have a certain expectation to suffer according to Law, in case they do out-live the other) are yet so kept in order by that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and providential terror by God impressed on his Image of Authority here on earth, as not to have courage to withstand the Attachment of a publike Officer.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, our Discourse formerly, and ordinary reason it self always te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying, that these his works, and the way of Government of them, are such as cannot be bettered; why should we think, Change and Alteration any ways convenient? For if it be an act proper to goodness, wisdom, power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to make things well and good, and afterwards to dispose them so, will not constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy herein, be as commendable to the same goodness, wisdom, and power, in their continuance in that order, as it was for creating and thus stating them? And so, if God had not made and ordered all things so as cannot be bettered, he could not have been God: and if he should not keep them in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whilst they remain the same things, he should not be God neither: wisdom in designation, requiring constancy in prosecution; and irresistible power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the necessary attendant of both.</p>
               <p>And having thus far spoken in defence of the constancy of the course of Nature and Providence, against such as would not believe a God, because <hi>since the Fathers fell asleep, all things are alike till now,</hi> so also, for conviction of such, as from inconstancy and irregularity of the actions in voluntary Agents,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.4.</note> and Gods permission of sin and oppression, would conclude against Deity too, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that divine Aphorism, <hi>because sentence against an evil work is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men, is fully set in them to do evil,</hi> we shall now farther speak. In this saying of the wise man, we may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the two usual grounds that make men lean to Atheism. The first is, in thinking all the acts and works of men evil which they cannot apprehend as good: not being many times able, to look through the mistaken or present par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular suffering of some few, unto that real and more lasting good, thereby procured to many. The other, in thinking that the acts permitted unto, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from humane Judgement and Will, (as it is seated in divers persons for the guidance of their own affairs), should be alike constant to those of God, in the Government of the world and course of his Providence; who hath an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform end to cause steadiness of his actions therein. Unto which an answer may be also made, out of the same consideration before spoken of: namely, the sufficiency of the one above the other. And if they wil allow any Creature to be so perfect, as to have Will and Understanding separate, they must in order to their specifical freedom of Will, allow them variety of actions also: especially, since their private ends must differ, as before noted.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as we must conclude Gods works must be uniform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, in reference to his Unity of Will and end to design, and all-sufficiency of power to atchieve; so, we must allow to things submitted to the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior voluntary Agents, (if at all you will grant them voluntary), freedom unto variety of productions and execution: and that in bad, as well as in good. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we shall at once, and against sense conclude, all men are alike good, wise, or powerful: and that, from such plurality and disparity of Judgement, Interest,

and Will, we should think that constant procession could be expected.</p>
               <p>From which liberty and freedom of action, in good or bad, guided according to the true light or corruption of humane judgement and Will, it must also follow that the evidences and directions given for mens guidance, should not be in such continuing and pressing manner repeated to each single person as that by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory conviction to good, his liberty to ill should, (as heretofore noted) by consequence be debarred. But that God should be as mysterious and reserved in the dispensation of his Providence in Nature, as in his Precepts in Scripture. It is enough, that there is <hi>Moses and the Prophets,</hi> such sufficient revelation alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given to all men in general, as to save any one in particular: when as a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous extraordinary defeat, or conviction of every evil action, like one risen from the dead, destroys not onely mans liberty, but will look like partiality: yielding hereby, greater light to direct evil persons, then was before given to good ones. And, to instance in that which yet comes neerer our present business, (for the conviction of the demi-Athiest of the world, (such as oppose God, in that God he hath placed over us) if there should in all such Enterprises new Advertizements from Heaven be given, to prevent, or always infelicity follow, to deter, then could no such things as Loyalty and Rebellion have been existent. Whereas now, God permitting the stubborn and obdurate hearted sometimes to prosper in that evil, as he thereby leaves us to our freedoms, so yet, by means of those many Precepts against it, and examples of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he leaves us unexcusable for all our attempts therein: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding success may for a time attend this, as well as it doth other sins.</p>
               <p>Which success, we may well conjecture also tolerated for a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as well to subjects Rebellion, which on their parts caused it, by having the <hi>woe of many Princes,</hi> as also for a common punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to other Princes and Monarchs themselves: who, out of their greater hatred and malice to one another, and covetous desire of gain, have suffered these common disturbers and enemies to them all, thus to settle and prosper, divine permission ordering those things in such sort, that we may well believe, that, as an adequate punishment for these faults on both sides, these lesser Antichrists shall, like the great one before noted, continue in the World <hi>till Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in brightness also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as the essential freedom of Will must produce variety of actions, so must the privacy thereof and of its inclination and aym in atchieving them, cause or endanger such mens mistake, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to judge and censure them, either to good or bad. And the like must also happen through ignorance of Circumstances accompanying the acts themselves; and also through ignorance of former merit or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit in the parties now prosperous or unsuccessful: all which may alter the state of the present event, from what we now see and apprehend to be called just, or otherwise.</p>
               <p>Besides, since the best of humane actions cannot be in full degree perfect, if, evil ones had not been permitted, all would have been not onely naught comparatively, as being much beneath the perfection of God or Angels, but naught also in the highest degree; as having none
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55976:221"/>
worse. Whereupon, Gods justice against sin might have lighten upon whole mankinde, as equally evil and guilty, and the work of mercy in saving some, could not, for want of disparity, take effect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality: whereas now, by his fixed rule of Providence, he hath so bounded the power of the most wicked as they cannot make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in this life to any great height. And this, because the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and appetites of Food and Generation, the natural affection of <hi>Storge,</hi> pitty, and sense of honor, will be so perpetually prevalent to the advance and preservation of specifical and personal being, that the most malicious and tyrannical Athiests cannot make any contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, or have any certainty to be generally prevalent to destroy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but they shall (withal) thereby injure themselves here, besides most assured destruction (by this means) brought to themselves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. At which time, the good shall also have their reward: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unreasonable, that that sentence and reward which must have respect to the actions of mens whole life, should be expected until after it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as to the other part of the wise mans Reason given for entertainment of Athiesm and wickedness amongst men, namely Gods forbearance <hi>to execute sentence speedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y against and evel work,</hi> as the forepassed reasons may in part satisfie why he should so do, so is there a farther ground thereof. Which is, our inconsiderate measuring Gods time and motives in execution of Justice to be the same with ours; and according to our own present sense thereof. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, when any thing is done against our Commands or Authority, we should our selves be presently and personally shewing our mislike, and proceed to correction or reproof, even so we may imagine God should do also: not duly weighing those differences between him and us that might justly make alteration herein.</p>
               <p>As first, we our selves, being personally and more immediately affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the injuries which are wrought unto us, must, out of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral desire and delight in acts of revenge, needs be more personally and presently pressing to self-repairation: and that, without thought of the prejudices of others to arise thereby. Whereas God Almighty, being not patible himself, nor otherwise to be prejudiced then by those harms done to others of his Creatures, and that disturbance which our sins do cause in the course of his Providence, cannot be imagined to be so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened in the course of his punishments, as thereby to cause a greater and more general harm to ensue: but, as he doth punish but in order to universal care and Providence, so, to contrive and watch such means and opportunity for doing it, as may best advance the general good of all. Again, unto us that have but an uncertain and momentary time of abidance in this world, it must therefore seem necessary that we should be always as speedy as we can in execution of all acts of Justice, for fear it will not be after in our power here, and knowing it will not be at all in our power hereafter: whereas these hazards, being not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with Gods eternity, both in existence and power, as well in this life as that to come, he cannot thereupon be streightned in time like us. Whereupon, since <hi>a thousand yeers are with him but as one day,</hi>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:55976:221"/>
therefore are we to answer these <hi>scoffers</hi> with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>that which some men count slackness, is not to be attributed to God:</hi> but we are rather grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to admire his <hi>long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And could men but silence or suspend that partial respect and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which each one is ready to cast towards the justice of their own Cause, and also that natural impatience and thirst of present revenge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration which he expects should appear in maintenance of his right, and in vindication of his sufferings, he might then finde great reason why God should not expresly appear in his redress; although his case should be as deplorable, and his usage as injust as himself doth now judge it to be. For since these injust and oppressive acts are usual amongst men; nay since in all kinde of judicature and dealing, one party or another will think himself defrauded or oppressed, if therefore divine Justice should interpose in all cases where wrong were done, it must also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to reparation of the party wronged upon him that did it, to the utter disheartening and defeat of humane Judicature: where, many times, for want of sufficiency of judgement or information, wrong sentence is given against their Wills. Or should God appear but in some more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable occasions of redress, how would their discontent be hereupon increased, who were not in their distresses so righted and relieved also? Each one being to be presumed to carry as partial a valuation of his own merits, and to be as impatient in the sense of his own sufferings, as he must be presumed to be separately persceptible of them by his proper Understanding and sense, and not that of another. It must therefore come to pass that either God Almighty, by his remarkable appearance in some mens Causes, must consequently leave others but so much the more discontented: or else, altering that more majestick way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Government he now exerciseth, descend to judge in every case whatever. Which done, what neerer hope of general content? since even therein the Verdict and Sentence can but pass on one side still, and must thereupon leave the other as it were directly discontented with God himself: and it will besides submit the justice of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to the censure of every one also. Whereas now, the party that by prosperity enjoys the things of this world, is not at all taken off from the acknowledgement of Gods supreme guidance and favour; and the other, laying his misfortunes on humane partiality and corruption, is the more stirred up to seek and relye upon supernatural redress and susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: the sense of affliction and oppression here, being by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence made the most ordinary and effectual means, of any, for the bringing men to be Religious, and to acknowledge both himself and his goodness, as heretofore declared.</p>
               <p>And then again, why may we not, from example in our selves, finde reason (on the other side) to conclude both for Gods existence and Providence; and that, even from this his concealment from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense in this case likewise. For is it not usual with Parents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and persons in Authority, out of design to reap to themselves the highest assurances they can of the loves and faithfulness of their Children and Servants, wholly to leave unto their full dispose the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55976:222"/>
of some Commands and Directions; and then so to withdraw and conceal themselves, as that the parties put in trust herein shall suppose them without the compass of any knowledge of theirs, whether they have in these things done their duties or no? And again, is it not with them usual, as to fix this tryal upon such objects and imployments wherein they had first used such Providence and circumspection that, in case of failance of duty, the evil thereby to happen should neither be general nor great, so also, it is usual not to take notice of the performance or neglect of duty in the present act: but to suspend the reward and punishment thereupon due, to be expressed in a fuller measure afterwards. Even so may we conceive of God Almighty, as, on the one side, trying our love and respect to him through these great obscurities and difficulties, so also, respiting our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments or rewards till the world to come.</p>
               <p>Beyond all which, as that divers necessary regard which humane preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth require should be thereunto continually had with due respect to men as they are either naturally or politickly to be considered, will, in the conduct of these things, lay such an exigence of having both a continual and steady, and yet of a secret and impartial care, so, when it shall be well weighed, it will be found a work proper and superable by Almightiness onely, between things and actions, in themselves so jarring and enterfering, to carry so even and respective a hand to both, that man shall neither be pined through want of care in one, nor suffocated through indulgence in the other.</p>
               <p>Should that natural thirst to pursue and obtain things pleasurable, be unto men permitted, as unto other Sensitive Agents, without any stint of positive Rule or Law, how soon (as heretofore shewed) should we finde this heady pursuit of each ones delight to prove each ones torment and ruine? Or if, again, in all the actions and emergencies of mans life, he should be onely considered as a sociable Agent, and by strict rules of polity, be wholly limited in his desires and attempts by the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not permitted to follow in any thing his own pleasure, must it not then follow, that as each single man did, by this way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, come to be defeated of his separate content, so (consequently) must all men want it: since all must needs want that which no one man could have. And thereupon, that natural way of serving and honoring that great God of all beneficence, must, for want of relish and more fresh resentment of the particulars of his bounty, come to be smothered or lost. As the necessity therefore of having regard to both, is the reason (on the one hand) of all those natural instincts and abilities, and of those large affordments of the Creature for mans use and delight, so (on the other hand) is it the cause of all those positive Edicts and Precepts, whereby, in reference to Society, we come to be directed and bounded in their use.</p>
               <p>When therefore we finde God Almighty, in the general way of sustentation of his Creation, both working at distance, and also by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes, and yet doing it so strongly and assuredly as to manifest both care and Almightiness in him, (through weakness of the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Agent and constancy of operation) so, in rules of Government and Society, and in those ways and directions to be set for mens restraint, it
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55976:222"/>
was (on the other side) likewise expedient, that he should be no more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently and convincingly express, then in the other: but ordinarily, to submit and entrust to his Authorised Deputies, the execution of those affairs which he held necessary for prosecuion of that course &amp; degree of providence which was by him appointed. In the atchievement whereof, as the Prince or Magistrate, without his supreme influence and sustentation, could be no more effectual to preserve mankinde politikely, then second Causes could, of themselves, preserve them naturally, so would it seem partial and destructive for God to appear more express in one then another: as well as it would be a derogation to his Almightiness, to be ordinarily express and personally working in either sort.</p>
               <p>Even as we see, in Kings and Governors, the greatest difficulty to rest in their even carriage between acts of severity or indulgence: in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of positive Laws for preservation of mans life, that, through their abundance or rigor, his happy life be not defeated. And, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then as it rests as the highest proof of each single mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ability, to carry himself in such a just and seasonable moderation between <hi>Epicurism</hi> and <hi>Stoicism,</hi> between natural enjoyment and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous restraint, that neither the vigor of youth may be suffered to defeat its own or after pleasures by intemperate abuse, nor the too great care for enjoyment hereafter, not onely needlesly deprive him of present possession, but render him unfit for delight for the future, like him that hath lost his stomack through too long fasting: or like him that hath borrowed beyond ability to repay.</p>
               <p>All which reasons seem to me of so much weight, that I cannot but in humility joyn with that unerring wisdom and truth, in esteeming him <hi>a fool that saith in his heart there is no God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 14.1.

                  <note place="margin">Verse 4. Psal. 94.11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For Religion must be acknowledged the onely thing that can steadily keep loyalty and and all other vertues in perfection. For the terrors of shame and the Law may, through secrecy, power, and corruption of manners be many times wholly defeated of their force of restraint: but, to him that believs the eye of an all-seeing God is perpetually over him, as no severity can be found sufficient to scare him from goodness, so no encouragement can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise valuable to entice him to evil.</p>
               <p>No, no, no certainly, let men boast of their godliness, or of eying or seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God while they will, if they were but so far removed from Atheism as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to believe his power and continual presence over them, those daily acts of disloyalty and uncharitableness would not then be so frequently sounding in our ears. Can we think, that if any one did verily believe, that to resist the higher powers were to receive to himself certain damnation, that he would then adventure his salvation upon such nice grounds and distinctions, as, for any temporal hope or gain, to make doubt of obeying his King as supreme, did not his belief of Gods veracity, and this fear of offending him grow slack, and Ambition, Pride, or Covetousness, (on the other hand) more forcibly

draw him on to perpetrate such actions, as he had stronger belief should yield him a present gain, then was that terror of forbearing them, out of a more remote and less feared punishment to ensue.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, however want of Conscience may make such as these forget God, yet generally, such as have more real thoughts and aims of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good and humane conservation, are, for want of sufficient judgement and insight wherein general and more publike good doth consist, led to the mistake of divine Providence: even when the private sence of the sufferings of themselves or friends, amidst those changes and calamities which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the sons of men, do press them to be impatient for want of present redress. Yet, could we separate our selves from our Passions and interests, why might we not plainly see, that Rebellion, Civil war, and the like ways of humane destruction, were, like Plagues and Famines, many times by God sent and permitted for the general good of men also. For these, naturally and ordinarily happening but unto such places and people that are so crouded with company that the blessings and benefits of Nature cannot, through the envye and strife of neighbors one towards another, be by any one truely and quietly enjoyed, why may we not in this case suppose God, even by way of Providence, to make use of our sins and the punishment of them; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to cut off and take away such as are most haughty and entermedling that the more meek and patient may, through their more free and quiet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have greater cause to praise him then before?</p>
               <p>Nay, why might we not herein perceive him to be most truly and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vindictive also? For since himself, in his good pleasure and secret wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and for reasons heretofore given, had determined not to be personally and expresly intermedling in the present judging and vindication of humane affairs, what cleerer way could there be to argue, both Almightiness, Justice, and Providence, then to make the sins themselves to be the constant punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the offenders? Thus, personally, may we finde that lust, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the other exorbitances which each person entertains contrary to the rules of Vertue or modesty, are to himself prejudicial also. And so, in polity again, disobedience, insurrection, and all disloyal acts, which are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of publike disturbance and Civil war, are, by means of the same Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil war, a certain punishment to the Authors. Wherein, although those that have perhaps had the least share of introducing them, may, for tryal of their Loyalty or Patience, be the greatest sufferers, yet, as none can say but he hath suffered far under his deserts, and may well think themselves happy that in this life their portion of punishments and afflictions have been shared, so are the other, in the life to come, to expect that fuller measure of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which their more full contribution in these violations of Charity may claim from the divine and impartial Justice of that great <hi>presever of men.</hi> In the mean time, because none, as bearing Gods Image, and because of that inward plantation of love, can be without some charitable deeds and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, therefore, as that their <hi>portion</hi> of prosperity which they shall be in this life possessed of, may be understood as a full reward for what hath been by them well done here, so is that measure of happiness they therein have above others, but like the advantage that fatted Oxen have above lean: even while they, in their jollity, are filling up that measure of wickedness, which may provoke divine vengeance, both to deprive them of life here, and also bring them to eternal punishment hereafte.</p>

                  <hi>Thus far have I laboured, in setting forth that perfect harmony which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the voice of Scripture and Reason; and declaring (as far as was to our present purpose necessary) how they do joyntly conspire and point to the same ends, Gods glory and mans good: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>BOOK IV. Of the Causes of LIKE and DISLIKE OF CONTENT &amp; DISCONTENT; AND Whether it be possible to frame a <hi>Government</hi> in it self pleasing and durable, without Force and Constraint.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N many of the Discourses hitherto, Government hath been treated of, as having its rise, and also its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and support, from constraint and force; that is, from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the power of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor upon the Governed; which being the occasion of that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reluctance and resistance in the Subjects, and consequently the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Civil broils; it will not be amiss to enquire what remedy may be herein found, or whether any may be found or no? It may therefore be doubted, since (as before shewed) the love of our selves was only purely natural, how those forraign affections come to hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their rise and being.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, we must again consider, that as Gods praise and glory was the end of all things, and accordingly (as heretofore shewed) the reason why things naturally done should be pleasurable also, to wit, that the Creature thereby exulting as in a benefit received, God might be honored, as having performed the work he intended, even the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55976:227"/>
of his power goodness; so now, men being to live in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (that the honor and praise of all, as his onely due, might therein be increased also, it was expedient that our content should by natural instincts and rules be affixed most to what was most usual amongst us, and our discontent upon such things only as were but few, and of rare event.</p>
               <p>All things do hereupon come to be loved by custom and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For so, I love an English face better then another, and think that worst that most differs. Out of which custom also, doth the Blackmore prefer his colour, flat nose, great lips, &amp;c. to that which is contrary in us. From this reason also, we come to set particular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon some faces; and (although we have forgotten it) to place most affection, and to be soonest taken with the like face unto that of Nurse, Mother, or such we conversed with in our youth. Which inclination and strength of appetite, being by custom made familiar (although by such various and insensible degrees as we did neither heretofore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor do now remember) comes for want of farther knowledge of its original, to be stiled sympathy; and that which is hateful upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reason of disaquaintance, or from some extraordinary composure of our fancy to dislike at the time of its first impression, to be called Antipathy.</p>
               <p>For we must not say, that God made any thing ill favoured or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen; but our oftner sight of the same, then other Creatures, makes us even love their shape better, then of such things as be hiders, and do seldom appear. Not, but that the shapes of Rats, Hedge-hogs, Snakes, Frogs, Owls, Bats, &amp;c. are as good as those of Horses or Dogs; or that the braying of an Ass, is a worse noise then the crowing of a Cock; but the new and unusual presentation of these things to our senses, puts our already settled and composed fancies, to a sudden startle and new la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when we will paint a Devil, or set forth any thing as ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the usual way to do it is by most unusal shapes. But, because nothing can come from the pencil, but what was before in the fancy; nor from fancy, but what came in by sense, we are constrained to make up this deformity by misapplication of members in the intire constitution of a body, together with some unusal figure or colour; all which apart, and in their proper creatures or posture, had been nothing terrible or strange. So that, to put wings to a Beast, or four feet to a Bird, a mans head to a Beasts body, or a Beasts head to a mans, cannot but disaffect. And if any shape hath in it self priority, then mans would have it; and thereupon, the Ape, a creature most like him, would be handsomest, which now, with us, not used to such a shape, is esteemed ugly, upon the same reason that Devils are painted white by Blackmores.</p>
               <p>And as several Species and Shapes come to affect by their own oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appearances one above another, so do they by common resemblance one to another; whereby things most like come by this means to be oftner in presence then things of more proper shapes. Thus Hogs, though we may be more used to the sight of them then Deer, are yet from their different shapes and qualities to that of other four foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creatures in general, esteemed less lovely; upon which ground, Bears appear more ugly then Lyons or Leopards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:55976:227"/>So again, though those women, &amp;c. that are accounted most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, are more rare and few then the ill-favoured; it is to be conceived that they are so only as to the general and whole number of them; but, divide the ill favoured ones into sorts (according to their likeness to one another) and you shall find fewer of any sort of the ill favoured, and greater difference between those sorts (compared one to another) then between handsome faces compared one to another. And with us that use not to go naked, a man is not so comely naked, as adorned with cloathes; which also by custom of wearing, is distinguished into fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and so made pleasant. And those people that cloath not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, have their accustomed decorums of painting, or the like, for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of their shapes and bodies; shewing that custom, and not natural shapes of themselves please us.</p>
               <p>And so farther, although there be more ill then good hands written, yet the best hands are those that come nearest that copy which is in each Country esteemed most perfect of the kind; which must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be more like one another then bad ones; because they maintain method, through evenness of line, and equality of distance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the letters; which bad ones do not; and so come, more or less to disaffect. As we see that those coloured horses which we call pye-bald, are because of strangeness, called and counted ugly: For first, few horses are of these so different colours in their bodies, in such sort placed and mingled, but are usually of one and the same colour, and with like marks. And then again, these Pye balds have as great difference amongst themselves, as they have to the rest. Whereas Spaniels, that are not usually of an entire or like colour and mark, do please in this varity.</p>
               <p>A Tune takes above other confused noises, for that because of the method therein used, we are able to remember and conceive it: But an Outlandish Tune is unpleasant at first to us, and ours to them, as they differ from the usual ayrs of each other. Nor are they, nor any new Tune made pleasant, until by our fancy they are apprehended and made familliar, in such degree, as we are able to conceive the cadences thereof before they are founded. And those fashions and tunes which we ordinarily call new, are but small variations from those generals formerly entertained; and yet please us not at first sight or hearing, so well as afterwards.</p>
               <p>So that Custom frames appetites; and appetite provokes the will to particular applications of good and bad, of like and dislike. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our wills, there is nothing that can be properly called ours; for the desire of property and enjoyment of others things is but in order to that; nay, my very body and the parts thereof, are valued as they are useful to the reaching and fruition of such content as fancy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be enjoyed without them. So that, should I want arms, legs, or any or more parts (not depriving me of life, and so of will) I should yet be I; and those parts reckoned as additional, not essential; even as they are my arms, my legs, &amp;c. and we may properly enough say, my body, my soul; because the will arising from the harmony of both, is not either of them; but the individual is there only, where the unity of direction and application is; whereas in separated
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55976:228"/>
parts, the general Laws of Nature (in corruption, alteration, &amp;c.) take place, and local motion ceaseth, as to proper and intern di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>And from the usefulness of members and organs, comes their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, posture, and symetry to be such and such, each creature and thing being handsomest, that hath that shape which is most usual: Whereas all distortions, pluralities, and defects carry (by their strangeness to us, and difference amongst themselves) a loathing with them.</p>
               <p>But if that will which ariseth from collections in our selves, may be called ours, what shall we think of those affections which we call Innate, as almost all so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts of Creatures to fear Men, Lyons, &amp;c. and Birds to fear Hawks? this only proceeds from the like grounds, namely, from unusualness of shape, deportment, and countenance; and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably entertained according to our conceits of that their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed power to harm us (appearing in those individuals we now see) and not from innate knowledge of any thing truly formidable in the species feared. And hence our first fears are usually bigger or lesser, as the size of the feared thing is. For a Bird in the nest, or which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet saw Bird but its dam, will be then more afraid of a Goose, then of a Hawk. But after it hath observed its dam or others to be scared with the last, and not with the first, it is otherwise. But if a Hawk be brought to hatch a Pidgeon, or harmlesly associate another Bird, these Birds fear not Hawks afterwards. And so, we see creatures that are not used to the sight, nor are able to know that a Wheel-barrow, or other such engines, are not living creatures, stand more scared because of the bigness and strange appearance of these things (which they could not so much as fancy before) then of other living creatures which they are used unto, and which may indeed, and do sometimes really hurt them</p>
               <p>And Creatures fly us not after they have been sometimes conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant amongst us, which we call made tame, even as upon trial of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity, Birds and Beasts come to relish the company of Haws, Lyons, Bears, &amp;c. well enough; but if the first sight or usage of any thing, or if formidable and strange report hath made an extraordinary a version in our fancy, then we carry to that thing a particular hatred a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d dread. And although all sorts of things are at first equally feared, because new born creatures (till they have observed so far as to make difference) must fear and trust every thing alike; yet when experience of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath once passed under the power of any thing, we thereby come to fear other things as they do there-from differ; nor can we forbid our selves (out of natural desire of Safety) to fear all strange things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting a stranger and an enemy the same.</p>
               <p>And however the passion of fear be natural and common to all, as tending to each sensitives preservation; yet, as touching the choice of the particular objects of its dread, custom and prejudice, and not nature nor reason do usually bear sway: for we find that weakest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and women, and children, are most subject to these antipathies and aversions; for as they have least knowledge and observation else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, so as from sense of security from other inductions, to stop them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this particular fear, so they may be observed to be so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastered
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55976:228"/>
by extreamity of this sudden fear even of that very object now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as not at any time too look wistly upon it, or to acquaint their sense therewith; but they still flying it, it must thereupon be kept from ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing familiar; for else we find they are, and may be won by degrees, if they will intend it.</p>
               <p>And, that fear is the beginner of all dislike (and attendant to the first sense of new differing objects) we may conclude from our proneness to star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon sudden occurences; and then most especially, when least resolved against it, or apprehending our selves least secure; and although (in strong and confirmed impressions) the name of hatred and dislike be drowned in the passion of fear: yet these always follow and are where fear is.</p>
               <p>For so experience tells us, that subjects do at first ordinarily contract greater dread and dislike against the Goverment of Kings and Monarchs, then against Polarchies, even because of their greater distance from them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the more near familiarity and converse with the other is a means to abate of their dread. And generally those Laws and Governments are by subjects most disliked, that carry greater strictness against offences: and anger is dislike with courage, as fear is dislike without courage.</p>
               <p>And as this fear may keep us from seeing or conversing with any thing (and so from loving it) so, after things have been loved, a violent or unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected strangeness may dilete (by its difference) all former conception; and consequently induce loathing of the thing; which usually we see come to pass in meats, after surfeits and sickness gotten by them, or in them, or other things upon occasional discourses. And yet have we our proper tastes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (according to our accustomed feedings) we are able to like and relish such things as are of neerness of savour, above what is otherwise. Upon which score again, such subjects that have lived under Monarchy, and upon some insinuation of Tyranny, Oppression, or the like, have been induced to a change thereof, are afterwards, by experience of the benefits and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments received under that Regiment, brought the more strongly to affect it again, and all things that lead, and are like thereunto.</p>
               <p>But some affections seem altogether hereditary, especially such as are proper to the species or sex: in which we must look for custom farther off, to wit, that those portions of the Parents spirits, that now find in the womb fit matter and temperament for action, put themselves into the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of operation, they were before habituated unto: and so producing a like creature, produce also those stronger affections and impressions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all creatures have like natural voyces and gate to the rest of their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: for as the like motion of the generative spirit produceth like shape and posture of parts, so doth the same again continue and adapt them to like motions of limbs and instruments of voyce, they having nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to their appetites to introduce forraign imitation, as men do in their language and gate.</p>
               <p>When Birds build nests, it taketh its first instigation from hence: and also the young ones lying therein till they can fly, learn by sense to do the like for their own broods afterwards: and therefore we may observe, that those birds that soon run when they are hatched, build no nests, or such as have little workmanship. And all birds of a kind build nests alike, whose artifice, and the webs of Spiders, Silk-worms, &amp;c. in all things, beyond necessity, is the procession of custom and fancy. For fancy, to its utmost ability, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55976:229"/>
method; and as long as it can be able to hold on in that (as a thing comprizable) it proceeds with eagerness and delight; but where it cannot be master of method, it undertakes nothing.</p>
               <p>The Pye, Crow, Cucko, and such Birds as have differing noats from the ordinary, have not in our ears the same pleasure as the Nightingal; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling in her several Noats, that which is usual in other particular Birds, differs only in generality of perfection and imitation; and though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per voyces of Pyes, Crows, &amp;c. are as usual to us as those of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, separately and apart considered, yet are they not equally usual to those of the Nightingal, and all other Birds besides of like tone. And Parrats displease in their own singular and unusual tones, but please us when they speak and resemble ours: and then most, when most imitating.</p>
               <p>As for musick, we see little children, not yet acquainted or used to one voyce or tone more then another, as soon stilled and pleased with any other noise, as that which we have reduced into a method, and call harmony: discords and concords take them alike, and a sixth is as pleasant as an eight.</p>
               <p>But now, as pleasure ariseth from custom, so pleasure from continuance and custom, may again decrease, as to the present sense thereof, and become that which we call nature, which is nothing else but custom upon custom: as we find it come to pass in matter of food, aswel in choice of quantity as kind, where custom manytimes so prevails upon appetite, through frequency of admittance, that from thence, more then from sense it self, now decayed, it covets still to acts as formerly, to the great prejudice of health: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the direct profluence and evaporation of the Spirit is its most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way and means of release, and thereupon yields greatest ease and delight: yet is there a delight also arising from that freedom and exitation in motion which they are put into by means of those vapors that arise from the stomack, whereupon it will come to pass, that through custom of being so moved, at such time as the stomack is so filled, they wil be prompting him to the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of feeding through memory &amp; the former pleasures thence arising, until by degrees it pass into such an habitual affection to delight, that the thought of insufficiency, or subsequent harms come to be unconsidered. No otherwise then in Kingdoms, where the benefits arising from Peace and Government it self, or the particular indulgences of Princes, are for the time our sense of want is fresh, and our only guide taken with gratitude and true delight, which when use and necessity are satisfied, and coming to be desired by custom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do afterwards in our desires, both exceed use, and ungratefully and covetously are entertained, as well to our own, as that Kingdoms ruine: Like as rich and great men also, who, from the custom of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousness and freedom of life, are still impetuously pressing to fresh or like enjoyments, even after the loss of their wealth or honor.</p>
               <p>And the like may be also affirmed of pain, grown otherwise by custom of indurance: Prisoners, Millers, and Musicians, distinguish little of dislike or content, in those sents and noises they are habituated unto. And so comes the motion of heart, brain, and bowels to be undiscerned, and the touch of one finger or limb against another, to pass without notice. And yet is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom the relisher of new objects; those smells and those colours, that have greatest affinity to ayr and light, do most please, because these things are perpetually objected to the sense (when any thing is) and are the conveyers of other objects to the senses; but yet the excess and quickness of pleasure and displeasure, arising from particular smells and colours, encreaseth or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55976:229"/>
by usuage and continuance: For children we find at first little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with any particular sort of them; and Dogs, which are creatures of quickest sent, and can best make distinction, do not yet choose or avoid any object or place for the smells sake only, the smels of Roses, Violets, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sweet flowers, pleasing them no better then the various and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering smells of those scarcer plants which we call weeds: And this, for want of customary usage sufficient, whereby to make some sents affect above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for they stand not affected or dis-affected to any smell, as of it self, but as it came into notice, or hath usually accompanied the prevalent appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of food, or resentment of the kind.</p>
               <p>Which hath also great prevalence in men (and things of longer life) both to provoke to particular like and dislike of many objects out of no other rule but what ariseth from these or like customs and inducements; for good smells and tastes in plants, is the resemblance to what we use, and therefore call esculent: but Wormwood, Rue, &amp;c. cannot otherwise affect them, through particular custom as Tobacco doth. In which cases forestalled prejudice prevails no otherwise towards like and dislike, then when by reason other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, we are wont to rate or set forth the praise or dispraise of any person, calling him honest or vertuous whom we love most, and who, by relation or benefit, are nearest unto us, and rating otherwise again, all such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige us, proceeding therein according to proportions and rules of self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and charity only; whereby, out of private regard we impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on persons the names of those vertues, which have their true worth only by generallity of performance.</p>
               <p>For so we are wont to find out abatements, or denials of vertues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to impose or insinuate what odiums or scandals we can on our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and competitioners against the first, because we would give reason and satisfaction why we hate them, against the latter, because we would satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie why we should be preferred before them, in each condition striving to make publique good and concern to cover, and be the same with ours.</p>
               <p>After the same manner, may be observed, that the rank of subjects that is most commending and aiming at Democrates, &amp;c. are such as have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hopes and probabilities to be Governors of others therein: In which case, our inbred pride and stubbornness may through the frequent contemplation of benefit therein to arise, provoke to action as the smell or sight of food may excite and awaken the stomack.</p>
               <p>And as thus in persons, so in actions and things, we strive always to have the like commended to what we have or do, and so on the contrary. For let a vice be cryed out upon, unto which we are subject, and we cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid self-consideration to step in with some excuses and abatements; making it look like vertue, or let any vertue be extolled, of which we are not in practise or ability, we are then as prone with our abatements towards vice.</p>
               <p>As for example, when self-consideration and advantage hath caused us in civil factions and disturbances to choose one side before another, we are then become prejudiced and shut up against all arguments to the contrary: for to discommend our cause, is to discommend us, and we can be no more desirous to be satisfied by others whether we do justly or no, then to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied whether we intend our own benefit or not; for as we are ashmed to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55976:230"/>
confess to seek the latter without regard to the former: So there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but to endeavor so to clear and set forth our practise and intentions to publike utility and justice, that our private aims and endeavors may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in excused or hidden.</p>
               <p>And as smells (as aforesaid) do affect from general agreement with ayr, or resemblance to food, or the like: so also do tastes affect from salt, because from salt they have entrance upon the pallat, and yet hath particular custom prevalence herein, so as to make some things more pleasant then others; and those that are most different, are most offensive to such as have been least accustomed unto them.</p>
               <p>All which is of as great use for the avoiding of pain, as the satiety of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (through long custom) is for procuring new pleasure: For if one thing should have always and alike pleased, we should have had no encouragement to variety, but might have ingratefully past over those many other things by God and Nature afforded for our use: And again, love and hatred, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and shame, pleasure and displeasure, being stated and encreased by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of one another, it is necessary that some things should be occasionally and for a time hateful, dishonorable, and unpleasant; for if all things, as they are alike good in their kinds, were alike lovely and pleasant to us, there would be, for want of choice, want of will; and for want of will, want of action; and such a thing as a rational or sensitive creature there could not be.</p>
               <p>Upon which grounds, and from custom of indurance beforementioned, it comes to passe that Patience, Humility, and other hardships accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience and persecutions, have such efficacy and force; both to the sustaining of afflictions, while present, and also to the relishing of all such enjoyments as the party is possessed of, with higher and more steady delight then those persons can whose custom and expectation hath always run a contrary way: divine providence so guiding these things to general good and content, that since no man could be without crosses, nor the greater part without many of them (through reluctance of the creature, and pride and covetousness of men) therefore it is made come to passe, that all, (at least the greater part of men) are by making a vertuous use of necessity, enabled to raise to themselves pleasure out of what is in it self otherwise, new custom dileting the old.</p>
               <p>Now again, to enquire after the pleasingness of Custom and Method, we will make instance in musick. We find the Scale to be reckoned from one to eight, these notes of unison and diapason, including the method of all the other, do come thereupon within most notice: No otherwise, then the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and angles of knots and borders in gardens do, which maintaing order and method, come more readily and delightfully to be looked upon, then the streight intermediate lines, or the flowers that are inclosed amongst them. Which flowers have usually greater delight, considered apart, then the herbs or other particulars whereof the knot is made; but because they have neither method amongst themselves, nor do share in the Common method, they must so far be defective of beauty: for they can have none but what must arise from separate consideration of Method in their own leaves and colours. As in the stars of the firmament, in which we can comprehend no order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their postures have no affinity with any method usual amongst us: we therefore take in them no delight, but what ariseth from their excellencies
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55976:230"/>
in themselves considered: even so on the contrary, Musick being a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, and consisting in Juncture and Method only, must consequently have the first and eight most lovely, as the borders and foundation of this method: for so the unison and diapason falling out to be Terminators, do come to have the same or like sound to one another, as the meeting of two lines make one angle, which no two of the other notes have, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (according to equal succession of notes in the same Scale) come to be oftner repeated, and (thereby) win more delight: But the second and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth that are farthest from one another, are the worst in the Scale.</p>
               <p>If Musick had gone to ten, as Arithmetick doth, the tenth would then have been a concord to the first, as now the eighth is, and so would also the sixth, if it had ended in that number: Even as a Ring of six or seven bells is as pleasant as that of five or eight, rung either in Peal or Changes: and are more or less delightful, as men are accustomed to hear the like Bells or way of Ringing, which is called understanding them.</p>
               <p>And so might Arithmetick have ended in eight, as Musick doth, or in any other number short, or above ten: so that eight times eight, or twelve times twelve might have been called a hundred; and eight or twelve of them again call one thousand, and so on. For ten is but ten units, and one thousand is but ten times ten unites: so that one and ten fall into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are the foundation and termination of all number; and come oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be repeated, even ten times to one above any other number. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have reckoned from one to ten, you begin from ten again, as you did from one; so that twenty is two times ten, as thirty is three times ten, and so on: Ten still keeping his denomination, not only in order after nine, but in computing of one and thirty, two and thirty, three and thirty, four and thirty, five and thirty, &amp;c.) the number of ten comes to be reckoned ten times to each one of the digits or single number.</p>
               <p>So in the scale of musick, you may suppose the same itteration, although not so apparent, because musick is not so far progressive as Arithmecal numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. For the cipher put to one, makes it ten, although it be stil but the same figure of one; and we properly call the other a cypher, having no value of it self; but (by its numbers) shewing the numbers of tens. So in Musick (which is but numbers played withal) the diapason is an unison with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed cypher, and comes in ascension and descension (according to the usual method of teaching Schollars) to be eight times repeated to any other note. For all Tones are but measures of distance, or difference of rise and fall from the first note: as a third is measured by one between, the fourth by two, and fifth by three notes between the first and him, and so on.</p>
               <p>In which doing, the first note being <hi>Terminas à quo,</hi> and each other note <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> and the <hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> being not computable (as to Method) but from <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> the first or unison comes (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) to be reckoned eight times for once of all the other numbers. As for example, in reckoning <hi>Sol, la, mi,</hi> and then <hi>Sol, mi,</hi> and, <hi>Sol, la, mi, fa,</hi> and then <hi>Sol, fa,</hi> and so on, the first note being itterated severally to each other, comes to be as often mentioned as them all: The like may be observed, on the part of the eight, when you come to descend and go back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Now for the pleasantness of the third and fifth above the fourth and sixth, and for the pleasantness of fourth and sixth above the second and seventh,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:55976:231"/>
we are to consider that as all things please by often presence (where by they become familiar), to this presence and familiarity may be made either by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repetition and succession in the fancy, or by length of abode there; as for example, by the iteration of four footed beasts in my fancy, I come to esteem those sorts handsomest that come nearest to the most agreeing and usual form: So again, by oftner and longer seeing the shape of a man then them all, it may please better, as more seen then their shapes altogether: and so also the barking of Dogs, though a noise singular to that creature, yet it is tollerable by often hearing it, nay it is Musick to Huntsmen that hear it very much: but the howling of Dogs, being in all kinds rare, is unpleasant to all. And so farther, although handsomness and beauty usually move af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, because it is the most usual and uniform feature, yet through fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and often presence, I may come to like better of a face or person dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the general rule, and commonly co-habitation proves a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker; and frequent notice is the most effectual means which lovers can use, even as we see other Creatures made friendly and loving hereby: For two Pidgeons, although at first never so disagreeing, will mate and like one another, being a while enclosed.</p>
               <p>So now (to return to Musick) the second and seventh are but used as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient notes, and have not usually above the eight part of time allowed them for their prolation in the ear and fancy, which the other notes have: for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; from the unison or first term, I cannot make a stop at the next, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so near the first as there wants a note to measure the distance between them; for all harmony being made up of proportion, there will want a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle term to proportionate the extreams. So in <hi>Sol, la, mi, la</hi> is the measure between <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>mi,</hi> and serves but to number withal: Nor can I make such a stand at <hi>la,</hi> from <hi>Sol,</hi> as to make a musical tone, until I come to a note of greater distance: For should I say <hi>Sol, la,</hi> and stop at <hi>la,</hi> as I do at <hi>mi,</hi> when I say, <hi>Sol, la, mi; Sol, mi,</hi> Musick would not be harmony or proportion, but numeration only. So, in descending the Scale again, the note that was seventh to the first, is now second to the eight.</p>
               <p>But then, although in thus scaling of notes, for teaching of young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, we use but one sort of time to all of them, yet when we come to make such Musick as we call Tunes, we must use difference of time, and make the greatest stops at the most methodical and useful notes, which by this means will also farther come to be most pleasant. And as a second is the Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator between the first and third, so is the fourth between the third and fifth; unto which third, the fifth is a third also, and the fourth is a second, but the fourth is as much a better note then the second, as the unison or diapason are better then the third: for goodness being but by comparison, as the second is more ill then the fourth or sixth, so is the first or eight better then the third or fifth. If a seventh should be a concord, as being a third to the fifth, then would there want a discord to set off other notes, and the eighth would be imperfect by wanting his discord: For these seconds are never used, but (by time and way of quaver) as slides and passes to eights. A fifth hath priority of a third, as having more proportions in it, and (being more distant) hath less debasement from the unison or eight.</p>
               <p>All which we have spoken more largely concerning Musick, to shew how (in respect to Method and Harmony) some notes must be oftner used then others; and how in regard of this usuage, and the longer stay upon such
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55976:231"/>
notes) they come to be more pleasant: And again, for that Musick (being a thing disputable how its pleasure should arise, might by being thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed upon) serve to illustrate other things. For from hence we may ground the chief reason why we come to be so wedded unto those customs and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions we have been bred in and used unto, especially in matters of Religion, which (having little proof from sense) relies chiefly on this course of preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, namely to affect by inculcation of Doctrines and Tenets, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Sermons and Preaching makes good: for thus God himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first and last in Religion, is as the unison and diapason, terminating all things; and as in Musick, the sweetness of those notes above others, ariseth from their longer continuance and oftner repetition: So in Religion, the more we press, and oftner we mention Gods Glory, Gods Worship, Gods Commands, &amp;c. that which we utter besides is the more acceptable, even as those things are in value above others, and that especially, if compared to any thing in our selves; whereby God appearing so much above us, our perfections appear so much worse as his is better.</p>
               <p>And this is wel known to undertakers for Church Reformation, first to cast into Gods Service, Gods Glory, &amp;c. all that they would have acted in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of their own designs, then to put such Laws and Customs as oppose them on the score of Humane Inventions, that so by the answerable dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in goodness (as between an eight and second) all that they like not may be disliked of others also. But then again, if an eight should be always stricken (without other variety) it would cease to please: So, to say nothing but Gods Service, Gods Glory, &amp;c. would not make a harmony to please above the degree of children: and therefore Faith, Charity, and the like, are taken in, as thirds and fifths; according as their usage and esteem hath made them preferrable in each Country and Sect: For where <hi>Solisidians</hi> are, there Faith is the fifth, or best note, and Love and Charity is made the worser; and on the other side, where Charity is rightly understood, it is made chief as the end of the other.</p>
               <p>And as for the other duties of Humility, Prayer, Repentance, Zeal, &amp;c. they are placed in the composure of the harmony of each Religion, as they have different esteem in the Authors thereof: Whereupon, as the tunes of our Country please us beyond others, so that form of expressing our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which custom hath wedded us unto: but as we may fancy other tunes by degrees, so other forms that have their differences at first small: Nay, we ordinarily have a natural itch to variety; and it may be observed, that as the the same tune always played, causeth weariness: so, to such as cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the true reason of things that Religion soonest cloyeth, whose exercise or doctrine hath least variety and most confinement, and therefore set forms displease ordinary capacities, as grave set set musick to those that are unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the art, pleaseth not so much as a Jig.</p>
               <p>And as Musick being an abstracted Method is not examinable by any thing but the ear it self: So in Religion, the farther you sequester your self from Charity, so much the more you confine its grounds to custom and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for if it be placed all in the ear (as Musick is) then (being only a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual method) it will follow, that that method we apprehend best (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that Religion we are most used unto) will without more ado please most; and thereupon each person must be rendred an uncontrollable judge therein: but so far as Love and Charity shall be taken in, this (being opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55976:232"/>
will make it fall within notice of other senses, and so become exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by other method: For Charity having its ground in Reason and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as it is made to stand in harmony with them) it may serve to justifie or condemn Religions, as the goodness of the tree may be judged by its fruits.</p>
               <p>To enquire into the reason of Comprehension and Method a little farther, we are to conceive that the brain in each man being the common sense to discover what is of benefit or damage, hath the Nerves as so many Scouts and Centinels for information: Now as any thing is by these apprehended, some impression is made in the soft substance of the brain. This at first coming must make an unusal dislocation and posture therein, and so displease within, no otherwise then distortion of any member doth displease without. And knowledge and comprehension is nothing else but the ready turning and cession of the brain to such figures as are offered: and reasoning and discourse is succession of configuration, according to such Concomitants and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances as have accompanied it; which now more or less readily appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and answering, as they were formerly oftener seen or fancied therewith, come thereupon to be esteemed more or less reason.</p>
               <p>But all new ojects must for a time displease, according to their strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for that this common sensory, being thus wholly imployed, and as it were, imprisoned and confined in apprehending and configuring this new guest, hath not time to watch and attend other informations, that might be by sense offered to it at the same time. For so we find, that in great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mind, and when our fancies are intent on the contrivance of things more eminently pressing, we are heedless of what else is presented unto us: And hence it is that two things at once cannot be studied on, if they be so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as not comprisable in the same method.</p>
               <p>Pain is more external, and differs from this inward offence; being the stoppage of Spirits in their methodical motions in the parts of the body; whereby, being hindred from recourse to their fountain the brain, the place that obstructs them will (through their irregular motion therein) find pain; and pleasure is, when these spirits are excited in motion or evacuation with their proper humor.</p>
               <p>When any violent or unusal posture is offered to the Nerves, diffused in the senses and exterior parts, the brain is sensible through them, no otherwise then the Spider is of any thing that toucheth any part of her web; in which, every forraign touch makes her sensible, by altering the posture of those threds unto which she is joyned. For as the Spider sitting upon the Center and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oition of her work with her body, and having her legs extended to the several Angles thereof is hereby made preceptible of those touches and impressions which forraign bodies do make upon it; even so the brain, by those his long legs of nerves, every where dispersed through the body, may be conceived to be much more sensible of those several forms of twitching and convulsion made in its membranes, by the like impression made upon its nerves by any forraign touch. And as by degrees, and many tryals from our infancy, our senses are enabled to conform themselves unto outward fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and objects: so is the brain also by degrees brought to receive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain those: and doth as easily fall into the like posture or figure, when those objects shall be raised in the fancy which did usually accompany them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:55976:232"/>If there be alteration in the body of the brain it self (without forraign touch of feeling) it is not then called pain, but horror, confusion, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the like. For the Spirits (used to watch in the senses themselves without) are now here extraordinarily imployed in putting this new object into method, whereby it may be capable of memory and use, and do thereupon for a time make disturbance, as in a Crowd.</p>
               <p>So that Pain and Pleasure are properly only in touch or sense of feeling: the objects of other senses being by them immediately let into the brain (as having the nerves that serve them more contiguous to his substance) they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not pleasure and pain to it, as directly from themselves, nor are capable thereof, as senses, but as outward parts and organs, to be affected by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign touch.</p>
               <p>Now health is negative to sickness, as pleasure is (for the most part) but absence of pain; and is when each individual body hath its humours enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wonted proportion, seats, and motions, according to the proper constitution thereof, so as the spirits may not be inwardly stopped to make us inwardly sensible, as pain makes us outwardly. But sicknesse affects more generally, because the obstruction being in common passages of all parts of the body, the sense thereof must be more universal then in pain, where a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle nerve it may be, is only affected. But then again, pain is more quick, as more intire and unite. For in sickness (till it be mortal) there is not a total stoppage, because the bowels and other passages have some recourse left them to the stomack, &amp;c. and thereupon those nerves that attend them can be but in part stopped. But usually sicknesse hath some pain, as having some part or passage more obstructed then another.</p>
               <p>When I see a heavy thing tend downwards, it is a motion so conformable to all other, that (as a thing whose operation and concernment is al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eady fully known) it is passed over with content of security and mastery: But the operation of the Loadstone, seeming proper to it self, distracts and puzzles us for want of ability to conceive (and consequently) to apply it to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and use. For knowledge refers to use, as truth doth to goodness; for from the observation of the motions and operations of Loadstones, men apply them to nautical, and some other uses. And <hi>Bonum</hi> differs from <hi>Verum</hi> but in application, things being true as they are real, and good as they are modal: Whereby, that which at first had entity and existence by Creation, in respect of those affections, and that serviceableness it carries to other things, comes afterwards in the rule of Providence to be held as good. And my will differs from my understanding as knowledge abstracted doth, from that which hath reference to me and my use. And it is as natural for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to affect truth and enquiry, as it is for the will to affect good, and the exercise thereof. And therefore as I may want personal liberty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my will, so may I want liberty in my understanding, when I want Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to conceive, or variety (suitable thereunto) for making farther disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, being then subject to be lead by the judgement of others, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greatest thraldom of any. But the want of this I cannot know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the want and the wanter are all one, but experience will inform in the other.</p>
               <p>So now we may call Method an Art proper to every fancy, of registring its own particular observations in a kind of total. For after that I have, from
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55976:233"/>
induction, observed, that every single man is more rational then other creatures, I conclude also; thereby differencing men from other things. And when again, I come to observe that he agrees with them in the search of things pleasurable, I then conclude this done as out of some principle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all, wherein they must agree as Sensitives. For as knowledge or memory precedes, being the observation of things in particular, so method succeeds in collecting these particulars, and placing them in totals with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of the same kind, and agreeing in properties. And when fancy hath an object not so placed already, or comprisable in some rank or classis of our entertained method, it is troubled. For if it be a thing altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, so as I cannot discover between the homogenial and heterogenial properties thereof, or if those properties are not reducable into some classis of comprehension of that Method I have already framed, what use or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure can I make thereof? and all those Arts and Sciences we have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are but methodical collections of those distinguishable inclinations, effects and properties of men, creatures and things, which Authors have made and agreed upon, and are true or false as they are more or less compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, and exactly discussive of all those particulars they undertake. In which course of proceeding, the subject is usually considered as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to pleasure and benefit. And those Arts and Sciences that seem most speculative, have yet (through Method) pleasure in speculation: but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally knowledge and enquiry look to good, as mony doth to commodity; that is, although it be not pleasurable in it self, yet is the general ready thing for procuring what is so, humane benefit being the end of the Art it self, and private gain or honor of the Artist.</p>
               <p>Now as all men have aims, and those higher or lower, according to their way of breeding, so have they their proper Method and means for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing them answerable to their understandings. And although the true aims of great men, in respect of honor and generosity, may not be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the vulgar, yet the greatness it self, and the advantages thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessarily always observed by them. Hence it comes to pass that their conceptions are still running along, to fancy their method and aim to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own. Thus children that for want of engagement and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are not yet able to apprehend the true benefit or value of riches or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or to conceive upon what inducements men are led to most of their actions, must also want method and understanding in themselves to approve and like of what they do, for play and liberty being their end, and having fancied other things as they stood in order thereunto, they cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to bend their studies to the attaining of food or apparel: because they always found these things ready; when as being debarred in the other, it caused them to use contrivance therein. And therefore they are not able to conceive that their Parents should be put to such labour and study in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their maintenance; but do think that in these acquisitions, and in their commerce with other men, they are but following their own liberty and pastimes, as themselves do with their play-fellows.</p>
               <p>And so again, the vulgar sort of men, having only riches and some other more sensual enjoyments in their aims, and having also another and more short way of getting those things amongst themselves, must needs be as much at a loss and mistake in their censures, when they come to look into the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of great men or their Governors. For being themselves neither able to
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55976:233"/>
fancy the way and difficulty of getting this greatness, or of protecting them therewith; nor the true end and use of this power (more then children do apprehend the difficulty and cost of their breeding and maintenance) they are ready, according to those conceits within themselves, to think that these things came by their good fortune, and were accordingly no otherwise use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then to enable them to live splendidly and deliciously, and to exercise arbitrary power in extolling or abasing some few as they saw good: because, if themselves were in like condition, their aims should not be other then the reward or punishment of friends or enemies. And if at any time they be brought into some speculation of the means of entrance, &amp; end of this power; this, as being a thing altogether beyond their own comprehension, they must be supposed as well implicitely following those methods which ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious heads have put upon them herein, as also delightfully and eagerly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; even for that the method and satisfaction which they now find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, must needs fill them with the belief of so much knowledge, as to think they have arrived at the top thereof. And therefore being not able, for want of sufficient observation and insight into Divine or Political matters, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the true ground and reason of things, they presently judge all those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are not agreeable to those rules of scripture, of pacton, of consent, or the like, which they find interpreted and scholied by their guides, to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious and unjust. The which also is much helped on, aswell out of desire to avoid the shame of being ignorant, as out of vain-glory to appear wise and knowing in things of such difficulty.</p>
               <p>And this peremptoriness of opinion and judgement is most incident to our first inlet into these discoveries. For then it is to be supposed that we are most swayed with delight of these new speculations, and do also most want time to examine whether the particulars we now apprehend are every way agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and comprehensive of those things we undertake to judge, or no: or else that we are not carried on by our own partialities and interests, so as to judge that Person a Tyrant, an Usurper, or the like, whom we have no interest in, nor hope of: but by our partial (that is to say, our short and weak Methods and Collections) we are subject to proceed too hastily to the liking or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of a Government or Governor, upon the like sudden apprehension as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did of S. <hi>Paul</hi>: who must one while be no better then a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> &amp; presently again concluded for no less then <hi>a god,</hi> from single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications and accidents, and such as had no coherence with that which they would apply them unto. Upon which ground it may be observed, that Princes and great men are by vulgar judgements never permitted to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a middle censure: they are still extreamly good, or extreamly bad. For being by some sudden accident brought to alter that conceit they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entertained as suddenly and ungroundedly of his vertues or vices, it is no wonder if they hereupon become as hasty and extream in their censures of him this way, as they did the other way. For it being to be supposed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unto man to affect farther discovery and knowledge, it comes therefore to pass that the delight in contemplation and prosecution of what is now in view, keeps him for the time inconsiderate of what more may be had, and so it must consequently leave the weak and empty comprehension as full and peremptory (as to its self and its own satisfaction) as he that hath more and better ground to go upon.</p>
               <p>The which we find verified upon mens first undertaking to read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Scripture: the many examples there found of Gods miraculous
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55976:234"/>
attestation and reward of some such as have been eminent for goodness and piety, presently raises in us a conceit of our own deserts herein also; and men are usually thereupon ready to fancy and expect (even to a degree of temptation) that God should in some like manner appear in the honoring and acknowledging of them. And, upon a contrary rule again, finding many examples therein of Gods displeasure and punishment of men for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, injustice, and other notorious wickedness, they are as ready, out of the conceit of their own wrong suffering and subjection at the hand of their own Enemies or Superiors, to make a paralel of the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and think that neither Patience nor Obedience is on their part due, to these so apparent enemies to God and goodness, as their prejudice and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth now judge to these so apparent enemies to God and goodness, as their prejudice and ignorance doth now judge them to be.</p>
               <p>The which is most especially instigated from the example and insinuations of persons of greater repute for learning or judgement then themselves; who having many times ambitious or factious aims, are ready (as we said) to cast before them such forms of examination as shall be sure to leave a dislike in them towards the actions and commands of their Superiors, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intice them to siding with them: which must prevail, because they are so far defective of observation and experience of their own, and consequently entice them to siding with them, which must prevail, because they are so far defective of observation and experience of their own, as to find and frame just Methods to themselves, and so to examine how far these and other particulars are, or are not agreeable and comprisable within the true rules and limits of Religion and Polity.</p>
               <p>And of these kinds of deceits, taken up upon too easie examination and credulity, I can speak more confidently, having had so great experience of them in my self, and that in both kinds. For I believe that no man was more averse to Episcopacy, and Church Orders and Ceremonies, and such like, then my self in my youth, and while I continued to converse with such only as had these things in detestation; and all because the method of examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was then put into me for to try cases of this kind by, (as to their approach to evil) was to search whether Papist used them or no. So that I, not having then knowledge or experience enough to examine how those things stood grounded in themselves, or to understand that Papists, even as they were Christians, could not choose but be in the right in somethings, was thereupon in danger to abandon some Christian truths and duties, because I found them within my rule of dislike, as being acted and believed by Papists.</p>
               <p>Being once prepossessed with these and such like short Rules and Methods of distinction and adjudication, I was quickly tainted also with the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical humour of judging for my self, and those of my belief, against such as differed, thinking that all that were not as invective against the thing called Popery (which truly for a good while I understood not) and as conversant in Sermons, and some select phrases and demeanors, were (notwithstanding their unblamable lives otherwise, and that according to Christian faith) to be esteemed but bare moral men. Their outstripping me in the real duties of general love and beneficence to men, and in the rendring God more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable by their publike and more solemn adoration and acknowledgement of him before men, were not, as I thought arguments comparable to prove them of the number of the godly and Saints, as were those Rules of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I had framed to my self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:55976:234"/>And so again, in matter of Government and Political speculation, none more pleased and taken then my self, with all those fine Maxims and Rules of Examination, which, in the beginning of our unhappy troubles, were set on foot for tryal and control of the actions of Princes. My thought I was now much elevated in my rank and ability, being enabled to give a just censure of all that was done by one so much above me, and whom I had ignorantly hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thought should have guided me. When he acted in Civil matters, the Law of the Land was to be his bound and director; and when in affairs of Religion, the Scripture. If I had staid there it had been well. No, as I was told that it was not fit that Kings should be unlimitted and arbitrary in their rule; So also, that his single judgement or conscience were not to be trusted herein neither, therefore I did next fancy, that the Judges were to determine the meaning of the Law, and the Divines of Scriptures. In which I was not yet so far out of the way, but what a few caveats might set right. But I proceeded farther still in pressing onwards, that I at last thought none to be trusted in these high powers but the people themselves: The Judges and Divines, alas, they might be corrupted, but a community could not wrong it self. And therefore, over all, as the Paramont Power, I conceived there was to be a Parliament, to give final determination, and see execution done.</p>
               <p>This at first I thought to import the King in Parliament; afterwards I was lead to believe it was the King and Parliament; afterwards it came to be the two houses of Parliament which were apprehended to be the Supreme Authority. And as the pleasing speculations of paction and derived power from the people did generally take &amp; encrease, so came the lower house to be the upper house, &amp; afterwards the sole house of Parliament; as being thought the peoples only true Representors. So that, at last, a King beset with all these limitations, did look like a Duck in a Garden, brought to eat up the Snailes and Worms, and then tied up by the leg, for fear of trampling over the flowers, or meuting in the Walks. But the examples of inconveniences arising from Kings exorbitant use of Power (by their strong and fresh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression) making me on the sudden heedless, how by bridling his Power to do ill, I did also take away the power of doing good: and then also there having been no president in stories of a perpetual or unlimitted Parliament, and consequently of any evil thence arising, I came to be so taken up with the apprehension of the good they might do, according to that power they had anciently practised, that I did not then consider withal (I mean for a great while I did not) that if one man, that did acknowledge himself subject to Law, could by his power do so much mischief, what then might be feared where a multitude shall joyn in a mischief, who shall say they are above Law.</p>
               <p>But it fareth with men in entertaining those narrow Schems for compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of any thing, as it doth in making knots and plats for Gardens or Building, which each one at the time of doing, will think done after the best manner, because done according to advisement of workmen or the like, and according to that stock of materials he then knew of, or stood furnished with: But when he shall make observation farther, and find both other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and other methods more fit and capable of their receit, he will then alter his own method of adjudication also: For it is to be conceived that in this course of methodising, our fancy carrieth the form of a Pyramid,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55976:235"/>
wherein the particulars observable in nature make the Basis; which lessens towards the top, as the particulars unite and agree in such generals as we may call notions. But then, as these notions come to be imployed and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive approbation from experience, they are again, for ready ease and use, collected into other totals called affections; which, having obtained settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the harmony of experiments, come to guide us in what we do without reference back to particulars, more then he that can now read should be put to make use of spelling.</p>
               <p>For so, Beauty, Honor, &amp;c. have place in my desire, but the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars out of which I did at first come to the general liking of them, are out of my memory; nor indeed could their variety and repetition be remembred, being the observation of my whole life, of the common rate and esteem of these things by others; which could never serve us for use and proficience in knowledge, unless we did proceed to this way of abreviation. For particulars, whilst they are remarkable, are the objects of memory, but after they are made familiar by instances of the like kind, they are amassed altogether, and pass into notions and affections. Unto the constitution of which notions, as each sense carrieth his part, so are they soveraigns in their own order; that is, where they are not in particular objects dependent upon one another, there their inductions pass as peremptorily and uncontroulably into affections one as another.</p>
               <p>Even as we formerly noted in Religion, and the Opinions and Doctrines thence derived, which (having not Charity for their object, but depending on the ear only) come (through often repetition and commendation) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and pass into affections and sciences, upon the same grounds that (by sight) this or that Figure, Fashion or Face comes to please. And so it is in the particular smells and tastes we are accustomed unto; wherein (former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions growing too numerous for memory of particulars) custom is (then) uncontrolable, and begets affections and science in inductions proceeding from them, as observations from sight breed affections in things objected unto it.</p>
               <p>In this way of discovering causes by various coincidence of effects, and of common causes to them again, according to their concurrence, until we come to the prime cause of all things, Gods glory, we seem to reintegrate our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and comprehension, as if received from the fountain by intuition. For hereby, if rightly proceeded in, we are able to judge of all things within the verge of humane sense, even as taught by themselves. And as we learn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, so we judge and discourse downwards; that is, from general notions to particulars.</p>
               <p>We will (for better instance and application in these things) look more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into our learning it self, and the labour therein used. We that read now (having forgot the difficulties that attended us in our learning thereof) do wonder at the backwardness of others: First, in distinguishing letters one from another, then in knowing and distinguishing their several values and pronounciations: then, having understood their agreements and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongst themselves, how to collect, apply, and place them in sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: Then how (in like manner) to make of these syllables, words; and of these words again, to frame sentences or notions. And lastly, how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and judge of these sentences, as they shall seem consonant and proper to those several artificial methods by me entertained already, which we call
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55976:235"/>
Affections; which having good for their object, do accordingly relish and transmit things to the common affection, the will, to determine how it stands in interest with other affections, and also to have the approbation of the understanding whether it be attainable or no, For will disputes not whether the affections propound what is good (that is to say, pleasant) or no, but whether this pleasure be so continuing and attainable as to make it good.</p>
               <p>But it is to be considered, that the fancy doth differently imploy itself in the methodising of particulars towards the constitution of affections and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, over it doth in methodising and retaining such other particulars which are to be imployed by way of Discourse and Reason. In the first way, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are amassed according to their genus, and so, from a broad foot or basis (as we said) do agree and point in streight lines towards the constitution of some affection in us. The which affection, being that which provokes us to delight and action, doth, as the end, by degrees instigate the fancy, and fit it self therein with a proper method of comprehension, how, amongst all the other observations made and collected, things may be so chosen and so ordered and placed, as to be instrumental and serviceable to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this end. So far as impressions are topically, figurately and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly retained, they have still reference to the objects, and do penetrate the brain only, being used but as instruments and servants to the attaining of that which each affection doth prompt to the enjoyment of: For each af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and appetite hath its proper method of judication and acquisition, as it had its own method and way of amassing from particulars, whilst it was making its inward impression and resentment in the heart; which is now its seat, from whence the brain is set on work as a Minister to produce figures conformable when an object of import is presented. Each affection rangeth particular objects in her method, as the Gardener doth flowers in his knots and borders, even as they are accounted prisable and delightful.</p>
               <p>However, we have used the terms of fancy and method severally, yet they are the same; being the orderly collection and configurations of particulars in the brain, contrived for the use of each affection. And so again, we may conceive memory and imagination to be the same, being the impresses and representations of particular objects and figures, whereby the often or seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observation of them, as presented to the sense from without, doth cause us to imagine we still see, hear, &amp;c. them in the same manner and form within.</p>
               <p>And as affections did at first arise from particular outward objects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing them according to experience of the pleasure accompanying them: so also do they take encrease from the methodical application of objects as a means to this end. And thereupon also, as figures were first impressed from particular and more distinct objects, and did thereupon by degrees come to the comprised in Methods and Configurations amongst themselves: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do they unite and become serviceable towards the constitution of other, or new Methods: Even as the several persons, ranged in a Scene or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask, may be comprehended under one figure: or as the several hounds in hunting may be considered as one pack, or their several barkings taken as one cry. Whereby also, through use, that which was at first cast into this method for the use of other affections, may become an affection by it self. For it is to be supposed that the same figures &amp; impressions of the brain may stand diversely considerable and affecting us, as they have already passed into
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55976:236"/>
affections by their use, or else are no farther pleasurable, then what the now use and application of them in some methodical course must afford, towards the service of some affection. In one sort they are considered as true; in the other as good. The figure of a letter is a different thing from its value, the which continues the same as to its use in making of words, although the letter it self may be figured in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse character, and those words and sentences made of them, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently considered in the spelling and pronounciation, over they are in their signification and import.</p>
               <p>As affections do come to be thus bred in us from outward objects, and also by degrees to encrease in strength, so there is more reason for will to follow the guidance of affections, so bred in estimating good and bad, then is for it to follow authority; for the inductions framed by my self are the observations of mine own sense; but my grounding on the discourses of others, is grounding on their senses, which is not farther prevalent, then corresponding with mine own. And inductions from Authority, move as other inductions by uniformity and consent, and that according to such paterns of truth as are fore-conceived; else a single Authority, by joynture of my former affections and inductions may prevail in my acceptance, as over-numbring the contradictors. Like as we may find in particular it fareth with the weaker and more credulous sort in matters of belief; unto whom (as not able to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict from contrary collection and experience in themselves, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend their Reasons and Arguments) those few Authorities they imbrace, come to be followed as of unquestionable power and force. For these sort of people being not able to apprehend many things of Divinity in general, or indeed any principle on its true ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, have their hopes and fears (for the most part) terminated in certain select phrases and expressions of Scripture, which (themselves not well understanding) they are (through their ambiguity) brought to fancy them in all uses, as carrying the sense of the whole Scriptures themselves; and thereupon to make use of them in judging of what is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and lawful for themselves or others, in all kinds of actions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments, as though they had been the very particular directions which were proper thereunto. Insomuch, as where the translator is at a loss for rendring the genuine and true sense of an Hebraism, or the like; they are wont to take up those phrases and expressions so affected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame, in a manner, a new Religion to themselves out of their customary use and approbation of them.</p>
               <p>In which case it fareth with them, as it doth with children who are by way of sport, turning themselves often round, not only for pride and affectation sake, to see who can turn oftenest, but on purpose also, that they may then stand delighted with those transient and giddy figures and apprehensions which are then made in their brain. Even so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth those sorts of men in these vertigoes and intoxications made in them by their affected use of unintelligible and insignificant forms and phrases. When as, out of pride to excel others in degree of speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom they see already so much before them in the ordinary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible course, they are thereupon lead to fancy this course. Which having in it no correspondence or ground-work in Nature or Reason,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55976:236"/>
both because the terms themselves are destitute of Figure and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and because they cannot be configurated by other real bodies and figures neither, they must consequently remain like men in a Maze, without a clew of Method to direct them. But they become hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so wedded, that whosoever, in offering to convert or farther instruct these people, shall not, for admission into their conceits, hide his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under these their familiar expressions, shall lose his labour, and that not only as being unconceived by them for want of sufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion, but as contradicting, as they conceive, such plain truths, as (by the customary use of these phrases) they conceive their opinions as to be.</p>
               <p>And as observation and practise of particulars become at last affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in such things as are performed and fancied in our selves, so also the the often sight and notice of the signs and figures of these affections in others come by degrees to affect also so far as to promote and induce the same in us; even as yawning affects to imitation both of that action and of the drowsiness it denotes, and the signs and attendants of the lust and fear of others affects thereunto also. No otherwise then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xamples of success and impunity of persons in their courses of stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness, or the conversation and discourses of them, are strong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for other children and subjects to do the like.</p>
               <p>But then this works not in children and creatures very yong, until practise and contemplation, hath so rooted and conformed these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in our selves as they have strength to take rebound from others, which in them cannot be, as also they must want observation of the signs themselves, and motives unto them; both for want of time, and for want of that affection that should spur thereunto. Nor can these signs be of much force again on men or creatures very ancient; where want of spirits in the brain must leave the appetite and affection to these very dull and almost delete, and leave also the nerves and organs of the body so empty and hollow, that they represent not with any steadiness or strength, as also the experience of danger to arise, must make them slow in new undertakings.</p>
               <p>But to return to enquiry, after the rise of knowledge and reason, from instance in reading and learning. At first every letter must by its often admission through the vissual nerve, receive an answerable impression and figure in the brain, before any difference can be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and valued between it and another letter by comparison; for else could there be no difference put between any thing but what the ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> could see at once. And this comprehension cannot be well made at first sight, but according to appliableness of the organ, and intention of mind in the learner; and therefore in teaching of Birds and Beasts, we use watchings, corrections and rewards to make them attend. In children, that have their brain of a more tender substance, and less distorted by former figures, and have also (according to their bigness) more store of it then men, we find how easie its to teach them to read over older folks; notwithstanding they have not usually the like desire and intention of mind. So that the first step to knowledge is to feel and see well, and to have good senses; the next is to compare and make differences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:55976:237"/>Younglings coming first to see, look upon every thing with like amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but, because the light is the most usual thing they behold (for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious session thereof makes colours) they therefore, after they have by custom past over its first dislike (caused through strangeness first like the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and such colours as shew it most lively. And hence they come to be pleased with glasses, candles, &amp;c. before shapes and figures; and Babies come to be but after-plays to toys of shew, for they see nothing without light, but many shapes and figures besides those of men and women; which shape again, as being oftenest notified in comparison of all others, comes to be most fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar &amp; pleasing. And upon like reason, come yonglings to like of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar party that is most present to their sense, it being much encreased by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of indemnity: So Ducks will follow the Hen that hatched them; and so children that Nurse, or other body that is most conversant, familiar, and kind unto them: and they like and dislike others of the same kind, as they resemble or differ most from these.</p>
               <p>The pleasure of motion which young ones have in being rocked, or in playing one with another, seems to affect from that accustomed tumbling they had in the womb; for feeling is the first of senses, coming with life it self, if not the same. But then, as the brain and animal spirit of each creature stands chiefly imployed in the womb in the motion and sense of feeling of the limbs and outward parts, and doth thereupon prompt to exercise and delight in like agitation and motion afterwards, yet, when objects from the senses do afterwards come to imploy the brain and spirits inwardly, and when sense from the inward parts do draw the fancy and intention that way, then by degrees doth the exercise and delight in the motion of the limbs cease, and men become not only sedentary and studious, as in relation to figures entertained in the brain, but also to be strongly affected with the pleasures of eating and drinking, and such other enjoyments as may be performed with least shaking and dislocation of the stomack and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</p>
               <p>Those loud and harsher noises that prevail in quieting of children, that cannot please from custom, do take their effect from diversion; that is, by recalling their imagination from the sense of some other suffering, to attend this strange noise now in their ears, and not from pleasure of the noise it self; which can please but by comparison of a less affliction to a greater. But all our delights, while very young, are most corporal, and have, like to other Sensitives, reference to our own sensible Customs: But when we come to observe what rate the sense and custom of others put upon things, persons or actions, we then, according to our own particular sense of the ability of the persons so rating them, judge and conclude of their worth, or otherwise, which we call honour and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>
               <p>And hence it comes that bigger Childrens most eager sports are usually made in imitation of what they see men do; and the end of them to aim at victory and pre-excellence one above another. And as we come to be in liking of persons, and then of actions, so children, at first, are imitating the actions of such they most converse with, and take notice of: so that sometimes they are washing, sweeping, making fires, or the like (from their converse and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongst servants: but, when they come abroad into the world, persons of greatest honor, come, through the observation of the respect by others given
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55976:237"/>
that way, to be most observed by them, and consequently, those actions that are performed by and to them, to please above other actions: For these having uniformity, as being regulated by Law and Custom, must affect above the lose, incoherent, and disorderly actions of others, as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some faces and good hands do above those that are common: For it is not the persons, but the dignity we affect. And all actions and things, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not to sensible good, refer to honor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and things come to have esteem as attendants and causes of honor: For as honorable actions draw on our observation and esteem, so self-respect leads us to affect and pursue the causes of them: But, unto the observation of the causes of honor children sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reach, for the effect must first so highly please as to provoke to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And therefore with them, and the more ordinary sort of people, flattery is apprehended to be the same with honor: And, for want of observatoin and intelligence wherein true honor doth consist, they take all kind of praises and commendations to be the same with it. And, upon this score, they may well indeed conclude that honor is in the honoring first, and not in the honored: for that there being no true cause or reason in the party this way honored, why this praise or honor should be given, but the cause and design of it taking issue from the flatterer, it must thence follow, that as honor is in the honored first, so flattery in the flattered first.</p>
               <p>From the custom of feeling (before spoken of) it is that very young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants or creatures, finding nothing under them for support as they had in the womb, do, when we would make shew of letting them fall, put their bodies and parts into posture of resistance and aversion: not against falling it self, as knowing the danger or damage to follow thereupon; but because they find their present posture strange and uneasie: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for want of the like sustentation to be left under them, they are tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to catch at new hold and support. For to a childe new born, that hath not apprehended the difference of sights, the fright of falling from a precipice will be but equal to that of falling out of its Nourses lap: And children receive displeasure at first from lying on any thing that makes them not sensible of a like general and equal sopport they had in the womb. And therefore we find them laid on beds and laps made even, and yet hardly enduring the unequal application of arms or legs under them, until they are so swadled up that these partial supports seem thereby to be equal and even. For the motion of gravity or propriety of place, being a necessary property of all bodies and their parts, it will follow to be soonest, and so consequently, most universally known: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this strugling of children is caused through sense of feeling to avoid a present injury it now feels through uneasiness, and not out of innate conception of danger, as some do think. For if such instincts and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were, then would children be afraid of drowning, or burning, or the like?</p>
               <p>This instance hath been prosecuted, to give occasion to discover how we may come to be habituated and affected to certain postures in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and enjoyment of our minde and will, as well as of our bodies; and how that thereupon, those restraints which Government imposeth upon
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55976:238"/>
our liberties in the one, most cause reluctance and desire of release, as well as in the other; and that sense and experience of alteration and discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is the cause of dislike in our wills aswel as our bodies. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these things are ascribed to nature, it must be understood of secondary or acquired nature. For children or creatures new born, for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and observation, stand affected from no sense but that of feeling. Nor do the objects of other senses please or displease at first, unless they imprint and move so violently as to induce feeling, by affecting the heart and other parts and habits of the body, by means of those inward pares of nerves. Whereupon the humors and parts within do heighten (as it were, by their proper experience) the relish of that figure or object in the brain, to like or dislike, after the rate they stood themselves formerly made sensible thereof from it.</p>
               <p>And therefore time and experience being required to make fear or other passions strong, we find that mandkind till they come to ripeness and tryal, stand not apprehensive or averse to Government. After which, sense and knowledge of its use and benefit, and also of his own suffering thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, makes him (proportionably) contented or reluctant. Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (I say) for that as Reason and Religion do out of sense of duty more or less bear sway over the more natural and bodily sense of suffering, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of will, so will Government be to each one more or less offensive: there being but these two great motives for children and subjects obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, sense of benefit and interest, and sense of conscience and duty. For want of true experience and knowledge whereof, the family as well as the Kingdom comes to be troubled with mutinies and insurrections, even for that ignorance and incogitancy of the benefit or harm to arise to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by obedience, or the contrary, leaves them to be lead by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense of trouble in being guided by the direction of another, which must thereupon come to be by them that are not able to apprehend their own advantages by peace and submission, nor that their benefits are reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal, interpreted as done out of private interest and design of their Prince and father only.</p>
               <p>Nor need we wonder, that, in the course of our lives, Custom should bear such sway, since life it self is but custom; that is, a Methodical and Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary motion of an active spirit, which by means of his circular and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar course, is diverted from eager pursuit of penitration and ascension. For the heat of the Sun or parental body, by degrees turning into spirit or ayr, such portion of seed or first matter as is apt to sublime, this spirit (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its lighter nature) grows presently motive and restless, as seeking a more high and open habitation: but partly out of similitude of the matter whereof it was bred, and the similitude and constancy of the same degree of heat it now hath to that which begot it; and partly through the present suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of skinny enclosure, arising from the slymy nature of the matter it self: and partly through those other inclosures of skins and shels, in Wombs, Eggs, &amp;c. it is invited and contented, at length to satisfie its proneness to direct upward motion, with this circular passage: as being from habit cozened to take and choose this easier way, rather then to press earnestly any more to that direct course, in which it had been so often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by such high difficulties. And as this Spirit is by reason of its tenuity made motive and naturally desirous of enlargement and aire, so

again, by reason of its smaller and more indifferent degree of sublimation, as being generated by that moderate heat of the body, of a substance which is neither suffered to addle through cold, nor harden through heat, it is therefore kept so well allayed, as to be retarded both in ability and desire of penetration. Which is also holpen on by the closeness of those vessels and cells where it is contained, and by the likeness and proximity of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof it is generated, and wherewith it is accompanied: which is not only the same with that whereof it was begotten, but also is but one degree beneath it in thinness.</p>
               <p>For it is to be supposed, that the Chylus being turned into blood, as it doth attain some degree towards sublimation it self: So also that most attenuated and concocted spirit which is in the cells of the brain, doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise still retain a good degree towards condensation: even so, as, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to course and vicissitude, to be again apt to be turned back into s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eam, and so into blood. Like as also the blood, on the contrary, stands ready and affected to turn into steam, and so into spirit, in their circulation and passage up and down the body. In which course of Version and Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they are holpen by the mediation of the humour remaining in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, being as it were a mixture of spirit and blood, caused through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of the blood in its passage through the heart: Whereupon we find that nature hath provided a thicker coat for them then for that thicker blood which is contained in the veins, even as the finer animal spirit in the brain, hath its whole substance, besides its two coats, for inclosure. And therefore it is to be considered, that as the first spirit generated of the egg, or the like, was homogenious unto it; so, by degrees, as bodies, and the humours in them do receive mixture and alteration, the spirit thereof ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated doth suffer change also, until, in age, the one do become as heavy and indigested as the other: and the spirit to be wholly suffocated and lost in the humours.</p>
               <p>But the first quickning spirit being by the means aforesaid raised up and invited unto a regular motion, doth then, through habit of so moving, make it self the organical continents and enclosures of heart, arteries, brain, nerves, &amp;c. serving as well for methodical motion, as for places of test and <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> to the spirits and humours, being then called life.</p>
               <p>And it is to be supposed that this confinement and imprisonment of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in bodies, is in it self unnatural, and at first a causer of pain: and living Creatures are by degrees only released of the sense thereof, through custom of indurance and diversion; by the means of maintenance of this metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical inward motion: So that so long as this is kept orderly and free pain is avoided: but if it be excited through too great and unusual proportion of spirits, as we find after drinking, where the strength of the liquor doth excessively turn into spirit, then the membranes of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:55976:239"/>In like manner as a Commonwealth is enlivened and preserved, by having the natural vigour and spirit of the people kept in a regular and methodical motion, by the due observation of such regular Customes and Laws as shall be by the Prince thereof established; when as the intemperate use of things, accordding to their own several and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal likings, would be subject to bring on change and alteration, to the destruction of the Body Politique, as well as the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>And, in the Kingdom, we may account the Nobility and Gentry as answering the humour in the Arteries; and, by their middle temper and condition, carrying great force to unite the other extreams; that is, that more sublime spirit remaining in the head thereof, the Prince, (which is chiefly swayed by sense of honor) and those more gross hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the ordinary sort, swayed by more earthly and sensual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. When as they, being participant of both, may attemperate the Prince against so great sublination in attempts of ambition and vain glory, whereby to put his people into too violent heat and feverish motion; And also raise up and quicken the more slow sense of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from their aguish dulness in matters of obedience, to be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive and respectful of their Princes commands, even as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural members are to the directions of their head. Like as also doth the degree of Yeomanry unite the Gentry with the Peasant; and thereby impart some influence of courage and civility into those of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rank, who else become heartless and unserviceable, as experience tells us of those Countreys where they are not.</p>
               <p>Through custom of Walking we make it so familiar, that the fancy need not alwayes intend that action by expresse direction, as in the extraordinary running it must: But custome of so doing, having made a fit collocation in the brain, it is able, while it continues that posture which is unto this notion requisite, to intend other objects also.</p>
               <p>But in this faculty of going, we may, from the daily observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the practise of children herein, be put in minde with what trouble we are at first reduced from our natural proneness to be leaping with both feet at once, and from thence to be taught to set down one foot after another, after the manner of going. The which whilst it was in doing as a matter of great difficulty, did (although we have now quite forgot it) take up the whole imployment of our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the trouble thereof abating by degreees, as custom and practice made it easie, and secured us against fear of falling, incident to that first trust to a new support, as well as fear generally is to all new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: But these things now over, the custom of walking keepeth my brain from trouble, as it doth my limbs from weariness. For it is not any naturalness in this motion of walking, that makes it thus easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
               <p>Nay, it seems that only Birds, that have indeed but two legs, are inartificial and upright walkers; and that this posture in mankinde is at first forced. For the infant comes from the womb with the knees up;
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55976:239"/>
and what pains with swadling do we take to stretch his body in length, and kept it so? With what aversion doth every one of them submit to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement, and how pleased are they when released, so as the knees may be gotten up again? When we come afterwards to teach them to go, how ready are they to lean forward, and set their hands to the ground? What strange footing do they at last make in this uncoth motion?</p>
               <p>And after we are men we may finde the naturalness of four-footed goings still pointed at. Inasmuch as the Arms, when they are at liberty and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise imployed, do in our several gates keep pace with our legs, especially in fast walking; wherein, greater strength being required, we may observe men moving their Arms answerable to their Legs, and that cross ways, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fashion of a trot. And so again, when they are to run, the arms are gathered up close, as ready to move in an exilient or leaping manner: which is the usual way of procession of such things as have their hinde legs long. In swiming also man imploys all four, like other things: especially like such as have broad forefeet and the hindparts long; as Frogs and such like.</p>
               <p>And as for any difference that is in the joynts, between men and Apes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may well proceed but from custom, as crookedness doth: in which case, experience tells us how that continuance and usage of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, whilst the bones and gristles are yet tender, will cause the same so to fix afterwards, that unto that party, it will be as it were natural, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by traduction also. And we may further observe, that the legs and thighs of infants are so bent, as not to be too long for the Armes: the trunks of their bodies being then also proportionably much longer; and the plants of the feet so turned, as to be accommodated to a four-footed motion well enough, especially after a leaping fashion. And therefore mankinde seems only incident to crookedness, in the distortion of the joynts of the back-bone: for although shortness of the trunk follow this peculier erected posture, yet for further ease of the weight thereof (wanting support like other Creatures that use four feet), some way of leaning and standing comes to be affected, bringing on crookedness; and so farther shortning the trunk also. Upon which consideration we may suppose mens Limbs fitted for upright going e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Parats have one claw turned backward: that is, because the whole race of them, feeding out of their feet, and not being able to hold their meat to their mouths without turning their claws, it came at last so to settle: although the distortion be still apparent.</p>
               <p>And yet why may not men naturally enough go on their hinde feet onely, as we see some horses born amblers? for as in them custom and habit do often pass by traduction, so, all men being goers, why should not children be naturally walkers? and since it may be presumed that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were set upright, why not their posterity, insomuch as there should be no sort of people without this posture? It may be so, if we could have spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teaching; but as <hi>Adam</hi> was to have his knowledge infused, and not acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from childhood, so the faculty of upright going also if he had it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is like he would not have so gone, more then spoken.</p>
               <p>But this gate (no doubt) is of great advantage to mans use in some things: and that even in the exercise of the faculties of his minde and judgement, because he is hereby able to carry his head and neck more steadily then when they should be prominent, and hang out fore-right; whereupon the senses
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:55976:240"/>
Nerves, and parts of the body may have a more direct and steady enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the brain, so as to hold on, and keep fresh such objects and figures as shall be entertained therein; that so, by summoning all its concomitant impressions, after each parties artificial way of topical method and adjudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a full discovery may be made to serve for instruction or use, against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, before that figure be parted with.</p>
               <p>And therefore we may observe that while we are in great inquiry and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy concerning any thing, we hold our heads very steady: whereas those that have a loose carriage of their necks, are proportionably weak in their intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals: And truly, to be a good Peripatetick is a great step to be a good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher: because, in this erect gate, the bones being in a straight line, do bear the weight of the body; so as the brain may not be diverted from its inward work and agitation, to any great supply of the Nerves and Muscles without. And besides this, we have some advantage to knowledge by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hands by this means more tender, whereby to imprint more exactly by feeling with them.</p>
               <p>But then again, there is no doubt but in many bodily exercises, the other motion and gate would be advantageous; as in leaping, running, climbing, and all sorts of nimbleness. And for tryal sake hereof it were not amiss that some children were so brought up and nourished, as to be without sight of company, that they might take their natural course herein, until some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of years, at least those that come to them, to feed or teach them to speak, should come upon all four, and then sit, after the eastern fashion; but the greatest and best advantage would be, if men could conveniently be brought to use both ways of gate upon occasion; but this by the way.</p>
               <p>Now as there is an creation of body, so is there an erection of minde; wherein (indeed) the pourtrait and image of God is to be sought. And unto this estate of upright walking and looking towards heaven, we are by more slow and difficult degrees reduced, in our souls, then we are in our bodies: even because of those natural and inbred affections of Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, Sensuality, Stubbornness, and the like, whereby we are carryed with a perpetual delight to lye groveling on the things of this world.</p>
               <p>The first great help to this straightness of minde are those swathings of Precepts and discipline, wherewith and whereby, from our infancy, and from the same time we begin to go, we have the Rebellion and irregularities of our nature rectifyed by the Laws and Rules of our Parents; by the due applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exercise whereof, while our affections (as well as our limbs) are yet pliant and tender, we come to be well fitted and prepared to undergo and act, as Christians and subjects in our political relation, that measure of duty and submission which, in our Oeconomical relation, we had been habituated unto as children; when either our heavenly Father, or the Father of our Country shall have farther occasion to make tryal of our growth and steadiness in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by those afflictions and hardships which through humility and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, we shall be put unto.</p>
               <p>So that there will be these differences between the erection of the body, and that of the soul. All the difficulty of upright going, in the first sort, rests in our infancy, even in keeping the limbs of our body straight; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the difficulty of upright walking, in the other sort, is chiefly afterwards; when, by reason of obdurate natural stubborness and crookedness of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, we stand in more need of the ligaments and tyes of Laws and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline then before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:55976:240"/>After we come to growth, the elevation of our minde is helping to the body, in continuance of this his elevation, even through pride and affection, as striving to excel in that which we see to be so generally practised; whereas to the true elevation and upright walking of the inward man, the pride and haughtiness of the outward man is altogether averse, and there is no surer way to the true raising and dignifying of our mindes, then by the depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and keeping under of our bodies: when as by due applycation and use of afflictions and Patience, we may make those true Christian graces of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and lowliness of minde, in our own and worldly esteem, to become our true glory and exaltation in the sight of God. For it is to be considered that there are ghostly and gracious habits, as well as bodily and natural ones: and that these, as the more worthy, ought to take up our chief endeavour.</p>
               <p>To proceed farther into search of the degrees of knowledge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, we may observe, that those that can perfectly read are past the trouble of spelling: and those that can do that well, do it so without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance to their fancy, that they can intend the matter treated of; without distraction, (through notice of the words) more then the action of walking doth disturb the party, from entertaining other objects and thoughts.</p>
               <p>As for the usual tryal and difficulty of rubbing with one hand, and patting with another both at once, it proceeds from want of custom, whereby the brain cannot accommodate it self to both actions at the same instant: but through practice and custom both may be done, and yet the fancy have ability and leisure to intend something else; even as Turners and Spinsters can use hands and feet in different motions, and yet think on other things at the same time. For those different motions come at last to be but one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Brain (by little and little) findes a posture accommodated equally to supply those Nerves that serve the Muscles in both motions, and that at once, as he that hath been sufficiently enured to the shapes of <hi>a,</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> can be brought to make one syllable of them, and as well say <hi>ab,</hi> as <hi>a</hi> first, and then <hi>b</hi>; so, another syllable may be added to that; and yet (making but one word) the Brayn may joyntly intend them as one work. And farther, if it have more to do, that, or more words, may, through habit in reading, be so kept from disturbing the fancy, that the sense of them, and not the particular words, shall occupy the minde. Even as in Arithmetick, which is learned for things sake, and not for pleasure of seeing the figures of 3, 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the things thereby wrought, and not the Instrument comes to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our fancy.</p>
               <p>No otherwise then the tools of Carpenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> please but in relation to the work. Yet men seek to have their tools fitting: which handsomness accompanies, as the most usual form: but, to have a good work done by ill favoured tools, or an ill work by handsom ones, can hold no comparison in the Artificers choice.</p>
               <p>So the skill in Arithmetick may be a thing pleasing in it self: as also the Arts of good Printing or Writing, and the well forming and placing of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and letters, may be pleasing in themselves, considered apart; but come they once to be brought to use, then, not they, but the things which they signifie and import, take up our fancy.</p>
               <p>So in Musick also, the Tune and harmony is attended, and not every eighth or fifth: nay there may be (and usually is) progression: and that Tune
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:55976:241"/>
may prompt us to some Song made thereafter; and that song again minde us of some mirth, company, or other accidents that accompanied it in the times of our hearing. For the ends and utmost discoveries of things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways coveted; and where knowledge and the figure is already sufficiently comprehended, nature is progressive in her enquiry, and cannot, out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duty, be idle. And things are kept in memory as they were let in; that is with their most usual, or which is all one, with their strongest conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants.</p>
               <p>As we see it come to pass in dreams; what strange progression will they make? So as fancy, in her method of transition from one thing to another, will make as it were an history; if the affections move not to such height and passion as to awake the party. And the object that begins therein is commonly that which we last went to sleep with, if it be of much concern; but then, that quickly runs into things and objects of strongest impression: and therefore the Stage and Company is usually what our youth was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed unto, because then, as things came with greatest notice, so they have greatest settlement. For although many times, in the morning, we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not the series and coherence of our dreams, because these (it may be) made little impression, yet a method of transition they must needs have had.</p>
               <p>All which will inform us that affections arise not from present objects as now in themselves, but as in relation to our collections, and memory of their former abearance towards us, which is not grounded on one, but many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations; except that one were equivalent to many in strength: for it is all one to have a dead or absent party in remembrance because of long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, as it is to remember another for some extraordinary favour and obligation. For he that brings one stone a day for one hundred days, make the like heap to him that lays down one hundred all at once. And, so also, a repitition of stroaks upon the forehead, with an Egg or the like, will at last make as great a swelling as one greater blow with a stronger thing; even for that the blood and humors, by little and little arrested in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by the small stroak, do by degrees amass equally to that more total stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age made by the great contusion.</p>
               <p>As the outward parts stand affected and sensible by the recourse of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and mediation of the Nerves and annimal spirit, so much more the Brain. And as he that hath had the Gout doth again remember and know the precise pain thereof upon the recourse of the same humors, even so is the Brain put in minde and made sensible of its impressions, as well from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and recourse of the humors therein, as from outward objects. So that in sleep our dreams take often rise from hence also: and from those vapours arising from the Stomack; which do commonly minde us of the same thoughts then, as did accompany the like food or disgestion in the day time.</p>
               <p>From these strong concomitant impressions accompanying objects, it comes that the weaker sort of men are so impetuous in Religion. For they, relying on Authority of particular persons, their zeal and devotion is heightened according to the passion and fervency accompanying the preacher in his delivery, and not from the reason of what he propounded. Whereupon Impression and Custom moves in Religion as it doth in other things; that is by constancy and asseveration: for looser men, though
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55976:241"/>
more, are not so remarkable, for want of sedulity and asseveration in what they do.</p>
               <p>And as that side hath most sectators that hath most zealous patrons, so also State alterations are swayed by the numbers of such as are most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly active: and although such as dislike the order of things established and done by them, may be of far greater number, yet if they be not unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in their number, so as to agree to choose another before it, and to agree in fervency of opposition, they are as like to hinder one another, as them.</p>
               <p>Now as to know is little more then to remember, so Conscience is but the memory of things, actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they relate to morality. For the Brayn (from sense) taking objects entire; Conscience picks thereout, what future hope or fear may make of concern, and puts them into his own method, as other affections do. For Conscience hath not onely her rule, as other affections, but arising from all things that have morality, (which accompanyeth every thing in one kinde or other) is an affection upon other affections. And therefore Conscience comes not until yeers of discretion, that other affections have some growth: all which she masters, according as hope and fear master her. And so Conscience, in her jurisdiction, is a Will or general affection by her self; Having Reasons proper. For Reason is when memory holds forth two things at once, that by comparison of them, according to their usual effects and consequents observed formerly, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may be made of the like to happen again.</p>
               <p>And, as Conscience is memory of things, as to Religious fear, so Honor is memory of things, actions, persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to Civil hope. Conscience hath not his correlate (as shame which is opposite to Honor) unless the passion of Hope be taken in. Honor and shame respect reward and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment present, or rather carry it with them; Conscience, that which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And thereupon, one regards the Sentence and Judgemen of such as have present power, the other the commands and power of such as shall judge for the future. So that one sort of good Conscience may be want of memory or unaccusing, but Honor must be active. Absence of guilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents the one, but the other must be possessive. And as Conscience is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon affections, as they relate to guilt and punishment hereafter, so Honor governs affections as they have judgement of things, <hi>&amp;c</hi> here: and as the known Will of that God I fear, can onely oblige me in the one, so the Will of those men I esteem, in the other.</p>
               <p>And indeed, all our affections are (as instigated so) Governed by hope and fear. For under these two, as under the desire of attaining good or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding bad in the general, all things are included: and all other affections in the choice of objects have respect towards them, that is, (from observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to judge what expectations of good or harm; that is, pleasure of sense or honor, or pain of sense or shame, here or hereafter, is like to proceed from them, or their different managery and application.</p>
               <p>But then, as more go to Heaven by the way of Hell, and we had rather have our commendable actions suppressed then the contrary much divulged, so fear is stronger then hope; for although pleasure be the object of the one, and pain of the other, yet because pleasure is never so perfect as pain, nor can be so fixed and continuing; nor again without fear of loss, it must therefore belooked upon as the most general and steady guide of our actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:55976:242"/>Upon which ground we need not wonder at the commonness of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor why, as children are scared with Hobgoblins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so some men (little differing from them) should be so obnoxious to the terrors and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights of such as they credit. In which case it may happen to these that are negatively superstitious, as being scandalized at some Ceremonies which they understand not themselves, but which their guides are pleased to blast, as under the notion of humane inventions, or the like, as it doth with that way of affrightment of children also, by telling them of <hi>Raw head and bloody bones:</hi> for as to them that for the present understand not that all living things should be so, these things are apprehended as really dangerous and terrible because terribly delivered; even so, under the odium of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, Popery or the like, are we many times brought to be superstitiously flying those things that are in themselves good: and are also by so much the better, as being by Christian Authority approved, &amp; as having the more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Catholike President of the Christian Churches usage. For (doubtless) they cannot be so weak as seriously to believe that those that do refuse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Papists, even for that very difference sake which is in many things between them, should at the same time they account them erroneous in the service of God and in matters of Ceremonies also, implicitely follow them in some other things; and upon no other score but because they do so. But by these and such like arts it is usual with seditious persons to steal away peoples hearts from their own Church guides and Rulers. For upon the same reason that a second dis-affects (so far as to spoil the whole harmony) so one crossing and unexpected fear raceth that whole method of belief and perswasion we stood before possessed of, as to the goodness of our Religion, or of our practice therein.</p>
               <p>And that fear is more pressing and prevalent then hope, appears in that our hope to attain good can never want our fear of missing it; nor can the possession of pleasure want the fear of deprivation. We may also observe that deaf men do ever suspect things are spoken to their ill or prejudice, even when they may as likely speak to their good. The like jealousie is entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when any whisper in our Company, or speak to one another in a language we understand not.</p>
               <p>Nay pleasure is but absence of pain, especially that of sense: and then we need not wonder why a positive thing should affect more then a negative. For pain being (as before noted) when the spirits are stopped in their wonted motions, and it must still happen but they should be more or less so, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure can neither be high nor lasting, but (at best) mixed; and be but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of a less pain to a greater.</p>
               <p>Upon knowledge and due consideration of the prevalence of this passion of fear towards the guidance of men as in a state of subjection, it seemed good in the eye of divine wisdom, to rank his service, and all our returns of duty and obedience, as under that notion. Nay we may observe that he doth not onely set down the commendations of such as have been dutiful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto him under the oppression of such as feared him, but also, for the encrease of this return of duty and service towards himself, he is wont to promise a new increase and implantation of fear into the hearts of those parties and people from whom he expects it, as being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly steady grace that is effectual herein.</p>
               <p>If we look unto Creatures below us, we shall finde that onely such of them

are disciplinable, and to be made tame and cohabitable as can be brought to be made sensible and subject to our corrections, and also kept in such a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear of us, as not to resist, or rise against us to our prejudice: Whereas Lions, Wolves, Foxes, and the like, which cannot be constantly awed, are called Salvage, amongst which sort we come to reckon mankinde it self, when it shall once arive at that degree of temerity as to be incorrigible and disrespective to Law and Government, being then become indisciplinable and impolitical. For as to be informidable, is to be indomitable, so to be indomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is to be unsociable. Because if it were not for this mutual fear, every man would be daily affronted and injured by every man. Nay, the boys and youths as we passed the streets might be inclined even for sport sake, to abuse us with dirt or stones or the like, did not the terror of punishment to come from us or their Master keep them in aw. In which case, as it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that as they are most ready to offer these abuses to other boys or those of their own rank, because less to be feared either for personal revenge or complaints, so, were it not for fear sake, especially for that fear which must come from Authority, no society could be maintained; especially in cases of great import; where revenge is ready to work more high.</p>
               <p>And therefore those that say a Prince ought to rule by love onely, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not what they say; but, out of an hasty affectation to be eminent in a popular expression, forget that absurdity that attends it. Amongst equals, it is in vain for any man to expect that another should be serviceable unto him, who stands not by natural relation, it is not by some antecedent obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brought to a degree of loving him: in which case it may be called, a return of gratitude and not of subjection. That Prince also that is to attain a Principality or new Empire it will be necessary that he should in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner demean himself towards those he intends afterwards to rule as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But as there is a manifest difference, both in material and fashion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the stirrup by which we get up, and the saddle by which we ride, so is there between that relation he had to them before they were Subjects, and that which he hath to them afterwards, being then their equal, and now their ruler: and therefore it cannot but be thought that a different managery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him that is to command, over it doth to him that is to entreat.</p>
               <p>When any one is actually seised and estated in an office of rightful power, he can then be no otherwise loving as a superior, then as the other had first merited of him by his submission and obedience. In which case, as power and command must precede the return of duty and obedience, so must that approbation which must come from the superior in the acknowledgement of the desert of one more then another, be esteemed a reward in requital of some work done by the person, and not an affection to the person, without any such consideration. So that although Princes may have their peculiar friends or favorites, (like other men), yet, in reference to the act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obedience, the eye thereof cannot be firm without Law, nor Law without fear; until such a golden age shall be light upon, wherein the Edicts and commands of superiors shall be to the will of every one, at all times, so pleasing and conformable, as that the Commander shall not be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from the obeyer.</p>
               <p>So that this passion of Fear being so necessary, both for making of us soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and for keeping us fitted and prepared for a due return of obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our relation of subjection, we are not onely to conceive the total
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:55976:243"/>
privation thereof to be a total defeat to Government and its force, but that proportionably, as there is a course taken for substracting or lessening of this fear, from that person that can onely immediately claim and make present use of it, so is there a proportionable stop given to the efficacy of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he is to execute.</p>
               <p>As for example, in the divisions and distinctions of obedience into Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Civil, and active and passive, formerly spoken of: whereby men are brought from reckoning the breach of their Prince his Commands to be a thing of such terror as was formerly thought: and in the latter of these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to wit, in the distinction of obedience into active and passive, their haste to be rendred famous in so popular a speculation, hath made them become frivolous or unintelligible. For I would fain know, if he that did sit still, or keep at home, according to his Prince his command, were not to be called actively obedient unto him, as well as he that was put to the greatest labour and toyl in the performance of what he was enjoyned? Or (On the contrary) whether he were not as well passive that did suffer punishment for being active, when he was enjoyned to be quiet, as he was that endured pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for being quiet and forbearing, when he should have been active and stirring.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, to say actively obedient, is none other then a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for Government being it self to be looked upon as a work ayming at an end, as then the Prince must be looked upon as directer and Agent, so can the subject in all Offices of imployment he is put to herein, as well for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as station, be considered but as instrumental and passive onely: and so far as he suffers for neglect or contumacy, he cannot be called passive as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his obedience, but as to his stubbornness or disobedience. And therefore they should consider that since the benefits of Government and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are not to be had, unless some as instruments shall submit to have their wills guided by the wills of those that are to direct, so is there no steady way but that of Conscience and Fear to make voluntary and sensitive Agents continually ready to be directed by the judgements of such as are above them; after the same manner as other instruments do depend on the hand of the Artificer.</p>
               <p>These passions of hope and fear, although most prevalent, yet are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: but arise from experience of objects pleasurable and painful. For chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, till some collection of Knowledge, hope not, nor fear not, as before noted.</p>
               <p>As remembrance of pain, at first, causeth fear (for pain is the thing fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) so men that have thin skins, and are thereupon more sensible, have more fear then other Creatures; and those creatures that are most docible, are as we see most fearful and attentive, as Dogs, Parrats, &amp;c. And as wise men have tenderer sense of feeling then fools, so, more sense, more fear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, more wisdom; for fear causeth enquiry to be rid thereof.</p>
               <p>But as thus, fear makes men generally come to be more wise, (insomuch as all wise men may be observed fearful,) yet this being in more things then fools, whose ignorance and inexperience will not let them know the danger of many things, this their generality of fearing of more things according to truth, keeps the fear of fewer things from being so superstitious and intense. For as all superstition comes of ignorance, so zeal that should be according to knowledge, should not put a man besides his senses: and if men had more wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55976:243"/>
God might be more rationally served then usually he is. And if our zeal and exercise of Region be <hi>not according to knowledge,</hi> (so as to be called <hi>our reasonable service of God)</hi> we cannot rightly be said to serve God as men and reasonable Creatures. For after the ground-work is laid, and we have transcended sense in apprehending Christ (with his mysteries) in our hearts by Faith, our outward service and worship is so much the better, as the more knowing; that is, in imploying of our abilities in discovering of what the true sense of Scripture, or the light of Reason will afford: as the next and best direction to attain what we desire to know or practise, as truth or good.</p>
               <p>Nay, as we are in search of the Scriptures to imploy our own utmost abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, so are we not wholly to relye upon them; but, having in the first place freed our selves of all prejudice and prepossession, and in humility implored divine illumination and assistance in all things, we are then to proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Christian Faith and love in all deportments and actions, not otherwise directed by our superiors: who also are in this case to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the authorized interpreters of the Scriptures, as heretofore noted, Else it will fall out, that each one undertaking to examine and interpret them according to his own wilde fancy, and weak and ungrounded method of comprehension, and being also strongly, through education or interest fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled in his judgement, there will arise to be as many Religions and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as men and interests. And that which is yet worse, mens natural pride and vainglory will prompt to such presumption of extraordinary revelation, that even things blasphemous and destructive of humane society, shall, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of the Church, Reason, or Authority, be set on foot. Whereas, in truth in things of most private and separate concern, the sense of the Church, and the Analogy of Faith is to be venerably regarded, even as the supreme Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magistrate is also in all things of publike concern.</p>
               <p>For in this case we are again fallen within the limits of moral care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. And therefore, as each mans reason is in him the best guide of what to do in the course of his own affairs, so publike Reason in that which hath publike respect to the end, that from the knowledge of what is there done, there may be a fit and a constant way left for attaining moral prudence and obedience: and that according to a well grounded experience and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of moral and political directions and Edicts. Whereby each Subject may, from the constancy of the measure and manner of application, used by his Prince in rewards and punishments, come to frame to himself political me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and schemes of comprehension and knowledge of his duty and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in civil deportments, as well as he may learn Philosophy by observation of that constancy which is kept up in the course of Nature. For she being preserved and governed by uniform rules and laws, the same Causes must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produce the same effects, if the Agent and Patient be in themselves and circumstances alike vertuous and the same, the which wisdom must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, from a well grounded observation of constancy in her observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for should not natures course be constant, species and individual things could not have any steady provision for existence and benefit, but causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeterminable, effects would be so also. For it was from the constant observation of one thing following another, in all respects alike considered, that I come to know any thing; even as by continually observing heat to accompany fire, I know fire to be the cause of heat.</p>
               <p>And from this constancy in Nature it comes also to pass, that what is most
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:55976:244"/>
naturally done is most uniformly done, and so most handsomly and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done. Which coming to be imitated by us, will be also most vertuously and wisely done: but what is not done in natural imitation (as following no rule) is vitious and ill favoured. For folly being a short and false observation in the course of things, it concludes to act upon half premises: Whereupon the irregular processions and effects thereof, come through inequality to be inequity. For as truth can be but one, but errors divers: even so (as we noted formerly of beauty and handsom faces) vertuous actions have more likeness to one another then vitious. For all virtuous actions are done by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rules and copies, and as they agree to these measures, their goodness is known: and as they differ therefrom, they do differ from themselves also, and approach to vice.</p>
               <p>Things being thus stated, it will follow, that more reason, knowledge and understanding, is but more observation, and that an uncontradicted observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is taken for a supreme reason in it self. For so (for example) the motion of gravity, because it is observed to accompany all things, none, or few search the reason of it, for there is not a more general or uniform rule in nature to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it by; all proof going from things more generally observed and known to such as are less. Whereas to believe the Antipodes, and that men, upon the same reason of motion of gravity, should tend in the same line towards us, as we do towards them; this seems as difficult for belief, as it is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the usual tendency of things, as to our appearance, which we call upwards and downwards. Nor can it be conceivable to any that will not take pains to get it comprehended from observation elsewhere.</p>
               <p>In which case, if men have made and methodized observations aright, it may appear that the sum and superiour bodies move in spheres, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the time they are absent and unseen is equal to that they compleat in compassing that half of the sphere which is seen, from whence, and the observation of eccilpses, the earth must be supposed to be spherical also.</p>
               <p>And if this be farther enquired into, we shall find that this motion of heavy things downwards, is but part of a more general motion, and to be so concluded from that more general observation of union: And is but the appetite thereof made more observable through this more apparent motion toward union after separation. For the common knowledge and observance of boldness as they are unite, and keeping close together, as by so much more general then the motion of gravity, as rest it self is more general then local motion, for indeed what is usually called motion and rest, are but these two: but it is not so observable as the other, because rest, or union already made, hath no variety to cause intent observance, as variety of motion doth in the other. And therefore it is onely discoverable to such as can un-ravel nature in their contemplation, until they come to the bottom and first ground-work thereof. For then they shall find both this constant practise of union or adhesion of bodies, and also the cause thereof to be (the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cause of all causes) that is, the will and law of God in order to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
               <p>And although inanimates have a kind of specification amongst themselves, whereby defire of proper union hath some force (as may be seen in that active part of earth, the Loadstone, in his variation, yet they follow in their whole mass) the general law of matter, in the common and general thirst
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55976:244"/>
of union. For should there not be a common centre of gravity, whereby all earthly things, as they stood differenced in weight by dense and rare, might have and keep the proper places assigned them, Chaos and confusion would follow.</p>
               <p>And therefore, this motion of heavy things to the earth being both necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and natural, both for affording a place of receipt and production of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and for leaving all without, so rare and transparent, that the influences of superiour bodies might approach them, we must conclude, that as the whole earth is more then a part, so hath it this attractive force of union, greater also in the whole then apart. And therefore for a stone (or the like) to tend that way, and not to be diverted by the desire of union through prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imity of a like less body, is no wonder. And, as it is to the whole, so it is to the centre or middle part of the whole, that this desire of approach is annexed. And hence it may easily be conceived, that with our Antipodes this motion of bodies to the centre, in their hemisphere, is but the same with us, in our hemisphere. For the desire of union is equal in proportion to all parts of the whole mass, as well in the greater body attracting, as the lesser (which we may call passive and) attracted, and is from centre to centre in both.</p>
               <p>And as the centre of attraction governs thus in all natural motions, so doth the centre of resistance in all violent motions. But as there, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their force to Union and Agreement, so here, to repulse and victory. For the ballance, the leaver, the wheel, and other mechanical instruments have their force, and are appliable to use, from the just computation of distance from the centre, in the parts where the strife lies in each of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents; whereby that part of the ballance, leaver, &amp;c. that is, shortest, and so nearest the centre of the whole opposition, will consequently, as most oppressed with its burthen, have least force in resistance; and the other, upon contrary reasons, will have most force: and this both of them proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their distances in things of like weight and resistance: even as in fencing, he that is to put by the sword of another, will find proportionable ease, as there is difference of length between so much of the sword which the party incloseth in his hand, and of that part beyond and without it. For the upper part of the hand (where the defendants forefinger joynt is) being the centre of opposition, it will follow that the assailant will have difference of force, as he hath difference of distance from it; that is, answerably, as the length of the sword without his hand, is longer, from the place touched by the assailant to the handle, then the defendants hand is broad.</p>
               <p>We before said the Brain to be the common sensory, and the Senses the scouts and intelligencers for information and knowledge: For colours, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, &amp;c. may be said to be by the brain felt, through the windows of eyes; and savours and sounds through the nose and ears. But, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign intelligencers, the eye hath most advantage to knowledge; being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of more variety of objects, and that at once; and of apprehending them at greatest distance. Now since, between men and beasts, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears little, and but occasional difference in the number or excellence of the senses, and that all knowledge is acquired in us, and acquired by help of these senses, it would be known how this ability is attained.</p>
               <p>In which discourse we will begin with sight, whose object is a luminous
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:55976:245"/>
or an opacous body, and that by means of beams of light directly issuing from the one, or reflected from the other. After the first way I see the Sun a candle, &amp;c. after the other way, all opacous bodies that return their beams; in both cases the beam of light being the object of sight, colour, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, &amp;c. are but its concomitants.</p>
               <p>There may be thought another way of discovery, that is, by Eclypse, where the body is discerned, not by reflecting or discovering the beam, but by impeaching and hiding it. So the Moon, in the Suns Eclypse, discovers her own body, not by sending, but by preventing the light: and indeed, colours so far as they are in degree distant from white or light, unto black or dark, in which last the beam is wholly entred and lost. So far, and all that while doth the beam suffer degree of Eclypse, in the different penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and return it finds in the superficies of that body.</p>
               <p>But although light beams be the only proper objects of sight, yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is the opacous body differenced in the manner of perception six ways. By Figure, by Motion, by Colour, by Magnitude, by Number, and by Scite or Posture. All which properties are so inseparably adjoyned unto every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial body, that neither in themselves, nor (consequently in our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, a body can be without them, nor they without a body, except it be motion, For we may see and imagine a body endued with Colour, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or Figure without motion, but a body with, or without motion, wanting Colour, Figure, Dimension, &amp;c. we cannot apprehend, because there can be nothing in the fancy, but what was first in the sense; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since no body was ever seen wanting these properties, it cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the imagination without them, nor they without it. True it is, that I may conceive a body of a different Figure, Proportion, &amp;c. unto any that I ever saw, as to the whole fabrick, yet must it be made up and have analogy unto some Figures formerly represented. For so let a Traveller tell of some strange Beast, he must (to make it conceiveable) give it some resemblance of head, feet, back, belly, or other shape, to the likeness of Lyon, Dog, Horse, or such like; whereupon having finished his discourse by such simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, you have a body figured in your fancy of such a shape as entire you had not before, but not so of the several parts. But now, to imagine a body void of colour, or a body of such a colour as I never saw, is impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this property is descernable by sight only, and must have come from thence, or not at all, even from the divers observance of colorate objects. And although, I seldom can remember the instance or shape or the body that gave me this colour, because the variety of Figures is more then that of colours (and thereupon not so easily retained in memory) even so Colours may remain after the Figures are abolished.</p>
               <p>And for a little better discussion and satisfaction herein, we will examine and instance in the miracle Christ wrought on the man born blind, who (upon his eyes opening) said he saw men <hi>Walking as trees.</hi> To satisfie which, we are to know, that Figure, Motion, Proportion, &amp;c. are not the proper objects of sight, but of feeling: For although I cannot remember the particulars, yet I did at first feel the different Shapes and Figures of things, before I could distinguish them by sight; and if we observe children, while they are very little, all their learning is but a conference between their hands and eyes; that is, to instruct their eyes to make true estimation of Figure, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, &amp;c. For after that by feeling they have observed the different sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:55976:245"/>
were made in rounds, flats, corners, and all other shapes and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions whatsoever, they are consequently ready to make observation for all Figures following. So now this blind man having (it is likely) upon some occasion been left to rest himself under, or against a tree, he could not but (thereupon) be knowing of the shape thereof: And therefore the erect sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and size of men, in his new illumination, seemed most to resemble that of trees, of any other which he could know; For it is to be conceived he could not reach beyond the trunks of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore Feeling being the next informer of the understanding (or rather understanding it self) is to be looked upon as the original and most exact sense; sight and other senses being only necessary for the quaintity and extent of its information: whose reports, having but respect to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of things, are not farther capable of evidence and certainty, then as consenting with, and controulable by feeling. Which sense, as it began to be with our selves, and shall last leave us (as being the assurance of that life by which <hi>we</hi> are <hi>we</hi>) So is to us the assurance of the realities of things in nature; even by making us perceptible of that which is the foundation and original; to wit of that their principle of existence or being. For hereby onely we come to gather our assurance that any thing at all really is: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the other we do but discover farther of the manner how; which must proportionably have dependance on the truth of the existence or being of thing it self.</p>
               <p>And therefore is the eye is of largest contribution to the intellect (not from generality of object and receipt at distance only, but) because it can take in more of the Figure and Appearance of the object, then the others; by means of those several colorate rays emitted from the several corners and object parts of opacous bodies, into the expanded end of the optick nerve spread round the puple of the eye. Even so, to the encrease and extent of mans knowledge above beasts, in the sense of feeling, we are advantaged by our hands, which serve to inform the brain by the spinal marow, as other senses do by their inward pares of nerves. And then this paradox may be brought in, that mens hands are greatest outward advantages to their knowlesge. For in them men having excellence above other things, do not only excel them as Mechanicks, but by them they are able also to understand more. And even as Cats that play most catch best, so also, because we are by them, and the speading of the fingers, made perceptible of divers parts of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject body at once, and thereby able to make more full figure thereof, as the <hi>retina tunica</hi> doth to the visual nerve. Whereas in the touchings that are apprehended by other parts, so small a circuit of the object body is placed upon so small an extension and portion of the nerves of my body, that no such perception of difference can arise between touch and touch, as to beget knowledge and affection to one thing much above another. And therefore we may observe that men cannot let their hats remain on their heads in the same posture they are put on by others, but must again place themselves to that kind of settlement they were accustomed unto. For the hat, covering and pressing the head round and in divers parts at once, must render it in a higher degree perceptible and affected with differences, then where, in that and other parts of the body, forraign touches are in so small measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>But because each sense can but inform in its own proper sphere and object,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:55976:246"/>
we will see a little how they lead to error, when brought from the controul of feeling. The Sun and Moon, &amp;c. have neither, to fight, their true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions nor Figures, and this because nothing could be felt at distance. An oar in the water, hath such a different Posture or Scite, that mine eyes alone can never inform me, that that part which is within, and that part which is without the water, do make but one streight piece: And multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying glasses deceive us by numbers, as travelling by water doth deceive us in motion; and this upon no other reason, but because the same direction and crossing of lines is made by my passing by the trees and land, as would be if they passed by me, or one another.</p>
               <p>And the like is for hearing and other senses, which (having their single proper objects) must refer to feeling, for science and assurance in other things not proper unto them. For although a perfect sight, hearing, smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or tasting, can never fail (with due mediums) in differencing of colours, noises and savours without and beyond controul of feeling (which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with these things, but by these his proper organs) yet can they not know farther then as from and for him. And the more remote any thing is from feeling, the more uncertain its discovery.</p>
               <p>Which happens to sight chiefly because it undertakes at greatest distance from it. Whereupon we find, that colours come to be lost afar off, and pictures, land-scapes, &amp;c. do make things that are plain and even, to seem such risings, as by sight alone (having reference to like shadows in faces and things that had such risings) we might be deceived. For different session of light or colour making Figure conceivable in our sense, and not any real quality in the object, as the Painters Art (which is able to express all Figures by colours only) doth clearly demonstrate, it must follow that Figure and all the rest are (as we said) truly demonstrable from feeling only; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so deceives the brain in crossing of nerves, as it is deceived by sight in crossing of lines: for from hence it comes to pass that one bullet felt by two fing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s a cross seems to be two.</p>
               <p>But now although motion be not so inseparable a property of bodies (and so ordinarily the object of sense, as some of the rest) yet, because it is of so great variety in its self, it gives the greatest information to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all others: For that it denotes more of the inward qualities of a body; And again, you cannot conceive any one figure or proportion not capable of divers motions.</p>
               <p>But then, though a body is many times seen, and so may be imagined without motion, yet, as it was never seen alone, so motion cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without a figurate body; and therefore although again, this property of figure be not so directive, as of it self, yet it is more necessary, as to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, by its presence and assistance, because my fancy cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of any object without a Figure.</p>
               <p>And this we cannot forbid our selves in the contemplation of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and all other spiritual substances, namely, to fancy them under one shape or another, wherein we conceive those attributes, and operations we ascribe to them should be most fitly exercised. Which, as it was the main rise to Idolatry, so was it of Heresie, Schism and Superstition also; mistaking Gods attributes under a wrong figure: which always coming far short of expressing his ability to act, must fall short also of rendring his Almightiness in all kinds of due esteem in our understandings. And again,

                  </gap>ies that do frame their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them.</p>
               <p>And although men now grown to some years, can remember names and words without their figures that first imprinted them; yet (as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us) we cannot remember the name of any single or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct thing or person, but his shape will first come into our fancy; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as natural notions and the comprehensions of separate things arose and were confirmed in us from frequent or intent admittance through outward sense: So the peremptory conceipt of the fitness of Method and Rules of adjudication framed thereupon, must arise also from divers essays and observations of the analogy and correspondenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> between them. And in childrens learning to speak, the articulation of words is not so great a hindrance as want of fancy through want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of some Figure of that thing which these words should express; for Paria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that can articular well enough, are for this cause uncapable to speak many things, or indeed any thing, but what must arise from large itteration, which must serve to them, as an affection arising from height and sharpness, or manner of sound and impression, through often hearing of the same tone, and not as an object of memory so distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figured by it self, as to mind him of the object whereof he speaks; although indeed their speech is usually brought on by way of memory from Figure, as by the sight of persons or places that did teach or accompany their learning.</p>
               <p>As the eye is the sense of largest supply to Feeling and memory, so (through variety of its objects) fancy hath more ability to conceive and distinguish the impressions thereof, then by any other of the senses. For sight hath all varieties of Figure, Number, Proportion, &amp;c. for its observation; whereas the other senses are, for the most part, single in their objects: Nay, Figure alone is of such variety, as there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be such exactness between any two things, take them of leaves of the same tree, stones; or what natural thing; you will, but some such difference to the eye may still be discovered, as a man may be said to know them by it. But Savours and Sounds, being, like single colours, without such remarkable difference, can seldom so imploy and affect the fancy, as to be remembred distinct from one another, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but as accompanied with that figurate body, or some other sensible accident at the time of their admittance. And hence comes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other advantage men have to knowledge abeve other creatures, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this greater variety of induction, by relying on sight and feeling more then they.</p>
               <p>For smelling (which is the sense they most relye upon, and make use of) is capable but of little variety of impression; and their knowledge and instruction gathered from difference herein, serveth seldom to other imployment then to distinguish food by, it being indeed but as one and the same sense with tasting, or being but tasting at distance; even as tasting again is but the proper sense of feeling for one part, namely the stomack. And it will hence follow, that as the variety of the objects of sight exceed those of smell; and as the variety of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the hand exceeds that of feeling with the Pallat; so doth
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:55976:247"/>
mens advantage to knowledge exceed, even in this respect also, that of other creatures.</p>
               <p>And again, as Beasts (relying and usuage of these more confined en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries of Taste and Smelling) can produce (thereupon) but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so such men or such creatures, as are in their senses most confined (whether in this kind, or in any other) must be also most confined in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; as on the contrary, they that are intent on Figures, have advantage to memory; and so to knowledge. And therefore we can never remember that which happened unto us in our infancy, or very young, because we had not as then throughly learned to distinguish and retain Figures.</p>
               <p>But then, although smelling have hereupon least influence upon us, as to our intellectual and moral habits; yet, by reason of its vicinity and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the spirits themselves, it is most strongly operative for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing affections in us, as in our natural condition, and thereby to move us more strongly to liking and action then the other senses can. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are not, like other Sensitives (that are not capable of making use of figurate objects, and receiving impression from them) lead to fancy, and distinguish particular things and persons from custom and usage hence only arising, but are able from those greater and more observable agreements and disparities which appear to sight and other senses, and from the oftner imployment of them thereabouts, many times to put a stop and controul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what is approved by the other, and to choose and stand affected from them, and not from the other; yet in those things that depend upon more general acquaintance and commerce, and where long conversation hath grown up into habit and custom, without controul or notice of other senses, there the sense of smelling doth with us, as well as them, so far prevail as to pass into that we call Nature: For and towards the liking of such sorts or species of creatures, with whom we are most conversant, by means of those vapours and spirits that flow from them.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that as all creatures do from their more usual associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, come to like those of their own kind more then others, so also do they by degrees do it; even as each individual of the same species attains to full growth and perfection, whereby they may be reciprocally enabled both to give and take from each other these more strong impressions. Upon which ground each Sensitive at the time of its ripeness comes to be imbued and possessed with correspondent degree of delight in each others company, and also with that high desire of more near personal union and congression; even so far, until by means thereof, and of that mixture of more spiritous parts therein made, a third creature of their own kind is made up and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>That this inclination is but emergent from that <hi>Natura Naturata,</hi> those Laws of matter which the great <hi>Natura Naturans</hi> did at first impose, for and towards the mutual preservation of the Universe and its Species, and not from such discreet instinct and original perception, as that each thing (as by a kind of miracle, or as being a God to its self) should be knowingly led to choice and discrimination herein, will plainly appear in those mixtures which are produced from those meetings of creatures of several sorts at common watering places, or the like. The which we might well think would be much more common and strong, if any thing from its birth should have been kept to herd amongst those of that kind, then can be now, where at the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:55976:247"/>
meetings at <hi>Nilus,</hi> or the like, there is but a short and occasional acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that not till some maturity neither, when we must presume each thing necessarily imbued before with the relish of its own race. But were any creature from the time of its birth brought to herd amongst those of another sort, there is no doubt but that creature, at years of full growth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, would have had its spirits so assimulated to those of that herd, as to choose congression there before any of its own kind, which it did but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or suddenly meet with. Although therein again, some allay and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be supposed, from that aversion which each one of that herd would bear towards this single creature, from that greater familiarity and converse they have one towards another.</p>
               <p>Not but that as there are degrees of likeness of flesh and humors in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of creatures one to another, and so consequently of that steam or spirit thence generated, and issuing out of the nostrils or pores; even so also are we to conceive that each thing is soonest won to the liking of that which is most near to its own kind: As the Ass (a Creature that is more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to stray then herd) is to choose a Mare; whereas she again, that is used more to heard with those of her own kind, yields not but upon force or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. Upon which score, and also for that all Creatures both in the Nest and Litter, and from Conversation and Nourishment by their Dam, are possessed with an early tincture, they do ordinarily come to receive a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impression towards the future liking of one another in the same kind, then can be afterwards dileted or taken off, without a very long tract of time.</p>
               <p>As for distinction and choice of Sex, it proceeds from precedent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses or practical experiment, and not from natural instinct or knowledge. For two Dogs or other Creatures will, in their play, while they are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more affected by the nearness and heat of each others breath, be ready to ride one another, till experience have told them their mistake: Not but that, as there are times of maturity in Vegitables and Fruits, so in Sensitives also; at which time (no doubt) two individuals in a herd, or the like, will have degree of perception and inclination towards each other (as to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of natural ripeness and perfection) from that degree of quantity and fervor of vapour and spirits reciprocally emitted, In which case, a short ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in so plain a difference, may teach the male (who is commonly the assailant and chooser) easily to distinguish that female from the rest which is fittest for him, even by his sense of smelling. Nay, as nature hath furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with a sense of tasting proper for our stomacks; even so may we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all sorts of Sensitives to be saluting each other with billing, smelling, or the like; whereby, as by a natural way of complement, a farther tryal might be made of that liking and agreement which was already induced by the eye.</p>
               <p>Now although mankind stands not so wholly obnoxious to be captivated by these affections which are induced from the sense of smelling only, even because he hath affections stirred up in him from other senses also which are likewise prevalent in his actions, yet that naturally, and as men and sensitive agents, we come to be hereby also provoked and swayed, is not to be doubted. But true it is, that in us these affecting vapours do make their entrance more imperceptibly, because of that weakness of our smelling faculty, caused through rawness and indigestion in the stomack; whereby the same foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:55976:248"/>
and crudity that doth make a stinking breath, is also thereby hindred from the smell of that, or any thing else which is not very strong; which yet doth not hinder the receipt of those insinuating vapours, whereby the humours and habits of the body may come by degrees to be embued and affected.</p>
               <p>From what hath been hitherto spoken, we may also know how to put a difference between those two several affections which use to pass under the same notion of Love. For that appetite before spoken of, may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called natural lust or desire, and, being more sensual, is not proper to man as man, but affects him as a Sensitive: Whereas the other, taking its rise and ground from figure and impression in the fancy, as all sorts of knowledge doth, it may be called Noble, as to its beginning, as well as Heroick and Divine, as to its aim and end. And although it be true that they are usually heightned by each other (as to particular application) yet may they be one without another: For I may love like a man, without lustful thought, and lustful thoughts may again sway me beyond personal liking; neither of them being to be known (as to perfection) but when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: for that love is but small that must be enlivened from thought of sex, or continued by youth only; and as great a defect in nature it must also ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, to acquiess but to an eminent beauty.</p>
               <p>As both these affections take their rise and growth from generals, so have they general and specifical aim and intention in the eye of providence and nature: but when they come to be reduced into act, they have in us person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inducement and design; at which time those affections that were amassed from many, cannot shew their proficience and full strength but to one at once. And therefore to keep them from being destructive to their first end, they ought in men (especially so far as they are sociable) to be bridled and guided by reason. In which doing, that more rational and noble affection of love is to precede and give direction to the other, as to the person, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect had to Law and Charity. Which Love again, although (as in it self considered) it cannot be too high to any one, yet for fear least that general duty of Love and Charity which we owe towards all, should by too great intention towards this one come to be diverted or neglected, we are both to take our own reason along with us, and also that of the publike, as heretofore noted.</p>
               <p>And farther also, for fear least too great sense of contrariety and difference from those we so entirely love should (besides the espousal of personal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and injuries) contract in us a consequential hatred and dis-affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, we are in this case also, to take to our guidance the rules of Religion also; whereby we are taught to love all alike.</p>
               <p>And indeed, more controversies, quarrels, and publike disturbances do arise from too great fondness and indulgence, then any thing else. When as, through too great love and care to provide for those that have relation to us by family or friendship, others come to be neglected or injuriously dealt with; who otherwise would still have been looked upon as friends; there being more hatreds and discontents raised upon second and relative conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, then from any primary difference, which the parties have to one another, in reference to themselves apart, or to the rules of vertue or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:55976:248"/>And hence it comes that we not onely stand liking and disliking others as they are friends or enemies to our prime favorite, but because love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred do arise and encrease by comparison, it may be also observed, how that in the same family, that greater affection which one brother or servant carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth towards another above the rest, doth by consequence draw him into as great hatred and dis-esteem of others in the same relation, upon that onely consideration: Insomuch as we shall find anger and revenge no where so implacably prosecuted as by one brother against another.</p>
               <p>No otherwise, then as subjects in the same Kingdom, are ready to break into factions and sidings through those diversities of sects and opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves; whereby we see it come to pass, that, by reason of that continual exasperation which must arise from the daily sight and discourses of such things wherein they stand contrary, this repeated difference doth more strongly engage them to mutual discontent and deadly hatred, then it doth against strangers, and such as do more differ from them.</p>
               <p>Insomuch as there are more Christians slain by one another, upon the score of Religion, then are by them upon others; or those of all other Religions upon them, upon the like ground: nay, we too truly find it, that, even in the sub-divisions and sects of Christianity, those that have lesser differences, will yet, by reason of vicinity, be drawn into more and more dangerous quarrels against one another, then against that sect which differs most from them both. In which case, if the publike rule and judgement for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be not regarded, it will fare with them as it doth with men falling out about a mistaken word, gesture, look, or the like; even that (for want of a sit means of reconciliation) the discontent and hatred will daily encrease, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it come to be determined in the field.</p>
               <p>The names of Sympathy and Antipathy are usually given to the affections of both sorts, as well to those strong likings and aversions introduced at the nostrils, as those at the eyes; but if we respect more occult naturalness here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then those of the first sort may be onely called natural, because they take their impression so inwardly, and by such insensible degrees, as seldom to admit controulment by other senses, or the impressions drawn from them. Whereas the other, that hath its rise from more artificial collections (as loving or liking other things according to their conformity to these Figures or Ideas of perfection, which, in each kind, are raised in mens fancies) may in both respects be brought to be controuled and examined by other Figures and Methods, as they shall be called up and judged by the Spirits and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; which in the other case cannot be, because these Spirits themselves do, in the affections that way brought in, become tainted in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and substance.</p>
               <p>Those kinds of aversions which proceed from sight, as from difference and abhorrence of figure, may be easily reconciled and made familar by an ingenious patience; nor is it dangerous to give them of that food to eat. Whereas those things that have contrariety to the particular humors or temperament of the stomach, are not in that kinde to be jested with; for that although outward smell or taste should not be perceptive of difference (which many times it wonderfully is in that case) yet it is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned but the vitiated stomack of the party will quickly nauseat and disgust it; and therefore we find that these sorts of longings or aversions are incident to the weaker and more sickly constitutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:55976:249"/>Here and in other places we have been the more copious for setting down the more concealed causes of those operations which use to pass under the rank of natural instincts, that, by placing every wheel of providence in its due order and motion, the real existence, wisdom and power of God might be more readily seen and acknowledged. The usual ground that leads men to Atheism and doubt whether there be any God at all, being many times scandal taken at the vulgar and ordinary assignation of effects unto God himself, as if they were by him immediately done: when as they, coming to find the same, like other things, to have their own natural cause of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction also, they thereby come to think that men are mistaken in the one, as well as the other. When as by help of a through insight and sufficiency of their own, to discover how no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing is by chance done, but that the greatest and most important things being by divine wisdom and order brought to pass by those things which to us do appear most weak and contemptible, they may thereby, and by means of that obseavable gradation of causes, come to discern a God at the top of all: From whom, as they did at first take their source and original, as being in their whole mass but rays of divine bounty, so do they, in all their variations amongst themselves, still make some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and demonstrations of that perfection and simplicity which at first gave them their being.</p>
               <p>Thus the natural desire of union (induced through custom) is by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directed towards variety and multiplication, as before declared. In which again, as the individuals do through their natural pursuit of pleasure attain to their several perfections, they do then again, as in pursuit of the highest of these natural provocations, aim at a new union and coition also. By successive repetitions whereof, as each man, and each sensitive seems to reintegrate it self into that first Parent of their kind, so doth the submission of them, in their several kinds, to the same common Laws of <hi>Adam,</hi> or first matter, bring on a confession also that there is a common Parent and cause of union for them all. In which course, custom and variety are affections semblably made use of for the sustentation of Sensitives, as motion and rest are for prrservation of Naturals. Whereby it comes to pass, that as matter doth naturally affect closeness and settlement, which is answerable to union and rest, so doth it, by customary degrees observed in motion, release it self, in, and of that tendency to separation, which its own sublimed part, (by means of heat) had forced upon it: All things cheerfully dancing those rounds which are by Divine Rule and Providence appointed unto them.</p>
               <p>As we are thus prevailed upon by custom to cast a different choice and liking towards things and persons, as they are in their naturals, so come we, through custom and constancy in company and conversation, to stand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly affected towards them also, as in relation to their morals; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gracefulness and winning insinuation taken from behaviour, as well as from person. And this especially towards years, when as time sufficient hath passed for making observation of difference herein, and naturalizing our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to those garbs and habits which cohabitation brings within our notice; at which time the other affections induced from personal beauty, &amp;c. do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so abate of their vigour, so as not to divert in these. Hence it comes, that old folks are ever condemning, not only the present fashions, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and deportments of men also in the present age, over what they were
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:55976:249"/>
formerly, even because, from continued impression, and that taken whilst they were young, they must stand already filled and prepossessed in their fancies against any figure that can now be offered.</p>
               <p>The which prejudication is most holpen on by compliance of interest and opinion, as we find by that ready assistance which each one of a sect casteth towards his fellow, as supposing himself holpen in that help which he yields unto them. And so again, in matters of Moral opinion and conversation, we are inclined and won to fancy and practise the like principles in matters of polity and obedience, as do the rest of our familiars and acquaintance. That child, that servant, that hath observed others of his brothers, or fellows, or others in others families, to gain liberty or any thing else, or to pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out punishment or reproof for dis-respect to their Parent or Master, will thereupon come to be inclined to desire and attempt the like.</p>
               <p>After the same manner, such subjects and people as are wonted to hear and read Stories of the commendations of such as have been <hi>Tyranicids,</hi> or have boldly opposed their Princes in their commands, or that have thriven themselves into the fancied liberty of <hi>Free-States,</hi> they do thereupon also come to be addicted more then others to the like degree of boldness and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity. And indeed, there is nothing more dangerous in a State, then too much toleration of Philosophical Discourses and Books of this kind, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one sure step to disloyalty and Civil disturbance. For as no man can come to any great height of evil on a sudden, so, in matters of obedience, we are brought to be Rebels upon these first grounds of dis-respect and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence cast towards Superiours, when, by too ordinary and familiar dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, subjects shall be informed of their Princes faults or weakness, and that he is not otherwise to be respected then as prosecuting the good of his people, whose servant he is, or the like. By which means the judgements and affections of people come to be forestalled and prejudiced against their present Government and Governors; no otherwise then a vitiated stomack, as before noted, doth through its own inward corrupt humors contract an antipathy and loathing against wholsom food. In respect of the danger of such like company, and such like Doctrine, is that Divine saying to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. <hi>Can a mon touch pitch, and not be defiled therewith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make us the better apprehensive of the rise and derivation of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from Figure, we may take another instance in our learning to number also, when as those Characters of Arithmetick, which we call Figures, are used in an artificial way, as outward helps to enable the fancy and memory to make comprehension and numeration inwardly of such natural things as were themselves the original ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects, whereby, as well as wherefore, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber themselves were framed. For as we finde children, one with another, making it one of the first tryals of their abilities to pose each other in mental addition of numbers, so is it to be conceived, that as they did at first learn from fight and experience that any thing single was called <hi>One</hi> (because none can be presumed to know what <hi>One</hi> is, that was never by sense made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of any one thing) so come they by degrees to comprehend, from the posture and form of two, three, or four <hi>Ones</hi> placed together, that these are the numbers which do answer the artificial computation of two, three; four, &amp;c. And therefore having the question asked them how many two and three do make, or the like, they do at first help themselves herein by real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural figures, as by calling into memory the figure of any three and two things
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:55976:250"/>
so and so posited; and so, by comparing them do know what they amount unto. Or else they help themselves in their numeration by an outward figure, as by counting on their fingers, or the like. And hence it is that other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives are very little apprehensive of numbers, because they are so little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive and intent on Figures. For although from sight they are loosly able to configurate and remember the forms and shapes of such particular things as they account of concern, yet want they both time and inducement to remember what kind of figure three, four, or five of these did make when they were placed together, which is the prime way whereby fancy doth measure discrete quantities. From whence we may conclude, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gebra is more natural and solid then Arithmetick.</p>
               <p>Some persons can remember great numbers of strange words that have no import or figure, but they do onely, as Parrats, remember them as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed from syllables and tone of delivery. If this be done by children, they must repeat them in the same order they were heard: In which case, the brain succeeding in its motion according as it received impression from the articulation of the several words, doth then perform that office which is called Memory. But some can also repeat them out of that order, as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or the like, and can also remember and give an account of multitudes of different things seen presently one after another, in a different order also to what they saw them in; the which cannot be done, but by such as have attained years of ripeness; who, by that time have framed artificial common placs and Receptories in their brain, whereby to help themselves in the art of memory. Which art we find may be holpen and attained by the use of outward Figures, directing men to fancy common places of this kind, even as Arithmetique and the art of numbring is holpen by its figures: and we now see Books written on this artificial way of recognition, by proposing Schemes to that purpose.</p>
               <p>But usually boys, in repetition of a lesson, or something without Book, or any thing which they understand not, are holpen by memory of the different forms of some of the letters, lines, and part of the leaf, where the same is set down. Insomuch, as the remembrance hereof, all along, directs them in repetition of what is therein contained: Even so, that they can tell you what page, and part thereof they are now saying; and when the memory of this figure fails, the other fails also. And so in all other things whilst a Figure can be held, it serveth the understanding as an index for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and farther discovery of things accompanying it. But all discourse and arguments upon subjects not figurable, produce nothing but mazes and intoxications, as it fareth in some metaphysical notions and specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>By what hath passed we may know what things and arts are the objects of Science, and what of probability onely. For as they depart from controlment of sense, they depart from Science; and if they come to be entertained as affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, upon repetition and authority only, they must take their hazards to be more or less true and reasonable, as these figures were more or less fit for them which the party makes use of in his fancy to conceive them by; for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of abilities in apprehension of abstracted things wil be in choice of fittest Figures. For example, as we have helped our selves in the conceipt of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55976:250"/>
bodies and their postures and Motions, by representing them in globes and spheres (by remembrance of whose shape and linemeants, we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and conceive the others; for so, if we would examine the question of diurnal motion (between Copernicus and others) we are then fancying ing the Earth and Heavens turning round, as we have seen these Globes do.</p>
               <p>And so, to make us mindful and observant of matters of high and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial import as Coronations, Ordinations, witnessing of Deeds between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and party, or the like there are certain remarkable tokens exhibited unto the eyes; by whose order and sensible method of performance, the thing by them expressed comes to have proportionable esteem in our fancy, above other things that have not such ceremony used about them.</p>
               <p>Nay, of such force are these sensible expressions, that Religion it self would soon vanish without their use in many things. For although all our outward worship and expression of devotion and obedience, as Sacraments, Prayer, Alms, &amp;c. may be called Ceremonial (as they are but expressions of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward root of charity and love of God, we have in our hearts) yet must they be all acknowledged as necessary, to the quickning &amp; supportation thereof. And so again, to the supportation and enlivening of these, must such Ceremonies as are unto them proper, be allowed also; our minds and devotion being not otherwise able to conceive and attend what they are or do import.</p>
               <p>And as for those that do so bitterly inveigh against Ceremonies as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions (for such they must be, as heretofore noted (if any be) they are not themselves able to keep up their own devotions without them; and although they make not so much use of expressions to the eye, they requite it in sedulity and constancy of what is performed by the ear, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Sermons and other select phrases of theirs, as Papists do their prayers upon beads, serves with them to the like end, namely, to keep their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in exercise.</p>
               <p>Besides, all men, to secure themselves against this strong and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection of fear, must always be ready, according to the pressure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in their consciences, to encrease the other affection of hope, by all such actions as they conceive to be their duties; which prevailing upon, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into affections, by itteration and custom (and so much the sooner and more firmly doing it, as they are more sensible and methodical in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) we need not wonder why those that most decline and cry out against Ceremonies, and Set-forms of Worship, as superstitious, are themselves most superstitious; that is, most fearful and scrupulous of having (in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or in any particular) served God, so, or otherwise then they ought: for as there is no comparison (in assurance of a work done) betwixt those evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that flow from sight, and those that come from hearing, so (the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of holy duties consisting in actions) there must remain greater secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and satisfaction of conscience, to him that hath performed in most sensible, solemn and orderly manner, those duties he conceived were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, then to him that imployeth not himself in practise of his devotions, in such serious and deliberate form.</p>
               <p>To search a little more nearly into the cause why affections should be so strongly raised in us from reiteration of Tenents, and inculcation of Doctrines received from others only, of which we never had experience in our selves, nor are impressible from proper Figures, we are to consider, that although those collections can be only properly called Science, which do arise from
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:55976:251"/>
real figurate and perceptible objects, and were thereupon gathered into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thence into affections, even because in this case onely the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (in their disputes amongst themselves, and also for the satisfaction of others by tradition, and giving a reason or demonstration of things) may have recourse to the brain, to receive a judicious and deliberate determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to such evidences as the senses have there laid up, yet, as to the introducing of an affection, the often repetition of any thing to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Classis of hope or fear, prevails towards the belief of what is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon offered and presented, in as high manner, as if it had been impressed by a figurate object of its own; nay more, in all likelihood, because the ground and reason which it takes for its support, to wit, these passions of hope and fear are there strongly placed and proved already: Whereupon, being set so much onward on his way, as towards affirmation and proof, there is nothing can hinder its progress towards assurance, but plain sensible contradictions, or strong preoccupations.</p>
               <p>As we formerly instanced how a repetition of strokes, made by an Egg or other like thing on the forehead, would by degrees make as great a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor as one greater blow given by a stronger or harder thing: so may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive onward, that by successive continuance of these strokes, the same may be still more raised, untill it exceed, by far, that other swelling taken from the one only stroke: especially when it is to work upon a tumor and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion already made, like as Tenets and Doctrines usually doe; insinuating themselves as under the consent and command of prenotion and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already conceived and assented unto, by the help of Similitudes, Types and Figures.</p>
               <p>That blow which Logick gives with its conclusion from premises newly represented; however it may, for the sudden, strongly affect, by its more pointing and entire stroke; yet can it not raise an impression or swelling, answerable to those repeated blows made upon the affections and passions themselves; whereby, as building upon a groundwork already made and laid, it may well be supposed to proceed more thrivingly and assuredly for setting up a compleat Fabrick, then can be expected from a Figure and Idea impressed by it self; which must, on the other side, be supposed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually declining in its presence and force in the fancy, for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression or repair. For a Syllogism can give but one blow, and so depending on figurate induction, cannot produce higher assent then they can yield; which in wise men may be by observation contradicted, and by fools, for want thereof, unapprehended. Whereas relying and grounding upon the strength of affections already made, a discreet pressure can never fail of receipt and encrease.</p>
               <p>Logick must clear his way to the will by the understanding, and must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Indicative mood before it can make use of the Imparative; when as those things that enter as Rhetorical impressions, by their insinuation and mixture with those affections and passions that do already rule and command us, cannot fail of a constant power to govern &amp; guide us also: and thereupon they, depending not so wholly on sense, but being usually above its controul, are not in like danger of a defeat by a negative from thence. For Logick must assertain us by the rule of <hi>all</hi> or <hi>none</hi>: whereas the other needs but look like truth, and, by joyning with that which hath been so fully assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto already, stands always generally proved, where it is not totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="469" facs="tcp:55976:251"/>To prove that there is a God, a Resurrection, and future judgement, and the like, faith is enabled, by absence of negatives from sense, by degrees to silence doubtings, and to contract a positive assurance. In which case when that which, from authority or report of others, or conceit raised in my self, is at first apprehended as a thing that may be: it will afterwards, through absense of dissent or denial, shake off its first state of doubting, and become as a certaine conclusion of that which most assuredly is: when neither experience in my self, nor sufficient aurhority elsewhere, doth or can demonstratively contradict. Demonstratively, and highly demonstratively it must be also, after such time that this opinion hath once fastened it self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these prevailing affections. Even as we find that children will be so far scared by formidable tales, and the apprehensions of such objects &amp; things as they could never from sense have notice of, as to avoid being in the dark, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, or the like: And although these conceits were first entertained from the ungrounded reports of such persons as are of much less credit with them for ability and learning, then those that do contradict it, yet can it not take off the prevalence of that which hath so steady a support within, and hath not strong experiments to contradict it from without.</p>
               <p>This steady and effectual way of prevalence, it pleased the All-seeing providence to make use of in the propagation of the Gospel it self, divine wisdom never overthrowing nature, but by his grace steering and directing her. For although, at the first, for the remove of pre-occupation, and making an impression in the hearts and affections of men, he did extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily appeal to sense by miracle, yet had the encrease of the Christian faith its ordinary and next dependance on this effectual way of preaching, even as that had again on the efficacy of the holy Ghost. Towards the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof, as well in the first receipt, as growth afterwards, it pleased God Almighty also to make that natural thirst to be always living, and that imbred sense of Morality, (accompanied with that continual humor of each mans adjudication for his own merit, and for the demerit of others) to serve as steps and degrees whereby to enter, as well as preside in the belief of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and that in a more high and steady degree of energy and effectual operation, then could be done by any doctrine brought in, and made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on such philosophical disputes as were then raised in the Grecian Schools. For although it be not hard to prove both a Deity, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Christian faith by such like disputations as S. <hi>Paul</hi> once used in the School of <hi>Tyranus</hi> (which may also be sometimes necessary for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of such as are capable of impressions that way soonest) yet considering that even the wise and best learned are swayed by natural affections as well as others, it is not to be doubted, but that the reliance on these two mastering passions of hope and fear, would render the instructer to be most generally and steadily prevalent, even by proposal and pressing upon them rewards and punishments of so great height, as were above the degree of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer comprehension.</p>
               <p>In which case of exaltation of, and pressure upon these affections (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of fear) we shall be often drawn to seek or avoid benefits or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which are neither present, nor can have other sensible assurance that they will be; and in the mean time, stand neglectful of those which sense it self demonstrates both to be, and to be formidable. For there is none that can have equal assurance of the reality of Purgatory or Hell fire, as of that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55976:252"/>
which is in his kitchin, yet, by reason of this so often and pressing presenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof to the fancy; and so to the affections by fear, he will, through the instigation thereof, have his will inclined to take notice of that which he believes is most to be feared; and so consequently will prosecute or avoid all those courses which he is made believe will acquit him of the danger hereof.</p>
               <p>These things well considered, there will be good cause found, even in reason also, for that prevalency and spreading ability which attended the Professors of the Protestant Religion, over those of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For those more nice and retired speculations of the Schoolmen could not, with all their fine subtilties, so accurately delivered in their Books and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, be reasonably presumed half so efficatious for conviction in those things where reason was but subservient, as was those more familiar insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Protestant Preachers applied themselves unto in their sermons, made suitable to the affections of their present Auditors. For first, there are more that hear Sermons; then read Books; and again, the Preacher can better know and distinguish the temper and inclination of his Auditory, then the writer can of those that shall read him: And besides, there is a great efficacy to be attributed to elocution and gracefulness of delivery.</p>
               <p>And in the sub-divisions of Protestants again, we find that side still most prevalent and encreasing, that is most sedulous in this course of Preaching also: and that also in the plainest manner. For that language and exact me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that would hecome a Sermon made at S. <hi>Maries,</hi> would be unfit and ineffectual to be used in a Country Auditory: In the first it is expected he should be exact in his observation of Order and Scholastick Rules and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; whereas he that makes a Sermon, or writes a Book of a vulgar address, it behoves him to be more copious and plain in his delivery, even so far as he conceives his hearers or readers not fitted with pre-notion enough to conceive and understand him in a more compendious and exact method; and in case he find them possessed with strong aversions and pre-occupations he is then to enlarge himself, and to make use of repetition and inculcation of Doctrine; whereby he may be able to convict at several times, and by degrees, such as could not or would not be won at once, and on a sudden; the which I hope may serve as an apology for my self in those itterations and ways of pressure I have used all along this present Treatise; by which or by <hi>transferring and reflection on my self,</hi> if I have become <hi>a fool</hi> for truths sake, and for conviction of such <hi>as are puffed up against one another,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Christs Ministers</hi> too,<note place="margin">Cor. 4, 1, 10, &amp;c.</note> I am not wanting of good Authority and presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therein.</p>
               <p>But to return to the discourse of Figure, although particular words did arise from, and were made conceivable by particular figurate things and their accidents, yet when we can make notions and sentences, by joyning parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular words, it is because many figures may be by use so brought into one, as to be conceived all at once; even as the whole story of any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are several figures painted, may (by often sight) be brought into one fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in our fancy, in such sort as if it were but one figure, as it is now but one whole piece.</p>
               <p>And as again, in this whole piece or figure we are able to distinguish, upon occasion, the several figures therein one from another, according to their several postures and scituations; so, in each figurate body, these adjuncts
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:55976:252"/>
of Number, Scite, Habit, Proportion, &amp;c. are but parts of figure it self, as constituting his whole form. Nay motion it self is not otherwise conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then as altering the Figure of a body from what it was while, it was rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quiessent: And therefore as any of them are change, the whole figure must be changed also, in regard the lines from thence issuing to our sight, will not be the same they were before. Whereupon it will also fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that as that party shall never so little alter his standing, or divers other persons, shall be beholding the same object, it must: by means of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral lines issuing from the diversly scituated parts thereof unto the eyes of the several beholders, put on a differing representation of shape and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, except it be in pictures, or the like, which have such real levels and smoothness, as not to make an alteration in the return of the beam through inequality of the object.</p>
               <p>As words and figures, so Sciences collect into totals in our fancies, under the general notion of good and bad, and useful or not. For we can no more seriously consider any thing without respect to our selves, then we can see with other mens eyes, or judge of them by their reason, for particulars had their admission through hope and fear, like or dislike. And from hence it is we find that subjects (especially such as look not to have share in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery of them) are ever finding fault with the execution and rigour of the Laws, and will ever like those Laws best that themselves may interpret and mannage. And hence it is also that Merchants, and such as propound to raise themselves by trade and action, will not be brought to attend the discourses and speculations of schollers and contemplative persons: nor they again descend to the imployment of the others, each of them having long fancied their honor and benefits to arise their own way soonest: which they now apprehending themselves skilful in, are not to be expected so far to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their intention of benefit their own way, as to divert to an imployment that can but betray their ignorance.</p>
               <p>Although, as we said, knowledge flow from sense, and beasts have them in equal number with us, it will not follow that therefore they should be as wise. For first they ordinarily come short of us in quickness of feeling: and although they have equal acuteness of sight, yet they usual trust to smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as aforesaid, which can yield little observation or variety, but chiefly they want time to learn: for they are at their perfection before children (of like years) have learnt any thing. But most of all, they want so much quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sense, by reason of their hard breeding and thick senced skins, as to make them sensible of want. And again, their appetites are so few and cold, that they want spur to enquiry, and so to knowledge. Which last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration appears in Innocents, who are always laughing, and so far pleased with what they get or see, that they put not themselves forth to any enquiry after the possession or removal of any thing, whereby to encrease their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>Though this stupidity have its original cause from numbness of feeling, as beasts have (for we find that they will endure pain or smart better then wise folk, who are commonly thinnest skinned) yet the nearest reason is easie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and satisfaction. And as we see beasts of prey to be the wisest, of such as live not with us, because their food is of hardest acquisition, so of those that are domestique, those that through necessity of getting food from us,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:55976:253"/>
do observe us most, are consequently most crafty. For craft is but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wisdom, as theirs is: which reacheth only at getting food, or avoiding of blows. But wisdom beasts cannot have: for it must be a general know and compleatness of comprehension, in some measure proportioned to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ability. For as all things in nature are dependant upon one another, so no one can be throughly known without something be known of all: in such sort as nothing may be left to stand so far wanting or negative, as to the spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Method.</p>
               <p>And therefore as in the Mathematicks, he is to be held for the ablest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect or Engineer, that, through natural sufficiency and foregoing obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is endued with a capacity to retain, and most exactly to comprehend in his brain the entire and precise models and methods of several buildings and engines, whereby, upon occasion of erection of house or engine, he may be able out of those frames and plots conceived in his fancy, by way of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, and out of knowledge of the true nature and use of materials, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive afterwards such a house or engine as may correspond with his end and desire, or to know whether it be feasiable or no: Even so, in matters of polity also, they are to be held as the most sufficient artists that, being most knowing of all those several parts whereof the political body is framed, and of their true nature and use, can frame to themselves the largest and most comprehensive methods and schemes of government; even such as by an entire configuration may include each several rank and order of men, so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of and set on work, as that the whole political frame or building may be held up unto that way of work and rule which is fittest for it. Whereas he that will go about to contrive an engine for motion, or the like, without precedent knowledge of the Trochlick and Statick principles, and of the true natures of those materials whereof it is to be framed, and without full and exact comprehension of every part useful and necessary to his work: or he that will undertake to reform or set up a Government without fore-conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the true differences and properties of command and obedience, and of the natural tempers and inclinations of men in their several orders, and how they may be made appliable and useful therein; and who is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so entirely comprehensive hereof, so as in his Scheme or Model, to place every one in such a proper station, as by union and application of endeavour, the whole frame may be preserved and kept in motion, without neglect or leaving out of any, or suffering them to croud one upon another, even he shall find himself as much mistaken in his Politicks, as the other in his Mathematicks.</p>
               <p>And the danger of falling short, and running into mistake, is by so much the more to be feared in making schemes and methods of this sort, then of the other, by how much we are less capable of autoptical figures and means of connection and juncture here then there. For he that is to frame an engine, cannot but from sight and experience be informed how one board or piece of wood is ordinarily joyned to another, by taking part from one and part from another, and so making them even, and as it were one intire piece; and also how that is holpen on, and upon occasion farther secured in fastness and strength, by pins, nails, plates of iron, or the like. Whereas, to the framing of Polity and Society, it is not so easie to conceive how the natural implantation of love, is by Precepts of Religion, enjoyning <hi>to bear one another burthens,</hi> made efficacious for fastening of one man to another; and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:55976:253"/>
how again the application of divine and positive Rules and Laws, like pins and bolts, for the farther and more orderly securing of this political fabrick and structure, are necessary to be applyed also: for accomplishment of the entire frame, according as he that hath charge and oversight of the whole work shall think fit.</p>
               <p>Vulgar capacities can easily make to themselves a representation of a King riding abroad, and occasionaly righting or relieving of a single person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these and such like stories use to be figured and represented in Tales and Ballads; and they can also, because of instance in themselves, and their own prompting desires and hopes, be able to raise a figure of two persons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing before him in his judgement seat, to give sentence between them, in like manner as the two harlots are painted before <hi>Solomon</hi> his majestical Throne; when as yet, it will be very hard for such as have not been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in Histories, and often ruminated on the causes of Civil disturbance, to fancy how the whole people may be divided into two parties and factions, even as it were two persons; and how in that case there is no way to peace, and to prevent the danger of the whole by their quarrel, but by their joynt submission to the same Soveraign power also.</p>
               <p>But most of all they want prenotion enough to conceive, &amp; wariness enough to consider, that the most common and usual way for men to be lead into these sidings and divisions amongst themselves, and into associations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections against Authority, is from the doctrines of dis-affected persons vented in private Meetings and Congregations. In which case, to hope that the seeds of separation and discontent shall not be farther sowed by such as from dislike of what is already publikely taught and allowed, have already begun and set up this division, is as if one should permit those fires that used to burn publickly on the hearth of his house, to be now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into several corners thereof, on belief that, in requital of this liberty, it will now be neglectful of its own nature, and amidst variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible matter, obey him, saying, <hi>Good Fire, burn so discreetly,</hi> as not to endanger that Fabrick wherein thou art maintained.</p>
               <p>So that as men, from the time they begin to be apprehensive and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of morality, do stand affected with a different sense of honor and conscience, so do they accordingly proceed to make methods and collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards the satisfaction of those strong affections of hope and fear, and that in their several kinds. In which doing, as we come to attain knowledge and discovery in the nature and course of things from the instigation of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to attain satisfaction, so do we differently attain wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as these appetites and affections do differently, engage in discovery, and in ploting of means and methods for attaining them, and do more hardly or easily arrive at satisfaction. So for example, a fool can neither be much or stadily covetous or ambitious (especially the letter) or indeed have much of any virtue or vice, which grow chiefly from society, because things of Society are by him little regarded and understood, farther then to the outside and pride thereof: and so also must want virtue or vice, because so far as he wants understanding, he wants will.</p>
               <p>So then it should seem necessary that the concupiscible and irascible appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites should precede knowledge; and that I must have sense of want before I can have instigation to attain the means of content. For he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and cannot give a reason of his content, is a fool, and the more content, the more folly, and the less hope of wisdom: and the more sense
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:55976:254"/>
of want, the more enquiry; and the more enquiry, the more wisdom: And therefore as the proverb is true, that of an unknown thing there can be no desire, because (as before shewed) observation and knowledge of particulars do grow into affections and appetites, so is it true again, that of undesired things, there can be no knowledge, because none will contrive or invent any means to attain any thing which they have not first a liking unto. But as Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is generally <hi>found of such as seek her</hi>; so, in every particular, men are more or less knowing and crafty, as their desire to the thing hath made their diligence and attention to exceed.</p>
               <p>And towards our instigation to knowledge and discovery, we are much holpen on by the humour of choller; for by its irritation, we are kept, as it were, awake and intent on objects, and provoked also towards action. But then again, for wisdom and moderation in our actions, we are beholding to the humor of melancholly; for by its dulness and fearfulness, we are brought to hesitation and advisement.</p>
               <p>Hence we may learn what insinuations are best for youth, towards their proficience in wisdom; namely, things of hardest acquisition, and that have their benefit arising through engagements to largest enquiry: And these are chiefly sense of Religion, and sense of honor, for these oblige us to diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and search in all things, and all the circumstances of them also; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as nothing can be looked upon but as through these considerations, both generally, and differently concerning us in our benefit or harm. And these two may well go hand in hand, fixing them upon right objects, that is, works of Beneficence and Charity; for as Conscience directs us to love, and to do good to our neighbour, in obedience to God; so doth honor prompt us to do the like, by encouragement and direction of the Laws and Rules of our Prince and Country. By these means all engagements will be taken in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause intervening, with their concerns, in all we do, we shall in those secret things and occasions where honor cannot reach, be tyed by conscience to hearty performance also.</p>
               <p>But then we are to consider, that conscience is of far more advantage to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge then honor; and that, not only, as more strongly terrifying and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, but also as more universally doing it. For there are more things which in conscience I stand bound to perform, then those which honor takes notice of: whereas there is nothing truly honorable, but what conscience doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and accompany, even as its best guide and surveyor. And this espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in matters of society, and our moral deportments therein, because men, out of interest or prejudicate custom or education, may make things honorable which are not, and may also make that honorable at one time which was not so at another, the which may prove thereby also dangerous to mislead us in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of duty and obedience. Whereas, by a due regard had unto conscience, we shall be always kept both upright and steady.</p>
               <p>Yet then again, by that which some call Conscience, men may be both kept and led into error; for if Religion be made to consist on a few slothful obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, or if, by dividing mens duties, you separate some of them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious tye of conscience, and so make their concern less: Or if lastly (through flattery) men be made proud of what they have already, by too soon assuming to themselves the title of Saints, or believing they cannot sin or fall away, or the like; then, I say, knowledge must want of its extent, by how much each one is more easily satisfied then otherwise he would be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:55976:254"/>And from hence, we seldom find great heirs, notwithstanding the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage education might afford them, become so eminent for wisdom or ability; as those whose harder breeding and greater wants, engage them to invent and study means of supply and encrease; for the first, thinking only of enjoying what they have already, grow proud, without search of more honor.</p>
               <p>So for Religion, too strict relyance on set tasks may well induce sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; nor it is not zeal alone that can attain wisdom, because it may be too implicit and negligent; that is, it may be placed in the observance of a few private directions and precepts, and not in the general observation of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and charitable actions, according to the Laws and Rules of his Country. And therefore when many men, appearing of great tenderness and scrupelou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, are yet known to be fools, it ariseth for that they (as all fools else) are slothfully implicite, and want such general scrupelousness or enquiry of their own as they seem to have. For when, they with most ardency, enveigh against the opinion and practices of some other person or order, it is but out of impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite belief of others, and not out of precedent enquiry and satisfaction of their own; no, not in these very things they practise or condemn: And their devotion being still fixed but upon a few observations, and the rest carelesly rejected as abominable, they must so far want wisdom, as they want general zeal and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and can (at most) be but religious craft. And therefore as in covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and appetites of less general engagement, their discovery can amount to no more then a stare of craftiness; even so, when these greater engagers are not closely followed, they produce neither wisdom nor craft in any perfection.</p>
               <p>We see then, that to resist affections and passions altogether, is to dilete our natural and individual beings. For if the diffused observations of things should not at last collect themselves into affections, it would not be possible to have any promptness towards pursuit &amp; desire, for want of present appearance of former particulars therein concerned, or to have any steady rule for discourse within, for want of union and agreement amongst the notified observations towards determination: but they being now transmitted into affections, carry so general and ready a sway in judging and willing of all things else, that it is not to be supposed that the doing or not doing, having or not having of any thing, can be equally sought or avoided, and not differently, according to the degrees of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation from them proceeding.</p>
               <p>And from this ground do passions proceed, which as they rise from affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as being heightned from extraordinary concern in objects, so is one passion generative of an other. And therefore the wisest men (although it be part of their wisdom to conceal them) have the most and most eager passions; which may be easily proved bp their breaking out upon pressure or sudden occasio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, wherein discretion cannot, or is not warned of concealing them.</p>
               <p>Affections work more inward, passions more outward, because I must like or dislike first, before I can act accordingly; and therefore mens affections are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom truly to be discovered, but by their passions; even as those again are best by their actions.</p>
               <p>Actions without passion, differ from passionate ones but in measure, for all proceed from affections; the first only proceed from affections counterpoised by comparison of one to another, which we call discourse and reason, these from one violent affection alone.</p>
               <p>When the affections move toward the enjoying any thing, called desire, the prosecution outward is accompanied with the passions of joy, love, jealousie,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:55976:255"/>
envy, ambition, covetousness, &amp;c. and when they are averse to any thing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hatred, they are (in their outward means of avoiding it) accompanied with grief, anger, scorn, malice, revenge, &amp;c. Amongst all which Government finds so few steady supporters, as she is forced to make use of those including and commanding passions of hope and fear, under whose force she is able, by means of rewards and punishments, to keep the other within rule.</p>
               <p>We cannot forbid our selves affections by reason, for they and reason are all one: for as they did first proceed from the same root of in induction and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so when they come to provoke to action, they point at the same end, my particular good. But this consideration of my particular good may, from new observation, forbid the prosecution of an affection in some present thing. And affections, if they be violent, do turn into passions, and so sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake a contrary affection to stand up against execution, if his enjoyment be more then proportionable to the others, and this may be then called an inward reason for so doing, as a new argument or induction may be called an outward: For the many passed inconveniencies sustained through violent prosecutions, create in us a ready fear, to make stoppage till farther enquiry; but if against this pressing affection, no other affection appear then what have heretofore been remitted as unvaluable to stop the other, then this affection passeth uncontrolled afterwards, as to that affection; these two affections uniting and becoming one as experimented inductions do.</p>
               <p>And so affections become satiate upon use, when particular objects have not proficiency, so as to persist in pleasing by variety; even as observation grows satiate and weak, upon itteration of the same inductions and experiments also.</p>
               <p>So then, will differs from other affections as a double to a single, and is the issue of two reasons or affections aiming at precedence. For although the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er affection hath always mastery, yet is it not so entire as to the others total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, having no more pressure or prevalence for execution, then he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the less affection in the promise of good or pleasure, or in the threats of avoidance. And as a greater affection may over power a less, so many less affections or reasons may do one that is greater, or a greater affection may over power many lesser; the will enforcing execution but ratable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in difference. For though appetite (as appetite) covet infinitely, yet, upon conference with another reason or affection, the will assents and acts but so far and much of them as is attainable; and that, as it is conceived undestructive to other appetites.</p>
               <p>But then although each object and thing have its peculiar method and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for comprehension and estimation, yet because these lesser affections, for readier use and guidance of the will, do, through usage and custom, unite and place themselves in and under those general affections called Hope and Fear, it therefore falls out, that these two are the most general and express appearers in all we do: Appetite or hope of pleasure usually leading and provoking to to act, and fear of pain and prejudice to forbear, except where a sudden tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, or a sudden affright doth violently move to present enjoyment or avoidance, without all kind of deliberation; in which case a man may be truly said to be guided by passion, and not by will; that is, by the violence of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle affection. But generally, fear is the affection that keeps us in rules of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and moderation; for else hope would lead us to do all and every thing presented under the apprehension of good or pleasure. And without it, Religion and Loyalty would quickly be at a loss heretofore noted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:55976:255"/>And thus comes wisest men, that have most pressing affections and passions to have them ordinarily best regulated, because through knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the one is still used and made a stop to the others extravagancy, unless when the pressure to sudden execution, as we said, gives not time to consider them. But towards years, most affections lose their height, because the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their hindrance (through other affections) makes them press us but rateable to that abatement. And therefore cannot aged persons be so strongly in love, both because the object cannot print so deeply as before; and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the affection it self is now grown less that should entertain it. And the reason why young folks are not wiser at their strength of years and affections, then afterwards, is because their affections provoke in their full strength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any allay from fear and experiment of inconvenience: onely in age the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to that particular covetousness of riches, doth encrease upon a contrary reason, namely, experiment of convenience and use of them, having seldom any abatement to the contrary.</p>
               <p>By what hath been hitherto said concerning the rise and beginning of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and perception, we may be informed what to judge of that peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which the Peripateticks and Galenists do take against each other. For if the enquiry should be, in what part of us this discovery is first made, and by which part the knowledge of each thing is first attained, the answer must be, in the brain: because in that, as the first sentient, the figures of things are first impressed, and a discrimination made by comparison, before any of the more inward parts can be made consentient and stand affected therewith. But if the question should be, from whence that act of adjudication and determination towards action doth proceed which in us is the guide of all our essays? it must be answered, from the heart and affections; for from these the brain is instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to raise figures, and to continue and pursue them as as they shall be judged to be of concern by the other. For the brain may be said to apprehend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard objects, as they are in themselves separate and absolute, but the heart, as they are modal and respective to our selves; it is a different knowledge to know and distinguish a man as a man, and as he is a friend or enemy, or the like.</p>
               <p>Whereupon we may make the brain the seat of understanding and discourse, and the heart of the will; we may place natural Philosophy and the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in the one, and moral Philosophy in the other; because this points to good as the other doth to truth. But then again, as the desire to know is for honor or other benefit sake, and my desire of acquaintance and knowledge of things is for some ends of mine own; so these ends having place in some affection in the heart, it may, in that respect, be called the original of knowledge also; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of all that points to action. Again, as we instanced how outward senses might be deceived, so must we say that feeling it self cannot be called full and steady, as in the brain; but so far as the heart is consentient therewith. So that as the heart is the first and chief of life, so of feeling; for upon his resentment of any thing, as from experience, we have the highest assurance of the realities of things which our nature can afford.</p>
               <p>But if we respect the contemplative part only, then is it true that the brain is the seat even of moral knowledge also, because when any is to deliver any thing on that subject, that method by which he proceeds must be first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his own brain. To which, notwithstanding the affections must give trial and judgement; even by comparing and estimating how his own appetites and affections stand inclinable in the case. <hi>For as in water face answereth to face,</hi> even <hi>so doth the heart of man to the heart of man.</hi>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:55976:256"/>
The which is as necessary to direct him in making his method for the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Moral Philosophy, as a due consideration of the ability and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the present hearers or Readers, is pre-required to be rendred intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectual in both. For as he that is not advertized and respectful of the prenotions and comprehensions of those he would instruct, may, by too great assention in his discourses above their sense, be rendred but as if he had spoken non-sense, (by appealing unto and relying upon principles and premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which were never by them apprehended and granted (an error ere-while noted in preaching); even so, success, cannot be in moral discourses; much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, where the Instructer or Preacher hath not due knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the present affections and inclinations of his hearers. It being (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) the highest help and proof of ability, to excogitate and examine at home, by what steps and degrees he came himself to attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things; and by what inducements he hath been brought to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or aversion of them; and also upon what grounds and considerations he hath been again brought to entertain contrary thoughts, towards those things which he liked or disliked before; that so, upon a due comparison of his condition to that of others, he may make a true estimate and judgement of a method, and way of discourse and delivery, most fit for the others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction therein.</p>
               <p>From all which we may discover that some of late have been too inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately hasty in their censures put upon those ancient assignments of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge to the heart. There is no doubt but when God calls for, and claims mens hearts to be exercised his service and worship, and when <hi>Solomon</hi> prays for an <hi>understanding heart to know good evil,</hi> but that both of them did very well know whence our actions and indeavours took their source and original, that is, from the affections: and as our moral abearances, as well one towards another, as in carrying our selves in a right and steady course of subjection towards God, was the thing chiefly aimed at, and not Philosophical speculation, so may we finde reason why we should be so often minded of searching and examining our hearts; because from them, and the affections therein abiding, the issues of life and death did proceed. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, had <hi>Solomon</hi> been endued with a little more melancholy hesitation, and suffered the passion of fear to have been more often made use of as a stop and temperament to those jolities and enjoyments which in his greatness were so frequently presented unto him as the objects of hope and desire, and had not so inconsiderately <hi>trusted to his own heart,</hi> he would have proved himself more wise, then by that book <hi>written of all things from the Cedar in Lebanon to the Moss on the Wall.</hi> If he had I say but suffered the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential fear of offending God to have come in with an arrest of judgement, and so, by its counterpoise, call him to a deliberate examination before exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he would then no doubt have been as happy and famous for the wise guidance of himself, and for giving a right sentence between his Passions and Affections within and at home, as he was in that sentence he gave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Harlots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which case of advisement and deliberation, we may look upon the Brain as the Judgement-seat, where the Affections in competition, being by the heart summoned to plead, each one calls up and assists it self with such figurate Presidents and Examples as it thinks fit to imploy as evidences on its own side; the heart, as from a majestick Throne or Tribunal, may be
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:55976:256"/>
supposed to give that determination which is called Will.</p>
               <p>But it is by the way to be conceived, that when the Ancients attributed Wisdom to the Heart, as the seat of affections, and the source from whence appetites and actions did proceed, they then reputed it as the noblest and chief of the inward parts; and did not thereby intend to deny that service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, both for raising and resenting of objects, which come from the stomack, the Diaphragm, and other membranous and highly sensible parts; nor how other Affections, by long contract may be induced upon other parts of the body; even as that more natural resentment of the kinde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of, may be by this means well thought seated in the Liver.</p>
               <p>But now to make farther application of some of these Discourses; since Affections have arisen (for the most part) from society, and the example and imitation of others, it seems most requisite that (in society) such means of prevention should be used, that their exorbitance be not the destruction ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Our general custom of living is that which pleaseth us, even upon no other reason but because it is so, and is the ground of what in each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called Fundamental and Common Law, that is to say, common custom.</p>
               <p>Now although a man may love his own home or manner of living bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then another, yet to be confined to the same house, food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be but imprisonment, so the desire of Liberty (in sociable living) is the same with that of variety in private usages; and Liberty in Government is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but freedom of choice to follow mine own will in the various pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of mine own customs. And publike Law is nothing else but the restraint of this liberty in some particular usages. For the Laws of no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment prescribe to men all they shall do or forbear; but onely direct and stint them in such and such practises, wherein custom and affection to some things above others, were otherwise like to prevail upon them to publike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>And so again, since understanding is (as beforeshewed) so fallible, and must be so differing in its grounds, it will appear necessary, for avoiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and disturbance, that each one in things of common concern, do submit to a common understanding. For in this case we may regard the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and affections as they are conceived in the subjects, in their separate orders and factions, to be unto the Prince, as those single figurate objects or inductions conceived in each ones brain; which are not to carry any peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriness of conclusion, as in themselves, but to serve as evidences and instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of choice unto him how to proceed in the execution of them, as they shall be found agreeable and approved by his experimented method and rule of publike good.</p>
               <p>So that in all differences which shall arise between one order and another, or between party and party in the Kingdom, the King is, in the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, to resemble the heart in the body natural, in bearing sway and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation between the disagreeing affections and interests of his subjects; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner as <hi>Solomon</hi> did between the Harlots, as before set down. By which means subjects enuring themselves to a constant way of decision and reconciling of differences, and thereby also being reduced into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course in the observation of uniform and fixed Laws, Custom of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:55976:257"/>
and practise will make the same generally pleasant, upon the like reason that (through use) each mans particular customs were to him pleasant before: insomuch as it may be a doubt, whether all customs were not from positive Laws at first: so that men having, from the usual practise of their superiors commands, throughly habituated themselves therein, they may (at last) be thought to perform them with delight, the Law it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming exolete and forgotten, as to its letter, and affection and custom ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the upholding thereof. And this may seem the reason also why not onely one kingdom differs from another in Customs and Fundamentals, but divers places of the same kingdom do differ amongst themselves: namely, from divers Authorities which have therein born sway.</p>
               <p>And as in nature we may observe, that such Creatures as have dread of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are (notwithstanding) by cohabitation brought to liking of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers company: so when the first terrors of oppression and severity (which all Government is accompanied with) are by indurance made familiar, (as commonly coming under the rate they were feared,) it comes then to be so pleasant also, that all governable people will be found averse from change. Whereas else, if the publike and general way for decision of common Justice and good should be interrupted, it would procure sickness and disease in the body politick, no otherwise then obstructions do in our natural bodies. For as each body hath its proper constitution and habit, for measure and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its humors, so hath each kingdom its proper method and proportion of Laws and politick executions; the which, when accordingly followed, doth not onely keep that kingdom in health, but also, by their free passage according to custom, administer content and delight to all the members.</p>
               <p>And this is made most apparent in those two great objects of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Liberty and Property. It being evident that the happy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed estate in either of them, is not in greatness of extent and proportion, but in that pleasure which custom bringeth. For since the greatest possessors in these kindes have desire of addition, and since in the lowest possession natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral necessity is supplied, all the rest will be but as coveted for Credit or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor sake: which honor and estimation, being more sought by great and rich persons, (thereunto used) then by the low and poor, it will follow, that the condition of the servant and poorer sort of men hath generally more steady and equal content; and that therefore, the stating and measuring the publike Liberty must be referred to publike judgement and care; and that the grants herein must regard the real benefit of all, and not importunity of deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders onely.</p>
               <p>In which respect of judging and estimating of the reality and value of publike benefits, the Prince, as the heart in the body politick, is again to be looked upon as doing that other office, as in the body natural before set down: that is, by vertue that life and soul-ship whereby he animates the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to be ready to give true evidence and demonstration whether the things disputed and stroven for, are things that have real beings and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or are not fictions and apparitions, entertained by weak and credulous persons: and how far also they are practicable and conducent to publike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
               <p>Else it may happen, with easie Princes, as with indulgent Parents, who, to still their children, leave them knives or the like, which instead of use turn to their dammage: no otherwise then uncontrolable priviledges of subjects
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:55976:257"/>
turn to their ruine through civil dissention, as heretofore observed. And therefore we see by experience that those very children, that have their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Wills and Affections least satisfied, are, in the general, best pleased and contented, as being least crossed through least coveting: whereas those that have them most, are most restless and clamorous for more.</p>
               <p>For as that course and manner of life must be much more uniform and constant, that is, directed by Law or one universal method or order, then that which (having no certain and determinate restraint, but being at liberty to and chose as it thinks good, in objects that concern others as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) is left irregular; and must consequently have more crosses, by how much he deals with more objects and aims to hinder him: by which means, his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty proving his restraint, it were much better and happier for him, to have his present liberty subjected by one, to his momentany discontent, then, by taking it upon him, to have it crossed by many, to his continual torment. For as an unusual posture will at first displease, which yet, through custom of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during, may become as pleasant as walking it self: so when I, using liberty in many things, am thereby put to many postures of restraint, this must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually displease, no otherwise then when the parts of our natural bodies are put into any other method or posture; then hath been hitherto familiar.</p>
               <p>And as a natural body is not an individual longer then it is guided by a single Will, no more is the body politick this or that kingdom, that is guided in publick actions by more wills then one. And as again, the parts separated in a natural body do not by their absence demolish the essence of the whole, while those that remain continue subject to uniform direction, whenas, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seperate, they fal, like as natural divided parts do, into the general acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of corruption: even so politick parts fall into Anarchy, after their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the common Affection and Will: But while they remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereto, they will, like bodily members, gain to themselves joint content, and the reputation of symetry and comeliness.</p>
               <p>For if subjects do at at any time finde fault with their government, it is either occasioned through some new and extraordinary injunctions, in not keeping a way of Government constant enough, (which makes arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment so much cryed out upon), or else, because some other particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest or pleasure draws their appetite so strongly another way, that it grows weary and insensible of this. No otherwise then dogs and other creatures, who having the acquisition of food and generation only in pursuit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, stand affected with those smells onely that tend thereunto: through eagerness herein, being made unapprehensive of the danger of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into new pastures, nor delighted with the content and security they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy already.</p>
               <p>And the like as is said of liberty, may be said of property; wherein co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness provokes to the same inconvenience which too much liberty doth; for as one is covetousness of riches, so is the other covetousness of Will, and then as sense of want must precede desire, so all covetousness is poverty: and in these two cases men must be looked upon, as so strongly respective to their own interests and concerns, as hastily to fall upon schemes and methods of adjudication and contrivance, without any equal regard to comprehend or take in the interests of others. For if the partial desires of any party, order, or faction of the people should be suffered to pass and act for it self, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to liberty or property, or the like, it would soon be found that all others
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:55976:258"/>
would be thereby dis-impropriate and made slaves. And this upon the same ground that, in the course of Nature and Providence, the good of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and Posterity would be defeated, if that natural desire not to die, might be fulfilled to such as are for the time alive. For men that can, from the pressure of their own affections, well enough fancy themselves possessing of such a part of the earth, and of being thereon, as on a Stage, acting their parts amongst amongst divers others; cannot yet be (ordinarily) ingenuous and comprehensive enough to consider onward, (by enlarging of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure) that divers other persons are thereon to act their successive parts also: and that thereupon it must necessarily follow, (as well for order sake as to make room for others) that each person must withdraw when that part is acted which was assigned him; for as himself is now possessing of his fathers stock and possession, upon occasion of his death, so must he, by his death, make room for the possession of others, else the whole plot must take end and fall into confusion. Even so, in a stare, we may easily conceive how soon the constitution and welfare thereof would perish by disorder, if the Statute and determinate rule of the Soveraign were not inviolably observed: for subjects would forget to do as they would be done unto, in regard of those liberties they would leave to posterity and their fellows; as men, in nature, are usually inconsiderate, that since their Fathers and Progenitors death made way for them, so ought they to do the like for their children.</p>
               <p>In which case of restraining the general actions of men to be guided by the same uniform Rules and politick Laws, as natural Agents are in their courses, although the number of those that would be thereby offended, would exceed any number of men offended by particular crosses arising from prosecutions of their own devisings, because a far greater number were this way ruled then the other, yet let the discontented parties of the whole Kingdom, governed by no other restraint then what they occasionally make one upon another, be compared to those in any Kingdom of the same num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where an uniform constraint is imposed, and the persons in the first sort restrained will be more, and also (because of unexpectedness and want of order) their restraints will be more unpleasant in the kinde then the other: which hath now through custom of induration, lost the sense thereof, even as Millers and Jaylors, of those noises and sents they are used unto.</p>
               <p>For as we finde by experience, that the onely reason of the discontent of the subjects of one Kingdom above those of another, is for that there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in their Governments and Customs, it must be much more likely to happen between Subjects and the same Kingdom, where the different usages and customs must be in the continual notice of one another. And thus it fareth not onely in case of licentiousness (or where no Government is) but upon the like reason (when Authority doth make restraint in any thing) it will follow, that as this restraint is more or less, (that is, as the subjected par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have more or less possibility of breaking it,) so will the continuance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience be more or less also. For although appetite affect pleasure and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of each sort, yet, when such high difficulty or inconveniency shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the reasonable will doth soon decline it; and being thereupon turned to the choice of an object or action for the present less affected in it self, doth through custom therein bring it (as aforesaid) into pleasure; and make our Obedience prove our Liberty.</p>
               <p>And the very reason why men living under one Government are many
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:55976:258"/>
times affected with another, is not from unpleasantness of that uniformity they are under, but (on the contrary) supposing a greater uniformity of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons set by Law in that Government they commend then indeed there is. For in this case, usually considering their own contrivances onely, which must be regular; and that without just estimation, how the contrivances of others might, or do cross them, they mistake pleasure, by plotting an unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the fancy which can never be in act; and so come to pursue pain and trouble instead thereof. For it is not variety, as variety, that affects, but it is custom varied, which will imply custom and not variety: because to affect va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of customs, is to affect Custom.</p>
               <p>And therefore when men through the often contemplation and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of an Idea or platform of Government in their fancy, come thereby to attain an affection and Will thereunto; this comes no otherwise to pass, then if a remarkable object should, through often presentation in the fancy, come to pass in the extream of love or hatred, according to that relish it was at first entertained with, and thereupon be called sympathy or antipathy; even so also, this apprehension takes sometimes with men, as if by sensible practice and induction their likings had been won; and they may (thereupon) be as well said to be guided by custom to like and approve that unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced form, as that they live under: and it may be more, as having oftener and more attentively considered it and its benefits; when (on the contrary) the inconveniences and the pressures of the Government under which he lives, work so strongly towards the abatement of his affections, through the allay of fear, that he becomes not so intent in his relishes that way: and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, out of that general love every man carries to his own contrivance, the inconveniences of the Government he now fancies, are as far removed from his conceit, as sense.</p>
               <p>And it fares (in this case) with Government upon tryal, as with any other beloved and much desired object, namely that they never answer (in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that measure of delight they were coveted with, because the Idea in our fancy was the thing which we were in love with: which, as it was oftener seen in our fancy then the original in our sense, so was it pleasanter; and it was perfecter also, as being contemplated without those inconveniences, which are now found in the others enjoyment.</p>
               <p>And besides this, our senses themselves are cozened with the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things; for as each person (in their natural affectation of glory and reputation) is willing to appear publikely without faults, even so each Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (and the people therein) do their utmost to set forth their power, riches, freedom, peace, honor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but their sufferings they so strive to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, that we may be, and are as often deceived in judging a good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a happy and peaceabele State or Kingdom, as of a vertuous, rich, or honest person: or in discovering the many discords any marryed couple may have, by those outward kinde appearances that may pass betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The like reason leads for regulating and stinting men in the exercise of Religion: which, as it is taken of much more concern, must be made equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptable and pleasing to all by set and positive rules; or else, through necessary exasperation (which difference wil beget amongst subjects) their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents will be higher then in other things: encreasing, as it were, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Antiperistasis, until it break forth into the thunder and lightning of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:55976:259"/>
war and commotion. For to be divided in sect and opinion, must by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees turn into a division in Love and Charity: even because, as there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence between Faith and Charity; so is it, as well the beginner of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, as the highest proof of uncharitableness, upon unauthorized grounds and suspitions, to censure or condemn any one in respect of his judgement or belief: and if done by any towards that Church whereof they are members it is undutiful also.</p>
               <p>And this discord we shall finde arising, even from natural and necessary grounds also. For since the Will must follow the light of the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, how shall any be thought willing to associate and accompany those that do amiss? And since the reason why those of any Church do order their discipline and practise different from that of another, is but because they do proportionably differ in their belief and judgements in matters of Doctrine and Discipline, must it not then be presumed, that so far as the members of each Christian Church shall decline in their reverential regard towards their Churches soundness and veracity, even so far will they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently judge it fit to divide themselves by seperate Congregations, or the like; whereupon, since a Christian Church and State are but the same (as heretofore proved), it will soon be found that this schism in the Church will be the same with a revolt in the State; and wants but strength and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to actuate its dislike into a rebellion. For although they may at first, for a countenance to their actions, and to draw in associates, make use of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable distinction of Religious and Civil affairs, and so pretend that they intend not at all to trench on the Civil jurisdiction, yet when by strength of Allies and Confederates they shall once have arrived at their desired degree of power, it will then appear that they which at first did intreat to be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in relation to the Church, will now practise to be so in reference to the State too; and so by degrees to be super-eminent and command in both. For must it not be expected, that that thirst of ambition and rule (by them called Zeal and Charity) which first caused them to draw in sectators, as the objects and trophies of their glory and power, should ever stoop to any stint or moderation afterwards; whenas, in order to spiritual things and religious cognizance, it is so easie a matter to draw in State affairs also; and then, as Christs immediate Ministers, to preside in them without controle.</p>
               <p>And must it not then be expected, that that greater and higher tye of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and fear by which men are kept in obedience, as in a religious subjection, must also make them, in case of difference with their civil head, to seem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless of terror from him, as having but power over the body onely; and so consequently, stick fast to the obedience of the other against him. For if the separation was not at first made upon such grounds as were hazardous of salvation, why was it made? and being made and continued, how can it be expected they should be thought less? so that when opportunity shall leave men at liberty which side to follow, they will certainly choose that which they acknowledge for right in the main.</p>
               <p>Although some have in these cases stept in with an Apology, and thought tolleration of dissent from the Church allowable where a breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not presently made by schism, but the points in question were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speculative, yet will the example of the <hi>Arrians</hi> and others of old, and the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and others of late, truely satisfie us of the danger hereof; and how by degrees it will also arise to Civil faction and commotion. For
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:55976:259"/>
in this case as formerly noted, the discontented preacher is to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as fire, and the people in their natural thirst to dislike and insubjection, to be looked upon as fewel. And therefore although instance may be made, and hope may be gathered, that these Tolerations have not arisen to a Civil war; yet can none make instance, nor reasonably presume that publike discontents should not be hereby exasperated and encreased, even to a due height and fitness to break forth into open insurrection upon any fit opportunity: For as in our bodies natural, there is an amassment of corrupt humors and habits from intemperance and irregularity of diet, exercise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary cold or the like discover any thing in a Feaver, or other formal disease. Even so, they should do well to consider that Civil war and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in States and Kingdoms, are never to be feared to work to any strength or continuance, where there is not a precedent amassment of discontents: by which there may be a juncture made to obstruct the ordinary course of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment upon a revolt, and it is in this case to be highly observable, that the discontents of Religion, are ever chief and ringleaders. For as it is natural for mankinde to know, so also to be known to know; in such sort that we many times covet to know but through pride to appear knowing; it must therefore be presumed that the Authors and Abetters of each Sect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, seeking to make themselves famous by the number and quality of those proselites they shall gain from one another, that therefore, in order to this encrease, and that of their own reputation, they must vilifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the Judgement and Practise of their opposites; and thereby, of necessary consequence, draw on exasperation and breach of Charity; and if the separation be made from the whole Church it must introduce diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience also. For Faith, Love, and Obedience, as they have a natural Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence, where there is some equal respect carryed towards them, so have they as necessary a separation and loss, where any of them is slighted or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>For as that Love and Obedience we are to give to God, doth depend on that belief we have of his Power, Goodness, and Truth; so also doth that respect and obedience which we are to give to the Church his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative power on earth, depend on our perswasion of its veracity and Authority. So that if men can be once brought to to dis-believe her soundness or insufficiency, (even so far as her communion may be hazardous and damnable), Obedience to her in any sort is not to be long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>And therefore although God have reserved to himself the Prerogative of <hi>trying the heart and reins,</hi> and Princes can have no Cognizance and jurisdiction over the thoughts and belief of men, yet so far as these their thoughts and perswasions do by words or actions make open tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the seduction of others in a course of sedition, contrary to the rules of Charity, so far are they censurable by the present <hi>Higher Power.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.22.</note> And in this case Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Admonition will be proper unto them, <hi>hast thou Faith, have it to thy self before God:</hi> that is, let not the desire of eminence and practise in thy different judgement make thee neglectful <hi>of Charity and those things that make for Peace,</hi> as is largely in that chapter set down: but rather know that for this very end
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:55976:260"/>
thou art for <hi>conscience sake</hi> also to be subject to the higher power; as is also largely commanded in the Chapter foregoing.</p>
               <p>And although it be true again, that in many matters of Religion, Princes cannot command as Law-makers, and in their own names, as in more civil matters he doth; yet, as the supreme Magistrate entrusted from above with the interpretation and execution of these Laws and Rules, he may command under God, with the same authority which a High Constable, Lieutenant, or other Supreme State Officer, doth in the absence of himself. And upon the same reason that Civil Laws would be fond and useless things, if subjects should be thereby only told their duties, and not to have Magistrates to see them do it, and direct them in cases of doubt; the same would also happen, in the Laws of God himself: which, considering the blindness of our understandings, and aversion of our wills and affections to obey at all, as well as difference in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, have much more need of such direction and constraint. The Prince being always to be regarded as the living Law, that is to say, the life thereof; because Law without an Interpreter to give it understanding, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcer to give it will, is but a dead Letter; and (for the most part) use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
               <p>So that, since Laws cannot live or go without the two supports of reward and punishment, if there be not a present powerful judge to see these kept up, the performance of Law will be but arbitrary; for why should any fear a punishment, or hope for a reward from a present authority that is uncertain or unable. Nay, unto those very Laws which by God himself are sent for our Government, what from incredulity, and what from natural reluctance, little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance can be expected, whilst his <hi>Minister</hi> shall be thought to <hi>bear the sword in vain.</hi> For can men once find means to avoid his coercion therein, they are then left to the partialities of their own interpretations, to make them signifie but what they please. And then (considering the general infection of Atheism, and the wrong and partial conceits of divine retribution, what likelihood of terror or hopes of prevailing, when <hi>the evil day,</hi> or day of judgement shall <hi>be put so far from them?</hi> since experience tells us, present terrors cannot many times do it.</p>
               <p>Upon no other consideration then this, namely want of present appearance in acts of terror and Government, it doth fall out (as before noted) that the divisions and differences between child and child, and between subject and subject, do by degrees amount unto such deadly heights; they being nothing else but the mutual encroachments of censure and controul exercised upon one another, after an extemporary and occasional way of rule and authority, for want of a common and present superior Government for restraint of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in them all. For as it is most true, that each one stands strongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded towards the goodness of his own actions and enterprises (or else he would not do them) so must he of consequent dissent from those of others, and also do his utmost for reducing them to conformity with himself; which being nothing else but the execution of Power and Government, it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that such families and Kingdoms which are under such indulgent Parents, or milde and fearful Princes, must be perpetually in danger of such mutinies and quarrels; because, for want of those bands of reverential fear and respect towards him, that mutual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ye of love towards each other comes to be dissolved. For it being the nature of love (as all things else) to gather strength and steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55976:260"/>
by that confederacy and union which is made against it by an outward and common fear of disturbance, so must it fall out, that there being now no such binding dread of Authority kept up, for the uniting and associating of them to one another, through consent and fellow feeling of equal condition, that thereupon there will be time and oportunity left to those natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Censure and Rule to break forth to publike disturbance. For as the Prince or Parent shall defist, or neglect to make use of fear and power, (those his proper instruments to rule by) so consequently must subjects and children be supposed ready to take them up; and, in contention thereabouts, to forget and neglect their own equal ties of Love and Charity.</p>
               <p>And to speak directly, if Gods and Natures Laws have not a living coercive force for obedience (even as positive constitutions of the Supreme Magistrate) they will be of much less avail to guide us in outward deportments, then the Civil Constitutions of the Prince (without subordinate Magistrates) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their civil suites; inasmuch as the Prince (being more personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with us) might decide many of his subjects differences himself. And therefore as God would have all obedience to him go by the name of fear, and threatens even such large temporal punishments to the breakers of his Law, (as well knowing that we should be more certainly guided, by an affection of such universal and near concern, then by any other more private affection, which would be but of doubtful concern) so must it follow, that as this fear will be more or less, as it is more or less present, there must therefore be some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Minister for our good,</hi> or <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r wrath,</hi> to execute rewards and punishments here accordingly. For since, in this life, (in respect of reward or punishment executed by God himself) none is <hi>able to distinguish of good or evil of all that is before him</hi>; so that we may observe (with the wise man) <hi>that all things come alike to all, there is one event to tho righeeous, and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean and unclean, to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: As is the good, so is the sinner, and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> It must therefore be granted, that fince these Laws were made for our guidance here, they must have their living Magistrate here also, to reinforce them as to execution, in respect of those rewards and punishments which, in regard of his present Power, he is enabled to make use of.</p>
               <p>And therefore, in reference to this essential support and relation which fear carrieth towards the establishment of subjection and obedience, we may call <hi>obedience a correspondence ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>action, and deportment of the inferior, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the command of the superior, through the sense of duty and fear:</hi> For as sense of duty or conscience must keep up obedience, so sence of fear must keep up conscience. By which definition, as we may know how to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between that subjection and obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence which other creatures give, who obey out of fear only, and not of sense of duty, as wanting understanding to apprehend it; so may we also perceive that since sense of duty must bring on a submission of will, that therefore hope can be very seldom, and love ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made the proper cause of obedience, as heretofore noted. For hope of benefit or advantage to arise by any thing commanded to be done, being the proper end and motive by which the superior was led to make this his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and direction, it must therefore follow, that hope of benefit cannot be also directly assigned as an end to him that obeys.</p>
               <p>But here again, degrees are to be admitted and considered of, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Commander is more or less All-sufficient and powerful in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:55976:261"/>
or defective and obnoxious. When God commands any thing, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in himself be any ways respected as indigent, or necessitated for assistance to the atchieuing his designs (as to those very instruments and agents which are now commanded and set on work) even so the benefit thence arising, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally theirs, voluntary creatures may in the performance of his Edicts be well said to be sometimes guided by hope also; and that, not only because hope cannot be then so much esteemed the Commanders end, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeds; but also in reference to that greater power and readiness of reward and retribution which is in God above others.</p>
               <p>Next unto whom, Princes, as most representing him on earth in Office and Power, and as having honor their end (whereby in their commands to be kept from justling with their subjects in the end of their obedience) may be also said to have obedience given them with more willingness, for those very hopes sakes; or rather, because of hope, to be given with less reluctance; for there may be degrees of aversion in dislike of one Government more then another, but none of willingness towards the choice of any Government, as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, as we said, must make his steady reliance on fear. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, that in these very Laws and Edicts that do make their enforcement through hope and promise of reward (which are but very few in comparison of what build upon terror and punishment) they may be reckoned as grounded on fear also; as being but negative to that, and seldom other then promises of exemption or limition in the execution of Government and Power, so as not to proceed to substraction of some benefit, as well as to the imposition of some evil; as by those examples of promises of obedience made in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the Theoraty, and that made by <hi>Saul, of making his fathers house free in Israel, that should slay Goliah,</hi> and by observation of the usual constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Nation may appear. For as hope, as we formerly said, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without fear of loss and missing; so in things already possessed, fear to to lose is antecedent to hope to enjoy, and is thereupon its ground also.</p>
               <p>And as for that mixture and influence which love carrieth towards obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is to be considered, that when, like other irrational agents, we do by natural propension and instinct only, pursue in any thing those general rules of providence, whereby particular and mutual preservation is aymed at; in those cases men being looked upon (like other Sensitives) as involuntary, or in small degree so; the name of obedience is not to them assignable in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and strict construction; because, for want of a known explicite precept, and sufficiency of understanding to apprehend sense of duty and direction in relation to a superior power, and for want of understanding to discover that oeconomy and relation creatures bear towards God, as well as one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may thereupon be said to want, as well the tye of fear, as of love also.</p>
               <p>When again, or so far at least, as we do attain to angelical perfection of comprehension and understanding, so as throughly to know, as well all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral relations which creatures do mutually bear one towards another, as also that relation and respect they all of them joyntly bear towards God their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and original; in that respect again, as no external precept and direction seems needful to provoke to do or avoid that which its own understanding hath cleared unto it already, so may that performance of duty which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised and given in that condition, be called love indeed; which cannot be in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:55976:261"/>So that to man alone, as seated in a middle rank, between creatures irration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and throughly intelligent, this notion of obedience is most due; even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he, in those multitude of appetites raised from observation and converse with other things, and want of true knowledge of his reciprocal relation to other things, together with his and their joynt subordination and dependance on God, is in both respects to have his love and obedience led on and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by express Law and sense of duty: In which his middle station, as having here that more perfect comprehension which Angels now have, and himself shall hereafter have, but in part communicated unto him, he may also in some degree be said to be guided by love in those commands which he performes; and that, not only as led by natural and charitable propension, but knowingly and gratefully led by sense of obligation to God; even as also sensible creatures below us, and whom we have occasion to imploy, may in our discipline over them be stiled obedient, when brought to the performance of our wills by awe and terror. There being nothing but sense of duty and gratitude that can reconcile love and fear; because else, obedience and fear do (as in their own nature) draw on hatred. And in heaven alone, they shall be throughly coincident, when our inlightned understandings shall be able truly to apprehend Gods favour and our own steady condition of perseverance and continuance therein; and then only can it be truly said of us in our obedience, that <hi>perfect love casteth out fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it is to be considered, as was formerly noted, that all things at first, and while they are strange, do move to fear, and also to hatred and dislike, and that they do by so much the sooner and more strongly do so, as each sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive doth conceive that first seen or known thing to have more or less power to hurt him, and also apprehends it self more or less within the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As therefore experience of indemnity, and sense and experience of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and reward for yielding of obedience to this object of fear and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, doth by degrees abate of that, and make it looked upon as an object of love and goodness, so doth it therewith testifie, that love was but the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of former obedience, even as obedience was of former fear; and so farther also, that the love of the commanded is subsequent and dependant on the love of the commanding, and that, not for obedience and imposition of the command it self, but for his kind resentment and acceptance of the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers duty.</p>
               <p>So that then, to make a difference between that grateful return of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which passeth between equals, and friend and friend, upon the score and sense of good nature only, and that return of respect and service which any, as in the state of subjection, doth yield at the appointment of a superior, and as fearing punishment for defailance: We may farther say, that obedience is begun in fear, continued by sense of duty, and perfected in love; and also, that the terror for performance and observation of Laws, ought to be, and is still proportionable to the greatness of the Law-maker. And therefore, in the constitution and promulgation of the Moral Law, or ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we find those terrible apparitions made, <hi>that Gods fear might be so before their faces, that they sin not.</hi> As for promises, not a word then, as being but tokens of his love to such as had been regardful of this his fear. And so it must still follow, that those that are by office of command most powerful and terrible, are also soonest, and in the highest degree rendred most lovely in their service, as having (by reason of this power) their own ends
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:55976:262"/>
soonest sasisfied. Thus God, that hath no direct service to be done him here as to himself, is the best Master; and neither he nor others having need of our service hereafter, love and thanksgiving shall make up our obedience. In all which respects Princes are most resembling him of any any terrene Power; and so can most truly (of any) said to be served by love; which indeed they ought always to seek, but never to trust to.</p>
               <p>And therefore, since our observations (as before noted) come at last to be collected into affections, and that when these affections come to interfere one upon another, they are guided by the general affection called will: So it is also necessary for ceasing of strife in the publike body, that the affections of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar orders and persons, should be guideded by the publike will of the <hi>King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom there is no rising up.</hi> For he can only be supposed competent judg, which, and what affections ought to take place, and how far the granting to the desires of some, may stand with the desire and good of others. And none but he can be the common and entire sensory or centre of attraction and preservation; but subjects affections, being guided by several interests (even as they are severally collected in several persons) must make (in their dealings with others) several centres, which must thereupon be centres of opposition, that is of division and civil war.</p>
               <p>And as the will, so the exercise of passions (the necessary attendants of will) must be in him onely; for if anger and hatred be at private dispose in punishments, they will proceed too destructively; and (as having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard beyond self-consideration) turn to malice and revenge. And so again (whilst these affections are in prosecution) how may covetousness, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, jealousie, envy, &amp;c. make us (through partial respect only) to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon disturbers? whereas he that hath whole and equal concern, can no more proceed distructively to his subjects (in that relation of subjects) then to himself. For when publike good is crossed by any, his anger and hatred of the Author will be terminated in justice, as to any punishment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man can be too severe to himself; where he hath whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
               <p>And since (as we noted) observation and knowledge must arise from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; so publique good and peace being of nearest concern to him, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding must be supposed ordinarily more able to judge and determine what it is, then such as have private concern only to looke after, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in publike things, can only have craft. When as he, having his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and benefit intermixed and emergent from all things rightly and duly done towards publike benefit, must be supposed always intent thereon, even for his own interest and advantage sake. Whereby it is to be supposed, that he shall be not only rendred the most able in understanding and judging how publike expedients may be best attained and managed, but also, by reason of often observation of the consequents and events of things, and which of them in possession hath proved most beneficial and pleasurable and which not, he may be justly also esteemed as the centre of political consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as being enabled, in regard of his great share and general experience and presence in all publike dealings, to give the truest report of publique liking and inclination. For it is to be supposed, that political bodies have their proper genius and constitution, as well as natural ones have, and that
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:55976:262"/>
then he, as the life and spirit thereof, can best judge, and soonest disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how the humor of the people stand generally tainted and affected. So that when the inclinations and desires of subjects, in their dealing one with another, shall obtain his consent, it will then prove a coition towards the encrease of publike good: But so far as they shall undertake to act on one another without his liking or assent, so far will they rendred not only barren of any good issue, but ready also to be productive of those monsters of civil war and rebellion.</p>
               <p>And as thus to the resentment of the general affections of the people, so to the differencing and discovering of the perfections and beauties of separate persons in regard of excellency and fitness towards publique imployment, he is to be looked upon as the most proper and able judge of what is in that kind lovely also. For as external feature and decorum hath its excellency measured by conformity to the most usual figures and shapes of the kind, the which they must be acknowed the most able to judge of that have made the most exact and general observations, even so the perfection and fitness of publike ministers being to be estimated by that conformity which is between their breeding and ability, and those imployments they are to manage; it must thence follow that the Prince being most conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and interessed, and having again most general acquaintance and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of both publike persons and imployments (as being in himself both the perfection and epitome of such Officers, as well) as the centre of such offices he must be consequently thought the best judge of what persons are in this kind beautiful, and fit to be entrusted or rewarded with offices and badges of honor; the which we may call political or publike love.</p>
               <p>By conformity unto the Prince his commands and directions, as to a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examplar and copy, it will also come to pass, that there shall be such things stated as vertue and vice in morality, and righteousness and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness in Religion. For when there is a certain and determinate rule set down in both, according to Divine and Natural Precept, it will follow that that which comes nearest to it will be most vertuous or righteous, and that which most differs will be most vitious and sinful. And then, by reason of this uniformity, not only peace and agreement will be secured, but our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being for a while accustomed thereunto, content and delight will follow also. Even as (on the contrary) we see discontent, distraction and civil war, most frequently to follow those places, where least constraints to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is kept up. For there is a beauty and handsomness arising in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deportments, in keeping a method and order in them according to their rule and copy, as there is a fairness and comliness in writing according to copy also.</p>
               <p>We shall therefore, for conclusion of this quere, whether Government and Peace may be preserved without force or no, say, that since obedience, as obedience, will always displease, and since power and authority will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways affected and sought after; it will be evident that superiors shall be more or less such, as they are more or less endued with power and irresistability; and that, as power is necessary for the Governor, so is fear for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, as heretofore noted; even for the necessary preservation of those relations, according to that saying, <hi>If I be a father, where is mine honor, if I be a Master where is my fear.</hi> For although a willing and hearty service
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:55976:263"/>
be most acceptable, and onely rewardable (as to the doer) yet the benefit of others will many times be gained by the deed itself; Whereas a known impunity will, by example, and as it finds hope to attain the like, procure common detriment, both by neglect of the deed it self, and by common invitation to disobedience. But if the subject, from his own or others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, once find that his obedience, in respect of other damages and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements in the Princes power is unavoidable, he must be supposed even through discreet willingness to submit, and then through custom of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to arrive (at last) at a state of natural willingness in obedience it self, experience telling us that steadiest loyalty is in such subjects as have been used to greatest subjection, and most discontents and rebellions in such Families and Kingdoms, where children and subjects have been most free. And it will ever be a most certain truth, that that obedience which must unavoidably be given, will ever (in equal things) be more ready, free, and unreluctant, then that which may have hopes of avoidance.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION:</head>
               <p>BUt it is now time to have done, having perhaps as much tyred others as my self in these tedious discourses, driven so vehemently on to the cure of that evil, which, while men are men, can never enter into a steady thought should be wholly done. For when all is said, Government will have its faults; and when in the rule of nature, we see it sometimes come to pass, that the stobborness of the matter is such, as will not admit of that form which to her policy in general, or to the production of some more perfect creature were in particular species necessary, (but that pestilence, murrains, mildews, &amp;c.) to the destruction of men, beasts and vegitables; as also monstruous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect shapes (incident to the generation of each race and kind, do sometimes happen) why should we wonder at ineffectualness herein? when, besides mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there is a perpetual aversion of will in the governed; and (alas the while) the workmans skill or care in this, is too often so to seek, that, through his default also, the malady is increased. Since therefore nothing in this life can be to us perfect and without its inconveniences, we can only call that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment good which is best, and which, upon tryal, hath fewest and least settled mischiefs; as not arising from its form, but contingent accidents in its ministration; and this is that which I have propounded as the drift of this whole Treatise.</p>
               <p>Yet then again, as the many unavoidable diseases of our natural bodies, are not at all to discommend or excuse the Physicians care and pains for their mittigation or removal, so I hope in this grand disease of the politique Body (called Civil War) although I cannot attain to a perfect or constant cure, yet if the application of those remedies I have proposed, shall sometimes cause di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and sometimes mittigation, I shall have comfort in my labours.</p>
               <p>But in this (as all things else) we must leave the success to God, whose work alone it is, <hi>to still (as the raging of the Sea, so) the madness of the people.</hi> Even that mad and raging humor of liberty, which being blown to a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious height by the breath of seditious Oratory, as seas by the wind, it is none other then if (in our natural bodies) the allurement of our pallats should tempt us to that food which should bring us to a feavor. And as these surfeits seldom
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:55976:263"/>
come but from such things as are best, and then again loathing of that very thing doth follow; so in the politique constitution (though nothing more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and commodious then peace) yet nothing more incident to mans fickle nature, then, in a giddy thirst for variety, to grow weary thereof; which, as a thing bringing Kingdoms and States to their fatal periods, no otherwise then bodily surfeits and sicknesses do single persons to their natural deaths, shall we say that as they are permitted for the punishment of our sins (which we can never want) so to this end also. And then, shall we say, that not so much in consideration of ours, or our progenitors sins, as <hi>that the will of God might be made manifest,</hi> are these things befallen us? Shall we say, that since none (of themselves) can be called righteous or good, that it may therefore be a reason that wickedness and vice are thus suffered, as to the estating us good by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, and that even again in Government, as to the adorning loyalty and other civil vertues, disobedience and rebellion is permitted also; and to make us thereby more sensible and thankful when peace shall again be restored.</p>
               <p>But be the reasons what they will (our duties of obedience and submission being plain enough) it is our parts to look to that, and to leave <hi>these hidden things to God, whose judgements are unsearchable, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is ways past finding out.</hi> For sure I am, that however God for the punishing of a sinful people, permit their Princes, as he did <hi>David</hi> in the fact of numbring, to fall upon such unwarrantable acts as may bring on their punishments, yet can this punishment never warrant any active resistance of his Authority. Or be the King not good, as <hi>David</hi> was, but such another as <hi>Saul</hi> was, yet since he is our King, <hi>and the Lords anointed, who can without sin lift up their hand against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why should we be more impatient of enduring those punishments from God, that come from the hands of evil Kings, then those of pestilence, famine, or the like, that come more immediately from nature, since all come from the same hand, and to the same end, the punishment of our sins. And since God owns the giving of them in his anger, and the having their hearts in his hand, and turning them wheresoever he pleaseth, why should we think of resisting one more then another?</p>
               <p>Thus is wicked <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart hardned, and his subjects the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gyptians</hi> thereby plagued. And thus, as aforesaid, is good <hi>Davids</hi> heart stirred up to number the people, and these people thereupon punished with pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And who would have thought a three years famine so long after <hi>Sauls</hi> death, should be the punishment of surviving subjects for a past fact of zeal done by a King so long dead? Or that the house of <hi>Jehu,</hi> and his people by consequent, should be threatned with Gods punishment for the execution of that his justice upon the house of <hi>Ahab</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three hundred years after the fact done; when as yet the very fact it self was so plainly appointed and warranted by divine authority.</p>
               <p>In which examples of Kings sins being made causes of punishing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sins with plagues, pestilence, famine, civil war, or the like, I would know if resisting of Kings had not been resisting of God, or if any such thing could have averted their punishment, but rather aggravated their offences, by adding this rebellion against their Prince, to their former against God, and so breaking more of his Laws. For suppose the people never so innocent, as in some of the alledged cases may appear, or suppose
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:55976:264"/>
as all of us are ready to flatter our own hypocrisies, that neither we nor our Fathers have sinned, as to those punishments, but that the Will of God might be made manifest, Oh let us not resist that Will, who owns all the evils that befalls each City, that is to say publike evils; lest while we will not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, as he appoints, by a King in his anger, he, by suffering him to be taken away, should, by Anarchy, plague us in his wrath.</p>
               <p>In tender sense of publick Peace and Charity, and the blessed condition of the Peace makers themselves and those that are promoters and assistants in it, I shall now appeal to the Consciences and Judgements of all such as are wont to gild over their own Covetousness and Ambition with the shews of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Religion, and are so forward to kill all that will not submit and joyn in opinion with them: you that will undertake to controle Heaven in its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, and under colour of Tyranny or Usurpation, of wrong rule or wrong entry, will at your pleasure be withdrawing your own and others obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from your present Prince, give me leave to summon your thoughts to a serious consideration of all those sad consequents that must attend it, that by calling your self to an accompt before the time of that general accomptcom, you may be both eased in your own reckoning then, and have your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here eased of those sins and miseries which your stubbornness must produce. Suppose then that you, with all those fair declamations of Law and Justice, or of Religion and Zeal, which you, in your popular Oratory, are so copious and ready in, shall be able to seduce and draw to your party such a considerable number of your fellow Subjects, as to form the same into a Civil war, wherein thousands must lose their lives as well on one side as the other, suppose I say, these several parties through thy perswasion slain by each other in the height of uncharitableness should now present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before thee with their wounded and macerated bodies, and all besmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with gore and blood, and with grim and ghastly visages stare thee in the face as the horrid spectacles of thy confusion and amazement. But this is not all; seest thou that throng of desolate Widdows and Orphans, and of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate Parents, who, as in sacrifice of thy ambition or avarice, are by the death of each other bereft of comforts, and left to a necessity of dying while they live; and so the never dying monuments of thy cruelty and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Let the shrikes and yellings of defloured and ravished Virging and Matrons, the groans, the tears, the sighs, of such as are in every corner, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of civil war, murthered, plundered, imprisoned, or otherwise dispoyled of life, or livelihood; let all those arise to thy remose. If not, nor the thought of that Forrest-face which thy native country must now put on, in respect of that destruction which must be introduced on its goodly Edifices, Corn, and Cattel, can move thee, as in Honor or Charity, yet let Piety: Piety I say, if thou hast any, the sense of the Honor of that God thou seemest to worship, let this move thee to think how in these Civil wars, those publike Oratories and publike places of worship dedicated to his name, must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in danger of ruine and sacriledge also, and how then canst thou persist in a course that must at once destroy all bonds of Love, Loyalty, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that must at once, and that with so high hand, offer such violence, the utmost violencence in thy power, to thy neighbour, to thy Prince, to thy God.</p>
               <p>Doth not thy heart yet feel remorse? Heark, the Trumpet calls thee to the Judgement-seat of that great God himself, whose Honor and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on earth thou hast so often slighted and offended. Now for a Mountain,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:55976:264"/>
now for a Rock, to cover thee from the face of the all-incenced Deity. Dost thou not now finde that the common Cause of condemnation against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is made for living and dying in hatred and malice? and how many are there now eying thee as the Author of, and ring-leader in those Civil distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances where Christian against Christian have by thousands killed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the height and heat of uncharitableness? And seest thou not again how the sentence of <hi>blessed</hi> runs to the <hi>meek,</hi> to the <hi>patient,</hi> to the <hi>peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?</hi> &amp; while thou art setting forward thy trembling limbs, and stepping in, with an Apology for thy Rebellion, how hath new confusion seized thee, at the sight of that King and Prophet who did so often flye from his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Prince, and had his heart smiting him but for cutting off but the hemn of his Garment? what seest thou now? where are thy Texts of Scripture thy Pretexts of Law?

                  </gap>ssors, who, amids all those dismal persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even for the most righteous cause of all, and plainly so, durst not lift up against him that was but a heathenish Prince, but chose to follow both the Precept and Example of him, who is now in the highest Throne of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as a reward of his Patience. Oh horror of horrors, what is thy Judge become a party too; a Mountain, a Mountain, a Mountain.</p>
               <p>No sooner hath thy all-dispairing soul caused thine all confounded eys to sink and settle on objects below, but, oh torment of torments. Who is this that is now to be thy Prince, and under whose Dominion thou must now for ever live? Thou shalt not need here to study pretensions of Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression against thy Prince, nor invectives and standers against his Officers and Ministers. What is it which thou truly feelest now? Oh —</p>
               <p>If this be the expectation, as (without Repentance) it can be none other, of all that are promoters of civil disturbance, how necessary then is it that we should timously thinking of bridling our covetous and unruly appetites, and learn patiently to submit unto that Regiment and condition of life wherein Providence hath places us. When discontent of any sort assaults us to impatience, think we then, this is not our rest. No happiness to be here expected, all things in this life comes to us mingled; as well to manifest and draw down our acknowledgement of Deity and Providence for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of what is good, as to wean and withdraw our affections from this world to a better; in such sort that those very things wherein our greatest temporal preservation and good doth consist, are attended and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such as are of greatest mischief. From the food with which our bodies are nourished, do we contract the most of our diseases; nay from those sorts of it which are best too, do we by intemperance, draw on those maladies which are most desperate and deadly.</p>
               <p>From that very root of Love, and desire of beneficence and thirst of Honor, ingraffed for mutual comfort and assistance, do we daily finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects to be produced; when by too strict and irregular fixation and use thereof, according to the particular interest and guidance of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate appetite and discretions, we are led into Faction and Civil war.</p>
               <p>And so lastly, from that course of prevention and restraint which by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment was setled amongst us as the onely Soveraign remedy and cure of these exorbitances, namely the constitution and power of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:55976:265"/>
government; even this doth, together with the cure, make us lyable and obnoxious to those fatal mischiefs of Tyranny and Oppression also. Against which as we have neither reasonable or lawful remedy but that of Patience, so shall we finde it a true remedy indeed, and to usher us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an habitation and Kingdom where neither a natural distemper, nor a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil distraction shall any more afflict us.</p>
               <p>No, no, all cause of fear, either of loss or punishment is now banished; our obedience is become all love here, for a full comprehension of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our present Soveraign, together with a full assurance of his continual ready acceptance, as well as of our own continual ready ability of performance shall make all apprehension of power stand as it were forgotten in that of goodness. And whereas we now <hi>know</hi> neither our own duties, nor Gods love and acceptance <hi>but in part, seeing them as through a glass darkly, then shall we know him,</hi> as to his Will and good pleasure, <hi>even as we are known of him,</hi> as to our hearty desire of serving and honoring him; and this, <hi>face to face.</hi> We shall not longer wait on tedious Inductions and Observations for some slender and fallible comprehension of these things, but at such time as Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shall make up our Obedience, our knowledge shall be inherent, arising from presence and intuition. There is no such opacity here as to necessitate us to rays of light to discover, (at most) but skin-deep into the qualities of things; no, then the true Nature of things shall be as soon known as their names; and their inward, as their outward form. And therefore what cause then of fear that any thing <hi>should separate us from the love of God</hi> our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Soveraign? Where there shall not be so much as a false accuser left to appear in that Kingdom; whereby to disturb us in our civil life, more then a disease to disturb us in our natural.</p>
               <p>The life and health of our then refined bodies shall no more run the hazard of either famine or surfeit, by relying on such food as could not nourish us until dead, nor but bring death by nourishment. Our then no longer sickly nor mortal bodies, shall now have their more spiritual life and perfection secured and encreased from a food far more spiritual and perfect then our selves. In this true Paradise shall we finde the true tree of life it self; that <hi>bread of life that once came down from Heaven</hi> cloathed with our nature, that we might be made capable and Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant of his. With this food shall we be always delightfully fed, never full; always satisfied, never satiate.</p>
               <p>As thus to our selves, so to our present society: instead of those thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and injuries which used to come from the hands of competitors or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we shall, on all hands, be saluted with the ready Offices of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and love, for how can envy or malice have either Author or Object, where encrease of eminence or property cannot be so much as wisht for? Our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments then shall not be purchased or endeared at the price of want and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty: for fruition shall here antecede appetite, even so, as there shall not be so much as time or room left for a wish.</p>
               <p>And whilst thou shalt be thus steadily compleat with happiness in thy self, so as neither to have cause to hope more, nor fear wors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and that through the gift and participation of divine love, so shalt thou finde this love so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined also, as to be universally and reciprocally efficacious, not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the possession against fear of intrusion through others wants, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it through consensation of like benefit in them. Each one that could
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:55976:265"/>
not as one, contain more content, shall, by this union, contain all. We shall not then know one another by our old dividing relations of consanguinity or friendship, whereby petty unions were made destructive of the common, and introductive of general disagreement: No, every one is lookt upon with the heightened affection of a brother, by means of that more close tye and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be derived from that <hi>Our father which is in Heaven.</hi> Hath any one been so heroick, as but to taste what it is to be truely in love with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here? Let him then think, that every one now shall be that <hi>he,</hi> or that <hi>she,</hi> but withour thought of a he or a she. Not so hazardously now beloved as to relye on the courtesie of a Idea, from the intent observation of whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in our conceit, the imperfections of the original might come to be clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. No, as we shall no longer depend on the help of deceiveable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor Affections or Passions for our comprehension and understanding, so shall we not be in danger to be captivated with the glance of a single sense; and that from an outward perishing and deceiveable figure. Our Understanding and intuistive knowledge shall now make way for our will; it shall not stand to the issue of two contending passions here. Where nothing is farther to be hoped for or feared, all such composition must cease. We shall not in this place love at the hazard of our discretions, nor endanger the loss of our selves by the love of another: for in this society every other shall be truely known to be an other self, even so much thy self, that thou shalt not be to thy self, but in that self: for we shall be so like and so much one another, as not to know di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction or separation but what number must make.</p>
               <p>Oh that happy practice of love below that prepared thee for this blessed enjoyment of love above! Oh that happy performance of Obedience to thy former <hi>Fathers in the flesh,</hi> although unto death, that hath now redeemed thee from death, and fitted thee for this <hi>subjection unto the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> unto life! Oh happy participation in a Cross that makes thee now a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with thy Saviour in his Crown! Thy former bread of affliction and tears of sorrow shall be by thy blessed Savior here turned into wine of comfort and food of life; not to be now tasted in a Sacramental sip or broken piece, and then onely in a topick Communion; but, in this true and real Communion with thy Redeemer himself, thou shalt totally and eternally enjoy that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and blissful <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> Truely blissful now indeed, and that in act and possession; free from the resentment and fear of all those persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and afflictions which formerly gave abatement to that fulness of joy which in the militant Communion could be expected. For here thou shalt, in and with them, in a continual and triumphant manner, be made a more neer and firm participant of all the gracious influences of deity: whose blessings and bounty can now be no more denyed or hid from thee, then thy most blessed meditator can be again separate from that nature of thine, which was by him for thy sake assumed.</p>
               <p>But thou, thou ravished and exulting soul, what canst thou now finde to do, when thou hast found thy self thus full and hast found others thus full also, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to such a mutual encrease of joy and fulness? Why then thou and they must run over. Yes, yes, that thou shalt yet finde a new joy, nay thy greatest joy, in acknowledging thy joy.
