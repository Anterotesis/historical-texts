            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIHGT
Honorable and most vertuous
Lady, the La. Cicely Countesse of
DORSET.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are sundry reasons (right
Honourable) which haue moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
me to giue my consent that
this Sermon might be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
One is to testifie my duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
&amp; grateful respect towards
that noble personage now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
to whom when he was
liuing, I was so much bound for
so many yeeres together: Another is, to giue satisfaction to
diuers of speciall qualitie and note, who haue earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me, that I will not denie this dutie to the dead, nor
such a kindnesse to them aliue, but that they may reade that
againe and againe, which they heard once with no discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment:
A third is, that the world may truly take notice
of many excellent vertues, wherewith God had indued this
honourable man: and that as well with resolued knowledge
to compose and settle his soule religiously towards heauen, as
with rare wisdome &amp; prudence otherwise, to digest and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
either publike businesse touching his Souereigne and
the State, or his owne priuat affaires. In the opening where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as it should be vanitie to adde or amplifie any thing, so it
should be want of Christian dutie and regard, to conceale
that which is true: especially since the relation may satisfie
such as doubt, and the example may prouoke others to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
those good parts, which are not euery where to be found.
Now it being published, I haue as great reason to recommend
<pb facs="tcp:24849:3"/>
it to your honourable patronage, since you are the Suruiuer
of that worthy couple, who for so long time were ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the bands of Christian wedlocke. And whom may
it more concerne, or vnto whom can it be more comfortable
than to your Ladiship, that there should be some memoriall
of his well-doing, whom you so deerly loued, and so respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obserued, in the time of your conuersation together?
Besides, the reading of it, may peraduenture be a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer
vnto you of your owne mortalitie, when you heare of
his departure before you, who (as you supposed) might haue
ouer-liued you many yeeres. And lastly, the mention of that
which his Lordship hath left touching your selfe, may incite
you to go forward in those vertuous and Christian courses,
which hitherto you haue so singularly demonstrated, that
(besides the experience which his Lordship had, and testified
to the full) the world (which obserueth few good things,
vnlesse they be eminent) taketh great notice of them: and
therefore it neerly concerneth your Honor to persist therein:
and to endeuour yet dayly to increase those good graces; that
the end may counteruaile, yea exceed, both the progresse and
beginning. I doubt not but God who hath begun his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
worke in you, will accomplish it and make it perfect, so
blessing you all the dayes of your pilgrimage heere, that you
may liue to your children and childrens children an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
paterne of pietie, religion and vertue; and depart
from this earth in a full age, vnto the true and neuer ceasing
ioyes of his euerlasting Kingdome. Which he will alwayes
pray for, who is and long hath beene</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ee that looketh into this Chapter,
shall see it to be a Prophecie of the
comming of Christ: of his appearing
in the flesh, and his taking of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature vpon him, so to bring
grace and saluation to as manie as
should beleeue. And this, touching
the comming of Christ, is not naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
layd downe, but with an intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
also of his fore-runner Iohn the Baptist, the very words
being vsed (to make it the more notorious) which are repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:24849:4"/>
in the third Chapter of Saint Mathew,<note n="2" place="margin">Matth. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The voice of a crier
in the wildernesse, prepare the way of the Lord: make his paths
straight.</hi> But to fit men so much the more, to embrace that
mercy which should be offred by him, this sound reason is
brought; that of our selues we are mortall, corruptible and
transitorie, and that therefore it is good that we should haue
something else to rest our soules vpon. For we consist but of
<hi>flesh,</hi> and that is like vnto <hi>the grasse.</hi> And if we should imagine
othermen to be better then our selues, yet they are but as we
are: for <hi>all flesh is grasse, and all the grace thereof is as the flower
of the field:</hi> Therefore it is best to trust to something els; and
that must be the sonne of God, the Sauiour of the world, the
Redeemer of mankind, the mighty God of Iacob. I shall not
at this time speake any thing concerning the comming of
Christ, but shall rather insist vpon the opening of the reason
which leadeth vs vnto Christ Iesus. Which that it may bee
the more strongly imprinted in vs, it is not barely deliuered,
but with a kinde of Preface, or solemne introduction, <hi>A voice
said, Cry: And he said, What shall I cry?</hi> The whole may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into these two parts, <hi>A preparation,</hi> and <hi>A proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The proclamation is the maine, consisting of the latter
words, <hi>All flesh is grasse, and all the grace thereof as the flower of
the field,</hi> &amp;c. In the <hi>preparation,</hi> are two circumstances: A
commandement, what should be done: And the Prophets
composing of himselfe to the performance of it. Of all which
in their order, as God shall giue assistance.</p>
            <q>A voice said, Crie.</q>
            <p n="2">2 We shall little need to inquire, what voice this is which
speaketh to Esay. For that, whereunto the Prophet would
hearken, is only the voice of God. That which spake out of
the mount, in the twentieth of Exodus, when the law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
downe to the people of Israel,<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 20. 1.</note> 
               <hi>God spake these words and
said.</hi> That which called to<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 4.</note> Samuel, in the dead time of the
night, and badde him go, and doe a message to old Eli. That
whereof Dauid could say,<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 29. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The voice of the Lord is mightie:
the voice of the Lord is glorious.</hi> The veritie, the authority, the
maiestie of that which is vttered, doth declare so much. This
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:24849:4"/>
biddeth the prophet <hi>Crie:</hi> not speake only; much lesse whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but with an extention of his voice to deliuer his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
This must not be as that was when God passed by Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<note n="e" place="margin">1. Reg 19. 12.</note> 
               <hi>in a soft and still voice:</hi> nor as that, where, to describe the
mildenesse of our Sauiour, it is said of him;<note n="f" place="margin">Matth. 12. 19.</note> 
               <hi>He shall not stirre,
nor crie, neither shall any man heare his voice in the streets:</hi> but
it is rather like that of Ionas the prophet, who entring into
Niniue<note n="g" place="margin">Ionah 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>cried and said, Yet fortie daies, and Niniue shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied.</hi>
Or as that in our prophet Esay,<note n="h" place="margin">Isa: 58. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Crie aloud, and spare
not: lift vp thy voice like a trumpet.</hi> Heere must be such a noise,
as would mooue a man that were musing, would whet him
that were dull, would rowse him that were slumbring, would
awake him that were sleeping. So carefull is God, that we
should heare this lesson, and lay it vnto our hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hence we may perceiue the heauinesse and dulnesse of
our nature, when in a matter so cleere, we need such a noise
to remember vs of our mortalitie. For set aside the word of
God, Philosophy and experience may informe so much vnto
vs. The Churches and Church-yards thorow which we do
passe, the tombes of other men, the going before vs of our
parents and our kinsfolkes, of our friends and acquaintance,
might proclaime this vnto vs. What should we need any
crying? or why should we lacke any speaking? We may see

               </gap>rxes though but a heathen man, yet could
make this vse of his sight: For when he beheld from the top
of his high tabernacle, the huge numbers in his armie, as
<note n="i" place="margin">Herodot, in Polymma.</note> Herodotus writeth, he broke forth into teares, and yeelded
this reason of it, that of all that multitude (which was so great,
that for ought we reade, there were neuer in the world so
many souldiers at once compacted into one armie) within
one hundred yeres there should not one person be remaining
aliue. And if we would not see it, yet feele it we may. For as
we reade in S. Austen, the aches of our bones, the heauinesse
of our bodies, the deafenesse of our eares, the dimnesse of our
sight, the baldnesse of our heads, the grainesse of our haires,
are signes of a house that is ready to fall to the ground.<note n="k" place="margin">August. de 12. abusio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num gradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. Tom. 9.</note>

            <p n="5">5 Heere the speech is so significant, that euery word hath
his weight. <hi>Flesh</hi> it selfe intendeth corruption. When it is
likened <hi>to the grasse,</hi> it more noteth our mortalitie. When the

which is giuen. When the <hi>grace and beautie</hi> is named, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth
that there is no hope to the contrarie. <hi>The spirit

Thus God hath decreed that there should be a succession of
one man after another. And as in the greatest shewes, when
one hath had his turne, he is to be gone, and to leaue the place
to them that follow, and if he should desire to keepe himselfe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:24849:6"/>
on the stage, and by no meanes to depart, he should be verie
iniurious vnto those who are to succeed: so it is heere in mens
liues; one hath his turne before, another hath his turne after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but the first must yeeld to the latter, when his time is
once accomplished; els he shall doe wrong to succession. Yet
this going away and departure out of this world, God hath
appointed to be the meanes to aduance men vnto heauen.
Our corruption is the way vnto our incorruption. For God
meaning for to crowne with the garland of immortalitie,
those that haue striuen lawfully, doth not come downe to
them to honour them vpon earth, but calleth them vp to
him, so to glorifie them in heauen. Which thing Saint Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
well considered, when he spake in this maner:<note n="z" place="margin">Chrysost in Ep. ad Philip. Homil. 12.</note> 
               <hi>He
would haue thee to striue below, but he crowneth thee aboue:
for the crowne is not in this place, where the striuing is; but in a
glorious place. Doe you not see heere, that such champians and

below in the place of trying masteries, but the King calling them
vp putteth on their garlands there.</hi> God doth take with his
children the verie selfe-same course. Their fight must be on
earth, but their reward in heauen. And thither they may not
come, till they haue put off this body. Their flesh is as a
veile which keepeth them from beholding the purity of that
secret one.<note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 26. 31.</note> In the tabernacle which Moses made, there was
a veile which was hanged vp betweene the holy place, and
the holy of holies. This was made of foure substances, that
is, blue silke and purple, and scarlet, and fine linnen, which

Such a<note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 27. 51.</note> veile was afterwards in the temple at Hierusalem,
which at the death of our blessed Sauiour did rent from the

the very <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> So when our flesh, this
veile, which keepeth vs from beholding the inuisibilitie of

Dauid vseth the same comparison:<note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 103. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The daies of man are as
grasse: as a flower of the field, so flourisheth he.</hi> Which is thus
expressed by Gregory:<note n="h" place="margin">Greg. in Psa. 5. Poenitent.</note> 
               <hi>Man may be compared to the grasse,

greene in his flesh, by his youth he is white in his blossome, by his
death he is drie &amp; withered in the dust.</hi> Such is the shortnesse
and vncertaintie of our life. Saint Iames doth liken it to a

               <hi>vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and afterward vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

where a man seeth glorious shewes, and is wonderfully plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

nothing. Homer compareth men vnto<note n="q" place="margin">Homer. Iliad. 5.</note> 
               <hi>leaues,</hi> which peepe
out of the tree, and then grow bigger and bigger; at last they
are at the greatest, fresh in shew, and greene in colour; but
then they fade and decay, and are driuen off with the winde.
Some other say, that a man is but like vnto an apple, which
if it be let alone will at length be ripe, and of it selfe will fall
vnto the ground, but peraduenture before that time, it is sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off by a blast, or cropped off by a violent hand. Lastly,
other haue likened our being heere in the world vnto a game
at chesse, where there be degrees of men, Kings, and Knights
and common Pawnes, amongst whom, one is caught away,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:24849:7"/>
and by and by another: but howsoeuer on the boord they
differ in their degree, yet when the game is ended, and they
are swept all into the bagge, there is none better than other,
the meanest lieth aboue, and the greatest is vnderneath. Thus
both the spirit of God, and the iudgement of wise men, by
significant similitudes would riuet it in into vs, and fasten it
as with a naile into our cogitations, that our daies are but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
our continuance heere but momentame, our abode
on earth but vncertaintie.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Now lest it should be said, that with some it may bee
thus, but with other otherwise, it is farther added, that <hi>All
flesh is grasse.</hi> Men are all of the same molde, and returne to
the same substance. The wise woman of Tecoah could speake
in generall to Dauid,<note n="r" place="margin">2. Sam. 14. 14.</note> 
               <hi>We must needs die, and we are as water
spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered vp againe.</hi> Heere
shee ioineth herselfe with Dauid, My Lord we needs must
die, you a man, and I a woman: you a Soueraigne, I a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
Dauid himselfe knew this, when lying in his death-bed,
he spake thus vnto Salomon,<note n="s" place="margin">1. Reg. 2. 2.</note>

Death is the way of all flesh. So holy Iob,<note n="t" place="margin">Iob 30. 23.</note> 
               <hi>I know that thou

So S. Paul to the Hebrewes,<note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> 
               <hi>It is appointed vnto men
that they shall once die, and after that commeth the iudgement.</hi>
Where the indefinite proposition is equiualent to a generall.

               <hi>hauen, whither euery ship must go:</hi>
some come sooner, and some come later, but there they all
must ariue. Perhaps when a ship is entring into the mouth of
the hauen, there commeth a blast of winde, and driueth it
out againe; but that will not serue the turne, it must backe
to the same place. The speech is true of all,<note n="y" place="margin">Innoc. 3. de cont. mund. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Vitaperpetuo
auolat, neque potest retincri: mors quotidie ingruit, neque potest

death daily doth grow on, and cannot be resisted.</hi> In this one
point all conditions are alike. The yoong may, and the old
must. The difference is no more, but the<note n="z" place="margin">Sen. Ep. 26</note> one come vnto
death, and death commeth to the other. <hi>Death,</hi> saith Saint

pitieth not the pouertie of one, nor standeth in awe of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of another, it spareth not the parentage of any man, nor his
behauiour, nor his age; for the old it standeth ready in the gates,
for the yoong it licth in ambush.</hi> The Poet could say of death,
that it is that,<note n="b" place="margin">Horat. Carm. Lib. 4. Ode 7.</note> 
               <hi>Quò Pius Aeneas, quò Tulius diues &amp; Ancus,
whether Aeneas with his piety, and Tullus with his riches, and
Ancus with his valour did go. Puluis &amp; vmbra sumus: we are
but dust and shadow.</hi> Nay it is a thing so assured, that in a sort
a man may say we are more certaine to die, than that euer we
were borne, since there is but one way onely to come into the
world, but a thousand waies to goe out of it, as<note n="c" place="margin">Greg. Naz. orat. 40.</note> Gregorie
Nazianzene obserued, as, by fire, and by water, by the teeth
of wilde beasts, by famine, or sword, or pestilence, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
meanes besides. And as the rule is generall for persons
and for degrees, so also is it for places; no one place being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
or priuileged from death. Which<note n="d" place="margin">Xenoph. in Apolog. pro Socrat.</note> Socrates himselfe
did rightly vnderstand, when after his condemnation being
told by his friends, that if he would giue liking thereunto,
they would by violence take him from the officers, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
conuey him away; he not onely gaue no consent to that
proiect of theirs, but also smiled at them, asking whether
they knew any place, without the territorie of Athens, to the
which death might not approch. And as pretie a speech was
that of<note n="e" place="margin">Ammian: Mercellin. hist Lib. 16. Sigon. de Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid. Imp. lib. 6.</note> Hormisda the Persian, who being by his king sent
in ambassage to Constantius the Roman Emperour, was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Constantius to walke vp and downe, to view the citie
Rome. There hee beheld the glorious monuments of the
place, the Capitol, the Pantheon, the Temple of peace, the
Forum of Traian, the Amphitheater, and the Bathes, with
many other matters of excellent workemanship. But being
asked by the Emperour what he thought of Rome, or what
was his iudgement concerning it, he replied, that it was the
most glorious Citie, that was in the world; and that as hee
supposed, there was not such another in all the earth: but
<hi>this,</hi> saith he, <hi>doth please me,</hi> or as other report it, <hi>this one
thing doth displease me, that I see men die at Rome, as they doe in
other places.</hi> The speech was most true, and fitteth all other
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:24849:8"/>
cities. We all then may resolue, that wheresoeuer we be, or
of what calling soeuer, we must come to the gates of death.
That we might not hope to auoid this, the Patriarkes and
the Prophets haue gone that way before vs: That wee may
not dread the sharpnesse of it, the Sonne of God himselfe by
sustaining death in his flesh, hath sanctified death vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8 A man would haue thought, that by this time sufficient
had beene sayd. But yet farther to imprint all into our cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the Prophet speaketh on, <hi>All the grace thereof is as the
flower of the field. The grasse withereth, the flower fadeth.</hi> As
if he should haue subioyned, that if in the life of man there be
any thing more faire, more amiable, more goodly, more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
more illustrious than the common qualitie, yet this is
but like to the flower. The flower is more sightly than the
grasse, more pleasing vnto the eye, more fragrant vnto the
smell: yet it endureth the common qualitie of withering and
fading. Yea many times the fairer and the gayer the flower
is, the sooner it is gathered and cropped off by the hand. So
it is with those things which this world esteemeth most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Authority, estimation, youth, beauty, pompe, strength,
all the delights of this earth are transitorie and vaine. Dauid
setteth men as high as possibly they may go,<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 82. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I haue sayd, Ye

hauing set out shewes and spectacles for a hundred daies
together, to demonstrate the magnificence of that Empire, on
the last day of those sights, in the presence of all the people
did breake foorth into teares, vpon a consideration, that all
that pompe was vanished and dissolued into nothing. It is
sayd of<note n="p" place="margin">Plutarch. in vit. Aemil.</note> Paulus Aemilius, that when he had his triumph for

three whole dayes together, he ioyed no way apparantly; as
neither on the other side, he gaue testimonie of griefe for the
death of one of his sonnes, who died a very few dayes before
the time of his triumph; with which patience he also tooke
the death of another of them within a few dayes after. But
albeit in all that, he did beare himselfe with great constancie,
yet in another case hee had other cogitations. For<note n="q" place="margin">Tit. Liu. lib. 45.</note> hauing
ouerthrowen in battell Perseus the king of Macedonia, and
hauing chased him vp and downe, so that there was small
hope to escape, Perseus writeth letters to him, that he would
yeeld into his hands his kingdome and his person; which
when Aemilius had receiued, he could not stay from weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
remembring the inconstancie and mutabilitie of all states
and conditions. So did that noble<note n="r" place="margin">Tit. Liu. lib. 25.</note> Marcellus in his entrance

and at last by composition it was surrendred vnto him; the

saw the citie Carthage raced downe vnto the ground, though

were among the olde Romans, in the happiest and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things that euer did befall them while they were heere
amongst men. Such meditations as these were, would well
become Gods best seruants, to lay it vnto their heart, that
the heigth of earthly felicity being taken in it selfe, is but store
of the lightest vanitie. Grasse is no better than grasse, and

Touching whom, since you expect that something
should be sayd, I shall draw the beginning of that which I
must deliuer, from a witnesse beyond all exception; and that
is the late Queene of euerlasting memorie. Her Maiestie not
long before her death being pleased, as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> seemeth, with some
speciall piece of seruice which his Lordship had done vnto
her, grew at large to discourse touching this Noble man, as
an honorable person, and a Counseller of Estate, in writing
hath aduertised me. Her Highnesse was then pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher
out his life, by seuen steps or degrees: <hi>The first was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
his yoonger daies, the time of his scholarship, when first in that
famous Vniuersitie of Oxford, and afterward in the Temple,</hi>
(where he tooke the degree of Barrister) <hi>he gaue tokens of
such pregnancie, such studiousnesse and iudgement, that he was

published vnto the world. <hi>The second was his trauell, when
being in France and Italy, he profited very much in the languages,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in matter of story and State:</hi> (whereof this Common-wealth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:24849:10"/>
found great benefit in his Lordships elder yeeres, in the
deepest consulations that belonged vnto this kingdome.)
<hi>And being prisoner in Rome for the space of foureteene daies,
(which trouble was brought vpon him by some who hated him for
his loue to religion, and his dutie to his Soueraigne) he so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
bare himselfe, that by the blessing of God, and his tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
kind of cariage, he was freed out of that danger.</hi> The third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
step which her Maiestie did thinke good to obserue was (vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
returne into England) <hi>his comming vnto her Court, where
on diuers occasions he bountifully feasted her Highnesse and her
Nobles; and so he did to forren Embassadors. At that time hee
entertained Musitians the most curious, which any where hee
could haue,</hi> and therein his Lordship excelled vnto his dying
day. <hi>Then was his discourse iudicious, but yet wittie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.</hi>
Thus he was in his yoonger daies, a scholar, and a
traueller, and a Courtier of speciall estimation.</p>
            <p n="11">11 <hi>The fourth step of his life, noted by her most sacred Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
was his imployment of higher nature, in Embassages beyond
the seas. As first, when his Lordship was sent to the French King
Charles the ninth, partly to congratulate his mariage with the
daughter of Maximilian the Emperour, and partly about other
weighty affaires touching both the kingdomes. At which time his
Lordship was so honorably attended with Gentlemen of choice
qualitie; and was so magnificent in his expence, as was admirable
to the French, honorable to his countrey, and gaue much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto his Soueraigne.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Holinshed <hi>An. 13. Eliz.</hi>
               </note> The Chronicles at large relate the
maner of it. <hi>Secondly, when afterward in a seruice of tickle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he was imploied into the Low Countries, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the sharpe sight which by some was caried ouer him, yet
his Lordship behaued himselfe so warily and discreetly, that no
blame could be fastened on him.</hi> The fift time obserued was,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>his temper and moderation after his returns from thence, when
her Maiestie to giue contentation to a great personage, in those
daies of high imploiment, was pleased to command him vnto his
owne house, there priuately to remaine till her farther pleasure
was knowen. Where his Lordship did beare himselfe so dutifully
and obsequiously vnto her Highnesse command, that in all the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:24849:10"/>
time of his restraint, for nine or ten moneths space, hee neuer
would endure either openly or secretly, either by day or by night
to see either wife or childe.</hi> A rare example of obedience, and
obseruance vnto his Soueraigne. The sixt degree which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
noted by that most renowmed Ladie, was the time <hi>that his
Lordship was Counsellor, before that he was aduanced to that
high office, which afterward he bare, in which time he daily shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great diligence and sound iudgement, in her weightiest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</hi>
The last of all was that space, wherein he held the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
roome of Lord High Treasurer of England, <q>in which place
she noted the continuall and excessiue paines, and care which his
Lordship did take in her businesse, his fidelitie in his aduices, his
dexterity in adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing of her profit.</q> Thus it seemed good to that

               </gap> discourse touching
her faithfull seruant. This was while his Lordship liued: and
since his death, his Maiestie that now is, the most religious,
the most learned, the most iudicious King, that this land
euer enioied, (as I haue beene aduertised from persons of high
qualitie) hath beene pleased diuers times to giue many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
speeches before the Lords concerning him, as his
Highnesse had done formerly, while this noble man did liue.

kind vnto his children, and to his Grand-children? Who
more fast vnto his friend? who more moderate to his enemy,
if truth were once found out, and staining imputations were
wiped away from the integritie of his Honor? Who more
true of his word? It was a noble testimonie, which a most
Honorable personage gaue of his Lordship since his death,
in a right worthy assemblie, that <hi>in much conuersation and
concurrence in many causes, of great waight and importance, hee
neuer heard him speake, or in earnest affirme that which he found
to be otherwise.</hi> What noble man in our time was more giuen
to hospitalite, and keeping of a great house? Hauing liued,
seuenty and two yeeres (for so was his age accounted) and
being married more then fifty and three yeeres, vnto one and
the selfe same Lady, he kept house for fortie and two yeeres
in an honorable proportion. For thirtie yeeres of those, his
family consisted of little lesse in one place or another, than
two hundred persons. But for more then twentie yeeres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
workmen and other hired, his number at the least hath
beene two hundred and twenty daily, as appeared vpon
checke-rowle. A very rare example in this present age of
ours, when house-keeping is so decaied. Who more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:24849:11"/>
than than his Lordship in solemne entertainments? as (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other particulars) was manifested not long since abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
to the world, when his Maiestie with the Queene and
Prince together with a great part of the Nobilitie, spent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
daies at Oxford. Who was euer more desirous to doe
wrong vnto none? His Lordship bought no land, but hee
commonly paid more for it, than it was worth, yeelding this
reason of it, that it would the better prosper and continue in
his name and posteritie. In his Will how carefull was he, that
all debts should be paid? yea though there were no specialty
whereby it might be challenged, yet if it might appeare
that ought was due vnto any man, his charge is to his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
that they should giue satisfaction. The like also for
wrong done to any one whatsoeuer (<hi>whereof he protested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the eternall Maiestie that he did not remember any.</hi>) And if
there should grow difference betweene his Executors and
any person demanding, his hearty praier and desire is to the
Deanes of Windsore, Westminster, and Pauls (for so his
Lordship doth ranke them) to heare, order, and determine
all controuersies depending. Which if they refuse to doe,
which he hopeth they will not, or if the partie claiming shall
not obey their award, he leaueth them to the ordinarie course
of law, but chargeth and requireth his Executors to answer
them in all Courts of Iustice immediately, without all delaies
whatsoeuer. Vnto those honorable parts, I may adde a great
many more: As his good and charitable disposition toward
his Tenants, of whom ordinarily, he tooke lesse fines by a
third part, than by other Lords is vsually accustomed; and
his Farmers held his Farmes, as is well knowen to the world,
but at reasonable rents: As his releefe to the poore in pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times of dearth.<note n="a" place="margin">From the 28. of May to the 15. of August, so much as cost 154. li. 14. s. 7. d.</note> In the yeere 1597. which was a time
of the greatest scarcitie that euer we did know, his Lordship
sent into Sussex of his free gift vnto six parishes store of
Danske Rie bought at Billingsgate. Diuers other yeeres, and
namely this present yeere 1608. his Lordship hath caused
weekely certaine quarters of Wheat, to be caried from his

commonly men did take. And that this his Lordships boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
might continue after his death, by his last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he hath bequeathed a thousand pounds for the erecting
of a Granarie at the place which last I named, for the vse and
benefit of poore people in those parts: And two thousand
pounds as a stocke for the storing of that house against times
of dearth and scarcitie. Vnto this he hath also ioined a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

               </note> where his ancestors doe lie, and where his Lordship desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that his bodie might be enterred. These are fruits of a
liuely faith, and so must be reputed.</p>
            <p n="13">13 But because a right beleefe and religion toward God is
the highest point of all, I may not heere omit to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
touching that. There are arguments most euident to
demonstrate vnto all men, that his faith was agreeable vnto
the word of God, and according to the profession of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
Church of England. In that famous Vniuersitie of
Oxford, where his Lordship for more then sixteene yeeres
was our Honorable Chancellor, it was his speciall care to
substitute such vnder him as were most sound for Religion,
which the wiser sort did obserue, although common men did
not marke it. As he kept downe with the one hand all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties,
and humours in opinions, which laboured to set trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Church and Common-wealth, so with the other
hand to the vttermost of his power he depressed the Priests
and Iesuits, which haue vsed too much to that place; not to
the Vniuersitie, which God be praised is free from all such
imputation, but to some few of the Citie, who embrace their
old superstitions. In that place this I can witnesse, that his
Lordship neither openly nor secretly did euer giue counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
vnto any that was backward in religion. And on the
other side, that there was neuer any thing soberly and wisely
proposed which might forward true pietie, which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
did not further; as I could by many particulars make
plaine to whomsoeuer. Touching the education of those
honorable plants his grand-children, his Lordship was euer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:24849:12"/>
carefull that they should be trained vp in the trueth of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
farre from Poperie and idolatrie. His charge was vnto
their Tutour (as I well knew in his life time) that as he would
answer him in the day of the last iudgement, before the face
of Christ, that he should traine them vp in the trueth of the
religion professed now in England. How angry would he be,
when he was at his Countrey house, if they came not duly to
praiers? He neuer could endure that they otherwise should
be matched, than where was sound religion. Concerning his
owne soule, when the last yeere he was sicke, besides ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
praiers, he composed himselfe to God by<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>At</hi> Horseley.</note> receiuing the
holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, when he looked to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the world. But two daies before he died, deuoutly and
religiously he heard a Sermon at home in his Lordships owne
<note n="e" place="margin">At <hi>Dorset</hi> house.</note> Chapell. Nay to let all other things passe, how holily and
Christianly in his last Will and Testament doth he commend
his soule vnto God! I must professe when I saw it first, it did
very much affect me. And because it cannot chuse but giue
very full contentment to all reasonably minded, yea perhaps
may doe much good vnto other by the example, I thinke it
not amisse to read the very words, that his owne hand hath
deliuered. These they are: <hi>First therefore as a liuing creature
most bound thereunto, I heere throw downe and prostrate my selfe
in all humility and thankefulnes, at the foot of my Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and Sauiour, rendring vnto his diuine Maiestie my most
lowly, hearty and infinite thanks, in that he hath vouchsafed to
create me a man indued and infused with soule and reason, and
fashioned like vnto the image of his owne eternall Sonne, that
might haue made me a brutish and soule-lesse beast, to haue fed
and grased vpon the earth, like vnto those irrationall liuing
creatures of the field. But especially in that he hath pleased to
make me a Christian man, whereby in this life I may ioy and
reioice with the sound and badge of that glorious name, and when I
goe from hence I may thereby, and through the mercies and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Iesus Christ depart and die in assurance and comfort of
my soules and bodies saluation and resurrection, and to rest at his
right hand, in the fruition of those celestiall and vnspeakable ioies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:24849:13"/>
and blessednesse that neuer shall haue end. To him therefore my
most mercifull and omnipotent God, and into the hands of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable
and eternall goodnesse, I giue, will and bequeath my
soule, firmely and assuredly trusting, beleeuing and freely confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
That by the death and passion of his Sonne Iesus Christ, and
by his onely mercy, meane and mediation for me, and by none
other, and not by any good worke or merit of mine owne (although
I must acknowledge, that I am bound vpon paine of damnation, to
doe as many good works as possibly I can or may; all which when I
haue done, yet am I but an vnprofitable seruant, and a sinfull
creature full of all iniquitie) I shall liue and partake with his
Saints in his heauenly kingdome, of that eternall and inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
blisse and happinesse which he hath prepared for his elect, of
which number (through his infinite mercy and goodnesse) I doe
confidently and stedfastly hope, know and beleeue that I am one.</hi>

owne age, wherein many persons of honour, men of learning

to recouer the Holy land out of the hands of the Saracens,
which he thought to be a seruice most acceptable to Christ,
and for effecting whereof, he left his countrey and friends,
yet by the way as he passed, in the presence of many of his
armie, was suddenly drowned in the riuer Sapheth. I might
mention the yoonger<note n="n" place="margin">Hier. Epist. 19. Tom. 9. Marcellin. Lib. 30.</note> Valentinian an Emperour indued
with many most rare qualities: yet being on a time much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
that the <hi>Sarmatae</hi> and <hi>Quadi,</hi> two barbarous nations,
had broken in vpon the Empire, and speaking loud and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
concerning that matter, he brake some veine or some

Yea albeit at that time Valentinian had not receiued the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

soeuer he be ouer taken,</hi> or hastily caught away, <hi>his soule shall be
at rest.</hi> I might rehearse the example of Iouian another famous
Emperour, who was the man that freed the Roman armie
from the danger whereinto Iulian the Apostata going against
the Persians had brought it. In the<note n="o" place="margin">Socrat. Hist. Eccl. li. 3. 19.</note> midst of their perill, the
Captains and souldiers assured both of his vertue and his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
proclaimed him for their Emperour. But he being a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:24849:14"/>
zealous and most resolute Christian, and knowing that they
not long before, (to giue contentment to Iulian) had turned
Heathens and Infidels, made answer that himselfe professing
for Iesus Christ, would neuer take vpon him any gouernment
ouer Gentiles; which made them by and by returne to the
Christian faith. Yet this holy and worthy Emperour,<note n="p" place="margin">Theodor. Hist. Eccl. Lib: 4. 4.</note> like
to the Sunne breaking foorth after a fearefull storme, was
presently caught away, and taken out of mens sight. For go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in health to bed, he was found dead in the morning; and
no reason of that hastie change could be imagined, but that
either he had taken too<note n="q" place="margin">Solon. Hist. Eccl. Lib. 6. 6.</note> liberall a supper, or was choaked

a hard iudgement on the good as well as vpon the bad, if any

<hi>Solent aliqui dicere, Some men vse to say, He who was slaine had
not beene killed vnlesse he had beene a fornicator, or had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
some sinne. The house had not fallen vpon him, vnlesse he had
beene a malefactor. He had not suffered shipwracke, had hee not
beene an offender. But see what saith the holy Scripture, Et san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem
innocentem condemnabunt: They shall condemne euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud.</hi> Though the person be innocent, yet God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth suffer the euill man to condemne him. This may
well be a lesson to men in our time, that they be not too
quicke, nor nimble in giuing vp their verdicts or censures of
other men. Especially since God disposeth all at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:24849:14"/>
Since he hath said, that<note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 9. 2.</note> 
               <hi>All things come alike to all: and
the same condition is to the iust and the wicked, to the good and to

that sacrificeth not.</hi> Which is to bee vnderstood of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and outward things; since the parties that speake this,
haue their owne breath in their nostrils, and it may be their
owne case, if God should so determine it: it being true that
this noble man spake in another cause, the very houre that he
died,<note n="x" place="margin">Eccl. 38. 22. <hi>Heri mihi, hodie tibi.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hodie mihi, cras tibi: It is my turne to day, and it may
be yours tomorrow.</hi> I might amplifie this point much farther,
but I end it with that saying of the Apostle Paul, <hi>What</hi>

               <hi>art

or falleth to his owne master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15 Yet, that truth may not be concealed in the matter which
now I handle; as God dealt with this noble person some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extraordinarily in taking him from among vs, so it may
be well supposed, that he gaue him more than an ordinarie
coniecture, or suspicion, that his death was not farre from
him. The last yeere when he returned after his greeuous
sicknesse, he spake it more than once to his honorable friends,
that he had setled his soule and composed it to another world,
whensoeuer God should call for him. Soone after he began
to dispose of all those worldly things, which the Lord had
lent vnto him. Of late it was his common speech, <hi>I am now an
old man, therefore this, or therefore that,</hi> as I my selfe can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The day before he died, writing with his owne hand to
one of his grand-childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he more than once in that letter vsed
this or the like phrase, <hi>After my death:</hi> and, <hi>when I am dead
and gone.</hi> The last morning of his life, it was noted by those
who were neerest about his Lordship, that he was apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
longer at his priuate meditations, then commonly hee did
vse. But the words of his will, written with his owne hand
may giue great satisfaction to a man of a hard conceit, that he
did fit himselfe to mortalitie, whereof in the former yeere he
had had a warning peece. I will read his Lordships owne
words, in which letech man iudge, whether it may not bee
thought that there was some instinct more then ordinarie.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:24849:15"/>
Thus then his will beginneth: <hi>The eternall God of heauen and
earth, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, guide and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
this mine intent and purpose, which in their name I heere take
in hand and begin. Because it is a trueth infallible, such as euery
Christian ought not onely perfectly to know, and stedfastly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
but also continually to meditate and thinke vpon, namely,
that we are borne to die; That nothing in this world is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
then death, nothing more incertaine then the houre of death,
and that no creature liuing knoweth, neither when, where, nor
how it shall please Almightie God to call him out of this mortall
life: So as heere we liue euery houre, nay euery instant a thousand

               <hi>Wake therefore: for yee know not what

Let vs say to our selues as God sayd to<note n="d" place="margin">2. Reg. 20. 1.</note> Hezechiah, <hi>Put

speake thus to our soules. Let vs not weaue the spiders-web;
that is, bestow all our labour vpon that which is but vaine,
but weake, and of no profit. Let vs not fasten our selues to

that with all prouident care and heedfull circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

to the intent they may know how iust and great cause
both they and I haue to holde the said Ring in so high
esteeme, it is most requisite that I doe heere set downe
the whole course and circumstance how and from
whom the said Ring did come to my possession, which
was thus: In the beginning of the moneth of Iune
1607 this Ring thus set with twentie Diamonds, as
is aforesaid, was sent vnto me from my most gracious
Souereigne King Iames, by that honorable personage
the Lord <hi>Hay,</hi> one of the Gentlemen of his Highnesse
Bed-chamber, the Court then being at <hi>Whitehall</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> and I at that time remaining at <hi>Horsley</hi> house
in <hi>Surrey,</hi> twentie miles from <hi>London,</hi> where I lay in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:24849:18"/>
such extremitie of sicknesse as it was a common and a
constant report ouer all <hi>London,</hi> that I was dead, and
the same confidently affirmed euen vnto the Kings
Highnesse himselfe. Vpon which occasion it pleased
his most excellent Maiestie, in token of his gratious
goodnesse and great fauour towards me, to send the
said Lord <hi>Haie</hi> with the sayd Ring, and this royall mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
vnto me; namely, <hi>That his Highnesse
heartily wished a speedie and perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of my health, with all happie and
good successe vnto me; and that I might
liue as long as the Diamonds of that
Ring (which therewithall he deliuered
vnto me) did endure: And in token
thereof required me to we are it and keepe
it for his sake.</hi> This most gratious and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
message restored a new life vnto me, as comming
from so renowmed and benigne a Souereigne, vnto a
seruant so farre vnworthy of so great a fauour; and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom, not long before, it had pleased his Maiestie,
yea in that very first day wherein we all had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
to beholde him, not only to bestow the honor
of a Priuie Counseller, but also without any answerable
desert or merit of mine preceding, to confirme that
most honourable place of High Treasurer of England
vnto me, which the late Queene ELIZABETH after
foureteene yeeres seruice and ten yeeres following her
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:24849:18"/>
Court (but not before) vouchsafed (I must needs yet
say most gratiously so soon as it became void) to grant
vnto me, and likewise within a short time after to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
both me and my succession to the high honor &amp;
degree of an Earle; which is and shall be to me, my
house and posteritie, an euerliuing demonstration, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of his great benefit to vs, as of our infinite bond
to him thereby for euer. The which inexplicable
goodnesse of his Maiestie towards me, besides many
lustres of his bright shining fauours, from time to time
cast vpon me, doe giue me iust cause to agnize, that I
am no waies able to merit, no not the least part of
them, but onely with the humble and infinite earnestie
of my heart in desire to deserue; which I can yet no
waies manifest, but by that faithfull testimonie which
shall neuer faile in me, namely, by demonstration of
mine incessant cares, labours and actuall indeuors for
the behoofe and furtherance of his Maiesties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
at the least thereby to shew that good will which
is in me, though I cannot shew that effect which is due
to him, since all that I possibly can or may doe, is but
meere debt and dutie, and so in that course to spend
such remaine of life as is left vnto me, yea euen to the

as long as the Sunne and Moone endureth: and that
I and mine may for euer and euer become more and
more thankfull, (at the least if it be possibly in me) for
so great honors, graces, and fauors, as this most cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and renowmed King hath thus most gratiously
vouchsafed vnto me; the remembrance of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may neuer die but be perpetually recorded in
the mindes of those, that by the grace &amp; goodnesse of
almighty God, both now are, &amp; hereafter shall be the
lineall stirpe and succession of my house and family, to
serue both him &amp; his: I haue heere therefore set downe
this short narration, of the true state and circumstance
of the whole matter, to the intent it may remaine to
my posterity heereafter, as a faithfull memorie thereof
euen in this my last Will and Testament for euer.</p>
