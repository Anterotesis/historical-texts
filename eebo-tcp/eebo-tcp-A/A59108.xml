            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In this life, we cannot get higher, than to be aſſured of that, which in the next life is to be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>All Saints ſhall enjoy a Heaven when they leave this Earth: Some Saints enjoy a Heaven, while they are here on Earth.

            <postscript>
               <p>Thus having given you a true Relation of this great and wonderful Thunder-clap, be pleaſed to take this by way of admonition.</p>
               <p>That, having ſeen the ſalvation of God exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, it will be allowed us, to be exceeding glad of his Salvation; an exceſs of gladneſs is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, but not of Drunkenneſs; O let that be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hored. Wine or Beer in a Drunken exceſs, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the heart, intoxicates the Brain, and turns all Fanatick.</p>
               <p>You muſt, you'l ſay, drink the Kings Health; but tell me, is it congruous in cups of exceſs to drink the Kings health, when he preſerves his health by little drinking?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:38011:4"/>
Again, beware of Execrations and Oaths, leaſt their ſinful provocations out-cry our lowdeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</p>
               <p>No, no, let us rejoyce with Temperance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as well as with chearfulneſs, and exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as good Chriſtians, as well as good Subjects, and indeed we are no longer good Subjects, than we are good Chriſtians; and with the Enſignes of joy and jubilation, let us all heighten the joyful ſhout of a King amongſt us.</p>
               <p>But ſtill let me mind you to preſerve your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Temperance, the better to perform your Loyal Exultations; that rejoycing for your King, you may do it in the Lord; and then I am ſure it will be very much our Gracious and Dread Soveraigns joy, to hear that we have ſo rejoyc't.</p>
               <p>And let this the devotion of ſome have the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of others, to work this effect of grace upon the hearts of men, to melt them to Loyalty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which certainly will be as joyfully welcom to every conſcientious, and loyal Subject, as are the refreſhing Streams to the thirſty Traveller, in the dry and parched Deſert. For that God hath tutored us by affliction, to melt in Simpathies of compaſſion; and we have learnt this Leſſon of Chriſtian Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there is no greater joy then the Souls Converſion, no truer Honour, then Errours retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and no firmer Tie then Loves Communion.</p>
