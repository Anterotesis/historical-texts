            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4811:3"/>
to testifie the sinceritie of the same. This
my present, which (in a rustie caske, in steed of a

your Highnesse, is (I confesse) farre vnworthie
your Maiesties tasting of (though in the benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of Dauids spirit, I doubt not your Highnes
will accept the same,) which, as it is borrowed
from the labours of so mightie and worthie a
king as was Salomon the true Author therof, it
seems most fit the dedication to your Maiestie,
who in Empire being a peere vnto him, in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
a partner, in happinesse a riuall, and in
wisedome a Sabian obseruer of his soundest do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
can perfectliest iudge, and will kindliest
(I assure my selfe) welcome this his child for his
fathers sake, which must be (and so I desire) his
onely grace. For with me it is true that in the
composition hereof, it fared as with more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Nehemias, when he attempted the repaire
of the holy Citie: who being oftentimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
therein by the practise and malice of
Sanballat, Tobia and Geshem, was sometimes
forced to desist from his attempt, and in the end
to effect it with sword in one hand and mattock
in the other: so whilest common cares and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestik

duties (the direct enemies to all ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

disturbe my leisure, &amp; in a maner vtterly disable
my disposition for so waighty an affaire (remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so often my hand from my mind, and my
minde almost from the affection of my heart) I
(with half my weak selfe) haue bene driuen thus
to peece together, this often broken off, &amp; now
vnworkmanly perfected taske. VVhich yet (as
a well fauoured person, euen in meane attires,

it be not artificially clothed with borowed bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my barren braine. And your Highnesse,
whose course of life so wel conformeth with this
his discourse (teaching vs your subiects by holy
practise, what he by deuine precepts instructed
his) may as iustly chalenge (me seemeth) the
publication of the like discourse: as we without
defrauding God of his honor, &amp; your Highnesse
of your due, may not conceale the perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance

                  <p>IT is the most fit subiect for the nobility of mans spirit to meditate of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie:
and a true saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>Omnia appetunt bonum.</hi> Yea the
common practise of our high minded age, is to striue for the same in the
superlatiue degree. But so foolish and new-fangled are our desires, that
wishing we wot not what, and seeking it we know not how nor where: we
come all farre short of the same, and some runne headlong to the despised
contrary (looking for it on earth) and therby groping for it to their graues,
they are there cut off of their hopes, and die discontented with their haps.
Whereas if they acknowledged it to be the tree of life, planted in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
paradise, they wold lesse labor their bodies for attaining these transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
shadowes of pleasure, and more exercise the faculties of the soule for
atchiuing the same, so much the more despising these instable &amp; imperfect

that euer had practise of that cure: who did not (for th' experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his potions qualitie, first kill many patients in triall thereof) but apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to his owne wound first, dares confidently write <hi>probatum est,</hi> and by
the seale of the holy spirit and consent of the Church, doth warrant thee to
tast of the same. It is a receipt so oldly composed perhaps, that thou respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest
it the lesse, or of so small price, that thou shamest to take it, or perhaps
knowing the bitternesse of the tast, thou hadst as liue continue sicke, as to
trie it. But deceiue not thy selfe, it is of the nature of the perfectest drogs,
which with age increase in strength: of the kind of <hi>Sibillaes</hi> works, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
grow higher prized: and of the herbe called woodroofe. which onely
handled hath an euill smell, but more forcibly rubbed, yeeldeth a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
Receiue it therefore as confidently as he assureth it, and as kindly as
I intend it: who in respect that the obscuritie of many places, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
(as at first would appeare) of some points, and strange dependancie
of the whole together: haue done my carefull &amp; studious iudeuor (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
&amp; imitation of the best interpreters hereof) to explane the true
<pb facs="tcp:4811:5"/>
sense, accord the different places: to ioine by probable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nexion the whole
discourse together: which aswel to distinguish the seuerall arguments, as to
varie the verse, and pawse the reader) I haue not altogether vnfitly distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into three Sermons, each one containing foure Chapters a peece. The
first especially shewing the vaine opinion of felicitie, which is not in earth
to be found. The second pointing more directly (by the lawfull vse of this
life) the true way vnto her. The last, teaching her residence to be in heauen,
and perswading the speedie pursute of her fauor. And that you might truly
consider of the cariage of the matter, according to the scope of the Text, I
haue caused the same to be quoted in the margent, reducing for memorie
sake into two abstract lines of verse set in the top of euerie leafe: the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of euery pages content, which afterward as thou seest, is paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically
dilated page by page, in the plainest forme I can deuise. Who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the grauitie of the argument did restraine my pen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the helpes of
much profane learning, and in consideration of the antiquity of the worke,
and maiestie of the author, could not (without great indecencie) haue vsed
the authorities of men, or of so late times (as since the learnings florished,
whence we now receiue our common light.) Like naked truth therefore I
pray thee receiue it, for it owne, if not for my sake: &amp; if in any thing I seeme
to swarne from thy conceit of many points, I pray thee confer farther ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
with <hi>D. Gregorius, Neocerasiensis Epis. Olimpioderus, D. Salonius Epis. Vienne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sis,
Theod. Beza, Ioh. Serranus, Anth. Corranus, Tremelius,</hi> all interpreters and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasers
in prose vpon this worke, and <hi>I. Lectius, Ro. Lemmannus, I. Viuianus,</hi>
reducers thereof into Latin poesie, or any other thou likest better of, so shal
my errors be couered or excused, whilst their different formes, distributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of method, &amp; interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wil leaue thee (I am perswaded) in some points
as litle satisfied as this my labor shall do: who in some things was forced to
digresse from them all, when either too much in one place, or too litle in an
other, they followed the forme of a Paraphrasis, which they vndertooke: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which error also it is not vnlike but I haue sometimes fallen my selfe, and
I doubt not but many things more might haue bin said, &amp; perhaps to more
purpose then I haue done, but <hi>non omnia possumus omnes.</hi> According to my suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie
I haue discharged my self faithfully vnto thee, and therfore I trust
(in these dayes wherein some pernitious, many vnciuil, and a swarme of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
and vnprofitable books passe from the presse) it shall not be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for me to vse great insinuation for thy fauour; since it lyeth not in the
bounds of a Preface, to prepare a peruerse mind, or in the nature of such a
worke, to go a begging for a grace. I will therfore cut off that labor, &amp; only
signifie vnto thee the excellency of this worke, compiled by the wisest man,
and mightiest king of Israell, euen <hi>Salomon</hi> the king of peace: <hi>Ydida:</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
of God: <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> the preacher: who in his Prouerbs instructeth thee
as a child, to a ciuill and honest life: in this worke, instituteth thy manly
thoughts to the inquisition of the highest good. To the end, that by his last
song of heauenly loue, thy ripened thoughts might be inflamed with that
glorious bride Christ Iesus: to whose holy direction I hartily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend thee.</p>

estate from life to death, shall find it (gentle Reader) to
be nothing else but a very pilgrimage through this earth

from youth to age, from health to sicknesse,
&amp; so from one estate to another. Or if we behold the particular incounters
which each man findeth in himselfe, in the variable change of hopes and

frailties of the flesh, bayts of the world, and snares of Satan, are bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, to slacken (if not cleane to diuert) our due course thitherwardes,
in such sort as if God of his infinite mercie and prouidence did not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
preuent and stop our willes and powers, and bridle the malice of
these aduersaries, we should all assuredly perish by the way. But now (such
is his fatherly care and loue to vs in Christ) that he hath left vs a direction
&amp; ready way of safetie in the midst of all assaults or afflictions how perillous
soeuer, euen praier; which being formed according to the rules prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
vnto vs by his Sonne, and with feruencie of faith offered vp vnto him,
are of power to penetrate the heauens, purchase our safetie, pay our debts,
and procure vs peace of heart in the midst of all earthly perils: yea (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our coldnesse herein, and feare of our owne guilt, deterring vs from
his presence) he doth not onely licence vs to this boldnesse, but allur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th vs
by many sensible blessings felt in our owne consciences; and calleth vs by
a supernaturall courage, sometimes with confidence to come vnto him,
and euen to hope against hope in our most desperate necessities. He doth
direct our tongues oftentimes here in before our mindes, and our mindes
before our hearts; being himselfe readier to giue then we to aske, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
with more regard of our good, then we can craue or conceiue: for
all which he expecteth nothing else at our hands, but continually to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and to yeeld him due praise: to relie on him onely in the day of
triall, and to encourage others thereto; for in this sort alone he
<pb facs="tcp:4811:72"/>
will be honoured of vs. This our earthly pilgrimage being then so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to all flesh, &amp; so readie a way prescribed vnto vs for our safer passage

&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the same. For this cause (gentle Readers) I hauing (through gods
great goodnes) felt in the direction and protection of my vnstable youth, a
plentifull portion of the wonderfull care he hath ouer vs, &amp; of the vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
force of praier &amp; thanksgiuing in all extremities: the more to stirre vp
my selfe to a memorie thereof, haue thought good to set downe these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
passions of my passed afflictions, as witnesses of the impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts most
stopping me in my Christian pilgrimage, and testimonies of the meanes of
my euasion hitherto, which may serue for presidents for my selfe in the like
future occasions: and not be altogither vnprofitable for others to imitate.
In which (as in a glasse) may be seene, the state of a renegerate soule, sicke
with sinne, sometimes (Ague-like) shiuering with cold despaire, straight
waies inflamed with feruencie of faith and hope. One while yeelding vnder
the burden of sinne to eternall death, and presently incouraged to runne
chearefully forward the appointed course of this his pilprimage; and like a
practised traueller, vsed to the change of company, dyet, heat, cold, paine,
pleasure, plentie, and want, not to amaze himselfe long with any change:
but by a consideration of pleasures passed, or rest expected, patiently
to passe ouer this world full of incombrances; from a sence and feeling
whereof in some measure, no true child of God is any long time (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
expempt. Now, although I doubt not but euen these reasons will carry
the iudgement of the godly Christian Reader to a fauourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my purpose herein, and to some delight in the tast thereof, to whom
no person or occasion, style or phrase, will seeme vnseasonable, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to the glorifying of God, and profit of the Church, or proceeding
from a zeale of that effect; yet the consideration that the greater number
to whose handes this Treatise may happen to come, are either not so well
affected, or so discreet and temperate as were to be wished, maketh me
thinke it needfull to say something in declaration of my purpose herein:
not in excuse of my exercising my selfe in such theames, which in deede
ought to be the common action in some measure of all men, as oft as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
affaires of this life wil permit them, neither in that I make common
with others this my exercise, which seemeth in secret only to be practised by
my selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that I take it not to be alwaies a token of pride or vaine-glory,
to make knowne for a common good to others, that which may breed a
suspect of ambition in the Author among the prophane or cauelling mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
though how herein I am caried my selfe, I leaue to God the sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of hearts to iudge: only I would satisfie them first in the cause of my
writing them in verse, then of the confused placing of them without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
titles. To the first I was induced, for that I find many oftentimes (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
<pb facs="tcp:4811:73"/>
such as had most neede to praie and meditate) to reade bookes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the affection of words then liking of matter, and perhaps more to
controll the compiling, then commend the contents, Such yet (so as they
read) shal giue me al that I craue, &amp; find I hope that good they loked not for,
if not in all, yet in some among many of these Sonnets. As for the apt nature
of Poetrie, to delight, to contriue significatiuely in fewe words much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to pearce and penetrate affections of men, with the aptnesse thereof,
for helpe of memorie, I will not saie much: but for my deducing these passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
and affections into Sonnets, it answereth best for the shortnesse, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and common humor of men, who are either not long touched
with so good motions, or by their worldly affaires not permitted to continue
much reading. To the cause of my so preposterous placing of them, and
deuision onely into three sorts, I confesse indeed I am perswaded their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
doth best fit the nature of mankind, who commonly is delighted with
contraries, and excercised with extreames; and also as they were by God
ministred vnto my mind to set downe by sundrie Accidents: so I suppose
my prouidence could not (by a formall placing of them) so soone hit the
affection of euery reader, as Gods direction (by that which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> call chance)
might often do. As they are therefore, I recommend them to thy courtesie
in reading, and thee to Gods holy spirit in the perusing of them. If they
may haue the same working in thee, that I praise God some of them had in
me, they shall not be vtterly vnprofitable. If in matter they iumpe not to thy
passions in all pointes, thinke that in the great Arsenall of Satans Armor
he hath choise of weapons for sundrie assaults, and disposeth of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly,
according to the strength or weaknesse of the partie he besiegeth:
which (being as different in particular persons as Gods gifts are to them)
thou shalt doe well (to thy abilitie) to reforme or supply my defect therin
If in manner of the verse or stile, they be (as I doubt not but they are) to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
much, I do not greatly seeke the praise of a curious Architector,
neither (without neglect of more necessary duties) could I attaine to the
required obseruances that way. And therefore craue that thy discretion
may excuse my intention and abilitie And thus I hartily recommend thee
to the Almightie.</p>
