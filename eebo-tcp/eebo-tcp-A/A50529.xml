            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was well hoped, after the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about the lawfulness and fitness of a <hi>set forme of Prayer</hi> had been so long debated in our Church, that the sect of those who opposed it, had been ere this well-nigh extinguished; but experience tels us the contrary; that this fancy is not onely still living, but begins, as it were, to recover and get strength afresh: In which regard, my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, at this time, will not be unseasonable, if, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my rise from these words of our Saviour, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, upon what grounds and example
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101070:6"/>
this practise of the Christian Church hath been esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and how frivolous and weak the reasons are, which some of late doe bring against it. To begin therefore; You see by the Text I have now read, that our blessed Saviour delivered a <hi>set form</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> unto his Disciples, and in so doing hath commended the use of a set form of prayer unto his Church; <hi>Thus therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>pray ye, Our Father which art in heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is not this a set form of prayer? and did not our Saviour deliver it to be used by his Disciples? They tell us, No. For <hi>Thus,</hi> say they, in this place is not thus to be understood, but for, in this manner, to this effect or sense, or after this pattern; not in these words and syllables. To this I answer; It is true, that this form of prayer is a pattern for us to make other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by; but that this only should be the meaning of our Saviours <hi>Thus,</hi> and not the rehearsall of the words themselves, I utterly deny; and I prove it out of the eleventh Chapter of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> where the same prayer is again delivered in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven—</hi>that is, doe it <hi>in haec Verba.</hi> For what other phrase is there to express such a meaning, if this be not? Besides, in this of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> the occasion would be considered. <hi>It came to passe</hi> (saith he) <hi>as Iesus was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his Disciples said unto him, Lord teach us to pray, as Iohn also taught his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples.</hi> From whence it may not improbably be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that this was the custome of the Doctors of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to deliver some certain <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> unto their Disciples, to use, as it were a Badge and <hi>Symbolum</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101070:6"/>
their Discipleship; at least <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had done so unto his Disciples; and thereupon our <hi>Saviours</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples besought him, that he also would give them in like manner some forme of his making: that they might also pray with their Masters spirit, as <hi>Iohns</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples did with theirs. For that either our Saviours, or <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples knew not how to pray till now, were ridiculous to imagine; they being both of them Jews, who had their certaine <hi>set houres</hi> of prayer, which they constantly observed, as the <hi>third, sixt,</hi> and <hi>ninth.</hi> It was therefore a <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> of their Masters ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which both <hi>Iohn</hi> is said to have given his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and our Saviours Disciples besought him to give them.</p>
                     <p>For the fuller understanding whereof, I must tell you something more, and the rather because it is not commonly taken notice of; and that is, That this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> is not the same with that related by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> but another, at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, and upon another occasion: That of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> in that famous Sermon of Christ upon the Mount, whereof it is a part; that of S. <hi>Luke</hi> upon a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall motion of the Disciples at a time when himselfe had done praying: That of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> in the second; that of S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the third yeare after his Baptisme: Consider the Text of both, and you shall finde it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to bring them into one and the same: whence it follows, that the Disciples, when it was first utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, understood not that their Master intended it for a <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> unto them, but for a pattern or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely, or it may be to instruct them in speciall, in what manner to ask forgiveness of sins: For if they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101070:7"/>
had thought he had given them a <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> then, they would never have asked him for one now; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour this second time utters himselfe more expresly, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven</hi>—Thus their inadvertency becomes our confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For as <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to <hi>Pharaoh, The dreame is doubled unto Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God;</hi> so may wee say here; The delivery of this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was doubled unto the Disciples, that they and we might thereby know the more certainly, that our Saviour intended and commended it for a <hi>set form</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> unto his Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of that set forme of prayer, which our Saviour gave unto his Disciples, as a precedent and warrant to his Church to give the like forms to her Disciples, or members; a thing which from her infancy she used to doe. But because her practice is called in question, as not warranted by Scripture, let us see what was the practice of the Church of the <hi>old Testament,</hi> then whose example and use, wee can have no better rule to follow in the <hi>New.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First therefore, wee find two <hi>set forms</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> or invocation, appointed by God himself in the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> One, the form wherewith the Priests were to blesse the people; <hi>Num. 6. 23. On this wise,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall Aaron and his sons blesse the children of Israel, saying unto them: The Lord blesse thee and keepe thee, the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</hi> Is not this a <hi>set forme</hi> of <hi>Prayer?</hi> For what is to <hi>blesse,</hi> but to <hi>pray</hi> over or invocate God for another?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101070:7"/>
The second, is the forme of profession and prayer to be used by him, who had paid his Tithes every third yeare, <hi>Deut. 26. 13. O Lord God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the Fatherlesse and unto the widow, according to all thy commandements, which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy Commandements, neither have I forgotten them. 14. I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any uncleane use, &amp;c. 15. Look downe from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and blesse thy people Israel, and the Land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest to our Fathers, a Land that floweth with Milke and honey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what need we seek thus for scattered Formes, when wee have a whole booke of them together? The Booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> was the Jewish Liturgie, or the chiefe part of the vocall service wherewith they worshipped God in the Temple; This is evident by the Titles of the Psalms themselves, which shew them to have beene commended to the severall <hi>Quires</hi> in the same, <hi>to Asaph, to the sonnes of Korah, to Ieduthun,</hi> and almost forty of them to the <hi>Magister Symphoniae</hi> in generall. The like wee are to conceive of those which have no titles; as for example, of the 105 and 96 Psalmes, which, though they have no such Inscription in the Psalme-booke, yet wee finde 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 7. That they were delivered by David in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Asaph and his Brethren</hi> for formes to thanke the Lord. This a man would think were sufficient to take away all scruple in this point; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101070:8"/>
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and all the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, use to sing the same Psalmes not onely as <hi>set formes,</hi> but set in Meeter, that is after a humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure. Are not the Psalmes set formes of Confession, of Prayer, and of Praising God? And in case there had been no prayers amongst them, yet what reason could be given, why it should not bee as lawfull to <hi>pray</hi> unto God in a set forme, as to <hi>praise</hi> him in such a one? What therefore doe they say to this? Why, they tell us, that the Psalmes are not sung in the Church unto God, but so rehearsed for instruction of the people onely; namely, as the Chapters and Lessons are there read, and no otherwise. But, if either wee doe, ought, or may sing the Psalmes in the Church, with the same end and purpose that the Church of the old Testament did, (and it were absurd to say wee might not) this exception will not subsist: for what is more certaine, then that the Church of Israel used the Psalmes for Formes of praising and invocating God? What mean else those formes, <hi>Cantemus Domino, Psallite Domino,</hi> and the like so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in them? But there are more direct and expresse testimonies: In the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. it is expresly said of <hi>Ieduthu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi> and his so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>es, that their office was, <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie with a Harpe, to give thanks and to praise the Lord.</hi> In the second of <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 21. wee read, <hi>that the Levites and Priests praised the Lord day by day, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with loud Instruments unto the Lord.</hi> And as ye heard even now out of 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. that <hi>David,</hi> at the time when he brought up the Ark unto Jerusalem, then first delivered the 105. and 95 <hi>Psalms</hi> into the hands of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> and his sonnes, to confesse or give
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101070:8"/>
thanks unto the Lord.</hi> And lastly, to leave no place for farther doubt, wee read <hi>Ezra 3. 11. That the Levites the sonnes of Asaph were set with Cymbals to praise the Lord, after the ordinance of David King of Israel.</hi> And that, <hi>they sung together by course, in praising &amp; giving thanks unto the Lord, because he is good, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever.</hi> For this reason, the foure and twenty Courses or Quires, into which the singers of the Temple were divided by King <hi>David</hi> to serve in their turnes, consisted each of them of twelve, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the tribes of Israel; that so every Tribe might have a mouth and voyce, to praise and to give thanks unto God for him in the Temple.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have seene, what warrant to <hi>pray,</hi> and call upon God in a <hi>set forme</hi> hath from the practice of the Church of God in the old Testament; And, if reason may have place, in the publike service of God, where one is the mouth of many, there is none so proper and convenient. For how can the Minister be said properly to be the mouth of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in prayer unto God, when the Congregation is not first made acquainted, and privy to what he is to render unto God in their names? which in a <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>extemporary</hi> Prayer they are not, nor well can be. I am sure neither so properly, nor conveniently, as in a <hi>set forme,</hi> which both they and the whole Church have agreed upon, and offer unto God at the same time, though in severall places, in the self-same forme and words: And this may be a second reason; I meane from <hi>Vniformity,</hi> For how can the Church, being a mysticall Body, better testifie her unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, then in her uniformity in calling upon him?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101070:9"/>
especially our Saviour telling us, that if but <hi>two or three shall agree together on earth, as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done unto them of his Father which is in heaven;</hi> So prevailable with All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is the power of consent in prayer.</p>
                     <p>Let us now, in the last place, see what reasons they bring, who contend altogether for <hi>voluntary prayer,</hi> and would have no <hi>set formes</hi> used. First, they say, it is the ordinance of God, that the Church should be <hi>edified</hi> by the gifts of her Ministers, as well in praying as preaching. <hi>Ergo,</hi> their prayers should be <hi>extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or <hi>voluntary;</hi> because in reading a <hi>set forme</hi> this gift cannot be shewn.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer: First, that there is not, in this point, the same reason for <hi>Prayer,</hi> and for <hi>Preaching;</hi> for in prayer (I meane Publique) the Minister is the mouth of the Church unto God, and therefore it were convenient, they should know what he puts up to God, in their names; but in preaching, he is not so. Secondly, Why should not the Pastours and Ministers of the Church, edify the Church by their gift of prayer, as well in composing a set forme of prayer for her use by generall agreement, as in utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a voluntary or extemporary prayer in a particular Congregation? Thirdly, Are not the members of the Church to be edified, as well by the Spirit of the Church, as the Church or some part thereof by the Spirit of a member? But how can the Church edifie her members by her gift of prayer, otherwise then by a set form agreed upon by her consent? Fourthly, Ostentation of gifts is one thing, but edification by them another. Ostentation of the gift of prayer is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101070:9"/>
indeed best shewn in a voluntary or extemporary prayer; but the Church may be edified as well by a set forme; Yea, such a forme in the publique service of God is more edificative, then a voluntary. And that, both because the Congregation is first made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith; and secondly, because they are better secured from being ingaged in ought that might be unfit to speak unto God, either for matter or manner, or such as they would not have given their consent to, if they had been aware of it. For, now that extraordinary assistance of the Holy Ghost, which was in the Primitive and Apostolicall times, is long since ceased; And all men, to whom that office belongeth, to speake to God for others, are not at all times discreet and well advised, when they speake to him at will, and <hi>extempore,</hi> but subject to miscariage. Lastly, I answer, That the Church is to be edified by the gift of her Ministers in voluntary prayer, <hi>loco</hi> &amp; <hi>tempore,</hi> in fit place and upon fit occasions, not in all places, and upon all occasions. And thus much to this objection.</p>
                     <p>But they object secondly; that the <hi>Spirit</hi> ought to be <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unlimited,</hi> and that therefore a <hi>Book</hi> or set <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> which limits the spirit in praying, is not to be tolerated or used.</p>
                     <p>To this I answer: it is false, that the acting of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in one Christan, may not be limited or regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit of another; especially, the spirit of a particular man in the publike worship, by the spirit of the Church, whereof he is a member. For doth not the Apostle tell us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. that even that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary spirit of Prophecy, usuall in his time, might be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101070:10"/>
limited by the spirit of another Prophet? <hi>Let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> saith he, <hi>speak two or three, and let the other judg: If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</hi> Is not this a limiting? He gives a reason: <hi>For the spirits of the Prophets,</hi> saith he, <hi>are subject to the Prophets.</hi> Besides, are not the spirits of the people, as well limited and determined by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary prayer, when they joyne therein with their Minister, as they are by a set forme? True; the spirit of the Minister is then free; but theirs is not so, but tied and led by the spirit of the Minister, as much as if he used a set forme. But to elude this, they tell us, that the Question is not of limiting the spirit of the <hi>people,</hi> but of the <hi>Minister</hi> onely; For, as for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no more is required of them, but to join with their Minister, and to testifie it by saying <hi>Amen;</hi> but the spirit of the Minister ought to be left free, and not to be limited. But where is this written? that the one may not be limited as well as the other. We heard the Apostle say even now, <hi>The spirit of the Prophets, is subject to the Prophets;</hi> If in prophecying, why not in praying? And what shew of reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be given, why the spirit of a particular Minister in the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Church, may not, yea ought not to be limited, and regulated by the spirit of the Church representative, as well as the spirit of a whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by the spirit of a particular Minister? For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Minister, is as much subordinate to the spirit of the Church representative, as the spirit of the Congregation is to his; So much for this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>There remaineth yet a third, which may be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101070:10"/>
in two or three words. No set forme of prayer, say they, can serve for all occasions: What then? Yet why may it not be used for all such occasions as it serves for? if any sudden and unexpected occasion happen, for which the Church cannot provide, the spirit of her Ministers is free: Who will forbid them to supply in such a case, that by a voluntary and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary forme, which the Church could not provide for in a set forme? And this is what I intended to say of this argument.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101070:12"/>
To call upon the Name of the Lord Iesus;</hi> these I say, and the like expressions, have no other meaning, then to doe these things to the Divine Majesty, to the Lord Jesus, whose is that <hi>Name above every Name, where at every knee must bow.</hi> Accordingly here, <hi>Sanctificetur Nomen tuum, Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> is as much as to say, <hi>Sanctificetur Numen tuum, Sanctified be thy Divine Majesty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, under the <hi>Name of God</hi> here to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or hallowed, understand, besides the Majesty of his Godhead, that also <hi>super quod invocatum est Nomen ejus,</hi> whereupon his Name is called; or that which is called by his Name, (as we in our Bibles commonly expresse this phrase of Scripture;) that is, all whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Gods, or God is the Lord and owner of by a peculiar right; such as are things sacred, whether they be persons, or whether things by distinction so called, or Times, or Places, which have upon them a relation of peculiarnesse towards God. For such as these are said in Scripture, <hi>To have the Name of God called upon them,</hi> or <hi>To be called by his Name;</hi> that is, To be His. Thus we read in Scripture, of an House which had the Name of God upon it, or which was called by his Name, that is, of Gods House, (1 <hi>Kings 8. 43. Ier. 7. 10. &amp;c.)</hi> Of a City upon which the Name of God was called or named, to wit, the Holy City, Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem the City of the great King, the Lord of hosts, <hi>(Ier. 25. 29. Dan.</hi> 9. 18.) Of an Ark upon which the Name of God the Lord was called (1 <hi>Chro. 13. 6. 2 Sam.</hi> 6. 2.) that is, the Lords Ark, or the Ark of his Covenant, as it is elsewhere named. Of a people upon which the Name of the Lord was called, or which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101070:12"/>
were called by his Name <hi>(Deut. 28. 10. Dan.</hi> 9. 19. and elsewhere) that is, were his peculiar and holy people; as is said in like manner, and with like mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church of the New Testament; <hi>Iames 2. 7. Acts</hi> 15 17. I represent not these places of Scripture at large, because I know that every eare that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Scripture, can beare witness unto them. And for the meaning of this expression of Gods Name to be called upon a thing, or a thing to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Name, that it is all one as to say it <hi>to be His,</hi> (besides the evidence of the matter wherabout it is used) appeares by the same phrase used in two other places, of the like relation of men to that which is theirs, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 48 16. Where <hi>Iacob</hi> blessing <hi>Iosephs</hi> sons saith <q>
                           <hi>The Angell which redeemed me from all evil, blesse the lads, and let my name be called upon them;</hi>
                        </q> That is, let them be mine, namely, as <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> are mine, as he saith a little before; for they are words of adoption. Again in the fourth of <hi>Esay,</hi> where it is said, <q>
                           <hi>That seven women should take hold of one man, and say, We will eat our own bread, and weare our own apparel; onely let thy Name be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon us to take away our reproach;</hi>
                        </q> That is Doe thou own us, or let us be thine, that it may not be a reproach unto us, that we have no husband.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101070:13"/>
phrase of Scripture, of Gods Name to be called or named upon a thing, hath reference unto any such custome, I cannot affirme, but surely the meaning is the same; to wit, that God is the Lord and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of them. And thus ye have heard what is this <hi>Name of God</hi> we pray here to be sanctified; to wit, a twofold Name: First, His Name and Majesty which we call upon; Secondly, that also which is called by his Name: The first we may call his <hi>Personall,</hi> the other his <hi>Denominative</hi> or <hi>participated Name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having learned what <hi>Nomen Dei</hi> importeth, and so cleared the object of what we pray for, let us next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, What that is, which the word <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> or <hi>To be sanctified,</hi> implieth, being that which our vote witnesseth, ought to be done thereunto. And this I intended for the main and principall Argument of my present Discourse, being a matter not so well tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as the former, and perhaps not altogether freed of obscurity and difficulty to be understood. For our more certain and assured discovery whereof, we will first examine the abstract thereof, <hi>Sanctity,</hi> &amp; find out the notion of it; namely, what is the <hi>ratio formalis,</hi> the formall state, or nature of that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture entitleth in the generall, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, that is, <hi>Holy;</hi> not regarding what notion the Greeks or Latines had respect to in their Languages; but what the holy Scripture properly intendeth under that name: For because <hi>to be Sanctified</hi> can have but these two senses, either <hi>To be made holy,</hi> or <hi>To be used and done unto according to,</hi> or <hi>as becometh its Holinesse;</hi> and that the Majesty of God, which is the prime object of this Act, is not capable of the first sense <hi>(viz.</hi> to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101070:13"/>
be made holy,) but of the second onely: if we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore once rightly understand what is the condition and property of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> according to the notion of Scripture, we shall not be long ignorant, what it is either for the Name or Majesty of God, or that which is called by his Name <hi>to be hallowed</hi> or <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> namely, to be done unto according to their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>R. David Kimchi</hi> upon the 56 of <hi>Esay, ver.</hi> 2 [<q>Blessed is the man that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it</q>] <hi>hath these words, The sanctification</hi> of the Sabbath (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to separate or distinguish it from other dayes: because every word of Sanctity <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <q>imports a thing separated or divided from other things, by way of preeminence or excellency.</q> 
                        <hi>Thus the</hi> Rabbi. And that this which he saith is true, namely, that <hi>sanctity</hi> consists in <hi>discretion</hi> and <hi>distinction</hi> from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, by way of exaltation and preeminence, may appeare by these instances and examples, which I shall now produce out of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And first from that Law touching the holy oyle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 31. where, after the composition thereof described; <q>
                           <hi>This</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>shall be an holy anointing oyl unto me.</hi> what is that? it follows, <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mans flesh shal it not be poured, neither shal ye make any other like it, after the composition thereof. It is Holy, therefore it shall be Holy unto you:</hi>
                        </q> that is, As this Oyle is Holy and discrete from other Oyles, so shall it accordingly by you be used with difference and discrimination: For the Text goes on; <q>
                           <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever compoundeth any like it, or putteth any of it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101070:14"/>
upon a stranger,</hi>
                        </q> (that is, upon any besides those it was appropriated to) <hi>shall be cut off from his people.</hi> What else means all this, but that this Oyle should be a singular or peculiar Oyle, set apart and distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from all other Oyles, both in its composition and use, and that to be such, was to be Holy or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred?</p>
                     <p>The like we shall finde in the 35. <hi>verse</hi> of the same Chapter, concerning the Holy perfume there descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: <q>Thou shalt make it, <hi>saith he, (to wit, with the the ingredients he afore mentioned)</hi> a perfume, a confection, after the art of the Apothecary, tempered together, pure and Holy. <hi>verse 37.</hi> You shall not make to your selves (i. <hi>not for your own use)</hi> according to the composition thereof. It shall be unto you holy for the Lord. <hi>ver. 38.</hi> Whosoever shall make the like unto it, to smell thereto, shall be cut off from his people.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But above all others this notion of <hi>sanctity</hi> or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse is most expressely intimated and taught us in those divine periphrases or circumlocutions, which the Lord himself more then once makes of an <hi>Holy People,</hi> as <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 24. speaking on this manner; <hi>I am the Lord your God which have separated you from other people.—And ye shall be Holy unto me: for I the Lord am Holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.</hi> Mark here, that to <hi>separate</hi> is to make <hi>Holy,</hi> and that to be <hi>Holy</hi> is to be <hi>separated</hi> from others of the same rank. Again, <hi>Deut. 26. 18, 19. The Lord hath avouched thee</hi> (to wit, Israel) <hi>this day to be his peculiar</hi> (or appropriate) <hi>people, as he hath promised thee.—And to make thee high above all Nations, which he hath made, in praise, in name, and in honour;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101070:14"/>
namely, that thou maist be an Holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.</hi> What is this but Rabbi <hi>Kimchi's</hi> definition almost <hi>verbatim?</hi> That to bee sacred or <hi>Holy</hi> is to be <hi>separated</hi> or set apart from other things by way of excellence; or which is all one, To be set in some state of singularity, or appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse, whereby it is advanced above the common condition of things of the same order. He that will, may compare also two other passages, <hi>Deut. 7. 6. &amp;</hi> 14. 2. parallels to those I have produced; where to be an holy, and to be a peculiar people, are made one and the same, or the one expounded by the other.</p>
                     <p>It may be yet further confirmed by comparing <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 2, 7. with <hi>Ioshuah</hi> 20. 7. For whereas in the former of these places it is said, concerning the Cities of refuge: <hi>Thou shalt separate,</hi>

Now then, if to be unholy or unclean be to be common, surely it follows by the Law of opposition, that to be holy, is to be separated from the common, and to be singular and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in some manner or other.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it is to be observed, that whereas in the Law given <hi>Numbers</hi> 6. concerning the Vow of Nazarisme (which signifies <hi>separation,</hi> of <hi>Nazar,</hi> to separate) the words, <hi>To separate,</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> come very often in <note place="margin">As the 70. once or twice in this place, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where sometimes render the same word.</note> the Text; the vulgar Latine renders for them above ten times, <hi>Consecrare, consecratio, sanctificare,</hi> and <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificatio:</hi> which shews, that this notion, namely, that Holinesse consists in a state of separation, is no new conceit, but such as Antiquity took notice of.</p>

The nature of Holinesse, wherein it consisteth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the idiome of Scripture being thus found out and cleared, that which was aimed at in this inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, to wit, what the same meaneth by <hi>To sanctifie,</hi> and <hi>to be sanctified,</hi> will be no hard matter to resolve. For <hi>sanctity,</hi> and <hi>to sanctifie</hi> being Conjugates, or Denominatives, as Logicians call them, the one ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the way to the knowledge of the other. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sanctity or Holinesse be a condition of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and distinction from other things, as we have shewed it to be; then <hi>To sanctifie</hi> must either be to put a thing into that state, which we call, <hi>To consecrate;</hi> or if it be such already, <hi>To use,</hi> and doe unto it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the sanctity thereof; that is <hi>Habere cum discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> to put a difference between it and other things by way of excellency, or in a dignifying wise, by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating and severing it in the use thereof from things of ordinary and common rank: or, which is all one, To use it singularly, appropriately, and in a word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly. For not to use it so, it being such, were to abuse it; which the Scripture cals <hi>to prophane;</hi> to <hi>sanctifie,</hi> and to <hi>prophane</hi> being opposites. Whence <hi>Ezek. 22. 26.

                        <q>I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people.

                     <p>To speak of them distinctly; The first, originall or absolute <hi>Holinesse</hi> is nothing else, but the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable eminency of the divine Majesty, exalted above all, and divided from all other <gap reason="foreign">

Thus you see that as <hi>Holinesse</hi> in generall imports a state of eminency and separation, so this of God, as I have described it, disagrees not from that generall notion, when I affirm it to consist in a state of peerlesse or incommunicable Majesty: for that which is such, includes both the one and the other. But would you understand it yet better? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it then to his attributes whereby he is known unto us, and know that <hi>The Lord is Holy,</hi> is as much to say. He is a Majesty of peerlesse Power, of peerlesse Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of peerlesse Goodnesse, and so of the rest. Such a one is our God, and such is his <hi>Holinesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then to <hi>Sanctifie</hi> this peerlesse Name or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of his, must be by doing unto him according to that which his Holinesse challengeth in respect of the double importance thereof: namely, To serve and glorifie him; because of his eminency; and to doe it with a singular, separate and incommunicated wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, because He is Holy. Not to doe the former is <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi> and <hi>Atheisme,</hi> as not to acknowledge God to be the chief and Soveraign eminency: not to observe the second is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For as the Lord our God is a singular and peerlesse Majesty, distinguished from, and exalted above all things and eminencies else whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; so must his worship be singular, incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper to him alone.

                     </p>
                     <p>Whence in Scripture, those who communicate the worship given unto him with any besides him, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him, by way of Object, that is, whether immediately, or but mediately, are deemed to deny his incomparable Sanctity, and therefore said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane his Holy Name: See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 39. 43. 7, 8.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101070:20"/>
For the word, <hi>to sanctifie,</hi> or <hi>be sanctified,</hi> is sometimes used of God in a more generall sense then that I have hitherto specified, namely, as signifying <hi>any way to be glorified,</hi> or <hi>to glorifie;</hi> as when he saith, He will bee <hi>sanctified</hi> in the destruction of his enemies, or in the deliverance of his people, and that before the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and the like; that is, he would purchase him glory, or be glorified thereby. I answer, it is true, that <hi>to be sanctified</hi> is in these passages, <hi>to be glorified;</hi> but yet always to be glorified as God, and not otherwise. Namely, when God by the works of his power, of his mercy, or justice extorts from men the confession of his great and holy Godhead; he is then said <hi>to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,</hi> or make himself to be sanctified amongst them; that is, to be glorified and honoured by their convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and acknowledgement of his power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. For although men may be also said to glorifie, or purchase honour unto themselves, when by their noble acts they make their abilities and worth known unto the world: yet, for such respect, to be said to be sanctified, is peculiar unto him alone, whose Glory is <hi>his Holinesse; i.</hi> unto God.</p>
                     <p>THUS we have learned how the Name or Majesty of God is to be sanctified personally, or in it self; which is the chiefest thing we pray for, and ought so to be in our endeavour; namely, to worship and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him incommunicably, according to his most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent &amp; unparalleld Holiness: and so, O Lord, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> But there is another sanctification or hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Gods Name yet behind, which must be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therewith; which is, <hi>To sanctifie</hi> him also in the things which have his Name upon them; that is, are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101070:20"/>
separate and dedicate to his service, or in a word, which are <hi>His,</hi> namely, by a peculiar relation. For otherwise it is true: <hi>The whole earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof, the World and those that dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> But there are some things <hi>his,</hi> not as other things are, and so as they are no longer <hi>ours,</hi> such as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the style of Scripture (as I have already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) are said, <hi>to be called by his Name,</hi> or <hi>to have his Name called upon them.</hi> These are things <hi>sacred.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I told you before of a twofold sanctity or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: The one originall, absolute, and essentiall in God: the other derived, or relative in that which is set apart to be in a peculiar and appropriate manner <hi>His.</hi> For whatsoever belongeth unto him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is divided from other things with preeminence, whether they be things or persons which are so sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. For in such separation we shewed the nature of sanctity in generall to consist. Now as the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty it self is separate and holy, so know, it is a part of that honour we owe unto his most Sacred Name, that the things whereby, and wherewith he is served, should not be promiscuous and common, but appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate and set apart to that sacred end. It is an honour which in some degree of resemblance we afford unto Kings, Princes, and other persons of dignity, (of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite lesse eminency then God is) to interdict the use of that to others, which they are wont to use; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the whole kinde, sometimes the individuall onely. As we know in former times, to wear purple, to subscribe with the Ink called <hi>Encaustum,</hi> of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour, and other the like, which the diligent may finde, were appropriate to the use of Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101070:21"/>
onely. In the Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> we reade of the <hi>Kings Mule,</hi> so appropriate to his use, as to ride upon him was to be made King, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 33, 34. In the Book of <hi>Esther, Chap. 6. v.</hi> 8. of the <hi>Horse</hi> that King <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> used to ride upon, put in the same rank with the <hi>Crown</hi> and royall apparell, which none but the King might weare. And of individuall Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils thus appropriated, and as it were dedicated to the alone use of persons of eminency, our own times want not examples. Whence naturall instinct may seem to prompt unto us, that such appropriation is a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of honour and respect. Sure I am, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hath revealed it to be a part of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we owe unto him. Thus all the Utensils of the Tabernacle and Temple were <hi>sacred</hi> and set apart to that use; and not the Utensils of the Altar onely, but even the instruments of musick, which <hi>David</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to praise the Lord with in the Temple, were not common, but consecrated unto God for that end, whence they are called, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 42. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Nay, our blessed Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a profane or common vessell to be so much as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101070:21"/>
through his Fathers House, accounting it as great a profanation, as to buy and sell there. And yet was not this abuse (which is a thing well to be marked) within those Septs of the Temple, which the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> accounted sacred, but in the outmost. Court called <hi>Atrium gentium &amp; immandorum,</hi> the place in which together with such as were unclean, the Gentiles, and uncircumcised were admitted to pray; as that of the Prophet cited by our Saviour, rightly rendred, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>My house shall be called a house of prayer, to</hi> (or <hi>for)</hi> ALL NATIONS. Consider <hi>Esay</hi> 56. 6, 7. This Court therefore the Jews made no other account of, then as of a prophane place; but our Saviour proved by Scripture, that this Gentiles Oratory was also part of his Fathers house, and accordingly not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned with common use. Lastly, there was never any age of the Christian Church (till of late) wherein it was not commonly beleeved, that God was to bee honoured by such appropriation or consecration as we speak of; that is, that Gods Name was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be sanctified. But are there any (will you say) now that deny it? Yes, there are some in our age so far carried away into a contrary extreme to that they flie from, that they hold that no oblation or consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things unto God, by the devotion of men, in the New Testament, whether of Utensils, goods, times, or places, ought to be esteemed lawfull; but that all distinction between sacred and prophane in externall things, by vertue of such consecration (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the Sacraments) is flat superstition: Yet to him that seriously considers it, it cannot chuse, me thinks, but seem strange and absurd to affirm, (as this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101070:22"/>
assertion doth) that men now in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, are exempted and freed from agnizing God to be Lord of the creature, by giving some part thereof unto him; then which no part of Divine Worship is more naturall, and which hath been used by mankinde ever since the beginning of the world. Yea, in the state of Paradise, among all the trees in the Garden, which God gave man freely to enjoy, one tree was <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> and reserved to God as holy, in token he was Lord of the Garden. So that the first sin of Mankinde, for the <hi>species</hi> of the fact, was <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> in prophaning that which God had made holy.</p>
                     <p>They say, It is true, that in the Old Testament, this way of honouring and acknowledging God was warranted by the Divine Law: but in the New wee finde no precept given concerning it nor confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which was before. Now God is not to bee worshipped with any worship, but what he hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self prescribed in his Word. I answer, What though there be no particular pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cept in the New Testament for this, no more then for divers other duties, which a Christian is bound to; yet if a generall warrant be, the particular needs not. But our Saviour saith in his Gospel, in that Euangelicall Sermon hee preached upon the Mount, That hee came not to dissolve the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfill or perfect them. <hi>Think not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I am come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Law and the Prophets</hi> [that is, to take away the obligation of that rule of the duty of man to God and his neighbour, given first by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Law, and afterwards repeated and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Prophets; for so Prophets are here to

For surely, this must be the meaning of this speech of our Saviour, if we be more willing (as we should) to take a sense from Scripture, then to bring one to it. Doth not the whole context following evince it? Indeed the Law, that is, the Legall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or Covenant of works (as Law is oft taken in the New Testament) together with all the rites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereon, is dissolved by the comming of Christ; and a better Covenant with new rites establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in stead thereof: But the Law, that is, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Rule of life given by God contradistinct from those ordinances, which were onely appendages of that Covenant, (though these were also in some sense perfected by bringing the truth and substance, in stead of the figure and shadow thereof) is not disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, but confirmed and perfected by him, in such manner as became the condition of the Covenant of the Gospel. For that this confirmation is not to bee restrained to the Decalogue onely, is manifest; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Savior in the following words, insists upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precepts besides it. If it be said, they are reducible thereto; this will not serve the turn, for so are all the rest of Gods Commandements. Unlesse therefore it can be shewn, that to honour God by an oblation of his creature, is no part of the Law here confirmed by our Saviour: Let no man be so daringly bold, as to exempt himself and others from the obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101070:23"/>
unlesse he means to be one of them of whom our Saviour speaks immediately, saying, <q>
                           <hi>Whosoever therefore shall break one of the least of these Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and shall teach men so to do,</hi> (mark it) <hi>he shall be called (i.</hi> he shall be) <hi>the least in the Kingdome of heaven.</hi>

                     <p>Nay how dare we disbind or loose our selves from the tie of that way of agnizing and honouring God, which the Christian Church from her first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings durst not doe? <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> witnesse of that age which next succeeded the Apostles, is plain. <hi>Lib. 4. c.</hi> 34 <q>

T.) oblationes autem &amp; hic; sacrificia in populo, sacrificia &amp; in Ecclesia: sed species immutata est tantum; quip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe cum jam non à servis, sed à liberis offeratur.

For there is one and the

same Lord still; but there is a proper character of a bond or servile offering, and a proper character of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens; that so even the Offerings may shew forth the tokens of freedome.</hi>
                        </q>—Now where in Scripture he beleeved this doctrine and practise to be grounded, he lets us know in the XXVII. chap. of the same Book: <q>
                           <hi>Et quia Dominus naturalia legis, per quae ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo justificatur, (quae etiam ante legisdationem custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diebant, qui fide justificabantur, &amp; placebant Deo) non dissolvit, sed extendit, sed &amp; implevit, ex sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ejus ostenditur.</hi> i. <hi>That our Lord dissolved not, but enlarged and perfected the naturall precepts of the Law, whereby a man is just, which also before the Law was given they observed, who were justified by faith and pleased God, is evident by his words.</hi>
                        </q> Then hee cites some of the passages of that his Sermon upon the Mount <hi>Mat. V.</hi> 20. &amp;c. And a little after addes: <q>
                           <hi>Necesse fuit auferre quidem vincula servitutis, quibus jam homo assueverat, &amp; sine vinculis sequi Deum, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perextendi verò decreta libertatis, &amp; augeri subjectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quae est ad Regem, ut non retrorsus quis renitens indignus appareat ei qui se liberavit.—Et pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter hoc Dominus, pro eo quod est, Non moechaberis, nec concupiscere praecepit; &amp; pro eo quod est, Non occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, neque irasci quidem; &amp; pro eo quod est Decimare, omnia quae sunt pauperibus dividere.</hi> i. <hi>It was needful, that those bonds of servitude, which man had before been inured to, should be taken off, that so he might without Gives follow God: but that the laws and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of freedome should be extended, and his subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the King encreased, lest that drawing back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he might appear unworthy of him that freed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101070:24"/>
him.—And for this reason, our Lord in stead of, Thou shalt not commit adultery, commands not so much as to lust: in stead of, Thou shalt not kill, not so much as to be angry: in stead of to Tith, to distribute all we have to the poore, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> All which saith he, in the same place, are not <hi>solventis legem, sed adimplentis, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendentis &amp; dilatantis, not of one that dissolves the Law, but fulfils, extends and enlarges it:</hi> alluding still to that in our Saviours Sermon upon the Mount.</p>
                     <p>Besides, those who are acquainted with Antiquity can tell, that the Primitive Christians understood the holy Eucharist, to be, A commemoration of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christs death upon the crosse, in an oblation of bread and wine. Tis witnessed by the Fathers of those first ages generally. Whereupon the same <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> also affirmeth, That our Saviour by the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eucharist had confirmed oblations in the new Testament. Namely, to thanksgive or blesse a thing in way to a sacred use, he took to be an offering of it unto God. And was not <hi>Davids</hi> Benediction and thanksgiving at the preparation for the Temple an Offertory?

                     </p>
                     <p>TAKING therefore for granted, that which the practise of the Church of God in all ages; yea, I think, I may say the consent of mankinde from the beginning of the world, beareth witnesse to; that among those duties of the Sanctification of Gods Name, wherewith his Divine Majesty is immediately and personally glorified (of which I have before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) this is one, and a principall one; to agnize and confesse his peerlesse Soveraignty and dominion over the creature, by yeelding him some part thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his worship and service, of which we renounce the propriety our selves; and that accordingly there are both things and persons now in the Gospel (as well as were before the Law was given) in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lawfully and acceptably set apart and separated, by the devotion of men, unto the Divine Majesty, and consequently <hi>relatively Holy</hi> (which is nothing else, but to be Gods by a peculiar right:) I say, that these are likewise to be done unto according to their degree of sanctity, in honour of him, whose they are: Not to be worshipped with divine worship, or the worship which we give unto God, communicated to them, (farre be it from us, to deferre to any creature the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due unto the Divine Majesty, either together with him, or without him;) but yet <hi>Habenda cum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimine,</hi>

To be regarded with a worthy and discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native usance, that is, used with a select, and differing respect from other things: as namely, if <hi>Places,</hi> not as other places; if <hi>Times,</hi> not as other times; if <hi>Things</hi> by way of distinction so called, not as other things; if <hi>Persons</hi> set apart unto the service and worship of God, neither to be used by others, nor they to carry themselves in their fashion of life, as other persons, (for that which in other things sacred is their use; in persons sacred is their conversation, demeanour or carriage of themselves) but all to be sanctified with a select, appropriate, or uncommon usage; that as they are Gods by peculiar relation, and have his Name called upon them, so to be <hi>separate,</hi> as far as they are capable, from common use, and imployed as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and circumstances of his worship and service: which is the highest and most singular honour that any creature is capable of. Nay, (as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) even this is to the honour of God, that as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is that singular, incommunicable, and absolutely <hi>Holy One,</hi> and his service and worship therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable: so should that also which hath his Name thereon, or is consecrated to his service, be in some proportion incommunicably used, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously and commonly as other things are.

transgression And what though they be wood, and stone, and dust and ashes? when the Name of the Lord of all the world is called upon things, they are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (i. made holy.) <hi>And who so useth them to common use, he transgresseth therein; and though he doe it through ignorance, he must needs bring his atonement.</hi>
                        </q> Yea, it is a thing worthy to be taken speciall notice of, that, that so presumptuous, and most dreadfully vindicated sin of <hi>Korah, Dathan, Abiram,</hi> and their company, in offering incense unto the Lord being not called thereunto, did not discharge their Censers of this discriminative respect due unto things Sacred. For thus the Lord said unto <hi>Moses,</hi> after that fire from heaven had consumed them for their impiety: <q>
                           <hi>Speak unto Eleazar the Son of Aaron the Priest, that he take up the Censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are hallowed: The Censers of these Sinners against their own souls, let them make of them broad plates for a covering of the Altar: for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed,</hi> or holy. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 37, 38.</q>

                     <p>Now that by this discriminative usance or sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of things sacred, the Name of God is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and sanctified, according to the tenour of our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; is apparent, not onely from reason, which tels us that the honour and respect had unto ought that belongs unto another, because it is his, redounds unto the owner and Master; but from Scripture, which tels us, that by the contrary use of them, his name is prophaned.

Take in also if you will, that of <hi>Malachi Cha.</hi> 1. where the Lord says of those, who despised and dishonoured his Table, or Altar by offering thereon for sacrifice, the lame, the blinde, and sick, which the Law had made unclean and polluted, that they had prophaned his <hi>Holy Name.</hi> But if the Name of God be prophaned by the disesteem and misusage of the things it is called upon, then surely it is sanctified, when the same are worthily and discriminatively used, that is, as becommeth the relation they have to him.</p>
                     <p>I have already specified the severall kinds of Sacred things which are thus to be sanctified: yet lest some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contained under some of them might not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, by so generall an intimation, it will not

I preferre the first; yet either of both will give their Order the title of Holinesse, as doth also more especially their descent which they derive from the Apostles; that is, from those, for whom their Lord and Master prayed unto his Father, saying, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                     <p>Now that the Christian Church (for of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish I shall need say nothing) hath always taken it for granted, that those of her Clergy ought, according to the separation and sanctity of their Order, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, and differenced from other Christians, both passively in their usance from others, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally actively, by a restrained conversation, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarnesse in their manner of life, is manifest by her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canons and Discipline.

Which that the Church, even in her better times, respected with an holy and discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native usance, may be learned from the Story of that calumnious crimination, devised by the Arrian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against <hi>Athanasius,</hi> as a charge of no small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; namely, that in his Visitation of the Tract of <hi>Mareotis, Macarius,</hi> one of his Presbyters, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or instinct, had entered into a Church of the Miletian Schismatiques, and there broken the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> or <hi>Communion Cup,</hi> thrown down the <hi>Table,</hi> and burnt some of the <hi>Holy Books.</hi> All which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that in the generall opinion of Christians of that time, such acts were esteemed prophane and impious; otherwise they could never have hoped (as they did) to have blasted the reputation of the holy Bishop by such a slaunder.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>Books of God,</hi> or holy Scripture, (which I referred to this title) especially those which are for the publique service of God in the Church, I adde this further; That under that name I would

have comprehended the <hi>senses, words</hi> and <hi>phrases</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the expression of Divine and Sacred things; which a Religious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">Thirdly, under this fourth head of things Sacred I comprehend <hi>Sacred Acts;</hi> such as are the Acts of Gods holy worship and administration of his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For albeit these Acts are duties of the first and personall Sanctification of Gods Name, whereof the immediate object is God; yet are the Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sacred things, and therefore have some sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication due to them also, as other sacred things have: of which, although it be most true, that the unfained devotion of the heart (as before him who alone knoweth the hearts of the children of men) be the main and principall requisite; yet unlesse even in the outward performance, they be, for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumstances, discriminated from common acts, by a select accommodation befitting their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, their sanctification is defective, and by such defect, if voluntary, Gods Name is prophaned, even then when wee are worshipping him. How much more, when our carriage therein commeth short even of that wonted reverence, wherewith we come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an earthly Potentate? May not God here justly use the same expostulation with us, that he did with those in the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> who presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before him with such an offering, as was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the blemishes unworthy of, and unbefitting so great a Majesty, and therefore to be accounted rather an affront then an act of honour and worship? <hi>Yee

have,</hi> saith he, <hi>despised and prophaned my Name—</hi>
                        <q>Offer it now unto thy Governour: will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?—yet I am a <note place="margin">Malac. c. 1. v. 6, 8, 12, 14.</note>

                        </q> And this is the document or lesson, which this place naturally and unavoydably ministreth to us; That to come before the Divine Majesty, with lesse reverent and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deportment, then we doe before earthly Kings and potentates, is to despise and prophane his holy Name. And not that, which some would shelter under this text, and lean too much upon; namely, That the acts of Gods externall worship ought to be wholly conform to the use of the semblable actions performed unto men, and not differ from them: and upon this ground charge the Christian Liturgies with absurdity in their forms of praying, and praising God with <hi>responsals,</hi> singing <hi>by turns,</hi> and speaking <hi>many together.</hi> For this principle is directly repugnant to the nature of Sanctification, which consists in discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and difference. And therefore, though the materiall of our gestures and other expressions vocall or visible, be borrowed from the use and custome of men; yet for the formality of them, not onely they may, but ought to be differenced from them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, touching this reproof of the Prophet; take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that it is grounded upon the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXII. where we are taught, that when that is not observed concerning the Rites of Gods service which the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of them requireth, as in other particulars, so in this of a not defective or unblemished offering, his Name is thereby prophaned. See <hi>v.</hi> 32. with the rest of the chapter foregoing it. And if so, then by the contrary it is sanctified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:101070:29"/>
Lastly, Unto this head of sacred Acts I reduce <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>sacred Covenants,</hi> that is, such as are made either with God, or between men; Gods Name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called upon, which therefore 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 8. are styled <hi>Covenants of the Lord:</hi> For that the observance due touching both is a sanctifying of them, as things upon which the Name of the Lord is called, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; forasmuch as when they are violated by falshood, they are said to be prophaned, as <hi>Levit. 19. 12. Psal. 55. 20. Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus together with my explication of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sorts of sacred things, I have briefly and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pointed at that also wherein the proper sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of each consisteth, which though far short of such a tractation as the matter requireth: yet if it may serve but to give occasion onely to others who are better able, to bend their thoughts upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (which perhaps the times call for) I shall fully attain the end I aimed at. For mine own part, to descend to particulars would be a task too high for me, and as I suspect, not very acceptable. For it is ten to one (if the grounds I have laid be true) but that the most of us would be found faulty in some things, and some of us in all. Well, the summe of my argumentation hath been this: Is there any thing in the New Test. Gods by a peculiar right? To say there is not, is absurd and against the perpetuall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Christianity. If there be, then it is <hi>holy;</hi> if holy, then to be <hi>sanctified;</hi> if sanctified, then to be <hi>discriminated</hi> in the usance and respect thereof, from that which is of common condition.</p>
                     <p>NOW out of this discourse, which I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101070:30"/>
made, you may see and take notice, That (contrary to the vulgar opinion) <hi>the Prohibition of Idolatry</hi> and <hi>the discriminative observance of things sacred;</hi> not to prophane them by a promiscuous and common use; are derived both of them from one and same principle, sc. <hi>Gods Incommunicablenesse,</hi> which derives a shadow and resemblance upon the things which have his Name called upon them, to wit, a state of <hi>appropriatnesse</hi> and singularity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. not without good reason, compares together the transgressions of the one and the other kinde, as parallel sins, or sins of affinity: <q>
                           <hi>Thou that hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </q> Where by <hi>Sacriledge</hi> understand not onely the usurpation of things sacred, but the violation of that which is sacred, in generall: And it is as if he had said, thou hast mended the matter well indeed, for still thou dashest against the same principle. For it is one of the exemplifications of that he saith in the beginning of the Chapter: <hi>He that judgeth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth another, and doth the same, or the like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is inexcusable.</hi> By this it appears how much they are mistaken, who under pretence of avoyding Idolatry and superstition, cannot endure that any distinction should be made between things sacred and common. Is not this to <hi>unhallow</hi> Gods Name one way, that so we might not prophane it another? Far be it from me to be a patron of idolatry or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in the least degree: yet I am afraid, lest we who have reformed the worship of God from that pollution (and blessed be his name therefore,) <gap reason="foreign">

Why then should we think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, or rather not think it very likely, that we also may have miscarried in the same manner? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we will arrogate unto our selves that priviledge of infallibility, and freedom from errour, which we condemn as intolerable presumption in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries.</p>
                     <p>Besides, it is to be taken notice of, because of the prejudicate misprision of many to the contrary; That the measure of truth and falshood, best and worst, is not the greater or lesser distance from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, (forasmuch as Popery also containeth much of Christianity) nor that which is most destructive of the man of sin, alwayes most warrantable and safe to be embraced. If it were, there be some in the world, (whose religion we would be loth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

                     <p>Nay, give me leave, without offence, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter awakening of some out of their deafnesse to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else may be said to this purpose, to propound such a Demand as this: Who knoweth, whether this transgression I speak of, be not a main and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ingredient of that guilt, which the Divine Majesty admonisheth us to take notice of, in this his so long and so severe visitatioh of our neighbours and brethren? whether he doth not visibly, or, if some passages be considered, almost vocally, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them; <hi>Thou that hatest Idols doest thou commit Sacriledge?</hi> I know right well, that rashly to assigne the particular causes of Gods judgements, without rule or precedent of Scripture, is a sin of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and a bold intrusion into Gods secrets; and therefore I affirm not, but demand onely, whether there be not here some cause which may minister such a suspicion. But whatsoever it be, the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their wofull affliction calls upon me rather to pray for them, then to follow this harsh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant passage any further.

These impediments being out of the way, the hope of the Resurrection from the dead, and the reward of the life to come, were powerfull inducements to draw many to the worship of that God, who onely among the Gods <note n="*" place="margin">For since then, the Devil hath been Gods Ape.</note> at that time, promised this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to such as worshipped and served him, and no other, which was the bait wherewith the Jews allured them, and that to their own no small emolument; this kinde, as it were to recompence their want of Circumcision, seeming to be very bountifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Nation, as may be gathered both from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who is said <hi>to have given much alms to the people,</hi> (namely of the Jews;) And the Story of that Centurion, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. whom the Jews besought our Saviour so instantly for, alledging that <hi>he loved their Nation, and had built them a Synagogue,</hi> and therefore deserved that favour they sued for, on his behalf.</p>
                     <p>Now, out of this discourse (besides the clearing of the passages afore-mentioned,) we may learn two things: One, how so many of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the preaching of the Apostles, could so soon and so readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be converted to the faith of Christ. It was because they had already embraced the principles which led thereunto. For we are to take notice, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church among the Gentiles, was laid of these <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, who had already embraced the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true God, had knowledge of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, beleeved and hoped for the life to come. For was not S. <hi>Peter</hi> (to whom the instructions for this Embassage were first given) sent first to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Centurion, a Gentile, the first of this order? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101070:38"/>
but that this might be for a pattern for them, with what kinde of men they were first to deal in this great work; namely, with such as were <hi>idonei Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores Euangelii;</hi> those which were <hi>puri puti Gentiles,</hi> being not so; as who knew nothing of the principles requisite thereto. This will appear, if we consider well the tenor of the Apostles Sermons, to such Gentiles as they converted; which we shall observe to presuppose that they already knew the true God, and the promise of eternall life, to such as worshiped him, and so had no more to learn, but the way and means now revealed by God, for attainment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was by the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>The other thing we may learn, is, what was the true state of the Question, which the Apostles met to decide in the Councell at Jerusalem; whether the Gentiles which beleeved in Christ, were to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised or not, and so bound to keep the whole Law? It was this, to resolve (that, whereas all such as embraced the worship of the God of Israel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to one of these two kindes of <hi>Proselytes)</hi> to whether of them the Gentiles, which had or should receive the Gospel of Christ, were to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whether to the <hi>Proselytes of the Covenant,</hi> or to the <gap reason="foreign">

he no Commission to circumcise him: Yea, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, as he was Preaching, fell upon him and his houshold, being uncircumcised, as it did upon those of the Circumcision: whereby it appeared, that God would have the rest of the Gentiles, which embraced the faith, to be after the pattern of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius;</hi> and to have no more imposed upon them, then He had.

                     <p>And thus much for clearing of the words of these two parallel Texts; now what hath been anciently the current opinion of this point? And first, for the Jews, it is apparent to have been a tradition of theirs, that all the space between the earth and the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is full of troops of Evill spirits, and their Chieftains, having their residence in the air; which, I make no doubt S. <hi>Paul</hi> had respect to, when he cals Satan <hi>the Prince of the power of the air. Drusius</hi> quotes two Authors, one the Book called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Munus novum;</hi> another, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators upon <hi>Pirke Aboth,</hi> who speak in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Debet homo scire &amp; intelligere, à terra usque ad firmamentum omnia plena esse turmis, &amp; praefectis, &amp; infra plurimas esse Creaturas laedentes &amp; accusantes, omnesque stare &amp; volare in aere, neque à terra usque ad firmamentum locum esse vacuum: sed omnia plena esse praepositis, quorum alii ad pacem, alii ad bellum, alii ad bonum, alii ad mulam, ad vitam &amp; ad mortem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citant.</hi> By <hi>praepositi,</hi> I suppose, he means such among the Spirits as are set as Wardens over severall char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for the managing of the affairs of mankinde subject to their powers. This was the opinion of the <hi>Iews;</hi> which they seem to have learned by tradition from their ancient Prophets: For in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we finde no such thing written, and yet we see S. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to approve it.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Doctors of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon the sixth of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> tels us,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101070:41"/>
that their opinion was the same; <hi>Tis the opinion of all the Doctors,</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Devils have their mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and residence in the space between the heaven and the earth.</hi> And that the Fathers of the first 300 or 400 years, nor did, nor could, hold the evill Angels to have been cast into Hell upon their sin, is evident by a singular Tenet of theirs. For <hi>Iustn Martyr,</hi> one of the most ancient, hath this saying; that <hi>Satan before the coming of Christ never durst blaspheme God, and that</hi> (saith he) <hi>because till then he knew not he should be damned.</hi> The same is approved by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his fifth Book and twentysixt Chapter; <hi>Praeclarè</hi> (saith he) <hi>dixit Iustinus, quod ante Domini adventum Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas nunquam ausus est blasphemare Deum, quippe non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum sciens suam damnationem; Post adventum autem Domini, ex sermonibus Christi &amp; Apostolorum ejus, discens manifestè quoniam ignis aeternus ei praeparatus sit,—per hujusmodi homines</hi> (he means those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques who blasphemed the God of the Law) <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemat eum Deum, qui judicium importat. Eusebius 4. Hist. Cap.</hi> 17. cites the same out of both, with approbation: So doth <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon the last Chap. of the first of S. <hi>Peter. Epiphanius</hi> against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie 39. gives the same as his own assertion, almost in the same words with <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> though not naming them; <hi>Ante Christi adventum</hi> (saith he) <hi>nunquam ausus est Diabolus in Dominum suum blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum aliquod verbum loqui, aut contra elationem cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare: expectavit enim Christi adventum—put avit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que se misericordiam aliquam assecuturum esse.</hi> I will not enquire how true this Tenet of theirs is, but onely gather this, that they could not think the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101070:41"/>
were cast into Hell, before the comming of Christ. For then how could they but have known they should be damned, if the execution had already been done upon them?</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> as may seem, intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile these places of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> with the rest of Scripture, is alledged to affirm, that the Devils suffering some <hi>hell-like</hi> torment in their aiery Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Air may in that respect in an improper sense be called <hi>Hell.</hi> But that the Devils were <hi>locally</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> in Hell, or should be before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is plain he held not; and that will appear by these two passages in his Book <hi>de Civitate Dei.</hi> First, where he saith, <hi>Daemones in hoc quidem aere ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, quia de Coeli superioris sublimitate dejecti me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito irregressibilis transgressionis in hoc sibi congruo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut carcere, praedamnati sunt.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Divines of later times, the Schoolmen and others, to reconcile the supposed Contrariety in Scripture, divide the matter; holding some Devils to be in the Air, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the History of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture tels us,) some to be already in Hell, (as they thought, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> affirm'd:) which opinion seems to be occasioned by a Quaere of Saint <hi>Hieroms,</hi> upon the sixth of the <hi>Ephesians;</hi> though he speaks but obscurely, and defines nothing. But
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101070:42"/>
what ground of Scripture, or reason can be given, why all the Devils, which sinned, should not be in the same condition? especially <hi>Satan,</hi> the worst and chief of them, should not be in the worst estate, but enjoy the greatest liberty? It follows therefore that these places of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Iude,</hi> are to be construed according to the sense I have given of them; namely, that the evill Spirits, which sinned, being adjudged to hellish torments, were cast out of Heaven into this lower Region, there to be reserved, as in a prison, for chains of darknesse at the Day of Judgement.</p>

                     <p>First; Because they are onely Gods <hi>Ministers</hi> who sends them, but the Peoples <hi>Magistri</hi> to teach, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101070:43"/>
and oversee them: Were it not absurd to call the Shepheard, the sheeps <hi>Minister?</hi> If he be their Minister, they surely are his Masters. And so indeed the People by occasion of this misappellation, think they are ours, and use us accordingly. Indeed we are called <hi>Ministers,</hi> but never <hi>their Ministers,</hi> but as you see here, <hi>Gods Ministers, Christs Ministers,</hi> who imployeth us to dispense his Mysteries unto his Church.</p>
                     <p>There are three words in the New Testament translated <hi>Minister,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the first is most frequent; but not one of them is given to the Apostles, in the whole Scripture, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>People;</hi> you shall never finde them called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is so frequent with us, but <hi>Ministers of God; 2 Cor. 6. 4. 1 Thess. 3. 2. Ministers of Christ,</hi> as in my text, and 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 23. Col. 1. 7. Ministers of Iesus Christ. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 6. or Ministers of that which they minister, as <hi>Ministers of the New Testament, 2 Cor. 3. 6. Ministers of the Gospel, Eph. 3. 7. Col.</hi> 1. 23. but not Ministers of them to whose behoof they minister: Yet might this speech, <hi>Minister of the Church,</hi> if rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, be admitted; namely, if it be spoken by an Ellipsis, for Minister of God, for, and over the Church; so the Apostle <hi>Coloss. 1. 17. A faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ for you:</hi> that is, Christs Minister, not theirs; yet not for Christ, but for them; But those who use this speech commonly mean other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Angels are called <hi>ministring spirits,</hi> but not our Ministers, but Gods Ministers to us-ward, or
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101070:44"/>
for our behalf: So <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> not the Peoples, or Congregations Ministers, but Gods Ministers for their behoof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this speech <hi>[Minister of the Church,</hi> or, <hi>of this or that Church]</hi> is so much the more incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, because it hath begotten (as incommodious and unapt speeches do) an erroneous conceit, not onely among the vulgar, but some of better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; namely, that a Minister is not lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, unlesse he be chosen by the People, because he is <hi>their Minister,</hi> and so to be deputed by them: And indeed if he be their <hi>Minister,</hi> in proper relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are his <hi>Masters,</hi> and so it is good reason they should appoint him, as Masters do those who are to serve them: But if in proper relation they are Gods Ministers, and not theirs, (though for them) then God is to appoint them, or such as he hath put in place to do it. It is an erroneous opinion, that some maintain, That the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Sacred Order,</hi> and of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> is given by God immediately to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Congregation; and that they depute him who is their Minister, to execute the power which is originally in them; That power is conferred by God immediately to those, who are <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> and, by and through them, belongs to the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and no otherwise: <hi>Sed tantum potuit incommodi sermonis usus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some perhaps object against my whole assertion, that of S. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 4. 5. We preach not our selves, but Christ Iesus the Lord,</hi> (to wit, <hi>esse Dominum) and our selves your servants for Iesus sake:</hi> If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were the Churches <hi>servants,</hi> why not their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters?</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:101070:44"/>
I answer, the Apostle sayes not, they were the <hi>Corintbians</hi> servants, but that he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so, in his Preaching to them: So he sayes expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 19. For though I be free from all men, yet I have made my self a servant to all, that I might gain the more:</hi> Yet he confesses the <hi>Corinthians</hi> began to vilifie him for this condescent, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 7. Have I committed an offence in abasing my self, that you might be exalted, because I have preached unto you the Gospel of God freely?</hi> This was that wherein he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self toward the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as a <hi>Servant,</hi> but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches he did not so: It would be a strange assertion, to say the Apostle were the Corinthians <hi>Servant,</hi> in a proper relation; we know he sayes, <hi>Gal. 1. 10. If I pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;</hi> And <hi>Rom. 6. 16. Know ye not, that to whom you yeeld your selves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to a second assertion, which is, that howsoever any Ecclesiasticall person may be rightly called a <hi>Minister,</hi> (so it be in a proper relation to God-ward) yet the word <hi>Minister</hi> is again most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly used by us, for a name of distinction of one Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Order from another: As when we call those which are <hi>Presbyters, Ministers,</hi> by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from <hi>Deacons;</hi> for so we speak <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> in stead of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason we thus speak, is to avoid the name <hi>Priest,</hi> which we conceive to signifie <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> that is, one that sacrificeth, such as were those in the Law. But our Curates of holy things in the Gospel, are not to offer Sacrifice, and therefore ought not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101070:45"/>
                        <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> and consequently, not <hi>Priests.</hi> This is the reason; but if it be well examined, <hi>Priest</hi> is the English of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and not of <hi>Sacerdos;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Tongue no word in use for <hi>Sacerdos: Priest,</hi> which we use for both, being improperly used for a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> but naturally expressing a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> the name whereby the Apostles call both themselves, and those which succeed them in their charge. For who can deny that our word <hi>Priest</hi> is corrupted of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> Our Ancestors the Saxons first used <hi>Preoster,</hi> which by a farther contraction came <hi>Preste,</hi> and <hi>Priest.</hi> The high and low Dutch have <hi>Priester,</hi> the French <hi>Prestre,</hi> Italian <hi>Prete,</hi> but the Spaniard one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaks full <hi>Presbytero.</hi> But, to come more near the point, our men in using the word <hi>Minister,</hi> for a distinctive name in stead of <hi>Priest,</hi> incurre four Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms: I mean when we use the word <hi>Minister</hi> not at large, but for a distinction from the Order of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> saying <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, we run into that we sought to avoid: For we would avoid to call the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by the name of the <hi>Sacrificers</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> and yet run into it in such sort, that we style those of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the legall name, and those of the <hi>Law</hi> by the Euangelicall name; the Hebrew cals them of the Law, <hi>Cohanim,</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which properly signifies to <hi>minister,</hi> and thence comes the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> but we call those of the <hi>Gospel, Cohanim,</hi> when we style them <hi>Ministers.</hi> On the contrary, the Apostles style those of the <hi>Gospel, Presbyteri;</hi> but we transferre that name to those of the <hi>Law,</hi> when we call them <hi>Priests:</hi> This is counterchange;</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:101070:45"/>
                        <hi>Incidit in Scyllam, qui vult vitare Charybdim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a confusion or tautology, to say <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> that is, <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is in Greek, what <hi>Minister</hi> is in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; both signifying a Minister; as if one should say, <hi>Homo</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Dilavium</hi> and <hi>Cataclysmus,</hi> and think so to distinguish things of severall natures or conditions.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We impose upon that Order, a name of a direct co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary notion to what the Apostles gave them: The Apostles gave them a name of <hi>Eldership,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> in calling them <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> we of <hi>inferiority,</hi> &amp; <hi>subordination</hi> in calling them <hi>Ministri:</hi> The Jews had no name more honourable then that of Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, for so they called their Magistrates: so we read of <hi>Elders of the people,</hi> and <hi>Elders of the Priests and Levites,</hi> meaning the chief in both sorts; This honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name the Apostles gave, as a name of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Euangelicall Pastors, whereby they digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them above those of the Law; whose name in the Hebrew (as I said before) is but a denomination of ministery: And we have rejected the name of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of Fathership, and Eldership, and assumed in stead thereof, a name of under-service, of subjection, of ministery, to distinguish our order by; I say to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish our order; For in a generall sense, and with reference to God, we are all his <hi>Ministers,</hi> and it is an honour unto us so to be, more then to be other mens <hi>Masters,</hi> as our Apostle in my text intimates.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in the Churches beyond the Seas, there is a worse Solecism by reason of this misapplied speech. They have a kinde of Officers, who are the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101070:46"/>
Pastors assistants in Discipline, much like to our Churchwardens, these they call <hi>Elders,</hi> we style them <hi>Lay-Elders;</hi> These are but a kinde of <hi>Deacons</hi> at the most, and of a new erection too; And yet these are dignified by the name of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who are indeed but <hi>Deacons</hi> or <hi>Ministers;</hi> and the <hi>Pastor</hi> himself is called a <hi>Minister,</hi> who in the Apostles style is the onely <hi>Presbyter</hi> or <hi>Elder.</hi> For so they speak, <hi>The Minister and his Presbyters, or Elders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, it had been to be wished, that those whom the term of <hi>Priest</hi> displeased, as that which gave occasion by the long abuse thereof, to fancy a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> had rather restored the Apostolicall name of <hi>Presbyter</hi> in the full sound, which would have been as soon, and as easily learned and understood, as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister;</hi> and was no way subject to that supposed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. But the mis-application of the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> in some Churches, to an Order the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles called not by that name, deprived those thereof, to whom it was properly due. Howsoever when they call us <hi>Ministers,</hi> let them account of us <hi>as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ,</hi> and not of men: Not as deputed by the Congregation to execute a power originally in them, but <hi>as Stewards of the mysteries of God.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of greater moment, then perhaps every man thinks of, under what notions things are conceived, and from what property or Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter the names we call them by, are derived. For hereby, not seldom, it comes to passe, That the same things, presented to us under different notions, and names derived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, are not taken to be the same they are. Even as he, that meets a man well known unto him, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick disguise, or antick habit, takes him to be some other, though he knew him never so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For example; a man would wonder that a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> (as we call it) being so remarkable and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall a work of the Divine power, and which draws the eyes of all men with admiration towards it, should no where be found mentioned in the Old Testament: Neither there, where the works of God are so often recounted to magnifie him, (when as <hi>Hail, Snow, Rain,</hi> and <hi>Iee,</hi> works of far lesse admiration are not preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101070:47"/>
neither by way of allusion and figured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, in the Prophets predictions of great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and changes, whereof they were taken to be presages; especially, when we see them borrow so many other allusions, both from heaven and earth, to paint their descriptions with. Should a man therefore think, there never appeared any of them in those times, or to those Countreys? It is incredible: Or that the Jews were so dull and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse as not to observe them? That is not like nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: What should we say then? Surely, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them under some other notions then we do, and accordingly expressed them some other way: As what if by a <hi>Pillar of fire,</hi> such a one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as went before the Israelites in the Wildernesse; or by a <hi>Pillar of fire and smoke?</hi> as in that of <hi>Ioel, I will shew wonders in the heavens, and in the earth, Blood, and Fire, and pillars of Smoke:</hi> Or by the name of an <hi>Angel of the Lord,</hi> (whereby no doubt they are guided) according as is said of that Pillar of Fire which went before the Israelites, That <hi>the Angel of the Lord,</hi> when they were to passe the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea, came and stood between them and the AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when that Pillar did so. And who knows, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in the 104 <hi>Psalm;</hi> may not have some meaning this way? <hi>He ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It comes in, in the Psalm, among other works of God, in a fit place for such a sense; both in regard of what goes before, and follows after. These, I say, or some of these may be descriptious of those we call <hi>Comets;</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:101070:47"/>
which because they are disguised under another no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not denominated from <hi>Stella,</hi> or <hi>Coma,</hi> hence we know them not.</p>
                     <p>Now, to come toward my Text; a like instance to this, I take to be that of the <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> so often mentioned in the Gospel: For I make no question, but that now and then the same befals other men; whereof I have experience my self, to wit, To mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel how these Daemoniacks should so abound in, and about that Nation, which was the people of God; whereas in other Nations, and their writings, we hear of no such; And that too, as it should seem, about the time of our Saviours being on earth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; because in the time before, we finde no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them in Scripture. The wonder is yet the greater, because it seems notwithstanding all this, by the Story of the Gospel, not to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted then by the people of the Jews, any strange or extraordinary thing, but as a matter usuall; nor besides is taken notice of by any forrain Story.</p>
                     <p>To meet with all these difficulties, (which I see not how otherwise can be easily satisfied) I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded (till I shall hear better reason to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,) that these <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> were no other then such as we call <hi>mad-men,</hi> and <hi>Lunaticks;</hi> at least, that we comprehend them under those names, and that therefore they both still are, and in all times and places have been, much more frequent then we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. The cause of which our mistake, is that disguise of another name, and notion, then we conceive them by; which makes us take them to be diverse, which are the same.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:101070:48"/>
That you may rightly understand this my Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (before I acquaint you with the reasons which induce me thereunto) you must know, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Physick tell us of two kindes of <hi>Deliration,</hi> or alienation of the understanding; One, <hi>ex vi mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> that, namely, which is with or from a Fever, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Delirium,</hi> or <hi>Phrenitis</hi> (the latter being a higher degree then the former;) Another kinde <hi>sine Febre,</hi> when a man, having no other disease, is crased and disturbed in his wits.</p>
                     <p>And this, they say, is either simple dotage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from some weaknesse of the brain, or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective faculty; or <hi>Melancholia</hi> and <hi>Mania,</hi> which they describe and distinguish thus: Both of them to be when the understanding is so disturbed, that men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, speak, and do things, which are most absurd, and contrary to all reason, sense, and use of men. But their difference to be in this; that <hi>melancholia</hi> is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with fear, sadnes, silence, retirednesse and the like symptomes: <hi>Mania</hi> with rage, raving, and fury, and actions sutable; which is most properly styled <hi>madnesse.</hi> Now then, I say, that those <hi>Daemoniacks</hi> in the Gospel were such as we call <hi>mad-men:</hi> understand me to mean, not of Deliration <hi>ex vi morbi,</hi> or of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dotage, but of these two last kindes, <hi>Melancholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci</hi> and <hi>Maniaci;</hi> whereunto adde <hi>morbus Comitialis,</hi> or the falling sicknesse, and whatsoever is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lunacy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such as these, I say, the Jews beleeved (and so may we) to be troubled and acted with evill Spirits: as it is said of <hi>Sauls</hi> Melancholy, <hi>That an evil Spirit from the Lord troubled him;</hi> and therefore, passing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101070:48"/>
by all other causes and Symptomes, they thought fit to give them their Name from this, calling them <gap reason="foreign">

An occasion of the more frequent use of which expression, in our Saviours time, and the ages immediately before him, then formerly, had been, or may seem to have been given by the sect of the Sadduces, which, after the time of <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> had much prevailed, and affirmed (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> tels us) <hi>that there was no resurrection, neither Angel, nor Spirit.</hi> To affront, and cry down whose errour, it is like enough the Pharisees, and the rest of the right-beleeving Jews who followed them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, to draw their expressions (wheresoever they could) from <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Spirits:</hi> as presently they did, in the <hi>Acts,</hi> when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> awakened their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Councell, saying <hi>I am a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee, &amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus sufficiently stated, and explicated my assertion, now you shall hear what grounds I have for the same: First therefore, I prove it out of the Gospel it self, and that in the first place from this Scripture, which I have chosen for my text, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>he hath a Devil and is mad.</hi> Where I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the latter words to be an explication of the former.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I prove it out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 15. where it is said, <hi>There came to our Saviour a certain man knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to him, and saying; Lord have mercy on my son,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>because he is Lunatick, and sore vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For oft times he falleth into the Fire, and oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101070:49"/>
the water.</hi> That this <hi>Lunatick</hi> was a <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> it is evident both out of the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> of this Chapter, where it is said, Our Saviour <hi>rebuked the Devill, and he departed out of him, and the childe was cured from that very hour:</hi> As also out of the 9. of the Gospel of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> where it is said of the self-same person, <hi>Lo, a spirit taketh him, and he cryeth out, and it teareth him, that he foameth again, and bruising him, hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from him.</hi> By comparing of these places, you may gather what kinde of men they were, which the Scripture cals <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to other Testimonies: And first, take notice, that the Gentiles also had the like apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>mad-men;</hi> whence they called them <hi>Larva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> and <hi>Cerriti,</hi> where <hi>Larvati</hi> is as much as <hi>Larvis, id est, Daemonibus acti:</hi> so <hi>Festus, Larvati,</hi> saith he, <hi>furiosi &amp; mente moti, quasi Larvis exterriti.</hi> And for <hi>Cerriti,</hi> they were so called, <hi>quasi Cereriti, hoc est, à Cerere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussi.</hi> And therefore you may reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that when <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nechmus</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> fains himself mad, and talks accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, the Physitian, who was sent for to cure him, asks the old man who came to fetch him, whether he were <hi>Larvatus</hi> or <hi>Cerritus.</hi> If the Gentiles thought thus of their mad-men, should we think it strange the Jews should? I could tell you here, that the Turks conceit of their madmen, is not unlike this; but that they suppose the spirit that works in them, to be a good, rather then an evill one. But I let this passe.</p>
                     <p>My next testimony shall be out of <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> who in his second Apology <hi>ad Antoninum,</hi> to prove (at least to a Gentile) that the souls of men have exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence and sense after death, brings for an argument

their <hi>Necyomantia,</hi> and their <hi>Evocationes Mortuorum,</hi> together with other the like: &amp; in the last place this of <hi>Daemoniacks;</hi> where by his descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, we may easily gather what kinde of people they were, which were so taken to be. <hi>Item illi</hi> (saith he) <hi>qui à mortuorum manibus corripiuntur</hi> (for such were these <hi>Daemonia</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be) <hi>at<expan>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a question sometimes moved amongst Divines, and worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving; How, and by what name the place and condition of the damned (which in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called <hi>Gehenna)</hi> was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or expressed in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament before the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and whilst the first Temple stood: For presently after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the afore-mentioned name <hi>Gebenna</hi> began to be frequented; as appears both by the second of <hi>Esdras,</hi> the Chaldee Paraphrast, and other Jewish writings, where that name is often found; as also by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, where our Saviour useth it, as then vulgarly known amongst the Jews. But it is as certain, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Captivity or second Temple (for so the Jews call the time of their state after their return) this name was not in use; both because it is no where to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101070:51"/>
be found in the Canonicall Scriptures of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which were all written within that time; and especially, because the ground and occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was not till about that time in being; which was the pollution of the valley of the sons of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> or <hi>Tophet</hi> by King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and the dreadfull execution of divine vengeance in that Place: Hence it became to posterity to be a name of execration, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to signifie the place of eternall punishment.</p>
                     <p>For this valley of <hi>Hinnom (Gehinnom,</hi> or, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they pronounced it, <hi>Gehenna)</hi> was a valley neer Jerusalem, in a place whereof, called <hi>Tophet,</hi> the children of Israel committed that abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, in making their children to passe through the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> that is, burnt them to the Devil. For an eternall detestation whereof, King <hi>Iosiah</hi> polluted it, and made it a place execrable, ordaining it to be the place, whither dead Carkasses, Garbage, and other unclean things should be cast out: For consuming whereof, to prevent annoyance, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fire was there burning. Yea, not man onely, but the Lord himself, as it were consecrated this place, to be a place of execration, by making it the field of his vengeance, both before and after. For first, this was the place where the Angel of the Lord destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the host of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> where one hundred and eighty thousand of their Carkasses were burnt, according to that, <hi>Esay 30. Through the voyce of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down. For Tophet</hi> (this was a place, I told you, in the valley of <hi>Hinnom) is ordained of old; yea for the King it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101070:51"/>
fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it.</hi> This was also the place, where the Idolatrous Jews were slain, and massacred by the Babylonian armies; when their City was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and their Carkasses left, for want of room for buriall, for meat to the fowles of heaven, and beasts of the field; according to the word of the Lord, by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in his seventh and nineteenth Chapters, <hi>The children of Iudah have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters in the fire, which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. Therefore behold, the dayes come, saith the Lord, that it shall be no more called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter. For they shall bury in Tophet till there be no place. And the carkasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the beasts of the field, and none shall fray them away.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence, as I said, this place being so many wayes execrable for what had been done therein, especially, having been as it were the gate to eternall destruction, by so remarkable judgements, and vengeance of God there executed for sin; it came to be translated to signifie the <hi>place of the damned,</hi> as the most accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, execrable, and abominable place of all places; the <hi>invisible vall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>y of Hinnom.</hi> For such was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Jewish Language, to give Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto things unseen, from such analogicall, and borrowed expressions of things visible. By all which it is apparent, that this notion of that name took its beginning after the Captivity, and was not in use before.</p>

Still therefore we are left to seek, by what other name, and under what notion this <hi>place of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> was expressed, before the word <hi>Gehenna,</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinnom</hi> came to be used. I answer, out of my Text, it seems to have been called <hi>Domus,</hi> or <hi>Coetus Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantum. Vir qui erraverit à viâ intelligentiae, in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu Gigantum commorabitur.</hi> In the Hebrew, <hi>in Coetu Rephaim,</hi> which word properly signifies <hi>Giants,</hi> and to that sense is alwayes rendred by the Seventy, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, though we, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Interpreters, both in this, and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, take it for <hi>manes,</hi> or <hi>mortui;</hi> but the ancient, I think, deserve the more credit, especially it being confessed, that the word elsewhere so signifies. <hi>In Coetu Gigantum</hi> therefore, that is, of those <hi>Giants,</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi> against God, of whom we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. Those mighty men, and men of renown of the old World, whose wickednesse was so great in the earth, that it repented, and grieved God he had made man; and to take vengeance upon whom, he brought the generall Deluge upon the earth, and destroyed man and beast from the face thereof. <hi>Vir qui erraverit à viâ Doctrinae,</hi> The man that wandreth out of the way of understanding, shall go and keep them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; that is, go to that accursed place, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they are in.</p>
                     <p>That this construction of <hi>Coetus Rephaim</hi> is not improbable, may appear, first, by the glosse of <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> upon this Text, in <hi>Coetu Rephaim,</hi> that is, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>in Coetu Gehennae;</hi> This notion therefore is not altogether new.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is strengthened by comparing with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101070:52"/>
it other places of Scripture, where the like expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is used; as twise more in this Book of <hi>Proverbs;</hi> First, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 18. where we read according to the Vulgar, <hi>Domus mulier is alienae inclinata est ad mortem, &amp; ad inferos semitae ejus;</hi> Here for <hi>ad inferos,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, She hath put, or set her paths in <hi>Hades,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> with the <hi>Giants.</hi> Again, <hi>Chap. 9. 18. Aquae furtivae dulciores sunt, &amp; panis absconditus sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior. Et ignoravit,</hi> (namely, he that goes in to a strange woman) <hi>quod ibi sint Gigantes, &amp; in profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Inferni convivae ejus.</hi> Here in some Editions of the Vulgar are added these words: <hi>Qui enim applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur illi, descendet ad inferos, &amp; qui abscesserit ab illâ salvabitur:</hi> an Argument how this place hath been understood; For the meaning of both these places seems to be no other, but, That the strange woman will bring them who frequent her, to <hi>hell,</hi> to keep the Apostate <hi>Giants</hi> company.</p>
                     <p>There is another place in the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> where these <hi>Rephaim</hi> are mentioned, to wit, <hi>Iob</hi> 26. 5. which though of a more ambiguous sense, and scope, yet as it is translated by the vulgar Latin, and well enough to agree with the Hebrew, seems to be no other, but a description of <hi>Hell</hi> with the former; <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes,</hi> saith he, <hi>gemunt sub aquis, &amp; qui habitant cum iis. Nudus est infernus coram illo (id est, Deo) &amp; nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est operimentum perditioni.</hi> The meaning hereof seems to be this.

                        <hi>Infernus,</hi> and the place of Perdition it self, is naked and open to the eyes of God, from whom nothing is hid; which is agreeable to that, <hi>Pro. 15. 11. Hell and destruction are before the Lord, how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</hi> In this place the Jews take the word <hi>Abaddon,</hi> which we render destruction, for <hi>Gehenna;</hi> that is, elliptically, for <hi>Beth Abaddon,</hi> the House of destruction. And why then should not the same word be so taken in that place of <hi>Iob?</hi> and <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est operimentum perditioni,</hi> be as much as, <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est operimentum Loco perditionis,</hi> or <hi>Gehennae?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Compare with these places in the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> two in the Prophets; One in the 14. of <hi>Esay;</hi> where by way of a Poeticall or Propheticall <hi>hypotyposis</hi> of the destruction or fall of Babylon, the King thereof is brought in coming to the <hi>Rephaims,</hi> or <hi>Giants</hi> in the other world. <hi>Hell</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming: it stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up the Rephaims for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: And they shall say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other is the 32 of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> concerning the fall of Egypt, where their slain are bestowed in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in the nethermost parts of the earth, with the <hi>Gibborim;</hi> which signifies not onely mighty men, but <hi>Giants,</hi> and so is rendred in this place by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty: And thus much from comparison of places of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>A third Argument to make this notion probable, which I have represented, is this; Because all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions almost in Scripture, whereby this place of eternall punishment is represented, relate and allude
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101070:53"/>
to some places or Stories remarkable for Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary vengeance executed upon sinners. As that of <hi>Gehenna</hi> to the notorious Judgements of God in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> for Idolatry, and Blasphemy. That of the <hi>Lake of fire and brimstone,</hi> so often mentioned in the Apocalypse, to the Lake <hi>Asphalti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the lasting monument of those showers of fire and brimstone from heaven, wherewith <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> with the rest of the Cities of the plain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for their abominable lusts. Our Saviours expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in his sentence of condemnation, <hi>(Go ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devill and his Angels)</hi> seems to relate to the punishment of the <hi>Apostate Angels,</hi> who for their rebellion were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto chains of darknesse against that great Day.</p>
                     <p>And was not the destruction of the old world, by the generall <hi>Deluge of water,</hi> as famous as any of these? Yea, not to be paralleld by any, but that second <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of fire,</hi> at the last Judgement? How improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it then, that this should not lend a denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the place or state of eternall punishment, as well as the rest?</p>
                     <p>Nay, which is more, <hi>S. Peter</hi> in his second Epistle, and second Chapter recites these last three together, as if they had been intended, as patterns of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Judgement and punishment of sinfull men. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>if God spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to Hell, and delivered them to chains of darknesse, to be reserved unto judgement. 5. And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a Preacher of righteousnesse, bringing in the Flood upon the world of the ungodly,</hi> (that is, of the <hi>Rephaim,</hi>

for so the Seventy sometimes turn it.) 6. <hi>And turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them with an overthrow, making them an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample,</hi> or pattern (mark it well, <gap reason="foreign">

That the ancient Jews so understood it, appears by all the three Targums, or Chaldee Paraphrasts. The Targum, called of Jerusalem, renders expresly: Untill the time when <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>King Messiah</hi> shall come: <hi>Ionathan: parvulus filiorum ejus,</hi> that is, of <hi>Iudahs</hi> sons, which one of the late Rabbies (saith <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf.)</hi> expounds, <hi>Rex Messiah, qui venit ex David, qui fuit minimus inter filios Isai Patris sui: Onkelos;</hi> Untill <hi>Messiah</hi> come, whose is the Kingdom. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in their Thalmud, <hi>Shiloh</hi> is reckoned among the names of <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we and the Ancient Jews agree, about the aim and purport of this Scripture. But we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans beleeve further, that it is long since fulfilled: Howsoever for the very point of time, when this Scepter departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> we vary in our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some will have it to have been, when <hi>Pompey</hi> first brought the Jewish State under the Roman sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. Others a little after: when <hi>Herod,</hi> an Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean stranger, yet formerly incorporated into the Jewish State and blood, was by the Romans inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to be their King, and the Hasmonaean, or Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabaean race (which till then had born the chief rule) by him extinguished. Others, not till the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and finall dissolution of the Jewish State by <hi>Titus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are principall moments of time, to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon: But against the first, the subjecting of the Jewish State to the Romans, is objected; First, that it anticipates the time of Christs birth too much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sixty years before it. Secondly, that it might as well be affirmed, that the Scepter departed from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:101070:56"/>
when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> carried them captive to <hi>Babylon;</hi> or when they were subject to the Persian or Greek Monarchies, as when they were made subject to the Romans.</p>
                     <p>Against the second, of <hi>Herod,</hi> lies the same excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that did against the former; that it was too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being thirty years and more, before the birth of Christ; and more then twice as much, before his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and ascension, at what time he began his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Secondly, that under the reign of <hi>Herod,</hi> the Scepter of <hi>Iudah</hi> might seem rather to be advanced then departed; for as much as they had then a King of their own, reigning over them; and though not of Jewish originall, yet a Proselyte, and so one of their own body. And, if the Scepter were departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> because one not of their own Tribe had the soveraign rule over them; why was it not depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the time, the Hasmonaean or Maccabaean fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who were Levites, reigned? No man would say, that the Scepter were departed from Poland, though the Polanders should chuse a Swede, a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a Frenchman, for their King. So neither from <hi>Iudah,</hi> though a Levite, or Idumaean Proselyte were their Prince.</p>
                     <p>Against the last point of time, the dissolution of the Jewish State by <hi>Titus,</hi> is excepted, that it is as much too long after, either the Nativity or the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ, as the other two were before it; to wit, seventy years after the one, and near forty after the other.</p>
                     <p>I mean not to enlarge my self any further, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting you with each particular passage, agitated
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101070:56"/>
concerning these differing opinions, or alledged in the disputing of them: I have selected onely so much, as I thought requisite for the understanding of what I aim at, which is to shew you such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of these words, with but a little alteration of the common translating; as being admitted, will leave no more place for those difficulties, wherewith this question is entangled.</p>
                     <p>For the handling whereof, I will divide the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my discourse into these two parts: First, I will unfold the words of my Text, which seem to have any difficulty or obscurity in them: Secondly, I will apply them to the time, wherein they were fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>For the first; I begin with the word <hi>Scepter,</hi> which is not to be restrained to <hi>Kingly Dominion</hi> onely, but signifies any <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>Majesty of Government,</hi> under what form or name soever; whereof a <hi>rod,</hi> or <hi>staffe,</hi> was anciently the ensigne, whence every Tribe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (by the word here used) as being united together under one <hi>staffe,</hi> or power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The meaning therefore is not, that <hi>Iudah</hi> should never cease from having a <hi>King,</hi> or being a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> but that it should not cease from being a <hi>State,</hi> a body Politick, or Common-wealth, having a <hi>power of Government,</hi> and Jurisdiction within it self, untill <hi>Messiah</hi> came: wherefore the Septuagint here for <hi>Sceptrum,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, translate <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, say they, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Iudah</hi> was so far from being a continued <hi>Kingdom,</hi> untill <hi>Messiah</hi> should come, that there was no <hi>Kingly Royalty</hi> in that Tribe, for more then two
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101070:57"/>
third parts of that time, namely, not till <hi>David,</hi> nor after <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> saving that of the Maccabees, (who were Levites) and of <hi>Herod,</hi> (by originall an Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite) which both put together, will not make four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years; yet were they never without some <hi>Ruler,</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi> of their own, at that time.</p>
                     <p>The next word I consider, is <hi>Law giver,</hi> which will not be hard to understand, if we mark well, what is implied by <hi>Scepter;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the word here trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Law giver,</hi> signifies not onely a maker of Laws, but <hi>qui jus dicit,</hi> he that exerciseth Jurisdiction; and so differs not much from the former, if they be not altogether Synonyma.</p>
                     <p>As for the phrase, <hi>from between his feet,</hi> it means nothing else, but <hi>of his posterity;</hi> For so the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture modestly expresseth the place of generation; as it doth also by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Femur,</hi> or <hi>Crus.</hi> For where we reade in the 26. of this Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and again in the first of <hi>Exodus; All the souls that came out of the loins of Iacob, were seventy souls:</hi> in the Hebrew it is, all the souls that came out of his <hi>thigh:</hi> whence, by the way, you may observe the occasion of that Fable, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Dionysius</hi> was born <hi>ex femore Iovis;</hi> which according to the Orientall expression, (whence that whole story of <hi>Bacchus</hi> came) implied no more, then that he was <hi>Iupiters</hi> son; but the Greeks, not understanding the meaning, converted it unto that Fable, which you all know.</p>
                     <p>Now for the word <hi>Shiloh,</hi> if we derive it, as I think we should, it will signifie a <hi>Peace-maker,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> of the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifies <hi>Tranquillus,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101070:57"/>
Pacificus,</hi> or <hi>Salvus fuit.</hi> And if the Masorites had so pleas'd, they might have pointed it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which was the name of the eldest son of <hi>Iudah</hi> that survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and in the Hebrew Etymology, can signifie nothing else, but <hi>Peaceable,</hi> or <hi>Peace-maker.</hi> And whether the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> or the Holy Ghost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him, might not chuse this name, before any other, to designe <hi>Messiah</hi> in this Prophecy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the allusion it had to one of <hi>Iudahs</hi> sons, I will not affirm; but leave to your better considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others, following the Jewish Rabbies, go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about, to bring the word <hi>Shiloh,</hi> to signifie <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius ejus,</hi> that is, <hi>Iudahs;</hi> construing the Prophesie thus: <hi>The scepter shall not depart from Iudah, till his son</hi> (namely, <hi>Messiah) come:</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> they will have put for the affix <hi>Vau,</hi> as sometimes it is elsewhere <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Secundina,</hi> (that wherein the infant is wrapped in the womb) and so by a Metonymie to signifie here, the Childe it self. In a word, they will have <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, <hi>Secundina ejus;</hi> and that to mean <hi>Filius ejus.</hi> But this, me thinks, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too ambagious, and therefore lesse probable; but let every one follow his own judgement.</p>
                     <p>And now I am come to the Application, to shew at what point of time this prediction was fulfilled: To make the way plain whereunto, I must first alter a little the construction of the remaining words; namely, <hi>And unto him shall the gathering of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or the <hi>Nations, be.</hi> For here the word, <hi>shall be,</hi> or <hi>shall,</hi> is not in the Hebrew, but added in translating, and so may be left out; the words in the originall being onely, <hi>Et ei aggregatio,</hi> or <hi>obedientia populo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:101070:58"/>
I construe therefore the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Vntill,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as common to this with the former sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; namely, thus: <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from Iudah, &amp;c. untill Shiloh come, and the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people be to him:</hi> (that is) Untill Messiah come, and the People or Nations be gathered unto him, the Scepter shall not depart: Where note, that two things are specified to come to passe, before the Scepter departs from <hi>Iudah,</hi> or <hi>Iudah</hi> ceases from being a Common-wealth: First, the comming of Christ, or Shiloh into the world: Secondly, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the Nations, or Gentiles unto him. For I construe the word <hi>Vntill,</hi> as I told you, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both sentences, <hi>Vntill Shiloh come, and untill the Nations be gathered unto him.</hi>

                     <p>And now, me thinks, your thoughts might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most prevent me, in designing the time when this prediction was fulfilled: namely, neither when the Jews came first under the <hi>Roman</hi> subjection, for then <hi>Shiloh</hi> was not yet come: nor under <hi>Herod,</hi> or as some will seven years after him, when his son <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> being banished, Judaea was reduced into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: For though Christ was then born, to wit, in the end of <hi>Herods</hi> reign, yet were not the Nations or Gentiles yet gathered unto him: But at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Jewish State by <hi>Titus,</hi> when both these things were come to passe, Christ being come, and the Gentiles converted unto his obedience, then did the <hi>Scepter</hi> depart from Judah, and they cease from being any more a Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>That this is the true application of this prediction, besides the evidence of the event, appears by our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101070:58"/>
Saviours Prophesie of this destruction of the Jewish State, in the Gospel of S. <hi>Mat;</hi> where, after he had named some other things to precede it, he addes this for the last signe; <hi>And this Gospel of the Kingdom,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be preached in all the world for a witnesse unto all Nations, and then shall the end come:</hi> that is, the end of the Jewish State; when the Gentiles, by the preaching of the Apostles, should be gathered unto Christ, then should the Jewish Church and Common-wealth be utterly dissolved; which till then had continued united under some Polity, and form of Government from its first beginning; For so it pleased the wisdom of Almighty God, when he would reject the <hi>Iews,</hi> not to dissolve their State, till he had erected him a new among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

What is man, that thou art mindefull of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? 5. For thou hast made him little lower then the Angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 6. Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thine hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.</hi> Again, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 23. Christ,</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall deliver up the Kingdom to God the Father, when he shall have put down all rule, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power. 25 For he must raign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 26. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 27. For he hath put all things under his feet.</hi> This is the quotation; for it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101070:59"/>
follows presently; <hi>When he saith all things are put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How principall a part of the Argument of this Psalm, what is in these two places cited by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> contains, every man may see, that reades and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them. But how it should be consonant to the meaning of the Psalm, seems somewhat difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. For he that reades the whole Psalm, would think it were nothing else, but a description of <hi>mans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; whom God had made next to the Angels in dignity, &amp; given him dominion over all things he hath made. For so after those words, <hi>Thou hast put all things under his feet;</hi> it follows immediately, <hi>All sheep and Oxen, yea and beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the Sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the Sea.</hi> But what is the dominion over these, to subduing of enemies, which the Apostle cites it for? or how is that, which is a description of <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde</hi> in generall, a Prophecy of <hi>Christ</hi> in speciall?</p>
                     <p>Some therefore, as in other citations of the Old Testament, so here also, betake themselves to the covert of an Allusion; namely, that the Apostle onely borrows the words of the Psalmist, to expresse his own, and not the Psalmists mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But, howsoever this may have place in some other allegations of the Old Testament, which are for Illustration or Exornation onely; yet when the testimony is brought for proof and demonstration, as this is, it can in no wise be admitted. For how can that testimony be of force to conclude any thing, where not the Authors meaning is brought, but his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101070:60"/>
words onely made use of? Others therefore say, that whatsoever is spoken of the Dignity and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>Man</hi> in generall, is to be understood by way of eminency of <hi>Christ,</hi> the chief of the sons of men. This indeed is something, but not enough. For what is the dignity of man, in regard of his Dominion and Lordship over the creature, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and subduing of enemies? which is that the Apostle seeks to demonstrate thence.</p>
                     <p>Well, to hold you no longer in suspence, the key of the interpretation of this Psalm, and the ground of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> accommodation of that passage <hi>(Thou hast put all things under his feet)</hi> to Christs victory, is to be sought in the words I have now chosen; <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings, &amp;c.</hi> which being first alledged by our Saviour in the Gospel, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that acclamation given unto him by his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, <hi>Hosanna,</hi> (that is, Save now) <hi>to the son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> (which the Pharisees thought too high an attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, to be deferred to flesh and blood) this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof by Christ to himself, gave the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle good warrant, to interpret the Psalm as he did, and to ground a Demonstration thereon.</p>
                     <p>I shall therefore divide my discourse into two parts; First, I will shew the meaning of the words as they stand in the Psalm: And secondly, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that our Saviour in the Gospel cites them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that meaning.</p>
                     <p>The whole drift therefore of the Psalm, is to praise and glorifie God for the dignity wherewith he hath invested <hi>Man: What is man</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thou art mindefull of him, or the son of man that thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitest
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101070:60"/>
him? For thou hast made him little lower then the Angels, and hast crowned him with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> This <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> is exemplified in two particulars: First, that God hath ordained man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that weak and feeble creature, <hi>Man,</hi> to subdue and conquer his enemies; which is that my Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth in the words before named; <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings, thou hast ordained strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest quell the Enemie, and the Avenger.</hi> Secondly, that he hath made man the Lord of all his Creatures: <hi>Thou hast made him,</hi> saith he) <hi>to have dominion over the works of thine hands:</hi> then follows, as it were the summing up of both in a word: <hi>Thou hast put all things under his feet.</hi> For having ordained him, both the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion to conquer thine enemies, and made him at his Creation the Lord and Ruler of the works of thine hands, <hi>Quid reliquum est?</hi> what honour couldst thou have given him, which thou hast not? <hi>Lord!</hi> (therefore) <hi>what is man, that thou art mindefull of him, or the son of man that thou visitest him?</hi> Where is to be observed, that the Corollarie, <hi>Thou hast put all things under his feet,</hi> comes in before his time, namely, before the description of this exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mans dominion over the creature, was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended: as if the Prophet, out of admiration, could hold no longer from telling us the summe of that Dignity, wherewith man was invested. <hi>Thou hast made him</hi> (saith he) <hi>to have Dominion over the works of thine hands,</hi> and so one way or other, <hi>Thou hast put all things under his feet.</hi> Then follows the other part of the Description, <hi>All Sheep and Oxen,</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:101070:61"/>
over these thou hast made him have Dominion, <hi>The Beasts of the field, the Fowles of the air, and the Fish of the Sea:</hi> whereas in direct order it should have stood thus; <hi>Thou hast made him have Dominion over the works of thine hands, over all Sheep and Oxen, the Beasts of the Field, and Fowles of the Air, and Fish of the Sea;</hi> And so in the upshot; <hi>Thou hast put all things under his feet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this last particular of mans dignity, to have Dominion over the Creatures, is so plainly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently intended in the Psalm, that I shall need speak no more of it: I return therefore to the former, to make it clear also. That God ordained man, not onely to exercise Dominion over the visible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but to be the Champion to conquer and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his Enemies; which is the drift of the words I have chosen for my text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings</hi> (saith he) that is, of mankinde, who springs from so weak and poor a beginning, as of Babes and sucklings; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, out of the mouth of babes, not in <hi>sensu composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> but <hi>diviso:</hi> Of such whose condition is to be babes and sucklings; not that they should exercise this strength he speaks of, <hi>To quell the enemy and the Avenger,</hi> while they were babes; but that this power should be given to those, whose condition was to be such. And this is marvellous enough, that God should advance so weak a creature, and of so despicable a beginning, to such a power, as to grapple with the Enemy, and overcome him. But behold, there is yet something more admirable, namely, that this should not be done by the strength
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101070:61"/>
of his <hi>Arm,</hi> but by the breath &amp; power of his <hi>Mouth.

Besides, who are the <hi>Enemies</hi> both of God and mankinde but these? And of mankinde especially; <hi>I put enmity,</hi> saith God to the serpent, <hi>between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed:</hi> Hence he is called <hi>Satan,</hi> the adversary, or Fiend, and <hi>the enemy</hi>

                     <p>Having thus cleered the words I chose for my Theme, I shall not spend much time to shew you, how directly and literally, the purport of them was fulfilled in our blessed Saviours incarnation: You have, in part, heard such Scriptures already, as do evince it. The summe is this: The Devill, by sin, brought mankinde under thraldom, and became the prince of this world, himself, with his Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worshipped and served every where, as Gods; and the service and honour due to the great God, the Creator of heaven and earth, cast off, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; and all this to receive at last, for reward, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wo and everlasting death. To vanquish and exterminate this enemy, and redeem the world from this miserable thraldom, the Son of God took upon him, not the nature of Angels, (which might have been the enemies matches) but the nature of weak and despicable man, that growes from a babe and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101070:62"/>
suckling: <hi>Who</hi> (saith <hi>Esay,</hi> in that famous Prophecy of Messiah) <hi>hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> (namely, that works such powerfull things by weak means:) <hi>for he shall grow</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) <hi>and as a root out of a dry ground;</hi> that is, a small and little one.</p>
                     <p>This is that whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> discourses so divinely, in the Epistle to the Hebrews: <hi>To which of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels said he at anytime, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? For unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak:</hi> but unto him, of whom it is said, <hi>What is man that thou art mindefull of him, or, &amp;c.</hi> Again, <hi>We see Iesus, who was made little lower then the Angels,</hi> (that is, was made man; that's the meaning) <hi>for the suffering of death, crowned with Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi> what can be so plain as this? It is the Son of man, by whom in part we are, and more fully shall be, delivered <hi>out of the hands of our enemies,</hi> that we might <hi>serve</hi> the true God <hi>without fear;</hi> as <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> sayes in his <hi>Benedictus.</hi> It is the Son of man that delivered us <hi>from the power of darknesse, Col.</hi> 1. 13. The Son of man, that <hi>spoiled Principalities and Powers, and made a shew of them openly, Col.</hi> 2. 15. It was no Angel, that did all this; but the Son of man; even as was prophesied from the beginning, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill first got his Dominion; <hi>That the Seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should break the Serpents head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is this all; for this Son of man enables also other sons of men his Disciples and Ministers to do
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101070:63"/>
the like in his name: The seventy Disciples, in the Gospel, return with joy, saying, <hi>Lord, even the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are subject to us through thy name:</hi> Yea, not these onely, but as many as fight under his Banner against these enemies, have promise they shall at length quell and utterly subdue them: Yea, at that great Day shall sit with their Lord and Master, to judge and condemn them. <hi>Do ye not know,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, that the Saints shall judge the world? know ye not that we shall judge Angels?</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, this victory, as for the event, so for the manner of atchieving it, is agreeable to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.

                     <p>I come now to the second thing I propounded; namely, to shew, that our Saviour in the Gospel,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101070:63"/>
when he cited this place, alledged it for, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, and no other meaning. The Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list relates it thus; When the chief Priests and Scribes saw the wonderfull things that Jesus did, and those in the Temple crying, and saying, <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na to the son of David,</hi> they were sore displeased; and said unto him, <hi>Hearest thou what these say?</hi> how they ascribe the power of salvation, (which is Gods peculiar) to thee, who art a son of man? Is that solemn acclamation of <hi>Save now,</hi> wherewith we are wont to glorifie God, fit to be given to thee? Our Saviour answers, Yes; <hi>for have ye not read,</hi> (saith he) <hi>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, thou hast ordained strength?</hi> Consider what that means. You will wonder perhaps, that a thing so plain, could be taken in a differing meaning. For, it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed to be alledged, onely to prove that children should glorifie Christ, whilest the great ones of the world despised him: And there are two things which have occasioned this mistake, and drawn the sense awry; The first is, because the Septuagint, (according to which the Euangelist reads this place) in stead of strength, translate here <gap reason="foreign">

Again, the Pharisees found no fault with the speakers, but with the thing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; which they thought too much for a man; and therefore our Saviour, when he alledged this Scripture, answered to that, and intended not to Apologise for the speakers.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is hard to keep a mean; which, as appears in many things else, so, in the Doctrine and speculation of Angels, whereunto men were heretofore so much addicted, as they pursued it, not onely to vain and ungrounded Theories, but even to Idolatry and superstition. There were in the Apostles times, who <hi>intruded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things they had not seen:</hi> there were then, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled men with <hi>a voluntary humility in worshipping of Angels, Col.</hi> 2. what after times brought forth, I shall not need speak. That ancient, and high soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though counterfeit) <hi>Dionysius,</hi> describes the Hierarchy of Angels, as exactly as if he had dwelt amongst them, delivering unto us nine Orders of them, out of nine words, found partly in the Old, partly in the New Testament; <hi>Seraphims, Cherubims,</hi> and <hi>Thrones, Powers, Hosts,</hi> and <hi>Dominions; Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Arch-angels,</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> and tels us the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall natures, distinctions, and properties of them all:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101070:65"/>
Whereas it cannot be shewn out of Scripture, either that some of these names concurre not, (as Angels, not to be a common name to all the rest, especially to comprehend Arch-angels) or that these are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations of the natures of Angels, and not of their offices and charges onely; yet have these nine Orders passed for currant through so many ages of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But we, who (together with divers superstitions) have justly rejected also these vain and ungrounded curiosities, are faln into the other extream; having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Doctrine of Angels in silence, making little or no enquiry at all, what God in his Word hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed concerning them: which yet would make not a little for the understanding of Scripture, wherein are so many passages having reference to them, and therefore questionlesse something revealed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>I shall not therefore do amisse, if I choose for my discourse at this time, a particular of that kinde, which <hi>Dionysius</hi> in all his speculations hath not a word of; and yet seems to have strong footing in Scripture: It is this:</p>
                     <p>The Jews have an ancient tradition, that there are <hi>seven</hi> principall Angels, which minister before the Throne of God, and therefore called Arch-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; Some of whose names we have in Scripture, as <hi>Michael, Gabriel, Raphael,</hi> and in the second Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi> mention is made of <hi>Ierechmiel</hi> the Arch-Angel. This Tradition we shall finde recorded in the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> (whose antiquity is before the birth of our Saviour:) For there the Angel, who in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101070:66"/>
the shape of <hi>Azariah</hi> had accompanied his son into <hi>Media,</hi> when he discovers himself, speaks in this manner; <hi>I am Raphael, one of the seven Angels, which stand and minister before the glory of the holy One.</hi> The <note place="margin">Vide Cyp. adv. Iud. li. 1. 20. H lar. in <hi>Psal.</hi> 129. vel. 130.</note> Greek hath, <hi>which present the Prayers of the Saints, and go in and out, before the holy One.</hi> But neither Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> who translated it out of the Chaldee, nor the ancient Hebrew Copie set forth by <hi>Paulus Fagius,</hi> (and in likelihood translated out of the same Chaldee Originall) hath any such matter; but reads as I first quoted. And therefore it seemes to be an addition, or liberty of the Greek Translator, who thought their Ministery to consist in presenting the Prayers of the Saints, and so translated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                     <p>This tradition is farther testified by <hi>Ionathan ben Vziel,</hi> the Chaldee Paraphrast, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 7. where the Lords words, spoken in the plurall number, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, descendamus, &amp; confundamus linguam eorum,</hi> are paraphrased in this manner. <hi>Dixit Dominus sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Angelis, qui stant coram eo, Venite nunc, &amp;c.</hi> Whether rightly or fitly in this place, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not: The testimony is sufficient for the Jewish tradition of seven Arch-angels, that stand before the Throne of God.</p>
                     <p>This tradition <hi>Iunius</hi> saith is magicall; and not a little triumphs therein, as an undoubted Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to evince the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> not to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: But whatsoever the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> be, I hope to shew this tradition to have firm ground, and footing in Scripture, and not so rashly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>

The chief and most clear place is that I have now read; which gives us to understand, that these <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Angels</hi> were represented by that Candlestick of Seven Lamps, which continually burned, in the Temple, before the vail, over against the Mercy seat; which was the Throne of God. For in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chapter, the Prophet being shewed this Seven-lamped Candlestick in a Vision, and two Olive-branches on each side, ministring oyle to the Lamps thereof: The Angel asketh him, if he knew what these meant: The Prophet answers; <hi>No, my Lord;</hi> Then the Angel, discoursing a little by way of Preface, tels him what they were: <hi>These seven,</hi> saith he, (that is, the seven Lamps) <hi>are the seven eyes</hi>

                        <hi>of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth:</hi> that is, those Seven <hi>Vigiles,</hi> or prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of his Providence, the seven Arch-angels, As for the two Olive-trees on each side; <hi>These are,</hi> saith he, <hi>two anointed ones, which stand before the Lord of the whole earth;</hi> that is, <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua;</hi> the Prince and Priest, at that time; which should be Gods two instruments on earth, whereby his Church (signified by the Candlestick) should be re-established, and his Temple builded; and that <hi>not by force, or strength,</hi> as he saith in his Preface, <hi>but by the Spirit of God,</hi> working with them; as the olive trees here conveyed oyle to the Candlestick, not after a naturall and usuall, but a supernaturall and secret manner. This interpretation of the latter, hath the suffrage of the best Expositors, both Jews and Christians; and so I shall need say no more of it: but betake my self to make good the first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101070:67"/>
the words I chose for my Text, That those seven eyes of God, signified by the seven Lamps, are seven Angels.</p>
                     <p>That this is so, I prove out of two places in the Apocalypse, derived from hence; where as well the Seven Lamps before the Throne, as the Lambs Seven eyes are said to be the Seven Spirits of God: <hi>I saw</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> cap. 4. 5.) <hi>Seven Lamps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne, which are the Seven Spirits of God.</hi> And again, <hi>cap. 5. 6. I saw in the midst of the Throne, and of the four Beasts,</hi> (as we translate it) <hi>and of the four and twenty Elders, a Lamb, as if he had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</hi> Here first, we have <hi>Zacharies</hi> very words, <hi>Seven eyes sent forth into all the earth:</hi> Secondly, That these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eyes are the seven Spirits of God: Thirdly, that these seven Spirits were represented by the seven Lamps burning before the Throne. If this be not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make my interpretation of <hi>Zacharie</hi> good, I know not what can be. For who can now but think, that the Jews derived their tradition of these seven Angels, from this place of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse from them both?</p>
                     <p>And that indeed the Jews supposed some such thing meant by the seven Lamps in the Temple, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the report of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> though depraved and fashioned unto the capacity of the Gentiles: For he tels us (both in his Antiquities, <hi>Lib. 3. cap.</hi> 7. and in his <hi>De Bello Iudaico Lib. 6. cap.</hi> 14.) that the seven Lamps signified the seven Planets, and the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place within the vail, <hi>(ibid. cap.</hi> 5.) the heaven of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101070:67"/>
God, or heaven of Glory; and that therefore the Lamps stood slopewise, as it were to expresse the obliquity of the Zodiack: Now it is true, that the Jewish Astrologians, savouring of Gentilism, make these seven Angels the prefects of the seven Planets, which they seem to have learned in part from the Greek Philosophy; which conceit, howsoever it be vain and groundlesse, yet may be as a key to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning of this of <hi>Iosephus.</hi> And one thing more; If the visible things of God may be learned, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, from the Creation of the world; why may not the invisible and intelligible world be learned from the Fabrick of the visible? the one (it may be) being the pattern of the other. But to let this passe, and return again to the Apocalypse.</p>
                     <p>Where concerning the places alledged, there may be two things objected: First, That the <hi>seven spirits</hi> there mentioned, are and may be expounded of the Holy Ghost, thus represented in respect of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-fold, (that is, manifold) Graces he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates unto the Church: I answer, that many indeed have so taken it; but, besides the uncouthnesse of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing one spirit by seven, there is a reason in the Text why they cannot be so taken; namely, because not onely the seven Lamps are said to be those seven Spirits of God; but the seven Eyes, and seven Horns of the Lamb also, to be the same: Now it will be very hard and harsh to make the Holy Ghost, the Horns and Eyes of Christ, as he is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world; that is, as he is a Man: Above Angels indeed the Man <hi>Iesus</hi> is exalted, and that too for the suffering
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101070:68"/>
of death, that is, as the Lamb: but not above the Holy Ghost. This made not onely <hi>Drusius,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Beza</hi> himself, in his Notes upon this place, to affirm, it could not be meant of the Holy Ghost, but of seven created Spirits.</p>
                     <p>A second scruple is, how (if they be created spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) <hi>Iohn</hi> could pray for Grace, and Peace from them? <hi>Grace be unto you,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and peace, from him which is, which was, and is to come, and from the seven spirits, which are before his Throne, and from Iesus Christ the faithful witnesse, &amp;c.</hi> would he pray for Grace, and peace from Angels? I answer, Why not? For first, he prayes not to them, but unto God, unto whom such votes are tendered: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he prayes for Grace and Peace from them, not as Authors, but as the Instruments of God, in the dispensation thereof: <hi>Are they not</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>sent forth to minister for them, who are heirs of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> And if it be no Idolatry to pray unto God, to give Grace and Peace from the outward Ministery of his word; no more is it to pray unto him for it, from the invisible Ministery. For certainly, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pray unto God for a blessing from an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he is wont to give us by an instrument. Secondly, it may be said, that the words, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> need not to be taken in that speciall and strict sense; but in the large and generall, wherein Grace sounds favour at large, and Peace all manner of prosperity. In which sense, no man will deny, but the blessed Angels have an interest in the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the favours and blessings of God to his Church: and so God may be prayed to, to give
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101070:68"/>
them, as he is wont, by their ministery. <hi>Grace and Peace from him which is, which was, and is to come,</hi> as the Author and Giver; <hi>and from the seven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> as the Instruments; <hi>and from Iesus Christ,</hi> as the Mediator. There is yet one place more in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> to confirm this tradition, <hi>chap. 8. 2. I saw,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>The seven Angels which stood before God.</hi> Is not this as plain as <hi>Tobit?</hi> Why should then the one be accounted Magicall, and not the other?</p>
                     <p>I adde moreover, that these Angels are those <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>And it may, not without reason, be conjectured, that those seven chief Princes fained in the Persian Monarchie, took their beginning from hence; And that <hi>Daniel</hi> (who in respect of his account for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of his power under <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede, had a main stroke in the moulding and framing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that State) caused the Persian Court to resemble that of heaven; ordaining seven chief Princes, to stand before the King. Of which we finde twice mention in Scripture, as in the book of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101070:69"/>
                        <hi>Esther,</hi> where they are recorded by name, and styled, <hi>The seven Princes of Media and Persia, who saw the Kings face, and sate first in the kingdom:</hi> And in the Commission granted to <hi>Ezra</hi> by <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> 7. 14. they are called, <hi>The Kings seven Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors: Forasmuch as thou art sent by the King, and his seven Counsellors, &amp;c.</hi> And it may be, the Church of Jerusalem, when they chose seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to minister unto their Bishop, had an eye the same way.</p>

S. <hi>Iohns</hi> saluting the Churches with a Benediction of Grace and Peace from their ministery; and the typing of them by the seven Eyes and Horns of the Lamb; as Powers, which the Father, since he exalted Him to be Head of his Church, hath annexed to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: Hence it comes to passe, that we finde these Angels peculiarly, both before, and in the Gospel, to have been employed about the Church affairs: In the Old Testament, the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> (one of the seven) revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> the time of the restauration of the Jewish State, and comming of <hi>Messiah:</hi> And the Angel <hi>Michael</hi> (one of the chief Princes) was his assistant, when he strengthened <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede; who founded the Monarchy which should restore them, and is in speciall termed <hi>(Dan.</hi> 12.) the Prince that stood for <hi>Daniels</hi> people. In the Gospel, we finde the same Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed both to <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> with the Euangelicall Tidings; and that <hi>Zachary</hi> might take notice that he was one of the seven, he sayes unto him, <hi>I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God.</hi> Likewise in the Churches combate with the Dragon, <hi>Apoc. 12. Michael</hi> and his Angels are said to be her Champions, and in her quarrel, to have cast the Dragon and his Angels down to the Earth: And in this Prophesie of <hi>Zachary,</hi> it is said, that these seven eyes of the Lord took care of one stone, which <hi>Zorobabel</hi> laid for the foundation of the Temple, and therefore the work could not be disappointed, but should certainly at length be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.

And now again at his last Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when he came to give his soul a sacrifice for sin. This is that, which Saint <hi>Mark</hi> relates in this place, as do also two other of the Euangelists, Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> The vindication of Gods House from Prophanation (how little account soever we are wont to make thereof) was with our blessed Saviour the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the first and last of his care; <hi>Vbi incipit, ibi desinit.</hi> The consideration of which,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101070:71"/>
how momentous it is, I leave to your selves to judge: Thus much by way of Preface.</p>
                     <p>Now for understanding of the words I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, I will divide my discourse into a Question, and an Observation. The Question is; In what part of the Temple this Market was kept? A thing not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly enquired after by Expositors, much lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. The Observation, That this fact of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour more particularly concerns us of the Gentiles, then we take notice of. For the first, (in what part of the Temple this was done) The Jews Religion, and scrupulosity to keep their Temple from propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, was such, as might seem to make this story incredible. Those who were so chary, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised or unclean person should come therein; who trod the pavement thereof with so much religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observance and curiosity, who would not suffer (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> relates) any other building, no not the Palace of <hi>Agrippa</hi> their King, to have any prospect into it, lost it should be polluted with a prophane look; how unlikely is it, they should endure it to be made a place of buying, selling, and bartering; yea, a Market for sheep, and Oxen, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. it is expresly said to have been? Neither will it serve the turn, to excuse it, by saying, it was to furnish such as came thither with offerings: For the sheep, and ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, whilst they were yet to be bought to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, were not sacred, but prophane, and so not to come within the sacred limits: You see the difficulty. But I answer, that this market was kept in the third, or <hi>Gentiles Court,</hi> which was the outmost of the Temple: For the Temple, in our Saviours time,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101070:71"/>
had three Courts, each surrounding one another. First, the inmost or <hi>Priests</hi> Court, wherein stood the Temple, and the Altar of burnt offering: Into this none but the Priests, and Levites came. Secondly, the middle or <hi>great Court,</hi> which surrounded that of the Priests: whereinto the Jews of all sorts, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised Proselytes came to worship. Without this was a third Court for the Gentiles, which surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Israelites Court, as that did the Court of the Priests: The two first they accounted sacred; calling them <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; into which therefore none might enter, but such as were circumcised and clean, according to the Law. The third was without the sacred limits, and so accounted prophane and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; which may be learned out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who <note place="margin">Lib. 6. de Bello Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daico. ca. 6.</note> tels us of certain little pillars, or columns, placed by the <hi>Lorica,</hi> or <hi>Septum,</hi> which severed this Court from the rest, whereon was inscribed in Greek (and Latin) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> That no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger passe within the sacred limits; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> The second part of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was called Holy, as implying that the outmost was not so. Into this Court therefore, which had no legall sanctity, and was without the sacred li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, the Gentiles were admitted, and had their station, together with such of the Jews, as were in their uncleannesse; further they might not go. By Gentiles here I mean such, which though uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, yet worshipped the God of Israel, and were called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>In this Court therefore the Jews made no scruple of doing prophane and secular acts, being in their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101070:72"/>
opinion no better then a common place. Nay, it is very probable, that to shew their despiciency of the poor Gentiles (according to that in the Apocalypse, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>without are Dogs)</hi> and to pride themselves in their prerogative and discretion from them, they affected to have such acts there done. And hence it came to passe, that they permitted a Market of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Sheep, Doves and other bartery, to be kept there, for the use of the Temple, and those who came thither to worship. And thus the poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, were stabled amongst Oxen, Sheep, and stals of Money-changers, and in that tumultuous place fain to offer up their devotions and prayers unto the most high God, whom they had chosen.</p>
                     <p>But our blessed Saviour, who came to redeem, not the Jews onely, but the Gentiles also, and to make them a principall part of his fold, would not suffer them to be thus neglected, but in this act of his gave them a <hi>praeludium</hi> of his further favour intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and he that was to vindicate their souls from death, and take away the partition-wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Jews, first vindicates their Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from prophanation; alledging for his warrant this place of the Prophet <hi>Esay, My House shall be called a House of Prayer,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> He did not say, My Fathers House is holy: For the Jews would soon have replied, That the Gentiles Court was without the sacred limits; But, <hi>It is written,</hi> saith he, <hi>My House shall be called a House of Prayer for all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Ergo,</hi> the place of prayer for all Nations is a part of my Fathers House. If my Fathers House,

then holy, and not to be thus prophaned. For whatsoever is his, is holy; Relative Holinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing else but the peculiarity a thing hath to God-ward.</p>
                     <p>Though therefore the Gentiles Court had no san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of legall distinction, yet had it the sanctity of such peculiarity, and therefore not to be used as a common place. The illation proceeds by way of conversion; <hi>My House shall be called the House of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Kings 8. 41. 42.</note>

                        </gap>, which our Translators were not so well advised of, when following <hi>Beza</hi> too close, they render the words thus; <hi>My House shall be called of all Nations the House of Prayer,</hi> as if the Dative Case here [<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Which sense is clear from the scope and purpose of the place, whence it is taken, as he that compares them will easily see, and I shall make fully to appear in the next part of my discourse, which I tendred by the name of an Observation.</p>
                     <p>Which was, that this fact of our Saviour more particularly concerns us of the Gentiles, then we take notice of. Namely, we are taught thereby, what reverent esteem we ought to have of our Gentile Oratories and Churches, howsoever not endued with such legall sanctity, in every respect, as was the Temple of the Jews; yet Houses of prayer as well as theirs. This observation will be made good by a threefold Consideration: First, of the story,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101070:73"/>
as I have related it. Secondly, from the Text here alledged, for warrant thereof. And thirdly, from the circumstance of time. For the story, I have shewed it was acted in the Gentiles Court, and not in those of the Jews: It cannot therefore be alledged, that this was a place of <hi>legall sanctity:</hi> For according to legall sanctity, it was held by the Jews as common: onely it was the place for the Gentiles to worship the God of Israel in; and seems to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the second Temple: the Gentiles in the first worshipping without at the Temple door in the holy Mountain onely. Secondly, the place alledged to avow the fact speaks expresly of Gentile worshippers, not in the words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> onely, but in the whole body of the context: Hear the Prophet speak, <hi>Isa. cap. 56. vers.</hi> 7, 8. and then judge; <hi>The sons of the stranger, that joyn themselves to the Lord to serve him, and to love the Name of the Lord to be his servants; every one that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my Covenant,</hi> (namely, that I alone shall be his God) <hi>even them will I bring to my holy Mountain, and make them joyfull in my House of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; their burnt offerings and sacrifices accepted upon mine Altar.</hi> Then follow the words of Text; <hi>For my House shall be called</hi> (shall be; it is an Hebraism) <hi>a House of Prayer, for all People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is this but a Description of the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or Gentile worshippers? And this place alone makes good all that I have said before, That this vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was of the Gentiles Court: Otherwise the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation of this Scripture had been impertinent; for the Gentiles of whom the Prophet speaks, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101070:73"/>
in no place but this. Hence also appears to what purpose our Euangelist expressed the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, namely, as that which shewed, wherein the force of the accommodation to this occasion lay; which the rest of the Euangelists omitted, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the place of the Prophet, whence it was taken; those who heard it being not ignorant of whom the Prophet spake. Thirdly, the circumstance of time argues the same thing; if we consider, that this was done but a few dayes before our Saviour suffered; to wit, when he came to his last Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: How unseasonable had it been to vindicate the violation of legall and typicall sanctity, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in so few dayes after he was utterly to abolish by his Crosse, unlesse he had meant thereby, to leave his Church a lasting lesson, what reverence and respect he would have accounted due to such places, as this was which he vindicated?</p>

commeth, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is an abused Text, being commonly alledged to prove, that God now in the Gospel, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not, or regards not <hi>externall</hi> worship, but that <hi>of the Spirit</hi> onely: And this to be a characteristicall difference between the worship of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the New. If at any time we talk of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decency in rites and bodily expressions, as fit to be used in the service of God; this is the usuall Buckler to repell whatsoever may be said in that kinde: It is true indeed, that the worship of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is much more spirituall, then that of the Law: But that the worship of the Gospel should be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirituall, and no externall worship required there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as the Text according to some mens sense and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation thereof would imply) is repugnant, not onely to the practice and experience of the Christian Religion in all ages, but also to the expresse Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Gospel it self. For what are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the New Testament? are they not rites, wherein and wherewith God is served and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped? The consideration of the holy Eucharist alone, will confute this Glosse. For is not the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the sacrifice of Christs death upon the Crosse, unto his Father, in the Symbols of Bread and Wine, an externall worship? And yet with this rite hath the Church, in all ages, used to make her solemne addresse of Prayer, and Supplication, unto the Divine Majesty; as the Jews in the Old Testament did by Sacrifice: when I say, in all Ages, I include that of the Apostles. For so much Saint

                        <hi>They continued in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for bodily expressions by gestures and postures, as standing, kneeling, bowing, and the like; our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour himself, lift up his sacred eyes to heaven, when he prayed for <hi>Lazarus;</hi> fell on his face when he prayed in his agony: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (as himself saith) <hi>bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> He and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the beleevers, do the like more then once, in the Acts of the Apostles: What was imposition of hands, but an externall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, in an act of invocation for conferring a blessing? and that perhaps sometimes without any vocall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression joyned therewith. Besides I cannot conceive any reason, why in this point of Euangelicall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>Gesture</hi> should be more scrupled at, then <hi>Voyce.</hi> Is not confessing, praising, praying, and glorifying God by voyce, an externall and bodily worship, as well as that of Gesture? why should then the one derogate from the worship of the Father, <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> and not the other? To conclude, there was never any society of men in the world, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the Father in such a manner, as this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation would imply: And therefore cannot this be our Saviours meaning, but some other. Let us see if we can finde out what it is.</p>
                     <p>There may be two senses given of these words; both of them agreeable to reason, and the analogy of Scripture; let us take our choice. The one is, That to worship God <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him not with types and shadows of things to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101070:75"/>
come, as in the Old Testament; but according to the verity of the things exhibited in Christ, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that; <hi>The Law was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth came by Iesus Christ.</hi> Whence the mystery of the Gospel, is elsewhere by our Saviour in this Euangelist, termed <hi>Truth,</hi> as <hi>Cap. 17. ver.</hi> 17. and the Doctrine thereof by Saint <hi>Paul, The word of truth.</hi> See <hi>Ephes. Cap. 1. ver. 13. Rom. 15. ver.</hi> 8. The time therefore is now at hand, said our Saviour, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father, no longer with bloody sacrifices, and the Rites and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances depending thereon; but in, and according to the verity of that which these Ordinances figured. For all these were types of Christ, in whom being now exhibited, the true worshippers shall henceforth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Father.</p>
                     <p>This sense hath good warrant from the state of the Question between the Jews and Samaritans, to which our Saviour here makes answer: which was not about worship in generall, but about the kinde of worship in speciall, which was confessed by both sides, to be tied to one certain place onely; that is, of worship by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the appendages; In a word, of the typicall worship proper to the first Covenant, of which see a description <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. This <hi>Iosephus</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifies, <hi>Lib. 12. Antiq. cap.</hi> 1. speaking of the Jews and Samaritans, which dwelt together at Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria: <hi>They lived,</hi> saith he, <hi>in perpetuall discord one with the other; whilest each laboured to maintain their Country customes; those of Ierusalem affirming their Temple to be the sacred place, whither sacrifices were to be sent; the Samaritans, on the other side, contending

they ought to be sent to Mount Garizim.</hi> For otherwise, who knows not that both Jews and Samaritans had other places of worship, besides either of these? namely, their <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> and <hi>Synagogues,</hi> wherein they worshipped God, not with internall onely, but externall worship; though not with sacrifice, which might be offered but in one place onely. And this also may seem to have been a type of Christ, as well as the rest, namely, that he was to be that <hi>one,</hi> and onely Mediator of the Church, in the Temple of whose sacred body, we have accesse unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in whom he accepts our devotions and services: according to that, <hi>Destroy this Temple, and I will rear it up again in three daies: He spake,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>of the Temple of his Body.</hi> This sense divers of the Ancients hit upon, <hi>Eusebius Demon.

                     <p>But howsoever this Exposition be fair and plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet, me thinks, the reason which our Saviour gives in the words following, should argue another meaning: <hi>God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is a Spirit, therefore they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and Truth:</hi> But, God was a Spirit from the beginning: If therefore, for this reason he must be worshipped in <hi>Spirit and Truth,</hi> he was so to be worshipped in the Old Testament, as well as in the New.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore seek another meaning: For the finding whereof, let us take notice, that the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> at whom our Saviour here aimeth, were the off-spring of those Nations which the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> placed in the Cities of Samaria, when he had carried away the ten Tribes captive. These, as we may reade in the second Book of the Kings, at their first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, worshipped not the God of Israel, but the gods of the Nations from whence they came. Wherefore he sent Lyons amongst them, which slew them; which they apprehending, either from the information of some Israelite, or otherwise, to be because they knew not the worship of the God of the Countrey, they informed the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> thereof, desiring that some of the captiv'd Priests might be sent unto them, to teach them the manner and rites of his worship; which being accordingly done, they thenceforth (as the Text tels us) worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Lord, yet feared their own gods too, and so did <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

In this medly they continued about two hundred years, till toward the end of the Persian Monarchy. At what time it chanced, that <hi>Manasse,</hi> brother to <hi>Iaddo,</hi> the High Priest of the returned Jews, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the daughter of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> then Governour of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria; For which, being expelled from Jerusalem by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he fled to <hi>Sanballat</hi> his Father in Law, and, after his example, many other of the Jews of the best rank, having married strange wives like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and loth to forgo them, betook themselves thither also: <hi>Sanballat</hi> willingly entertains them, and makes his son in Law <hi>Manasse</hi> their Priest. For whose greater reputation and state, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great subdued the Persian Monarchy, he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned leave of him, to build a Temple upon Mount <hi>Garizim;</hi> where his son in Law exercised the office of High Priest. This was exceedingly prejudicious to the Jews, and the occasion of a continuall Schism, whilst those that were discontented, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were wont to betake themselves thither: Yet, by this means the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans (having now one of the sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> to be their Chief Priest, and so many other of the Jews, both Priests and others, mingled amongst them) were brought, at length, to cast off all their false gods, and to worship the Lord the God of Israel onely. Yet so, that howsoever they seemed to themselves, to be true worshippers, and altogether free from Idolatry; neverthelesse, they retained a smack there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in as much as they worshipped the true God, under a visible representation; to wit, of a <hi>Dove,</hi> and circumcised their Children in the name thereof,

Yea S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 3, 4. will further assure us that they are; <hi>I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto you,</hi> saith he, <hi>first of all, that which I received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 4. And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.</hi> Both of them therefore, are somwhere foretold in the Scriptures, and it becomes not us to be so ignorant, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are, which those Scriptures be which foretell
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101070:79"/>
them. It is a main point of our Faith, and that which the Jews most stumble at, because their Doctors had not observed any such thing of Messiah. The more they were ignorant thereof, the more it concerns us to be confirmed therein. I thought good therefore, to make this the Argument of my Discourse at this time, to inform both you and my self, where these things are foretold, and if I can, to point out those very Scriptures, which our Saviour here expounded to his Disciples.</p>
                     <p>Which that I may the better do, I will make the words fore-going my Text, to be as the Pole-star in this my search; <hi>These are the things,</hi> (saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>which I spake unto you, while I was with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning me.</hi> Then follow the words I read, <hi>Then opened he their understanding, &amp;c.</hi> These two events therefore of Messiahs death and rising again the third day, were foretold in these three parts of Scripture, in the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> or <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> in the <hi>Neb im,</hi> or <hi>Prophets,</hi> and in the <hi>Psalmes;</hi> and in these three we must search for them. And first for the first, that Messiah should suffer death.</p>
                     <p>This was fore-signified in the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> first in the Story of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to offer his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> the son wherein his seed should be called, and to whom the promise was entailed, <hi>That in it should all the Nations of the world be blessed.</hi> What was here acted else, but the mystery of Christs Passion? to wit, that the promised seed should make all the Nations of the world blessed, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101070:79"/>
a sacrifice for sin: which that it might be the more evident, the place is also designed, the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mount <hi>Moriah;</hi> there <hi>Abraham</hi> was bid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> even where Messiah, who was then in the loins of <hi>Isaac,</hi> was one day to be offered upon the Crosse.</p>
                     <p>The second prediction in the <hi>Law,</hi> of Messiahs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering death, was by the slaying of Beasts, for the atonement of sin in their sacrifices; which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but shadows and representations of that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering upon the Crosse, which Messiah was one day to make of himself for the sins of the world. Which mystery of the end of those legall sacrifices, was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former story of <hi>Abrahams</hi> offering <hi>Isaac:</hi> For when he had now brought his son to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and had built an Altar, and was now ready to slay him, as he was commanded; the Angel of the Lord stayed his hand, and shewed him a Ram caught in a thicket by the horns, which Ram <hi>Abraham</hi> took, and offered for a burnt offering in stead of his son, to signifie, that the offering of the blessed seed was yet to be suspended, and that God in the mean while would accept the offerings of Buls and Rams, as a pledge of that expiation, which the blessed seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the loyns of <hi>Isaac,</hi> should one day make.</p>
                     <p>And thus much for the <hi>Law;</hi> now I come to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> wherein I finde three evident Prophecies that Messiah should suffer death. The first is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one in the 53. of <hi>Isay</hi> the whole Chapter through; I will not repeat it all, but some two or three passages thereof: <hi>ver. 5.

                     </p>
                     <p>The second place, which foretels that Christ should suffer, is that in the ninth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who pointing ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the time of Messiah's comming by seventy weeks, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his account, not at his birth, but at his suffering; as the most principall moment of his story. <hi>From the going out of the commandement,</hi> saith he, <hi>to restore, and build Ierusalem unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and sixty two weeks:—and after sixty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <p>A third place in the Prophets, is to be found <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> 12. 10. where, at the time when the Jews shall be converted, Christ is brought in speaking in this manner; <hi>I will poure out,</hi> saith he, <hi>upon the House of David, and upon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, the spirit of grace and supplication, and they shall look upon me,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101070:80"/>
whom they have pierced.</hi> Hence it follows, that the Jews should have pierced Messiah before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be their Redeemer. And that this place also was one of those applied by the Apostles to this purpose, appears by S. <hi>Iohns</hi> twice alledging it. Once in his Gospel, when a Souldier with a Spear pierced our Saviours side; <hi>Then,</hi> saith he, <hi>was fulfilled that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 19. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>Scripture, which saith, They shall look upon him whom they have pierced.</hi> Again, in the beginning of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apol. 1. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>he commeth in the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the third division of Scripture, the <hi>Psalms,</hi> the principall place there which I dare warrant, is that <note place="margin">Acts 2. 26, 27. 13. 35.</note> of the 16. <hi>Psalm,</hi> quoted both by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles; My flesh shall rest in hope, for thou wilt not leave my soule in the grave, neither suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</hi> For <hi>David,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> say, was buried, and his body saw corruption, therefore it cannot be spoken of him; but of <hi>Messiah</hi> in the person of <hi>David,</hi> as a type in whose loyns Messiah was. Now then if Messiahs body were to be laid in the grave, it follows he was to die, and to be in the state of the dead.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have done the first part of my task, and proved that Messiah was to suffer death, according to the Scriptures; namely, foretold in that threefold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Scripture, mentioned here by our Saviour: <hi>The Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.</hi> Now I come to prove the other part, that it behoved him also, <hi>to rise again the third day, according to the Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this was first foreshewn in the same story of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101070:81"/>
                        <hi>Isaac,</hi> wherein his sacrifice or suffering was acted. For, from the time that God commanded <hi>Isaac</hi> to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a burnt offering, <hi>Isaac</hi> was a dead man, but the <hi>third day</hi> he was released from death. This the Text tels us expresly, that it was the <hi>third day,</hi> when <hi>Abraham</hi> came to Mount <hi>Moriah,</hi> and had his son, as it were, restored to him again; which circumstance, there was no need nor use at all to have noted, had it not been for some mystery: For had there been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intended, but the naked story, what did it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to know, whether it were the <hi>third,</hi> or the <hi>fifth day,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> came to <hi>Moriah,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his son from death? Now, that I have not misapplied this figure, S. <hi>Paul</hi> is my witnesse, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly makes this release of <hi>Isaac</hi> from slaughter, a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Resurrection: For thus he speaks of this whole story, <hi>Hebrews 11. By faith, Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac; and he that received the promises, offered up his onely begotten Sonne. Of whom it was said, that in Isaac shall thy seed be cal led.

                     <p>The same was foreshewn by the Law of sacrifices, which were to be eaten before the <hi>third day;</hi> some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were to be eaten the same day they were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but those which were deferred longest, as the <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> were to be eaten before the <hi>third day.</hi> The <hi>third day</hi> no sacrifice might be eaten, but was to be burnt: If it were eaten, it was not accepted for an atonement, but counted an abomination: To shew, that the sacrifice of Messiah, which these sacrifices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101070:81"/>
was to be finished the <hi>third day</hi> by his rising from the dead; and therefore, the type thereof deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined within that time, beyond which time it was not accepted for atonement of sin, because then it was no longer a type of him.</p>
                     <p>Thus far the <hi>Law;</hi> as for the <hi>Prophets,</hi> I finde no expresse prediction in them, for the time of Christs rising (for that of the Prophet <hi>Ionah,</hi> I take to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an allusion, then a Prophecie:) onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall it is implyed, that Christ should rise again; both in that famous Prophecie of <hi>Esay,</hi> the 53. and that of <hi>Zachary</hi> 12. In the former it is said, that after he had made his soul a sacrifice for sin, <hi>He should see his seed, and prolong his dayes,</hi> and <hi>the pleasure of the Lord should prosper in his hand.</hi> And again, that the Lord should <hi>divide him a portion with the great,</hi> and that he should <hi>divide the spoile with the strong, because he had poured out his soul unto death:</hi> which argues that he should not onely live again, but be victorious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had died. In that of <hi>Zachary</hi> it is said, the Iews should <hi>look upon,</hi> or see <hi>him whom they had</hi> formerly <hi>pierced;</hi> and, that <hi>in that day</hi> he would <hi>powre upon them the spirit of grace and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> therefore he was to live again after they had pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him.</p>
                     <p>I come to the <hi>Psalms,</hi> where not onely his rising again is prophesied of, but the time thereof deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; though at first sight it appears not so namely, in that fore-alledged passage of the sixteenth <hi>Psalm, Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hell, nor suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</hi> All men shall rise again, but their bodies must first return to dust, and see cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:

They give also a reason of it in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; because, say they, in that time the humours of the body make their revolution; the flegme in one day, or twenty four hours; the choler in two dayes, or forty eight hours; the melancholy in three dayes, which is seventy two hours: and this to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why an Ague, founded in an inflammation of flegme, returns every day; an Ague, which comes from choler, every other day; from melancholy, every third day: Now if a body may be kept so long unburied, it is supposed it may be kept so long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted; (namely, where a corruption is not begun before death, as in some diseases) but longer it will not continue. When therefore it is so often inculcated in the New Testament, that our Saviour should <hi>rise again the third day;</hi> the Holy Ghost, in so speaking, respects not so much the number of dayes, as the fulfilling of Scripture, that Messiahs body should not see corruption, but should rise before the time, wherin

dead bodies begin to corrupt: and indeed our Saviour rose again within forty hours, after he gave up the Ghost, and was not two full dayes in the grave.

                     <p>Thus far all is clear; but for the rest, we are to seek: First, on whom the fault lay, and what was the reason of this omission of circumcision: Then, who, and what is meant, when it is said, <hi>she cast,</hi> or <hi>made the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101070:83"/>
foreskin to touch his feet;</hi> and above all, what is meant by <hi>sponsus sanguinum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zipporah</hi> is commonly reputed to have been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and froward woman; and <hi>Moses,</hi> the meekest man on earth, to have had that mishap in his choice, which many a good man hath. The reason, because she not onely hindred her childe from being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, out of some nicety and aversation thereof, as a cruell ceremony; but also, when she saw there was no remedy, but she must do it, to save her husbands life, yet she did it with an upbraiding indignation, telling him, that he was a <hi>bloody husband,</hi> who must have such a thing done unto his poor childe. But I see no ground either for the one, or the other.</p>
                     <p>For, that the circumcision of the childe was not deferred out of any aversation of hers of that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, may be gathered; First, because she was a Midianitesse, and so a daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by <hi>Ketu rah,</hi> and therefore well enough acquainted, and inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that Rite, which not onely her Nation, the Midianites, but all the Nations descended of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> observed, as may be seen in the Ismaelites, or Saracens, who learned not this ceremony first from <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>met,</hi> but retained it as an ancient custome of their Nation. Secondly, she had suffered already her elder son <hi>Gershom</hi> to be circumcised; wherefore then should we think she was averse from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of this? For that this childe, for whom <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was now in danger, was <hi>Fleezer</hi> his youngest son, it cannot be denied; for as much as it is evident, that <hi>Moses</hi> at this time was the Father of two sons, which, by reason, as may seem, of this disturbance, he sent
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101070:84"/>
back with his wife, unto her Father <hi>Iethro,</hi> as we may reade in the eighteenth Chapter of this Book: By which it may be gathered, that the cause of this omission of circumcision, was not any aversenesse in <hi>Zipporah</hi> from that rite, but rather, because they were in their journey, when the childe was born; and so having no convenient time or place to rest in, till the wound might be healed, and thinking it might endanger the infants life, to be tossed up and down, whilst the wound was green, in so long and tedious a voyage, they resolved to deferre the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. And that <hi>Zipporah</hi> was delivered of this childe, when they had begun this journey, for Egypt, may be gathered by this; because <hi>Moses,</hi> before Gods sending him, hath but one childe mentioned, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Gershom:</hi> For what reason can be given, why, if <hi>Eleezer</hi> had been then born, he should not have been mentioned also? But howsoever this case of travell afterward excused the Israelites in the Wildernesse, for deferring the circumcision of their children then, yet could it not excuse <hi>Moses</hi> here; in regard it was <hi>necessitas accersita,</hi> he being not forced to take his wife and children with him, (especially his wife being in that case) but might have sent her and them, back presently to her Father; as upon this admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he did. Nor was it indeed fit, when God sent him upon such a businesse to carry such an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance with him.</p>
                     <p>Thus have we freed <hi>Zipporah</hi> from the first charge of being the cause of this omission out of any averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the Divine Ordinance: Now I come to shew likewise, that the words she spake at the time
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101070:84"/>
of circumcision, <hi>Sponsus sanguinum to mihi es,</hi> were no words of upbraiding indignation to her husband (as is supposed) but have a far other meaning.</p>
                     <p>For I beleeve not, she spake these words to <hi>Moses,</hi> but to her <hi>Childe,</hi> whom she circumcised, as the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula</hi> then used in circumcision; namely, that as the fore-skin fell down at her childes feet (not <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Angels feet) she pronounced the <hi>Verb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>My reasons are; First, because a Husband is not wont to be called <hi>sponsus,</hi> after the wedding solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is past; nor can there any such example be shewn in Scripture; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not like that <hi>Zipporah,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she was the mother of two children, should say to her Husband, <hi>Sponsus sanguinum tu mihi es.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, because <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the word here translated <hi>Sponsus,</hi> properly signifies <hi>Gener,</hi> a son in Law, and <hi>Sponsus</hi> onely by way of equivalence or coincidence, (because to be made son in Law to the Parents, is by being the daughters <hi>Sponsus)</hi> My meaning is that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the word used, signifies not the relation of the Bridegroom to his Bride; but his relation to his Brides Parents, by taking their daughter to wife. And therefore in the whole Scripture, we shall never finde it relatively used, or with an affix, but onely in respect to the wives Father or Mother: And of the same condition is the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Thirdly, for a farther probability hereof, the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Rabbins tell us, that it was the custome of women to call their children when they were circumcised, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>From the sense of this place thus proved, I will point out two observations, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                     <p>The first is, that it is lawfull to use some fitting forme of words in the exhibition of a Sacrament, though not expresly ordained by God at the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; as appears by this form, that <hi>Zipporah</hi> used, no doubt <hi>ex more</hi> then, whatsoever the form were after that time.</p>
                     <p>The second is, that the neglect of the circumcision of a childe then, and so consequently of baptizing it now, makes not so much the child, as the Parents li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

to the wrath of God; as here the Angel sought not to kill the child, who was uncircumcised; but <hi>Moses</hi> the Father, who should have circumcised it. Both which observations I mean to amplifie no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to leave to your exacter meditations; and so I conclude.</p>

And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Law; so that I might have taken it thence: but I rather chose to make these words in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> my Text, as expressed more plainly, and so a Comment to those in the Law: the place is <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. where this, which my Text containeth, is expressed thus, <hi>Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a signe between me and you throughout your generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to acknowledge that I Iehovah am your sanctifier,</hi> that is, <hi>your God;</hi> as the expression in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tels us. For to be the Sanctifier of a People, and to be their God, is all one, whence also the Lord is so often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture, the <hi>Holy One</hi> of Israel; that is, their Sanctifier, and their God.</p>
                     <p>That which I intend at this time to observe from these words, is the end why God commanded this observation of the Sabbath to the Israelites; to wit, that thereby, as by a <hi>Symbolum,</hi> they might testifie
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101070:88"/>
and professe what God they worshipped: Secondly, out of this ground, to shew how far, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the like observation binds us Christians, who are worshippers of the same God, whom the Jews wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, though not under the same relation altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein they worshipped him.</p>
                     <p>All Nations had something in their ceremonies, whereby they signified the God they worshipped; so in those of the celestiall Gods, (as they termed them) and those which were Deified souls of men, were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering rites, whereby the one was known from the other. Those gods which were made of men, having funerall rites in their services, (as cognisances that they were souls deceased) and each of them some imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of some remarkable passage of the Legend of their lives, either of some action done by them, or some accident which befell them; as in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Osyris</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> is obvious to any that reads them: And indeed it is a naturall <hi>Decorum</hi> for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and vassals, by some mark or cognisance to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie who is their Lord and Master: In the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the worshippers of the Beast receive his mark, and the worshippers of the Lamb carry his mark and his Fathers in their Fore-heads. Hence came the first use of the <hi>crosse in Baptisme,</hi> as the mark of Christ, the Deity to whom we are initiated; and the same after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards used in all Benedictions, Prayers, and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, in token they were done in the name, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Christ crucified: so that in the Primitive Church this rite was no more, but that wherewith we conclude all our Prayers, and Thanksgivings, when we say, <hi>Through Iesus Christ our Lord and Saviour;</hi>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:101070:88"/>
though afterward it came to be abused, as almost all other rites of Christianity, to abominable supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>To return therefore unto my Text: Agreeably to this principle, and this custome of all Religions, of all Nations, of all vassals, the Lord <hi>Iehovah,</hi> Creator of heaven and earth, ordained to his people this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> for a sign and cognisance, that he should be their God, and no other. <hi>It is for a sign,</hi> saith he, <hi>between me and you, that I Iehovah am your God.</hi> In the place I quoted before, in the 31. of <hi>Exod.</hi> are these words; <hi>The Children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, for a perpetuall Covenant; it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, for in six dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested:</hi> As if he had said, it is a sign that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of heaven and earth is your God.</p>
                     <p>But for the distinct understanding of this significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we must know that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> includes two respects of time: First, the <hi>quotum,</hi> one day of seven, or the seventh day after six days labour: Secondly, the <hi>designation,</hi> or pitching that seventh day, upon the day we call <hi>Saturday.</hi> In both, the Sabbaticall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was a <hi>sign,</hi> and profession that <hi>Iehovah</hi> and no other was the God of Israel: the first, according to his attribute of <hi>Creator;</hi> the second of <hi>Deliverer of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of Egypt. For by sanctifying the seventh day, after they had laboured six, they professed themselves vassals and worshippers of that only God, who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the heaven and the earth, and having spent six days in that great work, rested the seventh day; and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101070:89"/>
therefore commanded them to observe this sutable distribution of their time, as a badge and livery that their religious service was appropriate to him alone. And this is that which the fourth Commandement in the reason given from the Creation intendeth, and no more but this.</p>
                     <p>But seeing they might professe this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well by any other six days working, and a sevenths resting, as by those they pitched upon; there being still (what six days soever they had laboured, and what seventh soever they had rested) the same conformity with their Creator; let us see the reason why they pitched upon those six days wherein they laboured, for labouring days rather then any other six; and why they chose that seventh day, namely <hi>Saturday,</hi> to hallow and rest in, rather then any other.</p>
                     <p>And this was, that they might professe themselves servants of <hi>Iehovah</hi> their God, in a relation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect peculiar and proper to themselves; to wit, that they were the servants of that God, which redeemed Israel out of the Land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage; and upon the morning watch of <hi>that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day</hi> which they kept for their Sabbath, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Host in the Red Sea, and saved Israel that day out of the hand of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians. This I gather from the repetition of the Decalogue, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. where that reason from the worlds Creation (in the Decalogue given at Horeb) being left out, <hi>Moses</hi> inserts this other of the Redemption of Israel out of Egypt in stead thereof; namely, as the reason, why those six days rather then any other
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101070:89"/>
six for work, and that seventh day rather then any other seventh for rest, were pitched upon, as Israel observed them. <hi>Remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>thou wert a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God, brought thee out thence through a mighty hand, and a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to keep the Sabbath Day:</hi> Not for the <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of one day of seven, (for of that another reason was given, the example of God in the Creation) but for the <hi>designation</hi> of the day.</p>
                     <p>But whether this day were in order the seventh from the Creation or not, the Scripture is silent; for where it is called in the Commandement the <hi>seventh</hi> day, that is in respect of the six days of labour, and not otherwise: and therefore, whensoever it is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, those six days of labour are mentioned with it. The seventh day therefore is the seventh after six days of labour, nor can any more be inferred from it: The example of the Creation is brought for the <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> one day of seven, as I have shewed, and not for the <hi>designation</hi> of any certain day for that seventh. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, it might fall out so, by disposition of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, that the Jews designed seventh day was, both the seventh in order from the Creation, and also the day of their deliverance out of Egypt. But the Scripture no where tels us it was so, (howsoever most men take it for granted) and therefore it may as well be not so: Certain I am, the Jews kept not that day for a Sabbath till the raining of Manna: For that which should have been their <hi>Sabbath</hi> the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had they then kept the day, which afterward they kept, was the fifteenth day of the second month;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101070:90"/>
on which day we reade in the 16. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that they marched a wearisome march, and came at night into the wildernesse of Sin; where they murmured for their poor entertainment, and wished they had died in Egypt: that night the Lord sent them Quails, the next morning it rained Manna, which was the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, and so six days together; the seventh, which was the two and twentieth, it rained none, and that day they were commanded to keep for their <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi> now if the two and twentieth day of the month were the Sabbath, the fifteenth should have been, if that day had been kept before; but the Text tels us expresly, they marcht that day; and, which is strange, the day of the month is never named, unlesse it be once, for any station but this, where the Sabbath was ordained; otherwise it could not have been known, that that day was ordained for a day of rest, which before was none. And why might not their day of holy rest be altered, as well as the beginning of the year was, for a memoriall of their comming out of Egypt? I can see no reason, why it might not, nor finde any testimony to assure me it was not.</p>
                     <p>And thus much of the Jews Sabbath, how and wherein it was a sign, whereby they professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the servants of <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and no other God.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to the second thing I propounded, to shew how far, and in what manner the like observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on binds us Christians.</p>
                     <p>I say therefore, that the <hi>Christian</hi> as well as the <hi>Iew,</hi> after six days spent in his own works, is to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the <hi>seventh,</hi> that he may professe himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a servant of God, the Creatour of Heaven and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101070:90"/>
Earth; as well as the Jew. For the <hi>quotum</hi> therefore, the Jew and Christian agree, but in <hi>designation</hi> of the day they differ. For the Christian chooseth for his Holy day, that which with the Jews was the first day of the week, and cals it <hi>Dominicum,</hi> that he might thereby professe himself a servant of that God, who on the morning of that day, vanquished <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>Spirituall Pharaoh,</hi> and redeemed us from our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall thraldome, by raising <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Lord from the dead, begetting us in stead of an earthly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> to an inheritance incorruptible in the Heavens: In a word, the Christian, by the day he hallows, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses himself a Christian; that is, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>To beleeve on him that raised up Iesus from the dead;</hi> so that the Jew and Christian both, though they fall not upon the same day, yet make their <hi>designation</hi> of their day upon the like ground; the Jews, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall day of their deliverance from the <hi>temporall Egypt,</hi> and <hi>temporall Pharaoh:</hi> the Christians, the memoriall of their deliverance from the <hi>spirituall Egypt,</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Pharaoh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But might not (will you say) the Christian, as well have observed the Jewish for his seventh day, as the day he doth? I answer, No; he might not: For, in so doing, he should seem not to acknowledge his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to be already performed; but still expected. For the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of <hi>Moses,</hi> was intended for a type and pledge of the spirituall deliverance, which was to come by <hi>Christ:</hi> their <hi>Canaan</hi> also to which they marched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a type of that heavenly inheritance, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by <hi>Christ</hi> do look for: Since therefore the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101070:91"/>
shadow is now made void by the comming of the substance, the relation is changed, and God is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be worshipped, and beleeved in, as a God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing and assuring by types; but as a God who hath performed the substance of what he promised. And this is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> means, <hi>Colossians</hi> 2. 16, 17. where he saith, <hi>Let no man judge you</hi> (henceforth) <hi>in respect of a Feast day, New Moon, or Sabbath days, which were a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</hi>

                     <p>What I intend to speak upon this Text, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of these two parts; First, of an enquiry, what is here meant by <hi>prophecying,</hi> a thing attributed to <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and therefore undoubtedly some such thing as they were capable of.

                     <p>To begin with the first, and which I am like to dwell longest upon; Some take <hi>prophecying</hi> here, in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:101070:92"/>
the stricter sense, to be foretelling of things to come; as that which in those Primitive times, both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women</hi> did, by the powring out of the Holy Ghost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; according to that of the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by S. <hi>Peter</hi> to the sending of the Holy Ghost at the first promulgation of the Gospel: <hi>I will powre out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and daughters shall prophecy, and your young men shall see visions.</hi> And that such <hi>Prophetesses</hi> as these, were those four Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Philip</hi> the Euangelist, whereof we read <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 9.</p>
                     <p>Others take <hi>prophecying</hi> here in a more large noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the gift of interpreting and opening Divine mysteries contained in holy Scripture, for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and edification of the hearers; especially, as it was then inspired and suggested in extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the Holy Spirit, as <hi>Prophecy</hi> was given of old; according to that of S.

This the Apostle teacheth us in this very Epistle, Chapter the fourteenth; even there where he discourseth so largely of those kinds of <hi>Prophecy: Let your women</hi> (saith he) <hi>keep silence in the Churches: For it is not permitted unto them to speak,</hi>

                        <hi>but to be subject: And if they will learn, let them ask their husbands at home.</hi> Again in the first of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the second and the eleventh, <hi>Let the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men learn in silence with all subjection. 12. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</hi> Note here, that to speak in a Church Assembly, by way of teaching or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting others, is an act of <hi>superiority,</hi> which therefore a woman might not do, because her sex was to be in <hi>subjection,</hi> and so to appear before God in that Garb and Posture, which consisted therewith; that is, they might not speak to instruct men in the Church, but to God she might.</p>

It is true, the Congregation is said to <hi>pray</hi> when the Priest only speaks; but that they should be said to <hi>preach,</hi> who are present only at the hearing of a Sermon, is a Trope without example. For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not alike: In <hi>prayer</hi> the Priest is the mouth of the Congregation, and does what he does in their names, and they assent to it by saying, A men. But he that <hi>preaches</hi> or <hi>prophecies</hi> is not the mouth of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101070:93"/>
Church, to speak ought in their names, that so they might be said to speak too; but he is the mouth of God speaking to them. It is not likely therefore, that those who only hear another speaking or <hi>prophecying</hi> to them, should be said <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>What shall we do then? Is there any other accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>prophecying</hi> left us, which may fit our turn? Yes, there is a fourth acception, which if it can be made good, will sute our Text better (I think) then any of the former; to wit, that <hi>prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> here should be taken for <hi>praising God in Hymnes and Psalms.</hi> For so it is fitly coupled with <hi>praying: Praying</hi> and <hi>praising,</hi> being the parts of the Christian Liturgy. Besides, our Apostle also in the fourteenth Chapter of this Epistle, joyns them both together; <hi>I will pray,</hi> saith he, <hi>with the spirit, and will pray with understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing,</hi> that is, prophecy, <hi>with understanding also.</hi> For, because <hi>Prophets</hi> of old did three things: First, foretell things to come: Secondly, notifie the will of God unto the people: And thirdly, uttered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in musicall wise, and, as I may so speak, in a poeticall strain and composure: Hence it comes to passe, that to <hi>prophecy</hi> in Scripture, signifies the doing of any of these three things, and amongst the rest, to <hi>praise</hi> God in verse or musicall composure.</p>
                     <p>This to be so, as I say, I shall prove unto you out of two places of Scripture; and first out of the first of <hi>Chronicles, ch.</hi> 25. where the word <hi>Prophecy</hi> is three severall times thus used: I will alledge the words of

and, as it were, by way of <hi>prophecying</hi> and versifying; even though we do but speak it only; as you know the Poet says, <hi>Amant alterna Camaenae.</hi> Thus I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken occasion somewhat to enlarge this particular; That we our selves might the better understand the reason of what we do, and what precedents, and whose example we follow therein.

                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to the second thing, I propounded to speak of; namely, what was that fault among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> which the Apostle here taxeth: For the right understanding whereof, I say two things; First, for the offenders, that they were the <hi>women,</hi> and not the <hi>men.</hi> That which the Apostle speaketh concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>men,</hi> being by way of supposition only, and to illustrate his Argument against the uncomly guise of the <hi>women à pari:</hi> this appears, because his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion speaks of <hi>women</hi> only, and nothing at all of <hi>men.</hi> Secondly, for the quality of the fault, it was this; that the <hi>women</hi> at the time of <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> were unveiled in the Church; notwithstanding it was then accounted an unseemly and immodest guise, for <hi>women</hi> to appear open and bare-faced in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. How then, will you say, should it come to passe, that Christian women should so much forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as to transgresse this <hi>decorum</hi> in Gods House, and service which they observed other where? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, from a phantasticall imitation of the manner of the <hi>she-Priests and Prophetesses</hi> of the Gentiles, when they served their Idols, as their <hi>Pythiae, Bacchae,</hi> or <hi>Maenades,</hi> and the like; who used, when they uttered their Oracles, or celebrated the rites and sacrifices of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101070:96"/>
their Gods, to put themselves into a wild and exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall guise, having their faces discovered, their hait dishevelled, and hanging about their ears: This these <hi>Corinthian women</hi> (conceiting themselves when they <hi>prayed</hi> or <hi>prophecied</hi> in the Church, to be acting the parts of <hi>she-Priests,</hi> uttering Oracles like, the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiae,</hi> or <hi>Sibyllae,</hi> or celebrating sacrifice, as the <hi>Maena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> or <hi>Bacchae)</hi> were so fond, as to imitate (as that sex is prone to follow the fashion) and accordingly cast off their veils, and discovered their faces immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly in the Congregation, and thereby (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks) dishonoured their heads; that is, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly accoutred, and dressed on their head: which he proveth by three Arguments; partly from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which having given <hi>women</hi> their hair for a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, taught them to be covered, as a sign of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the manner of this covering being to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the custome of the Nation: Lastly, by an Argument <hi>à pari,</hi> from <hi>men,</hi> for whom even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being Judges, it would be an uncomely thing to wear a vail, that is, a <hi>womans</hi> habit; so by the like reason, was it as uncomely for a <hi>woman</hi> to be without a vail, that is, in the guise and dresse of a <hi>man.</hi> And howsoever the Devils of the Gentiles, sometimes took pleasure in uncomelinesse, and absurd garbs and gestures; yet the God whom they worshipped with his holy Angels, who were present at their devotions, loved a comely accommodation, agreeable to Nature and Custome, in such as worshipped him. <hi>For this cause therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>ought a woman to have a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering on her head, because of the Angels.</hi> Lastly, he concludes it, from the example and custome both of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101070:96"/>
the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Churches, neither of which had any such use, for their <hi>women</hi> to be unvailed in their sacred assemblies: <hi>If any man</hi> (saith he) <hi>be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,</hi> (that is, will not be satisfied with these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) <hi>let him know, that we,</hi> (that is, we of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision) <hi>have no such custome, nor the Church of God.</hi> For so, with S. <hi>Ambrose, Anselme,</hi> and some of the ancients, I take the meaning of the Apostle to be in those words.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have heard briefly, what was the fault of these <hi>Corinthian Dames,</hi> which the Apostle here tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. From which we our selves may learn thus much; That God requires a decent and comely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in his House, in the act of his worship, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; For if in their habit and dresse, surely much more in their gestures, and deportment; he loves nothing that is unseemly in the one, or in the other.</p>

the <hi>Spirit,</hi> well appears by the figuring of the Spirit thereby in other places of Scripture; As in that of <hi>Isay, I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and slouds upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon</hi>

                        <hi>by seed, and my blessing upon thine off-spring,</hi> where the latter expounds the former: Also by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of our Saviour with the Samaritan woman, <hi>Iohn 4. 14. Whosoever</hi> (saith he) <hi>drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life:</hi> By that also, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 37. where on the last day of the great feast, <hi>Iesus stood and said, If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink. He that beleeveth on me, as the Scripture saith</hi> (that is, as the Scripture is wont to expresse it, for otherwise there is no such place of Scripture to be found in all the Bible) <hi>out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this</hi> (saith the Euangelist) <hi>he spake of the Spirit, which they that beleeve on him should receive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor did the Fathers or ancient Church, as far as I can finde, suppose any other correlative to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Baptism, but this; of this they speak often, of the <hi>blood of Christ</hi> they are altogether silent in their explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this mystery: many are the allusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they seek out, for the illustration thereof, and some perhaps forced, but this of the <hi>water,</hi> signifying or having any relation to the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> never comes amongst them; which were impossible, if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed some other thing figured by the water, then it; which barred them from falling on that conceit.</p>
                     <p>The like silence is to be observed in our Liturgy, where the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is more then once paralled with

the <hi>water</hi> in <hi>Baptism,</hi> washing and regeneration attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted thereunto; but no such notion of the <hi>blood of Christ.</hi> And that the opinion thereof is novell, may be gathered, because some <hi>Lutheran Divines</hi> make it peculiar and proper to the followers of <hi>Calvin.</hi>

                     <p>Whatsoever it be, it hath no foundation in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and we must not of our own heads assigne sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications to Sacramentall types without some war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thence. For whereas some conceive those two expressions, of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>sprinkling of the blood of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ,</hi> and of our being <hi>washed from our sins in</hi> (or by) <hi>his blood,</hi> do intimate some such matter, they are <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 5.</note> surely mistaken; for those expressions have reference not to the water of <hi>Baptism</hi> in the New Testament, but to the rite and manner of sacrificing in the Old; where the Altar was wont to be <hi>sprinkled</hi> with the blood of the Sacrifices, which were offered, and that which was unclean purified with the same blood: whence is that elegant discourse of Saint <hi>Paul, (Heb.</hi> 9.) comparing the sacrifices of the Law, with that of Christ upon the Crosse, as much the better. And that whereas in the Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Almost all things were purified with blood; so much more the blood of Christ, who offered himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot to God, cleanseth our consciences from dead works:</hi> But that this washing, that is, cleansing by the blood of Christ, should have reference to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, where is that to be found? I suppose, they will not alledge the <hi>water</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> which came out of our Saviours side, when they pierced him; For that is taken to signifie the two Sacraments ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, that of <hi>blood</hi> the Eucharist, of <hi>water</hi>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:101070:99"/>
Baptism, &amp; not both to be referred to Baptism: I add, because perhaps some mens fancies are corrupted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that there was no such thing as sprinkling, or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, used in Baptism in the Apostles times, nor many ages after them; and that therefore it is no way probable, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in S. <hi>Peter</hi> should have any reference to the Laver of Baptism.</p>
                     <p>Let this then be our conclusion; That the <hi>blood of Christ</hi> concurres in the mystery of Baptism, by way of efficacy and merit, but not as the thing there fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured; which the Scripture tels us not to be the blood of Christ, but the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so I come to my other <hi>Quaere.</hi> From what property or use of <hi>water,</hi> the washing therewith is a Sacrament of our new birth; for so it is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the <hi>washing of regeneration;</hi> and our Saviour sayes to <hi>Nicodemus, Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> For in every Sacrament there is some analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is outwardly done, and what is thereby signified: therefore in this. But what should it be? It is a thing of some moment, and yet in the tractates of this mystery, but little or seldom enquired after; and therefore deserves the more consideration. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; this analogy between the <hi>washing</hi> with water, and <hi>regeneration</hi> lies in that custome of washing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from the pollutions of the womb, when they are first born; for this is the first office done unto them when they come out of the womb, if they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to nourish and bring them up. As therefore in our naturall birth, the body is washt with <hi>water</hi> from the pollutions wherewith it comes besmeared out
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101070:99"/>
of the matrix; so in our second birth from above, the soul is purified by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> from the guilt and pollution of sin, to begin a new life to God-ward.</p>
                     <p>The analogy you see is apt and proper, if that be true of the custome, whereof there is no cause to make question. For the use at present, any man, I think, knows how to inform himself: For that of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times, I can produce two pregnant and notable testimonies; one of the Jews and people of God; another of the Gentiles. The first you shall finde <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. where God describes the poor and forlorn condition of Jerusalem, when he first took her to himself, under the parable of an exposed Infant; <hi>As for thy nativity,</hi> saith he, <hi>in the day thou wast born,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>thy navell was not cut, neither was thou washed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at all: None eye pitied thee, to do any of these things unto thee, to have compassion on thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy person in the day that thou wast born.</hi> Here you may learn what was wont to be done unto infants at their nativity, by that which was not done to <hi>Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> till God himself took pity on her, cutting off the navell string, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, salting, swadling: upon this place S. <hi>Hierome</hi> takes notice (but scarce any body else, that I can yet finde) that our Saviour, where speaking of <hi>Baptism,</hi> he says, <hi>Except a man be born of water &amp; the Spirit, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> alludes to the custom here mentioned of washing Infants at their nativity.</p>
                     <p>The other testimony (and that most pertinent to the application we make) I finde in a story related by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his <hi>Quaestiones Romanae,</hi> not far from the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101070:100"/>
beginning, in this manner: Among the Greeks, if one that were living were reported to be dead, and fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obsequies performed for him, if afterward he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned alive, he was of all men abominated, as a pro phane and unlucky person; no man would come into his company, and (which was the highest degree of calamity) they excluded him from their Temples and the Sacrifices of their gods: It chanced that one <hi>Aristinus</hi> being faln into such a disaster, &amp; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way to expiate himself therefrom, sent to the Oracle at <hi>Delphos,</hi> to <hi>Apollo,</hi> beseeching him to shew him the means whereby he might be freed and discharged thereof. <hi>Pythia</hi> gave him this answer,

                     <p>Hence the Jews before <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, were wont by this rite to initiate such, as they made <hi>Proselytes,</hi> (to wit) as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming infants again, and entring into a new life and being, which before they had not.

                     <p>But this is no great matter of difficulty, that which follows is; namely, how this <hi>Oak, or Oaken-holt</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> is said here in my Text to have been <hi>in</hi> (for the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) or <hi>by the Sanctuary of the Lord.</hi> For how comes the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of the Lord to be at <hi>Sichem,</hi> when as the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the <hi>Ark of the Testimony</hi> were at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> there set up by <hi>Ioshuah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so remained (as the Scripture elswhere tels us) untill the time of the Captivity of the Land; which without doubt was not till after <hi>Ioshuah</hi> was dead and buried: and is usually understood of that time, when the Ark was taken captive by the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims. And yet is not onely here a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at <hi>Sichem,</hi> but in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Elders and Officers of the Tribes are said, upon <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> summons, to have <hi>presented themselves there before the Lord,</hi> which speech useth to imply as much.</p>
                     <p>If we say, the Ark of God was taken out of its place at <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and brought to <hi>Sichem</hi> by the Levites, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion of this generall Assembly, yet the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will not be removed: For first, how could the

                        <note place="margin">Deut 16. 21</note> 
                        <hi>plant a Grove of any trees,</hi> (or any tree) <hi>neer unto the Altar of thy God, which thou shalt make thee; Neither shalt thou set up a pillar, which the Lord thy God hateth;</hi> when as here are both, an <hi>Oak</hi> or <hi>Quercetum,</hi> in the Sanctuary of God, and a <hi>Pillar</hi> or <hi>Statue</hi> erected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> whatsoever it was, must be something which had a constant and fixed station, and was not temporary or mutable; because the <hi>Oak,</hi> under which this pillar was erected by <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> is here designed and appointed out by it, as by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and standing mark: else to what purpose had it been to sign out the <hi>Oak</hi> by it, if it were such as would be here to day and not to morrow? For these reasons it appears that this <hi>Sanctuary</hi> could not be the Tabernacle, where the Ark and Altar for Israel were, but that it was somthing else: And what that should be, is to be enquired.</p>
                     <p>I answer, it was a <hi>Proseucha,</hi> or praying place, which the Israelites (at least those of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> in whose lot it was) after the Country was subdued unto them, had erected in that very place at <hi>Sichem,</hi> where God first appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and where he built his first Altar, after he was come into the Land of Canaan; The place where God said unto him, <hi>Vnto thy seed will I give this Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the understanding whereof, you must take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Jews besides their <hi>Tabernacle</hi> or <hi>Temple,</hi>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:101070:103"/>
which was the onely place for sacrifice, had first or last two sorts of <hi>places</hi> for religious duties: The one called <hi>Proseuchae;</hi> the other <hi>Synagogues:</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between which was this; <hi>Proseucha</hi> was a plot of ground, encompassed with a wall, or some other like mound or enclosure, and open above, much like to our Courts: the use properly for <hi>prayer,</hi> as the name <hi>Proseucha</hi> importeth: A <hi>Synagogue</hi> was <hi>aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium tectum,</hi> a covered edifice, as our houses and Churches are, where the Law and Prophets were read and expounded, and the people instructed in divine matters; according to that <hi>Acts 15. 21. Moses of old time hath in every City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.</hi> From whence also ye may gather, that <hi>Synagogues</hi> were within the Cities, as <hi>Proseucha's</hi> were without; which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference between them, as you shall hear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Proseucha's</hi> were such places as I have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them to be, I prove out of a notable place of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius,</hi> a Jew bred and born in Palestine; who in his Tract against the Messalian Heretiques, after he hath told us that the <hi>Messaliam</hi> built themselves cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houses, or large places, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>These <hi>Proseucha's</hi> of the Jews, both name and thing, were not unknown to the Poet <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> when describing in his third Satyr, in what manner proud and insolent fellows in the City of Rome, used in their drunken humours, to abuse and quarrell with those they met in the streets, in the night time, whom they took to be of mean estate and condition, he brings them in speaking thus: <hi>Ede ubi consistas; in quâ te quaero Proseuchâ?</hi> where dwell you? in what <hi>Proseucha</hi> should I seek or enquire for you? intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he was some poor fellow, either that dwelt in an house that could not keep out wind and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101070:104"/>
but was like a Jews <hi>Proseucha,</hi> all open above; or he alludes to the banishment of the Jews out of Rome, by <hi>Domitian,</hi> in his own time, and then fresh, as who had no where else to bestow themselves, but in their <hi>Proseucha's</hi> out of the City, or who used to assemble in the <hi>Proseucha's;</hi> according to some of these senses is <hi>Iuvenall</hi> to be understood.</p>
                     <p>For that the Jews had <hi>Proseucha's</hi> about the City of Rome, appears by <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> in his <hi>De legatione ad Calum;</hi> where commending the clemency and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> he saith, <gap reason="foreign">

made unto God; and why should it not be as likely, that our Saviour might sometimes pray in their <hi>Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eucha's,</hi> as teach in their Synagogues?</p>
                     <p>Thus we have seen the testimonies for <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> their use and difference from <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Now for <hi>Synagogues,</hi> the common opinion is, that they were not before the Captivity of Babylon; and that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity first taught the Jews the use of them in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity, which afterward they brought with them at their return into their own Country. The reason why men so think, is, I suppose, the absolute silence of them in Scripture, untill the time of the second Temple; but though the name were not, it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible the thing might be: howsoever, because it is most received, that they were not, we will let it passe for currant. But as for <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> such as we have described them, none, that I know, have affirmed or determined ought of their antiquity; it may be, not taken it into consideration, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had no occasion to think of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or because they confounded them altogether with <hi>Synagogues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The matter therefore being free and undecided, I will make bold to affirm, that if <hi>Synagogues</hi> were not, yet <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> that is, open places for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were a long time before the Captivity, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the dayes of <hi>Ioshuah</hi> the son of <hi>Nun.</hi> And though the Jews had, or were to have but one Altar, or place of Sacrifice, that namely, which the Lord should choose, to place the Ark of his Covenant there, the Tabernacle or Temple; yet had they other places for devotion, and religious use. And that this
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101070:105"/>
                        <hi>Sanctuary of God</hi> here mentioned in my Text at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> (which was a Leviticall City) was such a one; my reasons are these; First, because it is incredible, that the Israelites, having but one Temple for the whole Nation, whereat they were bound to appear, and those the males onely, but thrice a year, should have no other places of <hi>prayer</hi> nearer their dwellings, whither they might resort on Sabbath dayes, the Temple or Tabernacle being from some of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred miles distant at the least. Secondly, because (as I have already shewed) this <hi>sanctuary at Sichem</hi> could not be the Tabernacle, which was then at Shiloh, not at Sichem, and yet must have some stable and fixed place, because the situation of the <hi>Oak</hi> is designed by it: yea, must have been still there, when this story of <hi>Ioshuah</hi> was written; which is thought to have been long after his death: surely this Chapter was written after it, where both his death and buriall are recorded: wherefore to say the Ark was brought thither upon this occasion, will not serve turn. Thirdly, this place should be a <hi>Proseucha,</hi> because of that circumstance of trees growing in it; which, as it proves it not to have been the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, (where no such thing was lawfull to be) so seems it to be a Characteristicall note of a <hi>Proseucha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For though it were not lawfull to have trees near the Altar of God, that is, in or about the Court of the Tabernacle; Yet was it not so with <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> yea they seem to have been ordinarily garnished and beset with them. This may be gathered from a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> where relating the barbarous outrage of the Gentiles at Alexandria, against the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101070:106"/>

                     <p>The same is implied by that of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> speaking of a Jewish Wizard or Fortune-teller,—<hi>conducta sub arbore conjux.</hi> And again in his sixth Satyre,

It is said indeed that the Ark of the Covenant was upon that extraordinary occasion brought thither, but it being certain, out of the next Chapter, that the Tabernacle was still at Shiloh, this House of God could be none of it: Nay perhaps, we may hence learn, that when the Ark upon occasion
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101070:107"/>
of such a generall and extraordinary assembly was to be removed, they used to bring it to such places as these, which were as holy Courts, ready prepared for it, and that then it was lawfull, but not else, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in them.</p>
                     <p>Of these <hi>Courts for prayer,</hi> we may understand that also in the seventy fourth Psalm; <hi>They have cast Fire into thy Sanctuary, they have burnt up all the</hi> Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticula Dei <hi>in the Land,</hi> namely, in the Captivity by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who destroyed both their <hi>Temple,</hi> and their <hi>Proseucha's.</hi> For if we understand it of the persecution of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as some do, it must then follow, that some Canonicall Scripture was written after <hi>Malachi,</hi> and the ceasing of Prophecy, that is, in the time of <hi>Maccabees;</hi> which will not easily be granted; Besides that we reade not, that <hi>Antiochus</hi> cast any fire into the Temple.

                     <p>Secondly, we may learn from hence, that to have appropriate places, set apart for <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>Divine duties,</hi> is not a circumstance or rite proper to legall worship onely, but of a more common nature: For as much as though Sacrifice, wherein the legall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (or worship of the old Covenant) consisted, were restrained to the Ark and Tabernacle, and might not be exercised where they were not; yet were there other places for Prayer besides that; which are no more to be accounted <hi>legall places,</hi> then bare and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>prayer</hi> was a <hi>legall Dutie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, we may gather from this Description of <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> which were as Courts, encompassed onely with a wall or other like enclosure, and open above; in what manner to conceive of the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of those <hi>Altars,</hi> we reade to have been erected by the Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Genesis;</hi> namely, that the ground whereon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101070:108"/>
they stood, was fenced and bounded with some such enclosure, and shaded with trees, after the manner of <hi>Proseucha's,</hi> as we may reade expresly of one of them at Beersheba: <hi>That Abraham there planted a Grove, and called upon the Name of the Lord, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting God.</hi> Yea, when the Tabernacle and Temple were, the <hi>Altar</hi> of God stood still in an open Court, and who can beleeve that the place of those <hi>Altars</hi> of the Patriarchs were not bounded and separated from common ground? And from these patterns in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, after the Altar for Sacrifice was restrained to one onely place, the use of such open places, or Courts for prayer, garnished with trees, as I have shewed <hi>Proseucha's</hi> to have been, continued still.</p>

But in our time those who obtrude a new Discipline and Government upon the Church, altogether unknown and unheard of in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, will needs have two sorts of <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> here understood: one of such as preach the Word and Doctrine, whom they call <hi>Pastours;</hi> another of Lay-men, who were neither <hi>Priests</hi> nor <hi>Deacons,</hi> but

                     </p>
                     <p>These our Church-men call <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> and the Authors of this new device, <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> these <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> they will have meant in the first words, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>This is their exposition, and this exposition the ground and foundation of their <hi>new Discipline;</hi> but none of the Fathers, which have commented upon this Place, neither <hi>Chrysostome, Hierome, Ambrose, Theodoret, Primasius, Oecumenius,</hi> or <hi>Theophylact,</hi> (as they had no such, so) ever thought of any such <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> to be here meant; but <hi>Priests</hi> only, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred the Word and Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>But how (will you say then) is this Place to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, which may seem, as they alledge, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate two sorts of <hi>Elders,</hi> some that <hi>ruled</hi> only, others that <hi>laboured</hi> also <hi>in the Word and Doctrine?</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of our Church, who had cause, when time was, to be better versed in this question, then any others, have given divers expositions of these words; none of which give place to any such new-found. <hi>Elders,</hi> as the <hi>Fautors</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian Discipline,</hi> upon the sole Authority of this one place, have set up in divers forain Churches, and would have brought into ours.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101070:109"/>
I will relate four of the chief of these expositions, to which the rest are reducible.</p>
                     <p>The first is grounded upon the use of the participle in the Greek tongue, which is often wont to note the reason or condition of a thing, and accordingly to be resolved by a causall, or conditionall conjunction. According whereunto this Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>duplici honore digni habeantur,</hi> (or <hi>dignentur)</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is to be resolved thus; <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presbyters that rule</hi> or govern the Flock <hi>well,</hi> let them be <hi>accounted worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and that chiefly <hi>in respect,</hi> and <hi>because of their labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> And so this manner of speech will imply two duties, but not two sorts or orders of <hi>Elders,</hi> and that though this <hi>double honour</hi> be due unto them for both, yet chiefly and more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the second, their <hi>labour in the Word and Doctrine:</hi> and this way goes S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and other Greek Writers.</p>
                     <p>A second exposition is taken from the force and signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifies not simply <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to labour, but to labour with much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and toyl; for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>vexor, laboribus &amp; molestiis premor,</hi> and so properly signifies <hi>molestiam,</hi> or <hi>fatigationem ex labore.</hi> Thus the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will be; let <hi>Elders</hi> that do <hi>bene praesidere, i.</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and instruct their Flock well, <hi>be counted worthy of double honour;</hi> especially such of them as take more then ordinary pains <hi>in the Word and Doctrine:</hi> Or thus; let the <hi>Elders</hi> that discharge their office well, <hi>be, &amp;c.</hi> especially by how much the more their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and travell shall exceed in preaching <hi>the Word and Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:101070:110"/>
Thus we have seen two expositions of these words, neither of them implying two sorts of Orders of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but only distinguishing severall offices and duties of the same Order, or implying a differing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the discharge of them: But if they will by no means be perswaded, but that two sorts of <hi>Elders</hi> are here intimated, let it be so; two other expositions will yeeld them it, but so as will not be for their turn; for their <hi>Lay Elders</hi> will be none of them.</p>
                     <p>The first is this, That the Apostle should speak here of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> considering both as Members of the Ecclesiasticall Consistory or Senate, which consisted of both Orders, and in that respect might well include them both under the name of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> it being a common notion in Scripture, to call the Associates of a Court of Judicature by that name <hi>Senatus</hi> in Latin hath its name <hi>à senibus, i. senioribus,</hi> of Eldership; and is as much to say, as <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. According to this supposall, the Apostles words may have this construction: <hi>Let the Elders which rule well,</hi> whether <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Deacons, be counted worthy of double honour,</hi> but more <hi>especially</hi> the <hi>Priests</hi> who besides their government <hi>labour</hi> also <hi>in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> Now what can be opposed against such an exposition I see not. For it is not improbable, but the Apostle should make provision as well for the maintenance of <hi>Deacons,</hi> as of <hi>Priests,</hi> seeing he omits it not, of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> in the verse going next before this. But unlesse he includes them under the name of <hi>Elders,</hi> he makes no provision for them at all. Besides this is not the only place (some think) where <hi>Deacons</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the name of <hi>Elders.</hi> For the Councell
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101070:110"/>
of <hi>Hierusalem, Acts</hi> 15. where they inscribe their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodicall Epistle thus; <hi>The Apostles, Elders, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, &amp;c.</hi> may seem to comprehend the Deacons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> otherwise they should omit them, which without doubt were part of the Councell.</p>
                     <p>There is another exposition, which allows also of two sorts of <hi>Elders</hi> to be here implied, but makes them both <hi>Priests;</hi> namely, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Priests</hi> in the Apostles time, were of two sorts, one of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiaries, and such as were affixed to certain Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and so did <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, of such as had no fixed station, or charge over any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, but travelled up and down to preach the Gospel where it was not, or to confirm the Churches where it was preached already; such, as are elswhere known by the names of <hi>Euangelists</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> or <hi>Prophets:</hi> that these were those <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, spoken of here by the Apostle: that both these sorts of <hi>Presbyters</hi> were to be <hi>counted worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> as well <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as those that <hi>travelled</hi> up and down to preach the Gospel, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but especially these latter, because their pains were more then the others. This is confirmed from the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which in Scripture signifies not only corporall labour, as may appear in many places; but seems to be used by S. <hi>Paul</hi> even in this very sense we have now given, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. where he says, comparing himself with the other Apostles, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, I have <hi>travelled</hi> up and down more then they all, as is manifest he did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:101070:111"/>
These are the principall expositions given by the Writers of our Church, upon this passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the foundation and <hi>onely place</hi> whereon they build this <hi>new Consistory,</hi> and are so much in love with it. But this being capable, as you see, of such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of exposition; how much too weak and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient it is to establish any such new order of <hi>Elders</hi> never heard of in the Church from the time of the <hi>Apostles</hi> untill this last age, any man may judge.</p>
                     <p>But give me leave to propound a fifth exposition, which shall be more liberall to them then any of those yet given. For it shall yeeld them all they contend for so eagerly to be implied in this Text, namely, that there are not only two sorts of <hi>Elders</hi> here implied; but also that the one of them are <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> such as have nothing to doe with the administration of the Word and Sacraments; what would they have more? yet they will be never the nearer for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; for the <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> here implied, may be no <hi>Church Officers,</hi> but <hi>Civill Magistrates,</hi> which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture language we know are called <hi>Elders:</hi> as when we reade of the <hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> of the <hi>Elders of Iudah,</hi> of the <hi>Elders of the Priests,</hi> and <hi>Elders of the people,</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> and the like; according to such a notion the words may be construed by way of <hi>Transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus à thesi ad hypothesin,</hi> as Rhetoricians call it, to wit, in this manner; <hi>Cum omnes Seniores, sive Reipublicae, sive Ecclesiae, qui bene praesident, duplici honore dignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di sint, tum maxime Seniores Ecclesiastici, qui laborant in verbo &amp; Doctrinâ:</hi> Or thus, Let all <hi>Elders</hi> that govern well, of what sort soever, <hi>be counted worthy of double honour, especially the Elders of the Church which

labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> Is not this good sense? and doth not the Apostle in the beginning of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chapter, use the name Elder, in the larger and more generall sense, when he says, <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but exhort him as a Father, and the younger men as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Elder women as Mothers, the younger as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:</hi> why may he not then do so here? And doth not S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his last Chapter call the Ministers of the Word and Sacraments, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>? But it will be objected that this exposition is too ambitious, because it makes the Apostle to preferre the <hi>Elders of the Church</hi> before the <hi>Elders of the Common-wealth,</hi> that is, the <hi>Priest</hi> before the <hi>Civill Magistrate,</hi> when he says that all <hi>Elders,</hi> whether of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, are to be accounted worthy of double honour,</hi> so <hi>especially those Elders which labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> which are the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here know that the name of <hi>Elder</hi> is never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Scripture to the <hi>Supreme Magistrate,</hi> but to the <hi>subordinate</hi> only; and why the <hi>Ministers of the Word and Doctrine</hi> should not be <hi>accounted as worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honour,</hi> as they, or more worthy, I know not; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if S. <hi>Paul</hi> here says it; sure I am, this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not sufficient to refute my interpretation.</p>
                     <p>Thus I thought good to acquaint you how many ways this place may be expounded, without impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any such new <hi>Elders,</hi> (neither <hi>Priests</hi> nor <hi>Deacons)</hi> as they would impose upon us for <hi>Church Officers,</hi> by the sole authority thereof; for though this <hi>Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian</hi> controversy of our Church stirred up by the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101070:112"/>
admirers of the <hi>Genevian platform</hi> were in the heat before our time, yet the sect is not yet dead, but ready upon every occasion to surprise such as they finde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, or not forewarned.</p>
                     <p>And thus having informed our selves who they are, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are here termed Elders, we will now see also, what is that <hi>honour</hi> which is due unto them, which was the second thing I propounded, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>let them be accounted</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>worthy of,</hi> or deign'd <hi>double honour.</hi> That by <hi>honour</hi> here, is meant <hi>honor arium stipendium,</hi> or a tribute of maintenance, is manifest by the following words, which the Apostle brings to inforce it; <hi>For the Scripture saith,</hi> (saith he) <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corn;</hi> and, <hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire:</hi> Who sees not what these proofs infer? The first of them he alledges also in the same argument, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. where he addes, <hi>Doth God take care for Oxen?</hi> Or <hi>saith he it altogether for our sakes?</hi> (ours namely, that preach the Gospel) <hi>For our sakes no doubt this is written, that he which ploweth should plow in hope, and he that threst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in hope, should be partaker of his hope.</hi> The case is plain; It is an Hebrew notion, <hi>to bring honour,</hi> that is, to pay tribute, or bring a present, as <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to wit, the new Jerusalem. And thus much of the word <hi>Honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what is meant by <hi>double honour?</hi> Some (as among the Fathers S. <hi>Ambrose,)</hi> will have this <hi>double honour,</hi> to be <hi>honour of maintenance,</hi> and <hi>honour of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> But because the Apostles proofs here infer only <hi>maintenance;</hi> I take it to be meant in this place only of it. And as for <hi>double,</hi> there seems to be an allusion to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101070:112"/>
the right of the <hi>first-born,</hi> to whom at first the office of <hi>Priesthood</hi> belonged in their Families, and into whose room the <hi>Levites</hi> were taken, and whom the <hi>Presbyters of the Gospel</hi> now succeed. As therefore they had a <hi>double</hi> portion among their Brethren, in like manner should the <hi>Presbyters of the Gospel</hi> be counted worthy of <hi>double honour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if you will admit of that construction of these words, which I gave in the fifth place, namely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend as well the <hi>Elders of the Common-wealth,</hi> as the <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> (that both were to be accounted worthy of double honour, but especially those of the Church, who labour in the Word and Doctrine) it will agree yet far better; because both the one and the other succeed in the place of the <hi>First born;</hi> to whom belonged both to be <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Civill Governours</hi> in their Tribes and Families.</p>
                     <p>Yet howsoever the ancient Christians were wont in their Agapes or Love-Feasts, to give their <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a double</hi> portion, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, with some reference to this Text, as appears by <hi>Tertullian;</hi> neverthelesse, I think <hi>double honour</hi> is not here to be so precisely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but only to note a <hi>liberall and ingenuous mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> such as might set them above the vulgar, as the <hi>First-born</hi> by their <hi>double</hi> portion were preferred above the rest of their Brethren.</p>
                     <p>But I have not yet done with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, for from this that the Apostle here styleth the <hi>Priests</hi> mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>honour;</hi> it followeth, that the <hi>Priests</hi> mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is not to be esteemed of the nature of <hi>Almes,</hi> as some would have it, but is a <hi>Tribute</hi> of <hi>honour,</hi> such as is given by an inferiour to his superiour. For <hi>Almes</hi>
                        <pb n="216" facs="tcp:101070:113"/>
and <hi>honour, Nec bene conveniunt, nec in unâ sede moran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> the one respecting those to whom it is given, as <hi>miserable,</hi> the other, as <hi>honourable.</hi> I mean if <hi>almes</hi> be taken, as we use the word, for a work of mercy. From the same ground also it follows, that the <hi>Priests main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> is no ordinary mercenary wages, but such as is given by way of <hi>honour,</hi> as well as of <hi>reward:</hi> for such as is given to ordinary workmen is reward and wages only, and not a Testimony or Tribute of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi> But that which is due to the <hi>Priest,</hi> as you see, is <gap reason="foreign">

For as the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel are in the nature of <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> unto the people over whom they are set; so is their maintenance from them, such as is sutable to the condition and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Elder; not a common wages, which the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour often gives to his inferiour, or servant, but <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norarium,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the Feast of Pentecost, when that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hapned of the holy Ghosts descent upon the Apostles in the likenesse of Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tongues, there were present at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem (as the story a little after my Text informs us) men of severall Nations, as <hi>Parthians, Medes, Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, and dwellers in Mesopotamia, Iudaea, and Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphilia, AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and the parts of Lybia about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</hi> (or stranger-Romans) <hi>both Iews and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians;</hi> all these, upon the noyse of this strange accident came together unto the Place, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language, wherein he was born.</p>
                     <p>Many when they reade this story, suppose the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here mentioned, the most of them to have been <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and some Expositors cannot be excused from this mistake. For the more clear discerning whereof, and their better information, who may perhaps be overtaken with the same errour; I have made choyce of the words before read, for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my present discourse; which tels us in expresse terms, that these <hi>Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, these Mesopotamians, Cappadocians,</hi> &amp; the rest after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101070:114"/>
under those Nationall names, were <hi>Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,</hi> or <hi>Iews</hi> of the dispersion; <hi>Iews</hi> born in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and <hi>Media, Iews</hi> of <hi>Elam,</hi> or <hi>Persia, Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Iews,</hi> and so the rest of the Countries there na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; all of them of the Circumcision; for so saith my Text, beginning to speak of them: <hi>There were so journing,</hi> (or if you will, dwelling) <hi>at Ierusalem, Iews of every Nation under heaven;</hi> that is, of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where the <hi>Iews</hi> were dispersed.</p>
                     <p>This is yet further confirmed by S. <hi>Peters</hi> speech unto them; as when having cited the words of the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> verse the 22. he saith unto them, <hi>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Iesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, &amp;c. Him being delivered by the determinate counsell and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: Men of Israel,</hi> and such as had <hi>slain their Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> surely those were no <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Likewise when at the hearing of this, they were pricked in their hearts, he saith unto them; <hi>Repent and be Baptized, every one of you, in the Name of Iesus Christ, for the remission of sins. For the Promise is made unto you and your children, and to all that are afarre off, even as many as the Lord shall call.</hi> The Promise, saith he, is made unto you and your children; were these then any others then <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Israelites</hi> of the seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, we finde that of these <hi>Parthians, Medes, and Elamites,</hi> and of the rest named with them, there were added unto the Church by this Sermon of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> three thousand souls; But it is certain that <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Centurion was the first <hi>Gentile</hi> that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto the Faith; Therefore these first Converts
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101070:114"/>
were no <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Perhaps you will say, they were <hi>Proselytes</hi> of these severall Nations, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iews.</hi> I say, not so neither; because <hi>Proselytes</hi> are by name rehearsed among them, when it is said of those <hi>Romani advenae,</hi> (verse the tenth) that they were <hi>Iews and Proselytes; Ergo,</hi> the rest were <hi>Iews</hi> by race, and not by Religion onely. But what need I to have heaped together all these proofs, when my Text alone is sufficient to evince it?</p>
                     <p>I come now therefore to a more particular illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, according to what I have thus in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall premised. And first, for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Next for the persons here specified, <hi>Iews out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation under heaven;</hi> for the right understanding thereof we are to know that before the last dispersion of the <hi>Iews</hi> by the Romans, after their Temple and City were destroyed by <hi>Titus</hi> (which at the time of this story was not, nor many years after it) there had been already two Captivities, and great dispersions of that Nation, besides some smaller scatterings: The <hi>first</hi> was of the ten Tribes, by <hi>Salmanassar</hi> King of Assyria, who is said to have planted them <hi>in Hala, and Habor, by the river of Gozan, and in the Cities of the Medes;</hi> and these never (I mean any considerable part of them) returned to dwell again in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; of these therefore we are (chiefly) to understand, to have been those which the story here cals <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Medes, and Elamites;</hi> Elamites, that is, Persians of the Province of Elymais. For in those Countries which these names comprehend, were the ten Tribes placed by the Assyrian, and there still dwelt or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, in our Saviour and his Apostles time, and long after. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon those words in the third of <hi>Ioel, Et Filios Iuda &amp; Filios Ierusalem vendidistis Filits Graecorum,</hi> (which he understands of the Captivity by <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus)</hi> tels us thus much; <hi>Filit</hi> (saith he) <hi>Iuda &amp; Ierusalem, nequaquam Israel &amp; decem Tribuum, qui usque hodie in Medorum urbibus &amp; montibus habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</hi> The <hi>second</hi> Captivity was by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of Babylon, of the two Tribes, Judah and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, more then a hundred years after that of the ten.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is that I had to speak for the illustration of this Story, and Text: out of which besides the right understanding of Scripture, whereto it conduceth, you may observe these four things: First, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and providence of Almighty God, in so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first publication of the Gospel, that the fame thereof, and of that convincing miracle, which gave authority thereunto, might be carried unto <hi>all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:101070:117"/>
by so many both ear and eye-witnesses of the same as these Jews were.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a probable reason why the <hi>Apostles</hi> were so ignorant at the first, as they seem to have been, that the Gospel was to be peached unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> notwithstanding our Saviours Commission unto them; <hi>Go preach this Gospel unto all Nations.</hi> For it may be, they thought this command might be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in preaching the Gospel to those of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision onely, which were <hi>of every Nation under heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Elogium</hi> here given to those who made conscience (as we speak) or Religion, to come unto the House of God to worship; they were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the blessed opportunities and means for salvation which they meet with, which come thither to worship. For had these <hi>Iews</hi> staid at home, as the rest of their brethren did, they had not bin partakers of such a blessing; nor witnesses of so wonderfull a miracle for confirmation of their faith, as now they were.</p>

                        </gap> in this notion? For though prophane Authors do so, yet the Scriptures meaning, both here and elswhere, is to be measured by its own Dialect.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the onely word for <hi>good tidings,</hi> signifies also <hi>Praemium boni nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii;</hi> Yea, being not above five times found in the Old Testament, some will have it thrice taken in that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and twice will be easily yeelded them.

                     <p>Thus you see, this notion was familiar to all the Languages that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was brought up in. Why should it then be improbable, he should use it when he had occasion?

                     <p>The matter stands thus; S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he received no reward at the hands of the Corinthians for his pains in making known the glad tidings of salvation unto them, but did it <hi>gratis</hi> to them-ward: yet he looked for an <gap reason="foreign">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the Creation of the world, when God laid the foundations of the earth, and stretched out his line thereon, <hi>the stars in the morning</hi> (as God himself describes it <hi>Iob 38. 7.) sang together, and all the sons of God</hi> (that is, the holy Angels) <hi>shouted for joy.</hi> This in my Text is so like it, that a man would think some new Creation were in hand;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101070:126"/>
nor were it much wide of truth to affirm it: for if ever there were a day wherein the Almighty Power, the incomparable Wisdom, the wonderfull Goodness of God again the second time appeared, as it did at the worlds Creation, it was this day, whereof S. <hi>Luke</hi> our Euangelist now treateth; when the Son of God took upon him our flesh, and was born of a Virgin, to repair the breach between God and man, and make all things new. The news of which restauration was no sooner heard and made known to the Shepheards by an Angel sent from heaven, but suddenly the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Host descended from their celestiall mansions, and sung this Carol of joy; <hi>Glory be to God on high, welcome peace on earth, good-will towards men.</hi> A Song renowned both for the singularity of the first exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (for untill this time, unlesse it were once in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Vision, we shall not finde a Song of Angels heard by men in all the Scripture) and from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church, who afterward took it up in her Liturgy, and hath continued the singing thereof ever since the days of the Apostles untill these of ours. Yet perhaps it is not so commonly understood, as usually said or chaunted, and therefore will be worth our labour to inquire into the meaning thereof, and hear such instructions as may be learned therefrom. Which that we may the better do, I will consider first the Singers or Chaunters, <hi>The heavenly Host:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Caroll or Hymne it self, <hi>Gloria in excelsis Deo: Glory be to God on high, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the first, the heavenly host here spoken of, is an Army of holy Angels: For <hi>the Host of Heaven</hi> in the language of Scripture is twofold, Visible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101070:126"/>
The Visible Host are the Stars, which stand in their array like an Army, <hi>Deut. 4. 19. Lest thou lift up thine eies</hi> (saith the Lord there) <hi>unto heaven, and when thou seest the Sun, Moon, and Stars, even all the Host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship and serve them.</hi> The Invisible Host are the Angels, the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Guard; according to that of <hi>Micaiah, 1 King. 22. 19. I saw the Lord sitting upon his Throne, and all the Host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left.</hi> So <hi>Psal. 103. Blesse the Lord ye his Angels, that excell in strength, that do his Commandements. Blesse the Lord all ye his Hosts, ye ministers of his that do his pleasure:</hi> Where the latter words do but vary that which is expressed in the former. From this it is that the Lord Jehovah, the true and only God, is so often styled the Lord or God of <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> or of <hi>Hosts,</hi> that is, King both of Stars and Angels: according to that <hi>Nehem. 9. Thou art God alone;—and the Host of Heaven worshippeth thee.</hi> By which Title He is distinguished from the Gods of the Nations, who were some of the Host, to wit, of the Stars or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but none of them <hi>the Lord of Hosts</hi> himself. For the same reason, and with the same meaning and sense, in the Books written after the Captivity, he is styled <hi>Deus coeli, the God of heaven,</hi> as in <hi>Ezra, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, Daniel;</hi> in which Books, together with the last of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the title of <hi>Deus Sabaoth</hi> is not to be found, but the title of <hi>Deus Coeli</hi> only, and as may seem taken up for some reason in stead of the other.</p>
                     <p>But to return to what we have in hand: It was the Angelicall Host, as ye hear, who sang this Song of
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101070:127"/>
joy and praise unto the most High God. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? For any restitution or addition of happinesse to themselves? No; but for Peace on Earth, and Good-will towards men. He that was now born took not upon him the Nature of Angels, but of men: He came not into the world to save Angels, but for the salvation of men. Nor was the state of Angels to receive advancement in glory by his comming, but the state of men; and that too in such a sort as might seem to impeach the dignity, and dimme the lustre of those excellent creatures, when an inferiour nature, the nature of man, was now to be advanced into a Throne of Divine Majesty, and to become Head and King not only of men, but of the heavenly Host it self. O ye blessed Angels! what did these tidings concern you, that ruined mankinde should be restored again and taken into favour; whereas those of your own Host, which fell likewise, remained still in that gulf of perdition, whereinto their sin had plunged them, without hope of mercy or like promise of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance? what did it adde to your eminent Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the most excellent of the creatures of God, that the Nature of man should be advanced above yours? that <hi>at the Name of Iesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Observation therefore which this Act of the Angels first presents unto us, is the ingenuous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sweet disposition of those immaculate and blessed spirits, in whose bosomes Envy, the Image of the Devil and deadly poison of charity, hath no place at all: For if any inclination to this cankered passion
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101070:127"/>
had been in these heavenly creatures, never such an occasion offered, nor greater could be, to stir it up to envy. But heaven admits of no such passion, nor could such a torment consist with the blissefull condition of those who dwell therein. It is the smoke of that bottomlesse pit, a native of hell, the character and cognisance of those Apostate Angels, <hi>which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, and are reserved for chains of everlasting darknesse.</hi> These in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed grieve no lesse at the happinesse of men then the Angels joy; witnesse the name of their Prince Satan, which signifies the Fiend, or malicious one, who out of envy overthrew mankinde in the beginning; out of envy he and all his fellow-fiends are so restlesse and indefatigable to seduce him still.</p>
                     <p>The Use of this Observation will not be far to seek, if we remember the admonition our Saviour hath given us in the prayer left unto his Church; which is, To make the Angels the pattern of our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in doing the will of our heavenly Father; for so he teacheth us to pray, <hi>Let thy will be done in earth, as it is done in heaven;</hi> that is, Grant us ô Lord to do thy will here, as thy holy Angels do it there. And as we should imitate them in all things else; so in this affection towards the happinesse and prosperity of others. And good reason I think, if we mean at all to approve our selves unto God our Father, why we should endeavour rather to be like unto them, then unto Devils: But in nothing can we be more like them, then in this, to rejoyce at the good, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at the happinesse of our brethren: <hi>Hoc enim An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicum est;</hi> This is the Character of the Angelicall
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101070:128"/>
nature, and consequently of those, who one day shall have fellowship with them. To be contrarily affected <hi>Diabolicum est,</hi> the badge and brand of Devils and Fiends; and those who wear their Livery, reason good they should keep them company. Let every one therefore examine his own heart concerning this point, that he may learn upon what terms he stands with God, and what he may promise himself of the blessednesse to come. Do the gifts of God? Doth his favour or blessing vouchsafed to thy brother, when thou seest or hearest of them, torment and crucifie thy soul? Dost thou make their happinesse thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery? Is thine eye evill to thy Brother, because Gods is good? If this be so, without doubt thy heart is not right before God; nor doth his Spirit, but the spirit of Devils or Fiends reign therein. But if the contrary appear in any reasonable measure, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to increase it; (for we must not look to attain the perfection of Angels in this life, but in some measure and degree only) if thou canst rejoyce at anothers good, though it concerns not thy self; the Spirit of God rests upon thee: <hi>For emulations and envyings</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 5.) are the fruits of the flesh, but the fruits of the Spirit are</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and goodnesse:</hi> So he cals the opposite vertues to those former vices.</p>
                     <p>But as any good that betides our brother ought to affect us with some degree of joy, and not with grief and envy; so chiefly, and most of all his spirituall good, and that which concerns his salvation, ought so to do. This was that the holy Angels praised God for in my Text, on the behalf of men; that unto them
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101070:128"/>
a Saviour was born, who should save them from their sins, and reconcile them unto God. Which sweet disposition of those good and blessed spirits our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself further witnesseth, when he saith, <hi>(Luk. 15. 17.) There is joy in heaven</hi> (namely, among the holy Angels) <hi>for one sinner that repenteth.</hi> But is there any man, will you say, such a son of Beliall, as will not do this, will not imitate the holy Angels in this? Judge ye: There is an evil disease which commonly attends upon Sects and Differences in opinion: that as men are curious and inquisitive into the lives and actions of the adverse party; so are they willing to finde them faulty, and rejoyce at their fals and slips, hear and relate them with delight; namely, because they suppose it makes much for their own side, that the contrary should by such means be scandalized, and the Patrons and followers thereof disreputed. But should that be the matter of our grief, whereat the Angels joy; or that the matter of our joy, whereat the Angels grieve? How is this to do our Fathers will on earth, as the Angels do in heaven? Nay, if this be not to put on the robes of darknesse, and to shake hands with hellish fiends, I know not what is. <hi>O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another Lesson yet more to be learned from this act of the Angels; namely, that if they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God for our happinesse, and the favour of God towards us in Christ, much more should we glorifie and magnifie his goodnesse our selves, to whom sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Birth, and the benefit of this Birth redounds. If they sing, <hi>Glory be to God on high,</hi> for his favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101070:129"/>
men; we to whom such favour is shown, must not hold our peace; for shall they for us, and not we for our selves? No, the Quire of heaven did but set us in, we are to bear a part, and it should be a chief part, since the best part is ours. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church in her publick Service, hath ever since kept it up: so must every one of us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, never let it goe down or dye on our hands.</p>
                     <p>Thus much of the Quaere; Now come we to the Antheme or Song it self: whose contents are two; First, the Doxology or Praise; <hi>Glory be to God on high.</hi> Secondly, a gratulation rendring the reason thereof; Because of <hi>Peace on earth, Good will towards men.</hi> For the conjunction <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is not to bee taken here for a copulative, but as <hi>Vau</hi> is frequently in the <note place="margin">Ita Zonar. ad c. 74. Trullan.</note> Hebrew, for a conjunction causall, or for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Glory to God in the highest;</hi> for that there is <hi>Peace on earth, Good-will towards men.</hi> Or if we retain the copulative sense, yet we must understand the words following as spoken by way of gratulation: <hi>Glory be to God on high,</hi> and <hi>welcome peace on earth, good-will towards men.</hi> Or both causally and gratulatorily thus, <hi>Glory be to God in the highest; for</hi> (ô factum bene!) <hi>there is peace on earth, and good-will towards men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To begin with the first, the Doxology or praise; <hi>Glory be to God in the Highest:</hi> that is, Let the Angels glorifie him, who dwels on high: for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is to be referred to Glory, and not to God; the sense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, glorified be God by those on high; and not God, who dwels on high, be glorified. This may appear by the like expression in the 148. <hi>Psalm,</hi> whence this Glorification seems to be borrowed: <hi>Praise ye the

                     <p>To tell you every signification of the word <hi>Glory</hi> in Scripture, might perhaps distract the hearer, but would inform him little. Nor will it be to purpose to reckon up every signification it hath, when it is spoken of God: I will therefore name only the two principall ones: And first, <hi>Glory</hi> when it is referred to God, often signifies the Divine Presence, or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as in this Chapter, a little before my Text, when it is said, <hi>The Glory of the Lord shone round about the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, and they were sore afraid.</hi> But this is not the signification in my Text, but another which I shall now tell you. For <hi>Glory</hi> besides signifies in Scripture the high and glorious Supereminency or Majesty of God, which consisteth in his threefold Supremacy of Power, of Wisdome, and of Goodnesse. And as words of eminency and dignity with us (as Majesty, Highnesse, Honour, Worship) are used for the persons themselves to whom such Dignity belongeth, (as when we say, His Majesty, his Highnesse, his Honour, his Worship:) so in the Scripture, and among the Hebrews, <hi>His Glory,</hi> or the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> is used to note the Divine Essence, or Deity it self. As in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101070:130"/>
2 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. There came a voice</hi> (saith S. <hi>Peter) from the excellent Glory;</hi> (that is, from God the Father) <hi>This is my welbeloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Rom.</hi> 1. The Gentiles are said to have <hi>changed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the incorruptible God,</hi> into the likenesse of things corruptible. As it is said (in the 106. <hi>Psal. ver.</hi> 20.) of the Israelites in the Wildernesse, <hi>That they changed their Glory into the similitude of an Oxe that eateth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>grasse.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn cap.</hi> 1. 14. of his Gospel says of the Son, <hi>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God.</hi> According to which sense he is called <hi>Heb. 1. The brightnesse of his Fathers glory, and the expresse Image of his person;</hi> where the latter words are an exposition of the former, <hi>Image</hi> expounding <hi>brightnesse,</hi> and <hi>person</hi> or substance expounding <hi>glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If Glory therefore signifie the Divine Majesty or Greatnesse; to glorifie or give glory unto God is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but to acknowledge this Majesty or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of His; namely, his supereminent Power, his Wisdom, and Goodnesse: for in the peerlesse super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency of these three, (under which all his other Attributes are comprehended) his glorious Majesty consisteth. Take this withall; That all the religious service and worship we give unto God, (whether we praise him, pray, or give thanks unto him) is nothing else but the acknowledging of this <hi>glory,</hi> either in deed or word; namely, by confessing it, or doing some act whereby we acknowledge it. To come to particulars: By our Faith we confesse his Wisdome and Truth; by our thanksgiving, his Goodnesse and Mercy: when we pray, we acknowledge his Power and Dominion;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101070:130"/>
and therefore the form of prayer our Saviour taught us, concludes, <hi>For thine is the kingdome, power, and glory.</hi> In praise we confesse all these or any of them, according to that in the Hymne of the Church, <hi>Te Deum laudamus, Te Dominum confitemur; We praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.</hi> All which is evident by those forms of glorification set down in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which are nothing else but expresse and particular acknowledgements of the greatnesse or Majesty of God, and his peerlesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives. When the four Wights are said <hi>to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven glory, honour and thanks to him that sate upon the Throne:</hi> what was their Ditty but this? <hi>Thou art worthy, ô Lord, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</hi> When the Lamb opened the book with 7. Seals, the Wights, the Elders, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature in heaven, in earth, and under the earth, sung, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb to receive power, and riches, and strength, and honour, and blessing.</hi> And again; <hi>Blessing, honour, glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi> In which we may observe the whole glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to consist in the acknowledgement of these three soveraign prerogatives of the Divine Majesty, his Power, his Wisdome, his Goodnesse: The two first, Power and Wisdom, are expresse; and Riches and Strength belong to Power: The third is contained in <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Origen</hi> did too in the Greek Originals if we had them to look into. But the Latine Translators
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101070:132"/>
thought not fit to alter the words of the Hymne so ordinarily sung in the Liturgy, and so expressed it in Latine, as the Latine Church used. And for the meaning, I beleeve the Vulgar Latine aim'd at no other sense, then what the Greek implies; namely, that this Peace was no earthly peace, but the peace of Gods good-will to man, referring the Genitive Case <hi>voluntatis,</hi> not to <hi>hominibus,</hi> but to <hi>pax. Pax in terris:</hi> what <hi>pax? Pax bonae voluntatis hominibus.</hi> That which makes me think so is, because <hi>Origen</hi> and his Translator, in the place <hi>Beza</hi> quotes for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, expresly expounds it so. And so there will not be a pin to choose; save that the Greek expresseth this sense by way of Apposition more naturally; the Latine by way of Rection, somwhat harshly; and yet perhaps the Translatour thought, lesse ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>

                        </gap>, is the <hi>peace on earth,</hi> the Angels gratulate; namely, the reconciliation of God to men in Christ: For by reason of Sin, heaven and earth, God and man were till now at enmity: but by Christ this enmity is taken away, and man, by the forgivenesse of his sin, restored unto peace and favour with God. And as by this Nativity God and man became one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so by this conjunction Heaven and earth, Angels and men, become one Fellowship, one City and Kingdome of God: the Kingdome of Satan, that Prince of the powers of the Aire, who by reason of sin had captivated, and brought under his service the whole Earth, and thereby held the same at open
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101070:132"/>
war and enmity with Heaven, being now by degrees to be destroyed and rooted out. And this is that admirable mystery of our Redemption by Christ, which the Angelicall Host here gratulates, by the name of <hi>Peace on earth, and good-will towards men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that we may not doubt, but we have hit the meaning, that this <hi>peace on earth,</hi> is Gods good-will  to men, and therefore expounded by it; besides that in the Old <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Num. 6. 27. Judg. 6. 24. Psal. 85. 7. &amp;c. Cant. 8. 10. Jer. 16. 15. 29. 11.</note> Testament <hi>peace</hi> is often taken for Gods favour and mercy to men; (as in that of <hi>Isay 54. 10. The mountains shall depart, and the hils be removed, but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.)</hi> So if we examine the Use thereof in the New Testament, we shall finde it in speciall applied to this our Reconciliation to God in Christ by remission of sin. S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius Act.</hi> 10. describes the Gospel thus, <hi>The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Iesus Christ.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, Col. 1. It pleased God the Father, that in Christ all fulnesse should dwell. And (having made peace through the bloud of his Crosse) by him to reconcile all things unto himself.</hi> What can be plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then this? The same, as I take it, he means <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. when he tels us, <hi>That Christ came to preach peace both to those that were afarre off, and to them that were nigh;</hi> that is, both to Jew and Gentile. But what peace? namely, that <hi>through him, we both might have accesse by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> Hence the Gospel is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Gospel of peace;</hi> and God so often in the New Testament, <hi>the God of peace;</hi> that is, of reconcilement and favour: and the Euangelicall salutation is,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101070:133"/>
                        <hi>Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The meaning of this Angelicall gratulation being thus cleared, let us see now what may be learned and observed therefrom. Where my first Observation shall be this: S. <hi>Peter</hi> tels <hi>Cornelius, That to Christ give all the Prophets witnesse, that through his name, whosoever beleeveth in him, shall receive remission of sins.</hi> Our Saviour after his Resurrection, expounding the Scriptures to his Apostles sayes, the same, <hi>Luke 24. 47. Thus it is written</hi> (saith he) <hi>and thus it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that remission of sins should be preached in his Name among the Nations.</hi> But where is this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of remission of sins by Christ written? for in those formall words we shall hardly finde it. Let us take here the Angels key, and we shall: for they tell us that <hi>peace on earth</hi> is this good-will towards men. Now do not the Prophets speak of some peace on earth, which Messiah should bring with him when he comes? yes surely: well then, let us look for this publication of remission of sins under that name, and we shall finde it, <hi>Isay 9. 6. Vnto us a Childe is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Counsellor, the mighty God, the Father of eternity, the Prince of peace,</hi> that is, of peace not between men and men, but between God and men) <hi>and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of his government and peace shall be no end.</hi> Isay 52. 7. <hi>How beautifull upon the mountains, are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101070:133"/>
that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth:</hi> which place S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. 15. interprets of the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel of Christ. <hi>Esay 53. 5. The chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him;</hi> that is, he suffered for the remission of our sins. <hi>Is.</hi> 57. 19. quoted by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>Peace to him that is afarre off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord, and I will heal him.</hi> Ezek. 34. 24, 25. <hi>I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David</hi> (King <hi>Messiah) a Prince among them.—And I will make a Covenant of peace with them.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 37. 26. Hag. 2. 9. <hi>The glory of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter house shall be greater then of the former, saith the Lord of Hosts; and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts. Zech. 9. 10. Shout ô daughter of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem; behold, thy King commeth unto thee,—and he shall speak peace unto the Heathen, and his Dominion shall be from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the end of the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much of the Use to be made of the Angels expression in this heavenly Carol: Now I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to your consideration another, and that taken from the argument it self; namely, that if Almighty God, our heavenly Father, be so graciously disposed to us-ward, as to be reconciled unto us, by forgiving us our trespasses: then ought we semblably to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to our brethren and forgive them their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, when they have wronged or offended us. <hi>Leo Serm. 6. de Nativit. Natalis Domini, natalis est pacis, ergo singuli fideles offerant Patri pacificorum concordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am filiorum.</hi> The Illation is good; we have the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apostle S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to back it; 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. 10. God</hi> (saith he) <hi>so loved us, that he sent his Son to be the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101070:134"/>
propitiation for our sins.</hi> What follows? <hi>Beloved,</hi> (saith he) <hi>if God so loved us, we ought to love end ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So I say, if God be so gracious, to forgive and be reconciled to us, we ought as it were, to eccho this his loving kindnesse, and to forgive, and be reconciled one to another.</p>
                     <p>This congruity and semblablenesse of our actions and affections one towards another, with Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and mercy towards us, is the Rule and Reason not only of this, but of many other duties he requires at our hands. Thus the Jews were every seventh year to manumise their servants, as an act of congruity and thankfulnesse to God, who had delivered them, when they were servants, out of the land of Egypt, and house of bondage. They were bidden to use a stranger kindly, because themselves had been stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and God when they were oppressed, had been compassionate and kinde towards them, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them from their thraldome. Likewise we reade in the Gospel, <hi>Luk. 8. 36. Be ye mercifull, as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is mercifull:</hi> And <hi>Matth. 5. Blessed are the mercifull for they shall obtain mercy.</hi> In a word, God hath revealed, he will shew mercy to none, but such as appear before him with this congruity. <hi>Iames 2. 13. He shall have judgement without mercy, that sheweth no mercy:</hi> and therefore the tenor of our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at the last judgement runs, <hi>Come ye blessed,</hi> and be partakers of mercy, because ye have shewed it: But, <hi>Goe ye cursed</hi> without all mercy into Hell fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye have shewed no mercy.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see how God requires this congruity in generall: and as for the particular of reconcilement
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101070:134"/>
and forgiving our brother, it is written in capitall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and urged in such sort as it might not unfitly be termed the Livery of Christianity. In so much that if we consider it duly, it cannot but breed astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the evidence and necessity should be so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and the practice among those who look for the benefit of Christ and call upon his Name, so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded: when as I dare boldly pronounce, there is no remission of sins to be looked for at the hands of God without it.</p>
                     <p>An invincible argument whereof is, That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself, in the prayer he hath taught his Church, hath put in a barre against asking it, but upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us.</hi> If we ask not with this dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is no promise that any such prayer shall be heard: nay, our Saviour tels us in plain terms, it shall not: <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>you forgive not men their trespasses, no more will your heavenly Father forgive you your tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</hi> How then can any man whose heart is fraught with malice, and meditates revenge against his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hear this and not tremble? Is it not a fearfull thing for a man to carry in his own bosome, not only an evidence that his sins are unpardoned, but a barre too, that he cannot ask the forgivenesse of them? Let no man deceive himself: <hi>Etsi enim multis bonis conscientiis abundemus,</hi> saith S. <hi>Chrysostome, reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione tamen contemptâ, nullum possumus promereri sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi> As the fifth Commandement is called by the Apostle the <hi>first Commandement of promise,</hi> so is this petition for forgivenesse of sins, the only petition with condition: and such a condition too, as our Saviour
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101070:135"/>
dwels upon and enforces, when he had delivered this form of prayer to his Disciples: For he passes by all the rest of the petitions, and singles out this alone to comment upon, as that wherein the chiefest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay, and without which all our prayer would be uneffectuall, and to no purpose.</p>
                     <p>A further confirmation of which we have in that parable of <hi>Servus nequam, Matth.</hi> 18. whom his Lord being moved with compassion, when he besought him, forgave a debt of ten thousand Talents: But he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one of his fellow-servants which ought him an hundred pence, though he fell at his feet and besought him, yet would not hear him, but cast him into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Then his Lord was wroth, and said, O thou wicked servant! shouldst not thou have had compassion on thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low servant, even as I had pity upon thee? And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him unto the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.</hi> The Application is terrible: <hi>So likewise,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>shall my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</hi> We are this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus nequam,</hi> if when our heavenly Father forgives us thousands of Talents, we stand with our brethren for an hundred pence. There is no proportion between the offences wherewith we offend God, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences wherewith our brother offends us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no excuse, hath our brother wronged us never so often, never so much, never so hainously: For whatsoever it be, or how unworthy or undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved soever; our sin, our ingratitude to Almighty God is and hath been infinitely greater, even much more then ten thousand Talents surpasse an hundred pence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:101070:135"/>
To these two testimonies adde a third, and that also as the former, out of our blessed Saviours own mouth: <hi>Mat. 5. If thou bring</hi> (saith he) <hi>thy gift to the Altar, and there remember, that thy brother hath ought against thee: leave there thy gift before the Altar, and goe thy way; First be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the word whereby the Septuagint constantly render that which the Law cals <hi>Corban;</hi> and the Gospel concurres with them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Now <hi>Corban</hi> in the Law is in speciall used for those offerings, which were made for atonement of Sin, as the Burnt-offering, Sin-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Trespasse-offering, and Peace-offering, call'd Offerings by Fire or Sacrifices. So that this precept of our Saviours here, is the same in effect with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when thou commest to offer an offering unto God for an atonement of thy sin; Go thy stay first, and be reconciled unto thy brother, for without this thy sin shall not be forgiven thee. I shall not need tell you, that now in the Gospel, Christ is the Sacrifice, is the gift which a Christian by faith offers unto God for the propitiation of his sin; and that this sacrifice is commemorated, sealed and communicated unto us in the blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper; whereby it will easily appear, how this precept of our Saviours uttered after the style of the legall worship is appliable to the Euangelicall.</p>
                     <p>Hence in the ancient Church, when they assembled to celebrate this Sacrament, the Deacon was wont to proclaim, <gap reason="foreign">

In stead of which at length was brought in that foolish ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, still used among the Romanists, for the Priest to send a little guilded or painted Table, with a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix or some Saints picture thereon, to be kissed of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the Church, before they receive the Holy Bread; which they call <hi>the kissing of the Pax.</hi> So of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes profitable and usefull Ceremonies degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into toyes and superstitions. Our Church, though she useth no ceremony, retains the substance; when the Priest in his exhortation to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, saith, <hi>If any of you be in malice or envy, or any other grievous crime, bewail your sins, and come not to this holy Table:</hi> and by the Rubrick the Priest, if he know any such, is to turn them back, unlesse they will be reconciled.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the necessity of this duty is testified by that pious and generally received custome amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to exhort those that are dying to forgive all the world, that so themselves may finde mercy and forgivenesse at the hands of God. Is it needfull at the hour of death, and not as needfull in the time of our health? Is there no forgivenesse to be expected at the hands of God without it, when we are dying, and is there while we are living? No certainly; All times
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101070:136"/>
are alike here; and there is no time wherein God will forgive us, unlesse we forgive our brother. What then remains, but that we do every day, as we would do, if we were to die the next? It is a blessed disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have a becalmed heart to those who have wronged us, and not to <hi>let the Sun go down upon our wrath:</hi> To be able to come before God with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and say; <hi>Lord forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three sorts of men in the world; some which call not Christ their Lord, as Turks, Jews and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels: some which call him Lord, as all Christians, but not all in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for there are two sorts of them; some which call him Lord, and that is all; others which both call him Lord, and doe the will of his Father, the administration whereof is committed to him. The first of those three sorts, those who do not so much as call Christ their Lord, it is plain they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved; for there is no other name to be saved by, but the name of Christ onely. For the second sort, those who call Christ their Lord, that is, are Christians, and professe to beleeve in Christ, and hope to be saved by him, and yet do no works of obedience unto God; though such as these may think themselves in a good estate, yet our Saviour here expresly excludes them from entring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven: But the third sort, which doe not
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101070:137"/>
onely call Christ their Lord, but doe the will of his Father, these are the onely true Christians; for these there is hope, but for none other: <hi>Not every one</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Saviour foresaw there would be among those who beleeved on his Name, such as should think their faith sufficient, and that as for works they might be excused, having him for their Lord and Captain of their salvation, who himself had both undergone the punishment due for their sins, and fulfilled that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they should have done. So that now there remained nothing on their part for to obtain salvation, but to trust and rely upon him, without any endeavour at all to please God by works, as being now become unusefull to salvation. If ever there were a time when Christians thus deceived themselves, that time is now, as both our practice sheweth plainly by a generall neglect of such duties of piety and charity, which amongst our Fore-fathers were frequent; as also our open profession, when being exhorted to these works of piety to God, and of charity towards our brethren, we stick not to alledge, we are not bound unto them, because we look not to be saved by the merit of works, as they, but by faith in Christ alone; as though faith in Christ excluded works, and not rather included them, as being that whereby they became acceptable unto God, which of themselves they are not: or as if works could no way conduce unto the attaining of salvation, but by way of merit and desert, and not by way of the grace and favour of God in Christ, as we shall see in the handling of this Text. We greatly now a days, and that most
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101070:138"/>
dangerously, mistake the errour of our forefathers, which was not in that they did good works; I would we did so; but because they knew not rightly the end why they did them, nor where the value of them lay: they thought the end of doing them was, to obtain eternall life, as a reward of Justice due unto them, whereas it is onely of grace and promise in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: They took their works to have such perfectness in them as would endure the touchstone of the Law of God, yea such worth and value as to merit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they looked for; whereas all the value and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptablenesse of our works, issueth from the merit of Christ, and lieth onely in his righteousnesse commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto us and them by faith, and no otherwise. But setting aside these errours of the end, and of the value of works, we must know as well as they; That <hi>not every one that saith unto Christ, Lord, Lord, &amp;c. but he that doth the will of his Father, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the Explication of the words: To call Christ, <hi>Lord,</hi> is to beleeve in him, to acknowledge him, to look for salvation by him, or, as the Scripture expresseth it, <hi>Luke 6. to come unto him, every one,</hi> (saith our Saviour there, explaining this very Text we have in hand) <hi>Every one</hi> (saith he) <hi>that commeth unto me, and heareth my words, and doth them, I will shew you who he is like:</hi> where <hi>to come unto Christ,</hi> is put in stead of that which in the former was, <hi>to say unto him Lord.</hi> The <hi>doing of his Fathers will,</hi> is the doing of those works of obedience, which his Father hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his Law, and now committed to his Son, whom he hath made the head and King of his Church to see executed and performed by those he bringeth to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101070:138"/>
But how, and in what manner, we shall see by and by.</p>
                     <p>The Text consists of two parts; The one negative; <hi>Not every one that saith unto Christ, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> The other affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; <hi>But those who doe the will of his Father</hi> shall onely enter thither. But these are so nearly linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they cannot be handled asunder: And the observations which I shall draw thence depend on the whole Text; the first and chiefest whereof is this; That <hi>faith in Christ without works of obedience, and amendment of life, is not sufficient for salvation,</hi> and consequently <hi>not that faith whereby a Christian is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</hi> For if it were, it would save us: If it be not sufficient to save us, it cannot justifie us: This floweth directly from the Text, and cannot be denied; if ye remember what I said before; that <hi>to call Christ, Lord,</hi> is to beleeve in him.</p>
                     <p>For the better understanding of this, you must take notice that there is a threefold faith whereby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ: There is a <hi>false</hi> faith: There is a <hi>true</hi> faith, but not saving: and thirdly, there is a <hi>saving</hi> faith. A <hi>false</hi> faith is, to beleeve to attain salvation through Christ any other way then he hath ordained, as namely, to beleeve to attain salvation through him, without works of obedience to be accepted of God in him; which is a faith whereof there is no Gospel. A <hi>true</hi> faith is, to beleeve salvation is to be attained through obedience to God in Jesus Christ, who by his merits and righteousnesse, makes our selves and our works acceptable to his Father.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>saving</hi> and <hi>justifying</hi> faith is, to beleeve this so
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101070:139"/>
as to embrace and lay hold upon Christ for that end. To believe to attain salvation through obedience to God in Christ, so as to apply our selves, and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, for that end, namely, to perform those works of obedience, which God hath promised to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with eternall life: For a <hi>justifying</hi> faith stayeth not onely in the brain, but stirs up the will to receive and enjoy the good beleeved, according as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. This motion of election of the will, is that which maketh the difference between a saving faith, which joyneth us unto Christ, and that which is true indeed, but not saving, but dogmaticall and opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native onely. And this motion, or applying of the will to Christ, this embracing of Christ and the promises of the Gospel through him, is that which the Scripture (when it speaks of this faith) calleth <hi>comming unto Christ,</hi> or <hi>the receiving of him,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power</hi> (or priviledge) <hi>to be the sons of God, even to them that beleeve on his Name:</hi> where <hi>receiving</hi> and <hi>beleeving</hi> one expound another. So for <hi>comming; Come unto me</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>all ye that are heavy laden, and I will ease you.</hi> The last is very frequent, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>that ye might have life.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 6. 37. All that the Father giveth me shall come unto me.</hi> ver. 44. <hi>No man can come unto me, unlesse the Father draw him. 45. Every man that hath heard, and learned of the Father commeth unto me;</hi> and such like. All which expresse the specification of a saving faith, which consists in the embracing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and applying of the will to the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:101070:139"/>
What this embracing, receiving, or applying unto Christ is, I will farther make plain thus: He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth that Christ is an atonement to God for the sins of all repentant sinners, (and surely he is an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for none else) must repent and turn from all his sinnes, that so Christ may be an atonement for him, else he embraceth not what he beleeveth.</p>
                     <p>He that beleeves that God in Christ will accept and reward our obedience and works of piety, though short of perfection, and of no worth in themselves, must apply himself accordingly to doe works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Charity, that God in Christ may accept and reward them. For our beleef is not that saving beleef, untill we apply our selves to what we beleeve. To beleeve to attain salvation through Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works of obedience to be accepted in him, is, as I have already said, a false faith whereof there is no Gospel, no promise: To beleeve the contrary, that Christ is given of God to such only as shall receive him, to perform acceptable obedience to God through him, and yet not to apply, and buckle our selves thereto, were indeed to beleeve what is true, but yet no saving faith, because we embraced not the thing we beleeved, as we beleeved it.</p>
                     <p>Thou sayest then thou hast faith, and beleevest that Christ is the atonement to God, for the sins of all such as leave and forsake their sins by repentance; Why then repent thee of thy sins that Christ may be an atonement for thee. Thou sayest thou hast this faith, that God in Jesus Christ will accept thy unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving works and services unto eternall life; why then embrace thou Christ, and rely upon him for this end,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:101070:140"/>
that thou mayest do works of piety towards God, and charity towards men, that so God in Christ may accept thee and them unto eternall life.</p>
                     <p>Now if this be the faith which is saving, and unites us unto Christ and no other, then it is plain that a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith cannot be severed from good works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man can embrace Christ as he is promised, but he must apply himself to do them. For out of that which hath been spoken three reasons may be gathered for the necessity of them. First, it is the end of our faith and justification by Christ, yea the end why he shed his blood for us, that we being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God in him, might bring forth fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, which else we could never have done. This is no speculation, but plain Scripture. S. <hi>Peter 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>p.</hi> 2. 24. telleth us, that <hi>Christ his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin, should live unto righteousnesse.</hi> S. <hi>Paul, Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. The grace of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>that bringeth salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath appeared unto all men;</hi> (wherefore?) <hi>teaching us that denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> These words contain the summe of all I have hitherto told you: That Christ is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given us, to be a propitiation for our sins, and to justifie us, that in him we might walk before God in newnesse of life; so to obtain a Crown of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the world to come.</p>

                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:101070:140"/>
Answerable is that place <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. where the Apostle having told us, <hi>we are saved by grace through faith, and not of works, lest any man should boast;</hi> he addes presently, (lest his meaning might be mistaken, as it is of too many) <hi>that we are Gods workmanship cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Iesus Christ unto good works, which God hath before ordained</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>that we should walk in them:</hi> as if he should say, Those works of obedience, ordained by God aforetime, in his law for us to walk in, which we could not perform of our selves; now God hath as it were new moulded us in Jesus Christ, that we might perform them in him; namely, by way of acceptation, though they come short of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse the Law requireth. And thus to be saved, is to be saved by grace and favour, and not by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of works, because the foundation whereby our selves and our services are approved in the eyes of God, and acquitted of guilt, (which the Scripture calleth to be justified,) is the meer favour of God in Jesus Christ, and not any thing in us. And this way of salvation excludes all boasting; for what have we to boast of, when all the righteousnesse of our works is none of ours, but Christs imputed to us; whereby onely, and not for any merit in themselves, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acceptable, and have promise of reward. But that men should be saved by Christ, though they be idle and doe nothing, I know no such grace of God revealed in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Now that in Christ we may perform works of righteousnesse, which God will accept and crown, is plain by the tenour of Scripture. S. <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 1. 11. desires that the <hi>Philippians might be filled with the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101070:141"/>
fruits of righteousnesse, which are by Iesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.</hi> And the same Apostle tels the Romanes, <hi>Rom. 6. 22. that being made free from sin, and become servants to God, they have their fruit unto holinesse, and the end everlasting life;</hi> that is, as the Syriack turns it, <hi>Sunt vobis fructus sancti, they have holy fruits, whose end is life eternall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we would seriously consider it, we should finde, that the more we beleeve this righteousnesse of faith in Christ, the more reason we have to perform works of service and obedience unto God, then if we beleeved it not: For if our works would not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God, unlesse they were compleat in every point, as the Law required; if there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be looked for at the hands of God, unlesse we could merit it by the worthinesse of our deeds: who that considers his own weaknesse and insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would not sooner despair, then go about to please God by works? He would think it better to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, then to endevour what he could never hope to attain, and so lose his labour. But we, who beleeve that those who serve God in Christ, have their failings and wants covered with his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and so their works accepted, as if they were in every point as they should be; why should not we of all men fall to work, being sure by Christs means and merit, we shall not lose our labour?</p>
                     <p>A second motive why we should do good works is, because they are the way and means ordained by God to obtain the reward of eternall life, without which we shall never attain it: <hi>Without holinesse no man shall see God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Look to your selves</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iohn
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:101070:141"/>
Ep. 2. ver. 8.) that ye lose not those things ye have wrought for, but that ye may receive a full reward.</hi> The Angels message from heaven to devout <hi>Cornelius</hi> was, <hi>Thy prayers and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God:</hi> whereupon S. <hi>Peter</hi> inferred, that <hi>in every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, is accepted with him,</hi> Acts 10.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that we shall be judged, and receive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence at the last day, according to our works: <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world: For I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me: For in as much as ye have done these unto one of the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> Lord, how do those look to be saved at that day, who think good works not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to salvation, and accordingly do them not! Can our Saviour passe this blessed sentence on them? think they he can? If he should, they might truly say indeed, Lord, we have done no such matter, nor did we think our selves bound unto it; we relied wholly upon our faith in thy merits, and thought we had been freed from such services. What? doe they think Christ will change the form of his sentence at that great day? No certainly: If the sentence for Blisse will not fit them, and be truly said of them, the other will, and must, for there is no more; <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For when I was hungry, ye gave me no meat, &amp;c.</hi> This must be their doome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:101070:142"/>
they suppose the righteous Judge will lie for them.</p>
                     <p>And it is here further to be observed, that the works named in the sentence of Judgement, are works of the second Table, <hi>works of mercy</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick; all Almesdeeds, which men are now a-days so much afraid of; as if they looked toward Popery, and had a tang of meriting: For now a-days these costly works of all others are most suspicious; but will it be so at the day of Judgement? True it is, they merit not the reward which shall be given them: but what then? Are we so proud we will doe no works, unlesse we may merit? Is it not sufficient that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them for Christs sake, though they have no worth in themselves?</p>
                     <p>The third and last motive to works of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is, because they are the only sign and note where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know our faith is true and saving, and not counterfeit: For 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 8. If we say we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Christ, and walk in darknesse, we lie, and doe not the truth.</hi> Chap. 2. ver. 3. <hi>Hereby we know that we know him (viz.</hi> to be our <hi>Advocate with his Father, and the propitiation for our sins) if we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> And <hi>Chap. 3. 7. Little children, let no man deceive you: He that doeth righteousnesse, is righteous, even as Christ is righteous.</hi> The same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most you may finde again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 29. For if every one that beleeveth in Christ truly and savingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves that salvation is to be attained by obedience to God in him, and not otherwise, and therefore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth and layeth hold upon him for that end; How
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101070:142"/>
can such an ones faith be fruitlesse? how can he be without works, who therefore lays hold on Christ that his works and obedience may be accepted as righteous before God, for his sake, and so rewardable? It is as possible for the Sun to be without his light, or the fire to want heat, as such a faith to be without works.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour therefore himself makes this a most sure and never failing note to build our assurance of salvation upon, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 46. where the mention of the words of my Text gives the occasion, <hi>Why call ye me, Lord,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and doe not the things which I say? 47. Whosoever commeth to me, and heareth my sayings, and doth them, I will shew you to whom he is like. 48. He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock. And when the floud arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded upon arock. 49. But he that heareth and doth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell, and the ruine of that house was great.</hi> Whom these three motives or reasons will not perswade to good works, let not my soul ô Lord be joyned with theirs, nor my doome be as theirs must be.</p>
                     <p>A second observation out of these words, and near a-kin to the former is; That it is not enough for a Christian to live harmlesly, and abstain from ill, but he must do that which is good. For our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not here those onely, who do against the will of his Father, but those who do not his Fathers will: It is doing good which he requireth, and the not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101070:143"/>
evill only. This is an error which taketh hold of a great part of men, even of those who would seem to be religious. He is a reformed man, and acquits himself well, who abstains from fornication, adultery, who is no theef, no couzener, or defrauder of other men; who will not lie, or swear, or such like: But as for doing any works of piety or charity, they think they are not required of them.</p>
                     <p>But they are much deceived: For God requires some duties at our hands, which he may reward not out of any merit, but out of his mercifull promise in Christ. But not doing ill is no service rewardable: A servant who expects wages, must not onely do his Master no harm, but some work that is good and profitable: otherwise the best Christian would be he that should live altogether idlely; For none doth lesse harm, then he that doth nothing at all. But <hi>Mat. 25. 30. He that encreased not his Masters Talent,</hi> though he had not mis-spent it, is adjudged <hi>an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable servant, and cast into utter darknesse, where is weeping, and gnashing of treth.</hi> So also <hi>Mat. 3. The tree that beareth no good fruit, is hewn down,</hi> though it bore none that was evill: <hi>The axe is laid to the root of the tree, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</hi> Mat. 21. 19. <hi>The sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree is cursed for having no fruit,</hi> not for having evill fruit. And the sentence of condemnation, as you heard before, is to passe at that great day, for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done good works, not for doing ill ones: <hi>Goe ye cursed, for when I was hungry, ye fed me not, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus having let you see how necessary it is for a Christian to joyn good works with his faith in Christ;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101070:143"/>
I will now come to shew you, how you must do them, hoping I have already perswaded you that they must needs be done.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, we must doe them out of <hi>faith in Christ,</hi> that is, relying upon him onely for the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and rewarding of them: for in him alone God is well pleased with us and with what wee doe, and therefore <hi>without faith</hi> and reliance upon him, <hi>it is impossible to please God.</hi> We must not think there is any worth in our works, for which any such reward as God hath promised, is due; For, alas! our best works are full of imperfections, and far short of what the Law requires. Our reward therefore is not of merit, but of the mercifull promise of God in Christ: which the Apostle means, when he says, <hi>We are saved by grace, and not by works:</hi> That is, it is the grace and favour of God in Christ, which makes our selves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and our works rewardable, and not any desert in them or us.</p>
                     <p>Having laid this foundation; the next thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is <hi>sincerity of heart</hi> in doing them: we must doe them out of the fear of God, and conscience of his Commandements, not out of respect of profit, or fear, or praise of men; For such as do so are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: <hi>Not every one,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>that saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Lord, Lord, but he that doth the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> Now it is the will of our heavenly Father that we serve him in truth and uprightnesse of heart: <hi>I know</hi> (saith <hi>David, 1 Chr. 29. 17.) that thou my God triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightnesse.</hi> And so he said to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 1. I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou upright,</hi> or be thou
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:101070:144"/>
sincere. This manner of serving God <hi>Ioshuah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Israelites, <hi>Iosh. 24. 14. Fear the Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>and serve him in sincerity and truth:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam. 12. 24. Onely fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart.</hi> This since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, uprightnesse and truth in Gods service is, when we do religious and pious duties, and abstain from the contrary out of conscience to Godward, out of an heart possessed with the love and fear of God. It is otherwise called in Scripture, <hi>perfectnesse,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse of heart:</hi> For it is a lame and unperfect ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where the better half is wanting, as the heart is, in every work of duty both to God and men. And therefore it is called <hi>perfectnesse,</hi> when both go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when conscience as the soul, enlives the outward work as a body. And indeed this is all the perfection we can attain unto in this life, to serve God in truth of heart, though otherwise we come short of what we should: and therefore God esteems our actions and works, not according to the greatnesse or exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the performance, but according to the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth of our hearts in doing them: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the places I have already quoted, and by that 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 14. where it is said, that though <hi>Asa</hi> failed in his reformation, and the <hi>high places were not taken down, neverthelesse his heart was perfect with the Lord his God, all his days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A note to know such a sincerity and truth of heart by, is, If in our privacy, when there is no witnesse but God and our selves, we are carefull then to abstain from sin, as well as in the sight of men. If when no body but God shall see and know it, we are willing to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:101070:144"/>
do a good work, as well as if all the world should know it. He that findeth himself thus affected, his heart is true, at least in some measure, but so much the lesse by how much he findeth himself the lesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this manner. When we are in the presence and view of men, we may soon be deceived in our selves, and think we do that out of conscience and fear of God, which indeed is but for the fear or praise of men, either lest we should be damnified, or impair our credit, or the like: but when there is none but God and us, then to be afraid of sin, and carefull of good duties, is a sign we fear God in truth and sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not in hypocrisy.</p>
                     <p>The speciall and principall means to attain this sincerity and truth of heart is, to possesse our selves with the apprehension of Gods presence, and to walk before him as in his eye: wheresoever thou art, there is an eye that seeth thee, an eare that hears thee, and a hand that registreth thy most secret thoughts. For <hi>the ways of man</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon Prov. 5. 21.) are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his doings:</hi> How much ashamed would we be, that men should know how much our hearts and our words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons disagreed? How would we blush that men should see us commit this or that sin, or neglect this or that duty? what horrible Atheisme then doth this argue, that the presence of man, yea sometimes of a little child, should hinder us from that wickednesse which Gods presence cannot? This having of God before our eyes, and the continuall meditation of his all-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presence, would together with devout prayer for the assistance of Gods grace, be in time the bane of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101070:145"/>
hypocrisie and falshood of heart, and beget in stead thereof that truth and sincerity which God loveth.</p>
                     <p>Another property of such obedience as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, is <hi>universality:</hi> we must not serve God by halfs, by doing some duties and omitting other, but we must with <hi>David, Psal. 119. 6, 20. have respect to all Gods Commandements;</hi> to those of the second Table, as well as to those of the first; and to those of the first, as well as those of the second. The want of which universality of obedience to both Tables is so frequent, as the greatest part of Christians are plunged therein, to the undoubted ruine of their souls, and shipwrack of everlasting life, if they so continue.</p>
                     <p>For there are two sorts of men, which think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a good estate, and are not: The one are those who make conscience of the duties of the first Table, but have little or no care of the duties of the second. And this is a most dangerous evill, by reason it is more hard to be discovered: those which are guilty thereof, being such as seem religious, but their Religion is in vain. Such were those in the Church of Israel against whom the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> declaimeth <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. from the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> to the 17. <hi>To what purpose are your sacrifices and burnt offerings, saith the Lord? your oblations and incense are an abomination. Your new Moons, Sabbaths, calling of Assemblies; even the solemne meeting, I cannot away with; it is iniquity.</hi> Would you know what was the matter? see the words following; <hi>Learn to do well, seek judgement, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherlesse, plead for the widow.</hi> Lo here a want of the duties of the second Table.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101070:145"/>
Such is that also of <hi>Hosea</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>I desired mercy, and not sacrifice;</hi> which is twice alledged by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Gospel against the Pharisees hypocriticall scrupulosity in the same duties of the first Table, with a neglect of the second. But here perhaps some may finde a scruple, because that if sacrifice in this or the like places be opposed to the duties of obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the second Table, it should hereby seem, that the duties of the second Table which concern our neighbour, should be preferred before the duties of the first, which concern the Lord himself; forasmuch as it is said, <hi>I desire mercy, and not sacrifice;</hi> that is, rather mercy, which is a duty of the second Table, then sacrifice, which is of the first. I answer, The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghosts meaning is, not to preferre the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the first, taking them simply, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties of both together, before the service of the first alone: Be more ready to joyn mercy, or works of mercy with your sacrificing, then to offer sacrifice alone.</p>
                     <p>To go on: The duties of the first Table are by a speciall name called duties of Religion; those of the second Table come under the name of Honesty and probity: Now as a man can never be truly honest, unlesse he be Religious; so cannot that man (what shew soever he makes) be truly religious in Gods esteem, who is not honest in his conversation toward his neighbour: Religion and Honesty must be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together, or else neither of them will be in truth what it seems to be. We know that all our duty to God and our neighbour is comprehended under the name of <hi>love,</hi> as in that summe of the Law; <hi>Love God
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101070:146"/>
above all things, and thy) neighbour as thy self.</hi> This is the summe of the whole Law contained in both Tables. But S. <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us 1 <hi>Ep. 4. 20. He that saith, I love God, and hateth his brother, is a lier;</hi> which is as much as if he should say; He that seems religious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and is without honesty towards his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he is a lier, there is no true religion in him.</p>
                     <p>If you would then know, whether a man professing Religion, by diligent frequenting Gods service, and exercises of devotion, keeping sacred times, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, be a sound Christian or not, or a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one onely; this is a sure and infallible note to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him, and for him to discover himself by: For, if notwithstanding his care of the duties of the first Table, he makes no conscience to walk honestly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his neighbour; If he be disobedient to Parents, and lawfull Authority; if he be cruell and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; if he be unjust in his dealings, fraudulent, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor, a falsifier of Covenants and promises, a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter, a sclaunderer, or the like: his Religion is no better then an hypocrites: For such was the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many of the Pharisees, whom therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour termeth <hi>Hypocrites; Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites:</hi> They were scrupulous in the duties of the first Table, they <hi>paid tithe even of mint and annise,</hi> they <hi>fasted twice a week,</hi> they were exact observers of the Sabbath, and other ceremonies of Religion; but judgement, mercy, and faith in their conversation towards men, our Saviour tels them, they regarded not.</p>
                     <p>Besides our Saviours woe denounced against such, there are two dangerous effects which accompany
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101070:146"/>
this evil disease, which should make us beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: First, those who are addicted to Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conscience of honesty, are easily drawn by the Devil to many intolerable acts under colour and in behalf thereof, as they imagine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> We see it in the Papists and Jesuits, whose preposterous zeal to their Religion, makes them think Treasons, Murders, Rebellions, or any other such wicked acts, are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and excusable, so they be done for the good of the Catholique cause, as they call it. And if we search narrowly amongst our selves, we shall light upon some examples of indirect and unlawfull courses, undertaken otherwhile on the behalf of Religion, and all through want of this conscionable care of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining honesty towards our neighbour, together with our zeal for Religion toward God. Even as we see an horse in some narrow and dangerous passage, whilest he is wholly taken up with some bugbear on the one side of the way, which he would eschew, and in the mean time mindeth not the other side, where there is the like danger, he suddenly slips into a pit or ditch, with no small danger to himself and rider: So is it here, with such as look onely to the first Table, and minde not the second, whilest they go about as they think to advance the duties of the one, they fall most foully in the other.</p>
                     <p>The second evill is a most dangerous scandall, which follows profession of Religion without honest conversation towards men: It is a grievous stumbling block and stone of offence, making men out of love with Religion, when they see such evil effects from it, and those who seem to professe it. Those who are not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101070:147"/>
yet come on are skared from comming, resolving they will never be of their Religion, which they see no better fruits of. Those who are entred, are ashamed and discouraged, forsaking the duties of Religion, that they might shun the suspition of hypocrisie and dishonesty. <hi>But woe be unto them by whom scandall commeth:</hi> Let us all therefore take heed to adorn and approve our profession, by bringing forth fruits, not onely of piety and devotion toward God, but of works of righteousnesse and charity to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

Thus the Lord shewed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101070:148"/>
himself according to his style, <hi>A God gracious and mercifull, long-suffering, and slow to anger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when these Jews, notwithstanding this second tender, not only continued in their former obstinacy, refusing to accept him for their Redeemer, but also misused and persecuted his Ambassadors sent unto them, this their ingratitude was so hideous and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in the eyes of God, that he could bear with them no longer, but resolved thenceforth to cast them off, and choose himself a Church among the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>To prepare a way whereunto, he sent a Vision much about the same time, both to <hi>Peter,</hi> (who was then by reason of the Jews persecution fled to <hi>Ioppa)</hi> and to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile, Captain of the Italian Band, living at <hi>Caesarea</hi> upon that coast; ordaining the one <hi>(Peter)</hi> to be the Messenger and Preacher; and the other <hi>(Cornelius)</hi> to be the first Gentile which should be partaker of the faith of Christ: Therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <hi>Peters</hi> Vision was to admonish him, not to make scruple, as all Jews did, of conversing with a Gentile as unclean; signified by <hi>a sheet let down from heaven, wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the aire,</hi> that is, of all both clean and unclean; wherewith came also a voice, saying, <hi>Peter, kill and eat.</hi> Whereunto when <hi>Peter</hi> answered, <hi>Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean:</hi> the voice replies, <hi>What God hath cleansed, that call not thou unclean.</hi> Now as this Vision was to give <hi>Peter</hi> commission to go unto <hi>Cornelius;</hi> so was <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his Vision to command him to send for <hi>Peter; For he saw a Vision at the ninth hour of the day, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101070:148"/>
of the Lord comming unto him, and saying, Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. Whom when Cornelius looked on, being afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? The Angel said unto him, Thy prayers and thine almes are come up for a memoriall,</hi> or <hi>had in remembrance before God. And now send men to Ioppa, and call for one Simon, whose sirname is Peter, and he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to doe.</hi> And thus have I brought the Story as far as my Text; which is as you see a part of this Message of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> namely, his Report; <hi>And he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Thy prayers and thine almes, &amp;c.</hi>

And the Angel said unto him.</hi> Secondly, what the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or Report he brought importeth; <hi>Thy prayers and thine almesdeeds are come in remembrance before God.</hi> To begin with the first; The man here spoken to, (as you may read in the beginning of the Chapter, and as I have in some part told already) was <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a Gentile, Captain of the Italian Band at Caesarea, and so no doubt himself of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> the Land of Jury, like as most other Nations were, was under the Romane Empire, and ruled by a President of their appointing: which President had his Court and Seat at Caesarea, a great and magnificent City upon the Palestine coast, some seventy miles from Jerusalem, where was continually a guard of Souldiers both for the Presidents safety, and awing the subdued Jews: And among these was our <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Commander, being Captain of the Italian Band. But howsoever
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:101070:149"/>
he were by race and breeding a Gentile, yet for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he was no Idolater, but a worshipper of the true God, the God of Israel, or God the Creator of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth: For the Text tels us, that <hi>he was a devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much almes to the people, and prayed to God alway:</hi> which is as much as to say, he was a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, for so were those converted Gentiles called, who left their false Gods, and worshipped the true. Yet was he not circumcised, nor had taken upon him the yoke of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and so was not accounted a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of Israel: wherefore according to the Ordinances of the Law he was esteemed unclean, and so not lawfull for <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other circumcised Jew to accompany with him, had not God given <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> an <hi>Item</hi> that he should thenceforth call no man unclean, for as much as that badge of separation was now dissolved.</p>
                     <p>For the better understanding of this, we must know, there were, while the legall worship stood, two sorts of Proselytes, or converted Gentiles: One sort which were called Proselytes of the Covenant; These were such as were circumcised, and submitted themselves to the whole Mosaicall paedagogy: These were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Jews, and conversed with as freely as those which were so born. But there was a second sort of Proselytes inferiour unto these, whom they called Proselytes of the Gate: These were not circumcised, nor conformed themselves to the Mosaicall Rites and Ordinances, onely they were tyed to the obedience of those Commandements, which the Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors call the Commandements of <hi>Noah,</hi> that is, such
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101070:149"/>
as all the sons of <hi>Noah</hi> were bound to observe; which were, first, to worship God the Creator. Secondly, to disclaim the service of Idols. Thirdly, to abstain from blood, namely, both from the effusion of mans blood: and fourthly, from eating flesh with the blood therein. Fifthly, to abstain from fornication, and all unlawfull conjunction. Sixtly, to administer justice: and seventhly, to abstain from robbery, and do as they would be done to. And such Proselytes as these, howsoever they were accounted Gentiles, and such as with whom the Jews might not converse as being no free denizens of Israel; yet did they yeeld them a part in the life to come. Such a Proselyte was <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the Syrian, and of such there were many in our Saviours time; and such an one was our <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it was, that when afterward there arose a controversie in the Church, Whether or no the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which beleeved, were to be circumcised, and so bound to observe the Ordinances and rites of <hi>Moses;</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Councell of the Apostles at Jerusalem determined, It was the will of God they should not; and that upon this ground, because <hi>Cornelius</hi> the first beleeving Gentile was no circumcised Proselyte, but a Proselyte of the Gate only, and yet neverthelesse when himself was sent (as ye have heard) to preach the Gospel of Christ to him and his house, the Holy Ghost came down upon them as well as upon the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; whereby it was manifest, that God would have the rest of the Gentiles which beleeved, to have no more imposed upon them, then <hi>Cornelius</hi> had: and accordingly the Councell concluded, that no other burden should be laid upon them, but onely those
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101070:150"/>
precepts given to the sons of <hi>Noah; To abstain from pollutions of Idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication,</hi> and the rest, which they had received already in becomming Christians, and so nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to be expresly mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Now that I may not seem to have held you with so long a story without some matter of instruction: Let us observe by the example of this <hi>Cornelius,</hi> how great a favour and blessing of God it is, to live and dwell within the pale of his Church, where opportunity and means of salvation is to be had. If <hi>Cornelius</hi> had still dwelt among his Countrimen the Italians, where he was bred and born, or in any other Province of that Empire; he had in all likelihood never come to this saving and blessed knowledge of the true God, but dyed a Pagan as he was born. But by this occasion of living at Caesarea, within the confines of the land of Israel, where the Oracles and worship of the most high God were dayly resounded and professed; he became such an one as ye have heard, a blessed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert unto the true God, whom with all his house he served and worshipped with acceptation.</p>
                     <p>If this be so, then should we our selves learn to be more thankfull to God then most of us use to be, for that condition wherein by his Providence we are born; for we might, if it had pleased him, have been born, and had our dwelling among Pagans and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who had no knowledge of his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; (and such our Nation once was:) But behold his goodnesse and mercy! we are born of Christian Parents, and dwell in a Christian Country, and so made partakers of the name and livery of Christ as
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101070:150"/>
soon as we were born: How great should our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse be for his mercy? Nay, wee might have been born and bred in a Christian Nation too, and yet such an one where Idolatry, false worship, and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry so reigned, as there had been little hopes or means to have been saved: But behold, we are born, bred, and dwell in a reformed Christian State, where the worship of God in Christ is truly taught and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; where no God is worshipped but the Father, and in no other Mediator but his Son Jesus Christ. How should we then magnifie our good God for his so great and abundant mercy towards us? <hi>Luther,</hi> or some other tels a story of a German pesant, who on a time beholding an ugly Toad, fell into a most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lamentation and weeping, that he had been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull to Almighty God, who had made him a man, and not such an ugly creature as that was. O that we could in like manner bewail our ingratitude towards him who hath made us to have our birth and habitation, not among Pagans and barbarous Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, a people <hi>without God in the world,</hi> but in a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Christian Nation, where the true God is known, and the means of salvation is to be had! Thankfulnesse for a lesse benefit is the way to obtain a greater: To acknowledge and prize Gods favour towards us in the means, is the way to obtain his grace to use them to our eternall advantage: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our neglect of thankfulnesse in the one, may cause God in his just judgement, to deprive us of his blessing in the other. Consider it.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the person to whom the Angel spake, <hi>Cornelius, And he said unto him.</hi> Now
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:101070:151"/>
I come to the message it self, <hi>Thy prayers and thine almes are come into remembrance before God.</hi> Where before I make any further entrance, there is an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction requires to be answered; namely, how <hi>Cornelius</hi> his service could be accepted of God, (as it is said to be) when as he had no knowledge of Christ, without whom no man can please God. I answer; <hi>Cornelius</hi> pleased God through his faith in the promise of Christ to come, as all just men under the Law did: which faith God did so long accept after Christ was come, till his comming and the mystery of Redemption wrought by him, were fully and clearly made known and preached, which had not been to <hi>Cornelius</hi> till this time: for though he had heard of his preaching in Galilee and Judaea, and that he was crucified by the Jews, yet he had not heard of his Resurrection from the dead, and Ascension into glory, or was not assured of it, till it was now confirm'd unto him, by one sent from God himself. And it is like that having heard somewhat of the Apostles preaching, and of the Jews opposing their testimony, and so knowing not what to beleeve, he had earnestly besought God in his Devotions to lead him in the way of truth, and make known unto him what to doe.</p>
                     <p>This being premised, I return again unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels words; wherein I will consider three things: First, the conjunction or coupling of Almesdeeds with Prayer; <hi>Thy Prayers and thine Almes.</hi> Secondly, the efficacy of power they have with God; <hi>Thy Prayers and thine Almes are come up into remembrance before God.</hi> Thirdly, I will adde the reasons why God so much accepteth them; which are also so many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101070:151"/>
why we should be carefull and diligent to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise them.</p>
                     <p>For the first, the joyning of Almesdeeds with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>Cornelius</hi> we see joyn'd them, and he is therefore in the verses before going commended for <hi>a devout man, and one that feared God.</hi> And by the Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from God himself, we hear how graciously he accepted them; giving us to understand, that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion thus arm'd, was of all others the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pierce into his dwelling place, and fetch a blessing from him. Therefore our Saviour likewise, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. joyns the precepts of Alms and Prayer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, teaching us how to give alms, and how to pray in one Sermon, as things that ought to goe hand in hand, and not to be separated asunder. It was also the Ordinance of the Church in the Apostles times, that the first day of the week, which was the time of publike prayer, should be the time also of Alms. So saith S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 16. 1. Now concerning the collection for the Saints</hi> (saith he) <hi>as I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 2. Vpon the first day of the week</hi> (that is, upon the Lords day) <hi>let every one of you lay by himself in store as God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</hi> Which institution seems to be derived from the Commandement of God in the Law twice repeated; <hi>Let no man appear before the Lord empty:</hi> For the words annexed to that Law <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. (where it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <note place="margin">Exo. 23. 15 Deu. 16. 16</note> to the three great feasts, when all Israel was to assemble to pray before the Lord in his Tabernacle) the words I say there annexed, sound altogether like unto these of S. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the Lords day; <hi>Three
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101070:152"/>
times a year</hi> (saith the Text there) <hi>shall all the males ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord: and they shall not appear before the Lord empty. Every one shall give as he is able, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee.</hi> Is not this the same in sense with S. <hi>Pauls, Let every one lay by himself in store, as God hath prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him?</hi> The Primitive Church after the Apostles followed the same president, and our own Reformed Church hath ordained the same in her Service-book, were it accordingly practised as was intended: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Epistle and Gospel she appoints divers choice sentences of Scripture to be read, which exhorts us to Almes and other Offerings to the honour of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God; and then as supposing it to be done, in the Prayer for the whole estate of Christs Church, <hi>We humbly beseech him most mercifully to accept our Almes, and receive our prayers, which we offer unto his Divine Majesty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Shall I now need to exhort Christians thus to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and strengthen their prayers which they daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto God, to couple them with Almesdeeds, to come before God with a present, and not empty-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Whom neither Gods Commandement, the practice of his Church, the example of his Saints, nor the acceptance of such prayers as the hand which dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Almes, lifteth up to him; whom these will not move, no words of mine will do it. But some may say, Would you have us always give Alms when we pray? No; I say not so, but I would not have you appear before the Lord empry; that is, such as are not wont to give them, nor mean to do: for you may give them before, or second your prayers with them
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101070:152"/>
after; you may have set and appointed times for the one, as you have for the other; or when the Law of man injoyns you any thing in this kinde, do it heartily, faithfully, and with a willing minde, without grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that so God may accept it as a service done to him. Or lastly, thou maist doe as the holy men of Scripture were wont, vow and promise unto God if thy prayer be heard to offer something unto him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for relief of the poor, the Widow, the Orphan, and distressed one, or the maintenance of his service and worship. <hi>If God will be with me,</hi> (saith <hi>Iacob, Gen. 28.) and keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, &amp;c. Then shall the Lord be my God, and this stone which I have set for a pillar, shall be Gods house: and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth unto thee.</hi> (See the use of vowing by such as came to pray in Gods House, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 4.) If thou commest before God in any of these ways, thou shalt not come empty-handed. But send not thy prayer single and alone; the prayer with Alms is the prayer God loveth: Hear what himself saith <hi>Psal. 50. 14. Offer unto God thanksgiving</hi> (Alms is an Offering of <note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 35. 2</note> Thanksgiving) <hi>and pay thy vows unto the most High. So call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I come to the second thing I propounded, The power and efficacy which Prayer and Alms have with God. <hi>Thy prayers and thine alms</hi> (saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel) <hi>are come up for a memoriall</hi> (or, <hi>are had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) in the sight of God.</hi> God is said to remember our prayers when he grants them, our Alms and good deeds when he rewards them, or in a word, when he
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101070:153"/>
answers either of them with a blessing: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he is said to remember iniquity, when he sends some judgement for it. So God is said to <hi>remember Hanna,</hi> when he heard her prayer for a Son, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 19. and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> speaking <hi>(cap.</hi> 5. 19.) of his deeds of mercy and bounty shewed unto his poor brethren returned from captivity, says, <hi>Think upon me,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me ô my God for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</hi> Thus were <hi>Cornelius</hi> his prayers and alms remembred. Prayers therefore and alms, be they performed as they should be, are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and approved means to obtain a blessing at the hands of God. To speak first of prayer: What is it that prayer hath not obtain'd? It hath shut and opened heaven; see the story of <hi>Eliah.</hi> It hath made the Sun and Moon to stand still; reade the book of <hi>Ioshua.</hi> It is the key that openeth all Gods treasures and blessings both spirituall and corporall: for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blessings, <hi>Cornelius</hi> we see obtained thereby illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and instruction in Gods saving truth. And S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>If any man lack wisdome let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and it shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him Ephraim</hi> in the 31. of <hi>Ieremy</hi> prays for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace, <hi>Turn thou me, ô Lord, and I shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi> To whom God presently replies, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleasant Childe? For since I spake against him, I doe earnestly remember him still: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my bowels are troubled for him, I will surely have mercy on him, saith the Lord.</hi> Prayer obtains remission of sins; <hi>I said</hi> (saith <hi>David Psal. 32.) I will confesse my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my sin. For this shall every one that is godly
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101070:153"/>
pray unto thee in a time when thou maist be found.</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er also obtaineth corporall blessings; When heaven was shut and it rained not, <hi>Eliah</hi> prayed for rain and it rained: <hi>Hannah</hi> prayed for a Son, and she concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: If we be sick (saith S. <hi>Iames cap. 5.) The prayer of faith shall heal the sick: Nehemiah</hi> prayed that he might finde favour in the sight of King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and found it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                     <p>But some man wil say, If prayer have such power and efficacy, how comes it to passe that many even godly men, oft pray, and yet speed not? I answer, There are divers causes thereof; Either we pray not as we ought, or we are not disposed as we ought to be when we pray; We pray not as we ought, either when we pray not heartily, or not constantly: For God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not formall and superficiall prayer, but prayer that comes from the heart, and loves to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before he grant, as our Saviour tels us in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the woman and the unjust Judge, whom though at first he would not hear, yet importunity made him doe her justice. Or secondly, we rely not upon God as we ought, when we pray, but trust more to second means, to our wit, to our friends or the like, then to him. And this seems to be that wavering in prayer S. <hi>Iames</hi> speaks of, when he bids us <hi>pray in faith, without wavering, Chap.</hi> 1. that is, without ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from God to rest upon second means: but as with our mouth we pray to him, so should our hearts rely upon him to give us what we ask; we often pray to God for fashion, but indeed we look to speed by others; and so God takes himself mocked, and then no marvell if he hears us not: If it were our own case
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101070:154"/>
we would not listen to such suiters. Or thirdly, we pray and speed not, when we make not Gods glory the end of what we ask; <hi>Ye ask</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iames) and receive not, because ye ask amisse, that ye might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it upon your lusts.</hi> Or fourthly, we may ask some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that crosseth the rule of Divine providence and justice, and then also we must not look to speed: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed for the life of his childe by <hi>Bathsheba, Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> Wife, but was not heard, because it stood not with the rule of Divine justice, that so scandalous a sin, which made the Enemies of God to blaspheme, should not have an exemplary punishment. In like manner sundry times when the children of Israel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against the Lord, and murmured against <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> their Governors; <hi>Moses</hi> poured forth very earnest prayers to God for removing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from off the people, but God would not hear him, because their sins were scandalous, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with so high a hand, that it could not stand with the rule of his justice, not to inflict punishment for them.</p>
                     <p>Again, sometimes, and that too often, we are indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for God to grant our request; as first, when some sin unrepented of lies at the door, and keeps Gods blessing out; <hi>Psal 66. 18. If I regard</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 16.</note> And his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> observed it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. where he says, <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, even his prayer shall be abomination.</hi> So God would not hear <hi>Ioshua</hi> praying for the Israelites, when they fled before the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> because of <hi>Achans</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge; <hi>Get thee up,</hi> (saith God) <hi>why liest thou thus
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101070:154"/>
upon thy face? Israel hath sinned—for they have taken of the accursed thing;</hi> that is, the thing that cursed were those that medled therewith: Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their Enemies,—because they were accursed: <hi>Neither will I be with you any more, except ye put the accursed thing from among you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or lastly, our Prayers often are not heard, because <hi>we appear before the Lord empty;</hi> we do not as <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> did, send up prayers and alms together: we should have two strings to our bow, when we have but one. This is another indisposition, which unfits us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what we ask of God: For how can we look that God should hear us in our need, when we turn away our face from our brother in his need? When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to give to God, or for his sake, what he requires, why should he grant to us what we request? Hear what an ancient Father of the Church, S. <hi>Basil</hi> by name, <hi>in concione ad Deum; Novi quosdam</hi> (saith he) <hi>qui jejunarunt, qui orarunt, qui ingemuerunt, verùm ne unum quidem obolum in egenos expenderunt: Quae uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas hîc est reliquae virtutis? I have known,</hi> saith he, <hi>many who would fast, who would pray, who would sigh; but not bestow one half-peny upon the poor: But what then will their other devotion profit them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Adde to all these reasons of displeasure, a reason of favour, why God sometimes grants not our requests; namely, because we ask that which he knows would be hurtfull for us, though we think not so. We ask sometimes that which if he granted us would utterly undoe us: As therefore a wise and loving Father will not give his child a knife, or some other hurtfull
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101070:155"/>
thing, though it cries never so much unto him for it: so does God deale with his children. And how wise soever we think our selves, we are often as ignorant in that which concerns our good, as very babes are, and therefore we must submit our selves to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the wisdome of our heavenly Father.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, we must know and beleeve, that God often hears our prayers, when we think he doth not; and that three manner of ways: As namely first, when he changes the means, but brings the end we desire another way to passe: we ask to have a thing by our means, but he likes not our way, but gives it us by another means which he thinks better. S. <hi>Paul</hi> that he might the better glorifie God in serving him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <hi>the prick of the flesh</hi> might be taken from him: God denies him that means, but grants him <hi>grace suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him;</hi> that so being humbled by the sight of his own infirmity, he might glorifie God for <hi>his power in mans weaknesse.</hi> And is it not all one, whether a Physitian quench the thirst of his Patient by giving him Barberies, or some other comfortable drink, as by giving him Beer which he cals for? Secondly, God often grants our request, but not at that time we would have it, but defers it till some other time which he thinks best. <hi>Daniel</hi> prays for the return of the Captivity in <hi>the first year of Darius,</hi> but God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it till the <hi>first of Cyrus:</hi> we must not therefore take Gods delays for denials. The souls of the Saints under the Altar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. cry out aloud for vengeance; God hears that cry, and cannot deny the importunate cry of innocent blood; yet he defers it <hi>for a little sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> saith the Text; and why? because <hi>their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101070:155"/>
and Brethren that should be slain as they were, might be fulfilled.</hi> Lastly, God sometimes grants not the things we ask, but gives us in stead thereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is as good, or better: And then we are not to think, but that he hears us.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the power and efficacy of prayer. Now I come also to shew the like of Alms, how powerfull a means they are to procure a blessing from God: Not thy prayer onely, saith the Angel, but <hi>thine Almes also are come up for a remembrance in the sight of God.</hi> For Alms is a kinde of prayer, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a visible one, and such an one as prevails as strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God for a blessing, as any other. Hear <hi>David</hi> in the 41. <hi>Psalm, Blessed is he that considereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. 2 The Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. 3. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sicknesse.</hi> A place so evident as flashes in a mans eye. But hear <hi>Solomon</hi> speak too, <hi>Prov. 19. 17. He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord, and that which he hath given, he will pay him again.</hi> And <hi>Pro. 28. 27. He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</hi> Also <hi>Prov. 11. 25. The liberall soule shall be made fat; and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Pro. 21. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>he that watereth, shall be watered also himself.</hi> Likewise <hi>Eccles. 11. 1. Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt finde it after many days.</hi> These are for corporall blessings, and of this life; but hear also for spirituall blessings, and those of the life to come. <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 112. (quoted by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.) <hi>He hath dispersed,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:101070:156"/>
he hath given to the poor, his righteousnesse remaineth for ever, &amp;c.</hi> That is, he shall be remembred, not onely in this life, but in the life to come. <hi>Luke 16. Make to your selves</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>friends of the unrighteous Mammon,</hi> (that is, of these deceitfull and uncertain riches) <hi>that when you fail, they</hi> (that is, the friends you have made) <hi>may receive you into everlasting Tabernacles:</hi> that is, that God looking upon the Almesdeeds you have done, and hearing the prayers and blessings of the poor, may reward you with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. So S. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 17, &amp;c. <hi>Charge them that be rich in this world,—that they trust not in uncertain riches, but in the living God,—That they doe good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate: Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternall life. Non memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> (saith S. <hi>Hierome) me legere mala morte mortuum, qui libenter opera charitatis exercuit, habet enim multos intercessores, &amp; impossibile est multorum preces non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audiri.</hi> What should I say more? Shall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our sentence at the last day according to our works of mercy? <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, and inherite the Kingdome prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world: For when I was hungry, ye gave me meat, when I was thirsty, ye gave me drink, &amp;c.</hi> ye know the rest: O the wonderfull efficacy of Alms in prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God! What favour doe they finde in his sight? how are they remembred? but not for any merit in them, which is none, but of his meer mercy and mercifull promise, who accepts them in Christ our Saviour. Whence is that prayer of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> c. 12.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:101070:156"/>
concerning this case of good works, <hi>Remember me ô my God, concerning this, and spare me according to the greatnesse of thy mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much of the efficacy and prevalency which prayer and Alms have with Almighty God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a blessing from him. Now I come to the third thing propounded, The reasons why God requires them, and why they are so pleasing unto him: which reasons when they are known, will be also strong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to us why we should frequent them: For though indeed their efficacy alone were a motive sufficient to invite any reasonable man to do them; yet will these reasons adde a further enforcement thereunto. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then with prayer; the reasons why God requires this duty at our hands (I will name but the chief) are these: First, that we might acknowledge the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he hath in the gifts he bestows upon us: otherwise we would forget in what tenure we hold those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings we receive from his hands; Though therefore he be willing to bestow his benefits upon us, yet he will have us ask them before he doth it. Even as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do with their children, though they intend to bestow such things upon them as are needfull, yet they will have their children to ask them. Unlesse therefore we ask of God the things which are his to give, as we shall not receive what we have not, so we cannot lawfully use any thing we have.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another reason is, that we might be acquainted with God: <hi>Acquaint now thy self with God,</hi> saith <hi>Eliphaz</hi> Job 22. 21. <hi>and be at peace; thereby good shall come unto thee.</hi> Now acquaintance we know grows amongst men by conversing together, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:101070:157"/>
and speaking to one another. So it is here, by accustoming to speak to God in prayer we grow acquainted with him: otherwise if we grow strangers to him, and he to us, we shall not dare to behold him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Prayer is the way to keep our hearts in order: For to come often into the presence of God, breeds an holy awe in our hearts: It makes us to call our sins to remembrance with sorrow and shame, and to be afraid to commit them: we may know it by experience; men are afraid to offend those into whose presence they must often come to ask and sue for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and if they have offended, they are presently ashamed, and the first thing they do, will be to sue for pardon.</p>
                     <p>These are the reasons for prayer: Now let us see the reasons also why Alms are required; which are near of kinde to those for prayer. For first, we are to offer Alms to testifie our acknowledgement of whom we received, and of whom we hold what we have. For as by prayer we ask Gods creatures before we can enjoy them; so when we have them, there is another homage due for them, namely, of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, without which the use of the creature, which God gives us, is unclean and unlawfull to us. <hi>Every creature of God</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.) <hi>is good, if it be received with thanksgiving;</hi> not else. And the same Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. tels us, that even those things, which according to the manner of the Gentiles, were offered unto Idols, (that is, to Devils) a Christian might lawfully eat, so it were done with thanksgiving to the true and onely God: for so he should professe,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:101070:157"/>
he eat not meat of the Devils gift, or Devils Table, but of the Lords, whose of right was the earth, and the fulnesse thereof: <hi>Whether therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do else, do all to the glory of God;</hi> that is, give him the glory of the Lordship of his creature by your thanksgiving. Now our thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God for his creature, must not expresse it self in words only, but it must be also in work and deed; that is, we must yeeld him a rent and tribute of what we enjoy by his favour and blessing, which if we doe not, we lose our Tenure. This Rent is twofold; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is offered unto God, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his worship and Ministers; or that which is given for the relief of the poor, the Orphan and the Widow, which is called Alms. For not onely our riches, but our Alms are an offering unto Almighty God; So <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>He that hath pity on the poore, lendeth to the Lord:</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>He that hath mercy on the poor, honoureth his Maker.</hi> And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our will tell us at the day of Judgement, that <hi>what was done unto them, was done unto him.</hi> This then is the reason why we must give Alms, because they are the tribute of our thanksgiving, whereby we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we are Gods Tenants, and hold all we have of him; that is, of the Mannor of heaven, without which duty and service we have not the lawfull use of what we possesse. Whence our Saviour tels the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, who stood so much upon the washing of the Cup and Platter, lest their meat and drink should be unclean; <hi>Give alms,</hi> saith he, <hi>of such things as you have, and behold all things are clean to you.</hi> Luke 11. 41.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:101070:158"/>
Now that this acknowledgement of Gods Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was the end of the Offerings of the Law, both those wherewith the Priests and Levites were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and those wherewith the poor, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, and the Widow were relieved, appears by the solemne profession of those who paid them were to make, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. where he that brought a basket of first-fruits to the house of God, was to say, <hi>I professe this day unto the Lord, that I am come unto the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which the Lord sware unto our Fathers for to give us.</hi> And when the Priest had taken the basket, he was to say thus; <hi>A Syrian ready to perish was my Father, and he went down into Egypt and sojourned there with a few, and became there a Nation great and mighty, and populous. And the Egyptians evil intreated us, &amp;c. And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and out-stretched arm, &amp;c. And brought us into this land, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey. And now, behold, I have brought thee the first-fruits of the land, which thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But for Tithes the profession was made every third year, because then the course of all manner of Tithing came about. For two years they paid the Levites Tithe and the Festivall Tithe, the third year they paid the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites Tithe and the poor mans Tithe: So that year the course of Tithing being finished, the party was to make a solemne profession: When thou hast made an end (saith the Lord) of Tithing all the Tithes of thine increase, the third year, which is the year of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:101070:158"/>
(that is, when the Tithing course finisheth) and hast given it to the Levite, the Stranger, the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and the Widow, that they may eat within thy gates and be filled: Then thou shalt say before the Lord thy God; I have brought away the hallowed thing out of mine house, and also have given it to the Levite, and to the Stranger, to the Fatherlesse, and to the Widow, according to all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou hast commanded me.—Look down from thy holy habitation from heaven, and blesse thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest to our Fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>
                     <p>What we have seen in these two sorts, is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the end of all other Offerings <hi>in pios usus,</hi> (which were not sacrifices) namely, to acknowledge God to be the Lord and giver of all. As we see in that royall Offering which <hi>David</hi> with the Princes and Chieftains of Israel made for the building of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. where <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth thus; <hi>Thine ô Lord is the Kingdom, and thou art exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Head over all: Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is, to make great and to give strength unto all. Now therefore our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious Name.—For all things come of thee, and of thine hand have we given thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this reason there was never time since God first gave the Earth to the sons of men, wherein this acknowledgement was not made by setting apart of something of that he had given them, to that purpose. In the state of Paradise among all the trees in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:101070:159"/>
which God gave man freely to enjoy, one tree was <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> and reserved to God as holy, in token that he was Lord of the garden: So that the first sin of Mankinde for the <hi>species</hi> of the fact was Sacriledge, in profaning that which was holy. For which he was cast out of Paradise, and the Earth cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for his sake, because he had violated the signe of his fealty unto the great Landlord of the whole earth. Might I not say, that many a man unto this day is cast out of his Paradise, and the labours of his hands cursed for the same sin? But to go on.</p>
                     <p>After mans ejection out of Paradise, the first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that ever we read was performed unto God, was of this kinde: <hi>Abel</hi> bringing the best of his flock, and <hi>Cain</hi> of the fruit of his ground for an Offering or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto the Lord. The first spoils that ever we read gotten from an Enemy in war, paid tithes to <hi>Melchisedek the Priest of the most high God,</hi> as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement that he had given <hi>Abraham</hi> the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. <hi>Melchisedek</hi> blessing God in his name to <hi>be the possessor of heaven and earth,</hi> and <hi>to have delivered his enemies into his hand.</hi> To which <hi>Abraham</hi> said <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> by paying him Tithes of all. <hi>Iacob</hi> promiseth God, that if he would give him any thing, (for at that time he had nothing) he would give him the tenth of what he should give him: Which is as much to say, as he would acknowledge and professe him to be the giver, after the accustomed manner.</p>
                     <p>For the time of the Law, I may skip over that; it is well enough known, no man will deny it. But let us come to the time of the Gospel, which though it hath freed us from the bondage of typicall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101070:159"/>
yet hath it not freed us from the possession of our Fealty unto God as Lord of the whole earth. 'Twere strange me thinks to affirm it: I am sure the ancient Church next the Apostles thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. I will quote for a witnesse <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. tels us that our Saviour, when he took part of the Viands of his last Supper, and giving thanks with them, consecrated them into a Sacrament of his body and blood, set his Church an example of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating part of the creature <hi>in Dominicos usus; Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (saith he) <hi>dans discipulis suis consilium primitias Deo offerre ex suis creaturis, non quasi indigenti, sed ut ipsi nec infructuosi, nec ingrati sint, eum qui ex cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atura panis est, accepit &amp; gratias egit, &amp;c. Et novi Testamenti novam docuit oblationem, quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens in universo mundo offert Deo, ei qui alimenta nobis praestat, primitias suorum munerum in novo Testamento.</hi> But this is no proper occasion to follow this argument any further: I will therefore leave it, and adde a second reason why God requires Alms and such like offerings at our hands.</p>
                     <p>Namely, that we might not forget God: our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 33, &amp;c. speaking of this very matter of alms, <hi>Lay not up</hi> (saith he) <hi>for your selves treasures upon earth; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ay up for your selves treasures in heaven:—For where your treasure is, there will your heart be.</hi> The proper evill of abundance is to forget God and our dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: the remedy whereof most genuine and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall is, to pay him a rent of what we have: So shall we always think of our Landlord, and lift up our hearts to heaven in whatsoever we receive and enjoy.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:101070:160"/>
Yea, when this service is so acceptable to God, that he promiseth a great reward to those who thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and acknowledge him, how can it choose but detain our hearts in heaven in that respect also; when we shall so often think of God, not onely as the Lord and giver of what we have, but as the rewarder also of the acknowledgement we perform?</p>

Bounty, then is the <hi>righteous</hi> according to this notion the <hi>bountifull</hi> man, or as we speak the <hi>charitable.</hi> And that it is so taken in my Text, both the generall scope of the Psalm, and the connexion with the words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after, is proof sufficient; for before goes this; <hi>A good man sheweth favour and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with judgement: Surely he shall not be moved for ever:</hi> Then come the words of my Text; <hi>The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</hi> After it follows this; <hi>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousnesse remaineth for ever:</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. to promote their collection for the poor Saints at Jerusalem.</p>
                     <p>For illustration of this and our further information, it will not be amisse I hope, to commend to your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation some other places of Scripture where the word <hi>righteous</hi> is thus taken; as namely <hi>Psal. 37. 21. The wicked borroweth and payeth not again; but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth.</hi> Again, <hi>Psal. 25. 26. I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous for saken, nor his seed begging their bread. He is ever mercifull and lendeth, and his seed is blessed.</hi> Here the <hi>righteous</hi> is the mercifull and bountifull; to whom namely this blessing, that his seed shall not want, is proper and peculiar. The same use is, <hi>Prov. 10. 2. Treasures of wickednesse profit nothing, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse delivereth from death.</hi> The same is repeated again <hi>cap. 11. 4. Riches profit not in the day of wrath, but righteousnesse delivereth from death.</hi> Where <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> to be taken for <hi>alms</hi> is apparent out of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> 12. where it is so applied and rendred, namely, <hi>Alms doth deliver from death.</hi> I could adde also
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:101070:162"/>
another place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 28. but these shall be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                     <p>Hence appears their error who conceive of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Alms, as of an arbitrary thing, which they may do if they will, or not do, without sin; as that which carries no obligation with it, but is left freely to every mans discretion. And this makes some contend so much, to have the Priests maintenance granted to be eleemosynary, that so they might be at liberty to give something or nothing as they listed. But if that were so, yet if Alms be <hi>Iustitia</hi> in the Hebrew tongue, and the language which our Saviour spake. If our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our call'd them <hi>Iustitia,</hi> when he mentioned them, who dare affirm then, that <hi>Iustitia</hi> implies no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or that a man may leave it undone without sinne?</p>
                     <p>So much for the subject, <hi>The Righteous:</hi> The next is the Praedicate, <hi>shall be in everlasting remembrance: In remembrance,</hi> I said, with God and men: with God, in the life to come, and this life: Let us consider the first, The world to come.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that at the day of Judgement we shall receive our doom, according to our works of charity and mercy; and that of all the works that a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man hath done, these alone have that peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to bee then brought in expresse remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before God: <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:101070:162"/>
me, &amp;c. For asmuch as ye have done thus unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> Matth. 25. What doth my Text say? <hi>The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance;</hi> God remembers our good deeds, when he rewards them, (as he doth our prayers when he hears them;) If to remember then, be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, an everlasting reward is an everlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. 'Tis remarkable that this priviledge which the works of Bounty and Mercy shall have at the day of Judgement, was not unknown to the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for so we read in the Chaldee Paraphrast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ecclesiastes; Futurum est ut Dominus mundi dicat omnibus justis ante se constitutis, Vade, gusta cum gaudio panem tuum, ut statutum est, pro pane quem dedisti pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus &amp; obscuris qui esuriebant; &amp; bibe corde bono vinum quod repositum est tibi in horto Eden,</hi> (id est, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiso) <hi>pro vino quod miseuisti pauperibus &amp; obscuris qui sitiebant: quia ecce modò accepta sunt opera tua bona coram Domino.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason of this prelation of works of mercy at that great day is, because all we can expect at the hands of our heavenly Father is meerly of his mercy and bounty: we can hope for nothing but mercy, without mercy we are undone; according to that of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in his last Chap. <hi>Remember me, ô Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, and spare me according to the greatnesse of thy mercy.</hi> Now in those that are to be partakers of mercy, the divine wisdome requires this congruity, that they may be such as have been ready to shew mercy unto others, judging them altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of mercy at his hands who have afforded no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to their brethren: for so the Scripture tels us, that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:101070:163"/>
                        <hi>they shall have judgement without mercy, that have shewn no mercy.</hi> The tenour of our Petition for <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sins</hi> in the Lords Prayer, runs with this condition, <hi>As we forgive them that trespasse against us.</hi> And who can reade without trembling the Parable of the unmercifull servant in the Gospel, to whom his Lord revoked the Debt he meant to have forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, because he shewed no mercy to his fellow-servant, who owed him a far lesse Debt? <hi>Shouldst thou not,</hi> saith he, <hi>have shewed compassion to thy fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as I shewed compassion unto thee?</hi> This rule of congruity, I say, is the reason why at the day of our great account, we shall be judged according to our works of mercy and bounty: <hi>To do as we would be done to,</hi> hath place not onely between man and man, but between God and men.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this I speak of, manifest by the form of our last sentence onely, but by other Scriptures beside: what else means that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke 16.

                     <p>For the Christian in this point hath been no whit short of the Jew, but exceeded them rather, not in the later only, but in those better and primitive times: witnesse those anniversary remembrances of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Saints deceased; the appointing of Festivall days for their memoriall; the custome to assemble at their Sepulchres, to make Panegyrick orations in their honour; and above all, that ancient and so long continued custome without known beginning, to commemorate at the Holy Table, when the Eucharist was celebrated, the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Euangelists, Martyrs, and Confessors: All which
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:101070:166"/>
tended to this, that the <hi>memory of the righteous might be with blessing.</hi> In the extent of which blessing the Christian went beyond the Jew: for of that three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion of blessing I now spake of; first, to speak well of, or to praise: secondly, to speak well for, or to pray for: thirdly, to do well unto; the Jews seem (not only anciently, but of <note n="*" place="margin">Vid.

But the Christian added the second of prayer and good wishes for the Saints departed, namely, for their publike acquitall and consummation at the day of Resurrection: which, had it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the first and originall meaning, could not be disliked; but having roved in time, (the Mother of many Superstitions and Errors) and kindled the fire of Purgatory, it was thought fit by the Authors of our Reformation, to be disused, and the blessing of the Dead to be confined to that of praise onely, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of praising and commending them, by recounting their worthy deeds; and then secondly, of praising God for them.</p>

For, entertainment and provision for his Prophets and Ministers, in what account God hath it, appears by his great sollicitude in his Law that they should not be neglected: <hi>Take heed to thy self</hi> (saith he, <hi>Deut. 12. 19.) that thou for sake not the Levite, as long as thou livest upon the earth:</hi> What expression can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this? Again, by that story of the Shunamite woman, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 9. who entertained the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha</hi> and made provision for him, when he should have occasion to passe that way: <hi>Behold,</hi> (said she to her husband) <hi>this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 10. Let us make I pray thee a little chamber on the wall, and let us set for him there a bed, a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, and it shall be when he commeth unto us, then he shall turn in thither.</hi> How acceptable to Almighty God was this good office done to his Prophet, appears by the double miracle he wrought for her, both in giving her a childe, when her husband was now so old she despaired; and in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him again to life, when he was dead.</p>
                     <p>But let us come now to the New Testament, and see whether the like be not to be found there; lest otherwise any might think (as some are prone enough to do) the case were now altered. And first also to begin here with the provision of a place for Gods worship; the story of that Centurion of Capernaum in S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospel is worthy our consideration; <hi>Who when he heard of Iesus</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>sent unto him the Elders of the Iews, beseecbing him, he would come and heal his servant. The Elders came to Iesus, and besought him instantly, saying, He was worthy for whom he should do this.</hi> Why so? <hi>For</hi> (say they) <hi>he loveth our Nation,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101070:168"/>
and hath built us a Synagogue. Luk. 7. 4, 5. Then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> (saith the Text, without any more ado) <hi>went with them;</hi> namely, as well approving of their motive, that he who had done such a work deserved that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour should be deign'd him. Also concerning provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and entertainment for his Apostles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; Are they not our Saviours own words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise when he sent them forth? <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet shall receive a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets reward:</hi> Nay, <hi>He that should give them but a cup of cold water, should not lose his reward.</hi> According to which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the <hi>Philippians</hi> bounty and communication towards him; <hi>I have received</hi> (saith he) <hi>of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing unto God.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. concerning the like good office done him by <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> he speaks in this manner; <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus, for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain. The Lord grant unto him, that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> Which is not much unlike this of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in my Text, if it had been spoken in the first person by <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> himself, as it is in the third by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who will deny, but it implies the same thing?</p>
                     <p>Now then, if this be so as I think we have proved; What shall we think of the times we live in, when men account them the most religious to Godward, who do, or would unfurnish the House of God most, who rob his Priests most? But they have an excuse sufficient to bear them out, and what is that? The Priests they say have too much. If this excuse would
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101070:169"/>
serve turn, some of themselves perhaps might soon have lesse then they have: for sure some body else as well as the Priest, have more then they need, and might spare some of it. But whether the Priests have too much or not, will not be the question: Suppose they had; hath God too much too? For these men consider not that the propriety of such things as these is Gods, and not the Priests; and that to change the propriety of what is sacred, by alienating thereof to a profane and private use, (I say not, by diverting it from the Priests livelihood to any other holy use, in case the Priest have more then needs;) is to rob God himself: yea, God tels us so much, <hi>Malach. 3. 8. Will a man</hi> (saith he) <hi>rob his God?</hi> (as if it were a thing intolerable, and scarce ever heard of;) <hi>yet ye</hi> (saith he) <hi>have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In Tithes and Offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse, because ye have robbed me.</hi> (For that's the burden that goes with things consecrated, <hi>Cursed be he that alienates them.)</hi> This <hi>Malachi</hi> lived at the same time with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the Jews say, 'twas <hi>Ezra;</hi> whence this exprobration of his, and this fact of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> in my Text, may justly seem to have relation one to the other. And thus much of my first Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>My second is; That God rewardeth these, and so all other our good deeds and works, not for any merit or worthinesse that is in them, but of his free mercy and goodnesse; <hi>Remember me, ô my God,</hi> (saith <hi>Nehemiah) and wipe not out my good deeds:</hi> Why, is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward due to them of Justice? No; <hi>But remember me, ô my God, and spare me according to the greatnesse,</hi> or
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:101070:169"/>
multitude <hi>of thy mercy.</hi> Thus he expounds himself: And S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught us even now the self-same thing in his <hi>Votum</hi> or prayer for the house of <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> for like good service done to the Offices of Gods House; <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>grant unto him, that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day;</hi> that is, the day of Judgement, which is <hi>Tempus</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when every one shall receive according to his work.</p>
                     <p>The controversie therefore between the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists and us, is not, whether there be a reward promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto our works: we know the Scripture both of the Old and New Testament is full of testimonies that way, and encourageth us to work in hope of the reward laid up for us: <hi>We know that in keeping of Gods Commandements there is great reward;</hi> Psa. 19. 11. And that <hi>unto him that soweth in righteousnesse, shall be a sure reward;</hi> Prov. 11. 18. We know our Saviour saith, <hi>Mat. 5. 12. Blessed are ye, when men revile and persecute you,—for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Also that <hi>he that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward.</hi> And <hi>whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall give a cup of gold water only, to one of his little ones in the name of a Disciple, shall not lose his reward,</hi> Mat. 10. Again, we read <hi>Luk. 6. 35. Love your enemies, Do good and lend,—and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest:</hi> we know also what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Ep. v. 8. Look to your selves that ye lose not those things which ye have wrought, but that ye may receive a full reward.</hi> But the Question is, Whence this Reward commeth; whether from the worth or worthinesse of the work, as a debt of Justice due thereto; or from Gods mercy, as a recompence
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:101070:170"/>
freely bestowed, out of Gods gracious bounty, and not in justice due to the worth of the work it self? Which Question, me thinks, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here in my Text may determine when he saith, <hi>Remember me ô Lord for my good deeds, according to thy great mercy.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Hosea, Chap.</hi> 10. 12. when he biddeth us, <hi>Sow to our selves in righteousnesse, and reap in mercy.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. where though he saith, that <hi>the wages of sin is death,</hi> yet when he comes to eternall life, he changeth his style, <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>eternall life is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the gracious gift of God through Iesus Christ.</hi> For as for our works they are imperfect, and whatsoever they were, we owed them to him, in whom we live, and have our being, whether there were any reward or not promised for them.</p>
                     <p>Neither do we hereby any whit detract from that Axiome, That <hi>God rewardeth every man according to his work:</hi> For still the question remaineth the very same, Whether there may not be as wel <hi>merces gratiae,</hi> as <hi>merces justitiae;</hi> that is, Whether God may not judge a man according to his works, when he sits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of Grace, as well as when he sits upon his Throne of Justice. And we think here, that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> hath fully cleared the case in that one sentence, <hi>Psa. 62. 12. With thee, ô Lord, is mercy; for thou rewardest every one according to his work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay more then this; we deny not, but in some sense this reward may be said to proceed of Justice: For howsoever originally and in it self, we hold, it commeth from Gods free bounty and mercy, who might have required the work of us without all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of reward, (for as I said, we are his creatures and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:101070:170"/>
owe our being unto him) yet in regard he hath cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with us, and tied himself by his word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to conferte such a reward; the reward now in a sort proveth to be an Act of Justice, namely, of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia promissi</hi> on Gods part, not of merit on ours: Even as in forgiving our sins (which in it self all men know to be an Act of Mercy) he is said to be <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Iust, 1 Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. namely, of the faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his promise: for promise we know once made, amongst honest men is accounted a due debt. But this argues no more any worthinesse of equality in the work towards the obtaining of the reward, then if a promise of a Kingdome were made to one, if he should take up a straw; it would follow thence, that the lifting up of a straw, were a labour of a work worth a Kingdome, howsoever he that should so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise were bound to give it.</p>
                     <p>Thus was <hi>Moses</hi> carefull to put the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in minde touching the Land of Canaan, (which was a type of our eternall habitation in heaven) that it was a <hi>Land of promise,</hi> and not of merit, <hi>which God gave them to possesse, not for their righteousnesse, or for their upright heart, but that he might perform the word, which he sware unto their Fathers, Abraham, Isant, and Iaacob.</hi> Whereupon the Levites in this book of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> say in their prayer to God; <hi>Thou madest a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Abraham, to give to his seed the Land of the Canaanites, and hast performed thy word, because thou art just;</hi> that is, true and faithfull in keeping thy promise. Now because the Lord hath made a like promise of the <hi>Crown of life to them that love him,</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> sticks not in like manner to attribute this also
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:101070:171"/>
to Gods Justice; <hi>Henceforth</hi> (saith he, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.) <hi>is laid up for me a crown of righteousnesse, which the righteous Iudge shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but to all them that love his appearing.</hi> Upon which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> most sweetly, as he is wont; <hi>Est ergo quam Paulus expectat, corona Iustitiae; sed justitiae Dei, non suae: Iustum quippe est, ut reddat quod debet, debet autem quod pollicitus est.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, for the word <hi>merit;</hi> It is not the name we so much scruple at, as the thing wont now adays to be understood thereby; otherwise we confesse the name might be admitted, if taken in the large and more generall sense, for any work having relation to a reward to follow it; or whereby a reward is <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque modo</hi> obtained; In a word, as the <hi>correlatum</hi> indifferent either to <hi>merces gratiae</hi> or <hi>justitiae:</hi> For thus the Fathers used it; and so might we have done still, if some of us had not grown too proud, and mistook it, since we think it better and safer to disuse it: even as Physitians are wont to prescribe their Patients recovered of some desperate disease, not to use any more that meat or diet, which they finde to have caused it.</p>
                     <p>And here give me leave to acquaint you with an Observation of a like alteration of speech, and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for the self-same cause happening under the old Testament; namely, of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> changed into <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, Righteousnesse into that which findeth mercy: for so the Septuagint and the new Testament with them render the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Iustitia;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is taken for beneficience or alms, (as in that Tongue it is the ordinary word) in which use we are
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:101070:171"/>
wont to expound it works of mercy; but where there is no relation to Alms or Beneficence at all. Whence I gather that by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Septuagint meant not, as we commonly take it, works of mercy, but rather works whereby we finde mercy at the hands of God. I will give you a place which me thinks is very pregnant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 24, 25. where we reade thus, <hi>And the Lord commanded us to do all these Statutes,</hi> (you may see there what they are) <hi>to fear the Lord our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day. And it shall be our Righteousnesse, if we observe to do all these Commandements before the Lord, as he hath commanded us.</hi> Here the Septuagint (for, <hi>And it shall be our Righteousnesse)</hi> have, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, that whereby we shall finde mercy at the hands of God, <hi>if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to do all these Commandements, &amp;c.</hi> This place will admit no evasion; for there is no reference to Alms here: And indeed all our Righteousnesse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that whereby we finde mercy at the hands of God; and no marvell if works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as to relieve the poor and needy, be specially so called, for they above all other are the works where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shall finde mercy, and receive the reward of Blisse at the last day. And so much of my second Observation.</p>
                     <p>I come now to my third; That it is lawfull to doe good works, <hi>Intuitu mercedis:</hi> It is plain that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> here did so; <hi>Remember me, ô my God, concerning this, &amp;c.</hi> So did <hi>Moses</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Heb. 11.

                        </gap>, <hi>He had respect unto the recompence of Reward.</hi> And I confesse, it seems an unreasonable thing to me, that that which is made the end (though but in part) of the Action, should not be at all looked unto by the Agent, when as <hi>Finis</hi> is <hi>principium Actionis;</hi> and that which God hath promised unto us, as an encouragement to make us work with the more alacrity, should not be thought on, nor looked to in our working. Do not they, who would perswade this, go the way to discourage men from good works, by removing out of their sight, the encouragement which God hath given them?</p>
                     <p>But they object: The obedience of Gods children ought to be filiall, that is, free and not mercenary, as that of hirelings. I answer; Obedience, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for reward, without all respect or motive of love and duty, is the obedience of an Hireling; not that which acknowledgeth the tie of obedience absolute, and the reward no otherwise due, then of his Fathers free love and bounty, as every true childe of God doth, and ought to do.</p>
                     <p>They object again that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Charity seeks not her own:</hi> now say they, the works of Gods children must proceed from love and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I answer; what though <hi>Charity seeks not her own,</hi> may not a charitable man so much as look or hope for his own, or have an eye to what is promised him? But this place is altogether misapplied and abused: For that property of charity now mentioned (as some also of the rest of that Chapter) concerns only our
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101070:172"/>
charity towards men, and not our charity towards God: the meaning thereof being, That a charitable man will sooner lose his own, then by seeking or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for it, break the band of charity.</p>
                     <p>To conclude: The Use that follows from all this Discourse shall be only this; That if Almighty God remember them, who have done good deeds unto his House and the Offices thereof; much more ought we who are partakers of the comfort and benefit of such bounty, to remember and honour them with a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full celebration of their Names.</p>

But because the hope of reward is the most forcible spur to all undertakings, he addeth that too in the words of my Text, <hi>He that receiveth,</hi> saith he, <hi>a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Prophets reward:</hi> that is, he that receiveth a Prophet, not for any respect, but <hi>quatenus talis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a Prophet, shall have a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>Which words contain in them evidently these two Propositions: First, that there is some speciall and eminent degree of reward due unto a Prophet above
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:101070:173"/>
other men. Secondly, That he that shall entertain a Prophet, and do any good office unto him under that name, that is, for his office sake, shall be partaker of that Reward. Of these two I intend to treat, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the first, the more generall.</p>
                     <p>That there shall be differing degrees of Reward in the life to come, is evident by sundry places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: As first, from that so often iterated passage, wherein God is said <hi>to reward every man according to his works;</hi> which is not to be understood only of the differing quality of our works, good and evill, which God rewards accordingly, the one with everlasting blisse, the other with eternall fire, (as some here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept) but also of the differing works of just men compared together, as is manifest by that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. where the Apostle comparing his own and <hi>Apollo's</hi> work together, saying, <hi>He had planted, and Apollo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;</hi> addes, That <hi>both should receive their reward, according to their work;</hi> that is, as their work differed, so should their reward do. In the second place the same is represented by that Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. of the ten servants who received of their Lord, being to go into a far Countrey, ten pounds to trade with till his return. At what time he that had increased his pound to ten pounds, was made ruler over ten Cities; He that had gained but five pounds, over five Cities, and so the rest, according as they had improved the stock given them. A third place is that 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 42. There is one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars, for one star differeth from another in glory. So also is the Resurrection of the dead.</hi> Here is the full stop, and not the words to be referred to that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:101070:174"/>
which follows, to wit, That <hi>the body is sown in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and riseth again in incorruption,</hi> as some would have them. For the Apostle speaks here of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of things heavenly and glorious, <hi>(one star,</hi> saith he, <hi>differs from another in glory;)</hi> and not of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between glorious, and inglorious, corruptible and incorruptible: For this belongs to his other si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; <hi>There are celestiall bodies, and bodies terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall, but the glory of the celestiall is one, and the glory of the terrestriall is another.</hi> A fourth place is that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. where the Apostle speaking of the reward of beneficence, avoucheth, that <hi>he which soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, shall reap sparingly, and he that soweth bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, shall reap bountifully.</hi> Fifthly, that speech of our Saviour to the twelve, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. imports as much; <hi>Behold, we,</hi> saith S. <hi>Peter, have forsaken all and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee:</hi>

                        </gap>, <hi>in the Regeneration,</hi> or Resurrection, <hi>when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his Glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> relates it upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; whereby it appears our Saviour uttered it more then once, <hi>You</hi> (saith he to the Twelve) <hi>are they which have continued with me in my temptations: Therefore I appoint you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdome, and sit on Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel. Luk. 22. 28, &amp;c.</hi> Whatsoever is meant by the reward intimated in this expression, for the quality thereof: 'Tis plain there is some peculiar and more eminent degree of glory here promised the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:101070:174"/>
which shall not be common to others with them: First, because it is the reward of their proper and peculiar service unto Christ, as the Text shews. Secondly, because these twelve thrones in regard of their number, can befit no more but these twelve. Thirdly, supposing the twelve Tribes of Israel here mentioned, to be likewise in a condition of blisse and happinesse; it must needs be, that those who <hi>sit upon twelve Thrones to judge,</hi> that is, to govern them, must be in a higher degree of dignitie, then those over whom they shall be set: Whatsoever therefore the meaning of the reward be, thus much may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the description thereof, That there shall be differing degrees of glory in the Kingdome of Christ to come. To conclude; It hath been the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and constant Tradition of the Church, testified by the unanimous consent of all the Fathers, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver questioned by any, untill that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in this last age Age first began to doubt thereof, and others since more boldly adventured to contradict it.</p>
                     <p>Their main reasons or objections are these two: First, that the Reward to come depends not upon the virtue or dignity of our works, but only upon the merit and satisfaction of Christ: But his merits and satisfaction is uniform and the same to all: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Reward also which is to be given by virtue thereof shall be so. This Objection proceeds from that scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity, which many of ours have to admit of any relation or connexion between our works and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come: Whence also is that, that they should not be done <hi>intuitu mercedis;</hi> which is an assertion repugnant to the tenour of the Scripture, where the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:101070:175"/>
Holy Ghost is wont to ground his Exhortations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hope and promise of reward. Now what an unreasonable conceit is it to think that where wages is promised for the encouragement of the labourer, the labourer should be bound to work without having any eye or respect to his wages? But to the objection I answer thus; That it is true, the merits and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ is the foundation of our reward, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that alone which makes our works capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, without which they were not: neverthelesse it is true also, that our works are the subject of Reward; and the same merit of Christ, makes differing works capable of a different reward.</p>
                     <p>Their other objection hath a little more likelihood, and seems therefore somewhat more difficult to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: It is taken from the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. where the Kingdome of heaven is compared to a Vineyard, the Master whereof went out in the morning to hire labourers, and agreed with them for a peny a day: Three hours after, or at the third hour, and so again at the sixth and ninth hours; yea at the eleventh, but an hour before Sun went down, he did likewise. And when they came all to receive their wages, he gave the last hired as much as he had agreed with the first, to wit, every one a peny, neither more nor lesse: Whence it seems to follow, that the reward to come, signified by the <hi>peny,</hi> shall not be proportioned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the difference of works, but be one and the same to all.</p>
                     <p>I answer; First, the Parable proves no more but this; that the sooner or later comming of men into the Vineyard of the Church, (for all were not to be
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:101070:175"/>
called at one time, nor in one age) shall not make their reward greater or lesser: not that the reward shall not be different according to the diversity of our works. Secondly, I adde, that this Parable hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Churches of the Jews and Gentiles not called, nor to be called at the same time: For the Jews were hired into the Vineyard betimes in the morning, the Gentiles not till the day was far spent; yet shall they by the goodnesse of their heavenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster receive the same reward of eternall life, which was promised to the Jew, with whom the Covenant was first made, and who bare the heat of the day, whilest the other stood idle. Besides, in the new Vineyard of the Gospel the turn is changed; for into it (because the Jews would not) the Gentiles have first been hired, though at severall hours, the Jew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to come in untill the eleventh hour; yet when Christ comes to give us wages, shall receive his peny, that is, eternall life as well as we.</p>
                     <p>This to be the genuine scope of the Parable, may be gathered by that which is presently subjoined by our Saviour as it were to be the key thereof. <hi>So the last</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall be first, and the first last;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>for many are called, but few are chosen:</hi> which I understand thus; <hi>The last,</hi> that is, the Gentiles who came in last, shall be the first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Christs Kingdome. The Jews who were first in Covenant, and had wrought so long before us in Gods Vineyard, shall be last in the Covenant of Christ, and not converted till the fulnesse of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be come in: For though many of them were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited at the first comming of Christ, yet few or none
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101070:176"/>
obeyed, and so the Nation became not of his <hi>peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> but stands yet rejected; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. To the like purpose is the same speech used by our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 13. They shall come,</hi> saith he, <hi>from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God. And behold, there are last, which shall be first, and there are first, which shall be last.</hi> What means this? Out of the eighth of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where the same pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is related, we shall hear it expounded; for there the words run thus, <hi>Many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, in the Kingdom of heaven: But the children of the Kingdom</hi> (that is, the whole generation of Israel, who received not the Gospel, at the Preaching of Christ and his Apostles, and all the generations since, who have continued in unbeleef) <hi>shall be cast out into utter darknesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here by the way, because the Parable useth the notion of a day, to signifie a time of many ages; it will not be altogether unseasonable to note, that the Metaphor may appear the easier, how that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture often elsewhere cals the whole time of mans pilgrimage in this world, by the name of a <hi>Day;</hi> As, <hi>To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. <hi>Exhort one another</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus having cleared my Proposition <hi>in thesi,</hi> or in generall; That there shall be differing degrees of glory in the reward to come: It remains that I make it good in the <hi>hypothesis</hi> concerning a <hi>Prophet;</hi> namely, that to them who instruct others in the ways and will of God, which is the Office of a Prophet, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs a preheminence of reward, above and besides that which is common to all Saints. This prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of glory the Schoolmen term <hi>Aureola,</hi> that is, an Additament of felicity to that essentiall glory in the Vision of God, which they term <hi>Aurea:</hi> This <hi>Aureola</hi> or Coronet to be added to the Crown of glory, they ascribe to three sorts of persons; To Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, to Martyrs, and to Doctors or <hi>Prophets.</hi> The two first are out of my scope: The third, of <hi>Prophets,</hi> let us see how it is proved out of Scripture. First therefore it is apparent from my Text, <hi>He that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward; Ergo,</hi> there is some speciall or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reward belonging to a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and that too an eminent one; otherwise our Saviours speech will have no enforcement in it, as he that considers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may easily see. The second is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. where
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:101070:177"/>
the Angel prophesying of the Resurrection to be at the end of Time, and saying, <hi>That many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake; some to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and some to shame, and everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;</hi> he addes, <hi>And those that be wise</hi> (that is, have learned the true wisdome, which consists in the fear of God) <hi>shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament. But those that turn many unto righteousnesse</hi> (that is, the Teachers and Instructers) <hi>as the stars for ever and ever.</hi> Here the difference between those that teach and are taught, is as much as between the light of the Stars, and the brightnesse of the Firmament. Some will have the whole sentence to speak of the eminency of glory laid up for <hi>Prophets,</hi> Translating <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the first place not <hi>docti</hi> or <hi>intelligentes,</hi> but <hi>Doctores: The Teachers shall shine as the brightnesse of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they that turn many unto righteousnesse, as the stars for ever and ever:</hi> but I have followed that interpretation, which our Translators thought most likely. Thirdly, to this eminency of glory the Angel seems also to have respect in the end of that Chapter, when he says, <hi>But go thy way Daniel, till the end be; for thou shalt rest, and stand up in thy lot at the end of days: in sorte tua,</hi> i. <hi>in sorte Prophetarum.</hi> And this perhaps may be that too which our Saviour intends, <hi>Mat. 5. Qui fecerit &amp; docuerit, magnus vocabitur</hi> (i. <hi>erit) in regno coelorum.</hi> The reason of all this is, because those who teach &amp; convert others to righteousness, have an interest and a kind of title to all the good works which they shall do: How then can their reward but be great and eminent, when not onely their own works, but the works of their converts and disciples, shall be brought into their account?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:101070:177"/>
A matter, if we consider it, of no small encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and comfort unto us, whom God hath placed in this condition to be Teachers and Instructers of others, if so be we bury not our Talent in a Napkin, but imploy it for the advantage of our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. For it is not the habit or faculty, but the work, which shall reap the reward we speak of: Happy are we therefore, if we neglect not this opportunity of blisse, which God hath given us.</p>
                     <p>And thus having done with the first Proposition I undertook, I come unto the second; which is, That <hi>he that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall be partaker of a Prophets reward: He that receives,</hi> that is, doth any good office, or deserves well of a Prophet: For this to be the meaning, may appear by that which follows; <hi>He that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous mans reward;</hi> where <hi>righteous</hi> is to be taken by way of eminency, for one of eminent sanctity, such as among the Jews had therefore the sirname of <hi>Iusti,</hi> as <hi>Simeon Iustus, Iacobus Iustus,</hi> and other the like. Then in the next words the expression is varied; <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall give to drink to one of these little ones, a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, shall not lose his reward:</hi> whence I say we may gather what good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the word <hi>receiving</hi> before used, intimated to us, namely, to relieve, maintain, support, and the like. He therefore that thus <hi>receives a Prophet, shall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>of a Prophets reward;</hi> that is, have an eminent reward, or of the quality of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, though himself be none.</p>
                     <p>The reason is, because he that supports and enables
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:101070:178"/>
a Prophet for his duty, hath an interest in his work, and consequently in the reward that belongs unto it: This appears by the contrary, because he that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and abets those, who commit an evil act, makes himself guilty of their sin, and so of the punishment due to the same. An example whereof we have in that of the Benjamites in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> who by abetting the men of Gibeah, who committed that foul abomination with the Levites Wife, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty of their sin, and brought that hideous judgement, which at first was deserved only by a few sons of Beliall, upon the Heads of the whole Tribe: It is a known story. Now it is <hi>par ratio</hi> for a man to entitle himself to anothers good works, as to his ill.</p>
                     <p>But there is a modification in the Text, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reward we speak of depends, otherwise not to be looked for: And that is, This good office must be done <hi>in nomine Prophetae,</hi> not for any other respect, then as he is, and because he is a <hi>Prophet: He that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a Prophet</hi> in nomine Prophetae, <hi>shall receive a Prophets reward:</hi> not he that receives him onely for some personall or by-respect, because he is his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, friend, or friends ally, or which is the ground of the most respect the Prophet gets among the most now adays, because he is one of their own side and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but setting all such respects aside, <hi>eo nomine quia Prophet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> with meer respect to their office and calling, or because they are (as <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in their Rescript <hi>apud Theodoretum</hi> cals them) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Procuratores magni Regis.</hi> I may tell you that this is no ordinary thing now adays;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101070:178"/>
we may perhaps finde some that can be content to make much of the Prophet for some personall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his, or perhaps because he hath abilities above ordinary, or because it may be he is like to further the way they wish good luck to, or that they may gain repute among some sort of men, or other respects of like nature. But are there many which regard them <hi>in nomine Prophetae?</hi> How then comes it to passe that their courtesies are so appropriate to the persons of some, that they shew no respect or esteem to the calling in others?</p>
                     <p>Whence comes that Unchristian, or indeed Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isticall language, A base Priest, A paultry Priest? It would never have grieved me, if any other had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me thus, but to be served thus by a base Priest, who can endure it? Tell me in good earnest, is this to honour a Priest or a Prophet <hi>in nomine Prophetae;</hi> or not rather point-blank unto it, to reproach and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him under that reverend Name; that is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and reproach the Calling it self? For can a man honour that condition, the name whereof he thinks to be a reproach? Is any man wont to say, A base Lord, A base Knight, A base Gentleman, A base Christian? No: And why? because he accounts them all terms and titles of honour. Judge then by this, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they make of Gods <hi>Ambre,</hi> who turn the very title of their Calling into a name of reproach, and what reward by proportion they are like to merit at Christs hands: Not a Prophets I am sure; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Christians or not, themselves may judge. 'Tis often, and too often true indeed, that for our persons we are unworthy of any better respect, but even then
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101070:179"/>
it best appears, whether a man hath respect to the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>eo nomine,</hi> when there is nothing in the Person to move him to it.</p>
                     <p>But there is another sort of men, who honour not a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, yet behinde, namely, such as rob and spoil them of their livelihood and daily bread, and not onely themselves give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to enable and encourage them the better to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Ministery; but take from them severall ways, that which the piety and bounty of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors hath allotted them; yea to many, if not to the most, no gain or theft is more sweet, then that which is gotten out of the Priests portion: But whether it will prove so at that day, when the just God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man according to his works, may be greatly feared. I told you a little before, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why <hi>he that receives a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, shall be partaker of a Prophets reward,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he that supports and enables a Prophet to do his duty, hath thereby an interest in his work, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the reward due to the same. If this be so; what can they look for, who by subtracting their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread from them, hinder and disenable them from the free and chearfull performance of their duty, by distracting them with the cares of providing for their bodily life? Do they not derive upon themselves the guilt of whatsoever impediment comes hereby to the propagation of the Kingdom of Christ? Shall not the losse of every soul that perisheth for want of due provision to maintain an able Minister, be cast in their account at the last day? I will speak nothing now of the burden which Sacriledge it self, being a robbing
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:101070:179"/>
of God, carries with it, (see <hi>Prov. 20. 25. It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy; and after vows to make enquiry;)</hi> nor of those dreadfull execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Donors of such things were wont <hi>antiquo ritu,</hi> to lay upon the heads of all such as should divert them to profane uses, wherewith these men willingly and wilfully involve themselves. But for a close, let us join in an humble and hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Gods goodnesse and mercy, and say, Blessed be God our heavenly Father, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the malignity of many, hath not left us destitute, but in every age hath raised up some to shew kindnesse unto the Prophets, and to provide enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for them: Witnesse the goodly structures, and liberall endowments in our two Seminaries for the entertainment and education of Prophets and Prophets Sons; being the bounty of those Worthies, the fruits of whose Piety and Devotion, the whole Church of God by his Divine goodnesse doth enjoy; To whose blessed Names, as their deserts challenge from us, let all due honour and thankfulnesse be for ever rendred.</p>

Concerning whose name, (though observations drawn from names are like an house raised upon the sand, yet because of old, and among the Patriarchs Names were given by the Spirit of Prophecy;) it will not be altogether unworthy our speculation, to remember the reason why this Name Levi was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; which we shall see as truly verified in that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to which God did advance his posterity, as it was by his Mother fitly given to himself, upon the good hope she conceived at his birth.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Levi</hi> signifies a Conjoyner, an Uniter or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of union; for thus said <hi>Leah</hi> when she bare him; <hi>Now at this time will my husband be joyned to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have born a third son: And she called his name, Levi.</hi> She called him <hi>Levi;</hi> but for ought we reade, in regard of her self, she found him no <hi>Levi</hi> as she ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; but she prophecied of that sacred office, whereby all the sons of <hi>Levi</hi> became conjoyners, became ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of union, not between <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:101070:181"/>
God and Man, between Christ and his Spouse, between the spirituall <hi>Iacob</hi> and his deformed <hi>Leah.</hi> For as truly as ever <hi>Leah</hi> spake, might the Church then, and may the Church now, affirm, when she hath born these sons unto her husband; Now I know my heavenly husband, my Lord my God, will be joyned to me, because I have born him these <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, these sons of Union, these Ministers of reconciliation. <hi>Plato</hi> could say, a Priest was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, A friend-maker between God and men: Nay, his whole office is nothing but the service of peace, and that not only between God and man, but between man and his brother; for <hi>how can he love God, who loves not his brother?</hi> or how can he be at peace with God, who is at variance with his brother? Needs must he therefore that is Minister of the one, be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the other also; and he that is so, nay he alone that is so, is a right Levite, and a true son of Union.</p>
                     <p>How unworthy then of this holy name, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to succeed in the holy Order of <hi>Levi,</hi> are those who are Ministers of division, who by their lives, doctrine, example, or any other way divide God and his Church, and the Church within it self; who neither have peace with God themselves, nor will suffer others to have it; who neither agree themselves with others, nor suffer others to agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? <hi>Beati pacifici, Blessed are the peace-makers,</hi> especially in the sons of Peace. This Christ prayed for in his <hi>Apostles, Ioh.</hi> 17. saying, <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy name, that they may be one as we are one.</hi> Christ is so one, that he makes all one, who are one in him; so should every son of <hi>Levi</hi> be one. In
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:101070:181"/>
summe, the Ministers of God are called Angels, and therefore should sing a song like unto that song of Angels, <hi>Glory be to God on high, peace on earth, and good will amongst men.</hi> That Church which hath such a Levite, such a Minister, such a son of Union, may truly take up the words of <hi>Micah, Iudg.</hi> 17. and say, <hi>Now I know the Lord will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my Priest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus much of the name <hi>Levi:</hi> Now I come unto the Tribe it self; concerning which there may be two things asked: First, why God did confine the Priesthood to one Tribe alone, and not suffer it to be common to all, as it was before the Law, and is now since the Law? Secondly, why <hi>Levi</hi> was chosen to this holy Function rather then any other Tribe?</p>
                     <p>To the first, why God did limit this holy Function to one Tribe only, some of the Jews make this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: That one of the sons of Israel with his whole posterity was due unto God by virtue of Jacobs vow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. which was, that if God would be with him in his journey, and bring him back again unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, <hi>of all that thou shalt give me,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will give the tenth unto thee;</hi> Now because God gave children, as well as beeves and sheep, therefore they also must fall within compasse of his Vow. And that there might be no difficulty about tithing the odde children, because there were more then ten, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise this way to make all even: for first, say they, the full number of <hi>Iacobs</hi> children was fourteen, because that <hi>Iosephs</hi> two sons <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> go in the number of <hi>Iacobs</hi> sons: for <hi>Iacob Gen.</hi> 48. said unto <hi>Ioseph, Thy two sons which are born unto thee in the land
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:101070:182"/>
of AEgypt before I came into AEgypt, shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are mine; but thy lineage which thou begettest after them shall be thine.</hi> Now of these fourteen, four were the Lords by his right unto the first-born, for so many there were which first opened the womb of their four Mothers, <hi>Rahel</hi> and <hi>Leah, Bilhah</hi> and <hi>Zilpah, Iacobs</hi> two Wives and his two Concubines: Now of the remainder being ten, one fals to Gods share for Tithe, as being comprized within their Fathers Vow.</p>
                     <p>This reason, though it be as you see handsomely framed, yet hath no great likelihood, because men use not to be tithed; and therefore this extent of the Vow, is beyond the intent of the Vower. And whereas they urge the words, <hi>of all that thou shalt give me;</hi> they seem to forget, that God gave unto <hi>Iacob</hi> besides his sons, great store of man-servants and maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants, and yet we reade not that any of these were dedicate unto God, or that he challenged any of their posterity.</p>
                     <p>The only or chief cause (if I am not deceived) why God restrained the Priestly Function to one Tribe, was for a sign and band of restraint of his Church to one people: For, as the Church cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the sacred Function of holy Ministery; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the condition thereof must follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Ministery. As long therefore as none could be a Priest but of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> so long there could be no Church, but of that people whereof Levi was a Tribe. A point of sacred Policy so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the choice of Ministers, as shall be most fit to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the present state of an established Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="355" facs="tcp:101070:182"/>
The other question we propounded was, Why God chose <hi>Levi</hi> before any other Tribe? And of this many reasons may be given: As first, for <hi>Moses</hi> sake, whom God would honour by advancing the house of his Father to the highest pitch of dignity that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man could attain to: for what greater honour then to be Embassadour of the Lord of Hosts, to be admitted unto the inspection of his most secret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; to be Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, his proper and peculiar portion. Would God they either knew or beleeved this, who think their house disgraced, and their blood stained, if any of their Kin become of the Clergy. It was not so in Gods opinion, no, nor <hi>Moses</hi> his neither, for had it been, <hi>Levi</hi> of all Tribes should not have been Gods <hi>holy one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Reason was the Nobility of this Tribe, for <hi>Levi</hi> was enabled both generally, as being the son of a lawfull Wife, and not the son of an Handmaid; and specially as being of kin to <hi>Moses</hi> the Prince of the Congregation: In the first respect he was nobler then many of his brethren; in the second, more noble then any of them. This example of Gods own choice of men for his holy Service, if we would look unto, we would not sin the sin of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> to make Priests almost of no other but of the lowest of the people: I speak not only of the lowest for externall condition, but of the lowest for the gifts of their minde; for I know it is true which the Virgin hath in her <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat,</hi> That God often <hi>puts down the mighty from their seats, and exalteth them of low degree.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. I know it is true that he often <hi>filleth the hungry with good things, and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:101070:183"/>
the rich he sends empty away:</hi> but we should know that whensoever we offer unto him, he requireth the best thing in our hands; and therefore for this worthy Calling we are to give unto him, as far as may be, the worthiest among the sons of men.</p>
                     <p>Another reason why God chose this Tribe afore other, may be the smalnesse thereof, being not above the sixtieth part of the people: A number which God in his wisdome saw fit for that Church, as being both sufficient for instructing the people, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties of their order; and not too great to live of Gods ordinary, his Tithes and the other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Altar, whereas the least of the other Tribes were as big as three of it.</p>
                     <p>But the last Reason, and as it seems one of the chiefest, is that which <hi>Moses</hi> intimates in the very verse following my Text, speaking thus of Levi, that <hi>he said unto his Father and to his Mother, I have not seen them; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children; but observed Gods word and kept his Covenant.</hi> In which words <hi>Moses</hi> alludes unto their forward zeal to avenge the Lord of the people which worshipped the golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. where it is said, that <hi>Moses stood in the gate of the camp and cried, Whosoever is on the Lords side, let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves unto him. Then said Moses, Thus saith the Lord God of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the Camp, and slay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For Moses had said,</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:101070:183"/>
(so it follows in the Text) <hi>Consecrate your selves unto the Lord this day, even every man upon his son, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his brother, that there may be given you ablessing this day.</hi> This blessing here spoken of is our Urim and Thummim, the blessing of Sacred Order: So boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully did God reward them who were so forward to be on his side when <hi>Moses</hi> called them, that himself vouchsafed to call them unto his side for ever.</p>
                     <p>Whence, first, we may learn whom we are chiefly to preferre unto this holy Function, namely, those who are zealous for the Lord of Hosts, who preferre the glory of God above all worldly respects whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: This got <hi>Phinehas</hi> the son of <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Priesthood; this got all the sons of <hi>Levi</hi> the guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Urim and Thummim, the blessing of holy Orders.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we may see by the advancement of this Tribe, how mercifull our God is: We know that <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi>'s fury did once as much offend him, as his sons zeal now pleased him; and yet for this one action he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the sin of their Father in the bloody slaughter of the Sichemites: He remembred not the curse of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Into their secret let not my soul come: My glory be not thou joyned with their assembly. Cursed be their wrath, for it was fierce, and their rage, for it was cruell. Gen.</hi> 49. 6, 7. Nay, he turned the very curse of <hi>Iacob</hi> into a blessing, <hi>By dividing them in Iacob, and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in Israel.</hi> Here mercy and Truth met both together, and Justice and Peace kissed each other. Lastly, here God verified his own description of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, That though he be a <hi>jealous God, and visits the sins of the father upon the children unto the third and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101070:184"/>
fourth generation,</hi> yet he is also a mercifull God, and <hi>shews mercy</hi> even <hi>unto the thousandth generation of them that love him and keep his Commandements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus have you seen why of <hi>Levi Moses</hi> said this Blessing. <hi>And of Levi he said.</hi> Now I come to the description of this blessed Tribe in these words, Gods <hi>holy one: Let thy Vrim and thy Thummim be with thy holy one.</hi> How is <hi>Levi</hi> here called <hi>Holy?</hi> how is this Title given to him above the rest of his Brethren? Are not all the Lords people holy? certainly whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is meant hereby, it is something more specially belonging to <hi>Levi,</hi> then to any other Tribe. Which, that we may the better finde, we must take notice of a threefold holinesse; <hi>Essentiall, Habituall, Relative.</hi> Essentiall holinesse is the holinesse of God, all one with God himself, and this is a glorious holinesse: <hi>Who</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) is like unto thee ô Lord among the Gods? who is like unto thee, glorious in holinesse? Exo.</hi> 15 11. Habituall I call an inherent holinesse, such as is the holinesse of righteous men, integrity of life, or righteous holinesse, whereof <hi>Abraham, Iob, David,</hi> and all the Patriarchs are called Saints and holy men: This is that which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Latines <hi>Sanctimonia.</hi> Relative holinesse I define a speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or relation of peculiarity which a thing hath unto God, either in regard of propriety of possession, or speciality of presence: that which is holy after this manner the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Latines, <hi>Sacrum.</hi> The first of these three is proper to God alone, for he only is essentially holy. The second is proper to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures; for they are only habitually holy, or endued with holy qualities. But the last is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:101070:184"/>
to all manner of things; for all things animate or inanimate are capable of relative holinesse, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity towards God: Persons, Things, Times, Places. Persons, so the Nazarites of the Law are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy; thus was <hi>Sampson,</hi> thus was <hi>Samuel</hi> holy from their Mothers womb. Things, so the Offerings of the Law, yea and of the Gospel too, are holy things: The censers of <hi>Korah</hi> and his company were Holy, <hi>because</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>they offered them unto the Lord.</hi> Times, so the Sabbath day and other Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall days are holy days. Places, so the Temple of the Lord is an holy Place; Mount Sion an holy Mount; yea the ground about the bush where God appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> is called <hi>Holy ground.</hi> And of these four, Persons, Things, and Times are holy, because of Gods peculiar propriety in them, in that they are his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, his Things, and his Times: But Places are holy in another regard, because of Gods speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Presence in them.</p>
                     <p>Now let us see in which of all these three ways, <hi>Levi</hi> may be said to be holy: Essentially holy he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, for he was not God, but the holy one of God. Habitually holy the event shews he was not more then the rest, though he should have been. The Tribe of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>vi</hi> was always <hi>Tribus sacra, holy unto the Lord,</hi> but was not always righteous before the Lord. It was not always true of <hi>Levi,</hi> that he <hi>walked before God in peace and equity, and turned many from iniquity;</hi> but often, yea too often <hi>they were gone out of the way, and caused many to fall by the Law. Phinehas</hi> the son of <hi>Eli,</hi> was not like <hi>Phinehas</hi> the son of <hi>Aaron: Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> high Priests, as holy as any for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:101070:185"/>
as unholy as any in life and conversation.</p>
                     <p>It should therefore seem, that <hi>Levi</hi> should be only called holy by a Relative holinesse; namely, because he was Gods peculiar one, because his offered one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his peculiar of peculiars; that is, his peculiar Tribe of his peculiar People; for in this <hi>Levi</hi> had a priviledge above the rest, in the other none: and this <hi>Ezra</hi> gives unto him <hi>cap.</hi> 8. 28. when he delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Levites the holy Vessels, <hi>Ye are holy</hi> (saith he) <hi>unto the Lord, and these Vessels are holy also:</hi> that is, Ye are holy as the Vessels are; for he saith not, they were holy <hi>before</hi> the Lord, for so he had meant holy in life; but holy <hi>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>to</hi> the Lord; <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Relative holinesse.</p>
                     <p>But though this be true that <hi>Levi</hi> was holy after this manner, yet the word which in my Text is turned Holy, seems scarce to admit of this construction: for the word here used is not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, which signifies favourable and gracious, and in Religion charitable and godly: All which leans to an habituall, not to a respective holinesse. But because <hi>Levi</hi> was not in this sort holy above other, as I said before; It may seem therefore it should be thus construed: That <gap reason="foreign">

We therefore whom God hath set apart to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster about holy things; we who are holy unto the Lord, and Gods own in a peculiar manner; we who have a speciall relation unto God; we who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a speciall favour from God; we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we owe a speciall thankfulnesse unto him: we who are Gods peculiars, must demean our selves peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both toward God and man: we are unto God as other men are not, and therefore may not always do as other men do; we cannot reason from others to our selves, no not in things of themselves lawful, Why should not we do as every man may do; for all that is lawfull for others, will not be seemly for us; for we are the houshold servants of the most High, we are speciall men, of whom God requires a speciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in life and actions.</p>
                     <p>This was one cause why God injoyned the Jews so many peculiar rites and speciall observations differing from the fashions of other people, because they were his peculiar people, an holy Nation; because they were toward him as no other was, though all the world were his, and therefore would have their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners differ from the fashion of all other Nations, as a badge and acknowledgement of that speciall relation they had to him above other. <hi>Levit. 20. 25. I</hi> (saith God) <hi>am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people; ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, unclean fowls and clean, &amp;c. And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that you should be mine.</hi> This was also a cause why God restrained the Priests of the Law from that which was lawful for the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:101070:186"/>
rest of the people; They might drink no Wine; they might not mourn for their kin; they might not marry a divorced woman: the reason of all this is given, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were holy unto the Lord;</hi> that is, with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holinesse, as being Gods men in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and therefore required they should specially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themselves in their lives. These observations indeed were ceremoniall, but there is something mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in them: And therefore in the Gospel we hear of some speciall things required in a Minister; as that <hi>he should have a good report of those who were without;</hi> this was not required in every one who was to be a Christian. Again, S. <hi>Paul</hi> requires in a Bishop, that <hi>he should be the husband of one wife;</hi> this was not in those times required of every one who was to be a Christian. I shall not need to tell you what speciall demeanour the ancient Church bound her Clergy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but it came to passe at last this rule was over pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by them, for hence it was that a Bishop might not marry at all, that Priests and Deacons might not marry being once in Orders, and at last marriage was quite forbidden them all. Thus our Fathers erred on the right hand, but we go aside on the left: they restrained their Clergy from that which was lawfull for, and beseemed all men; we think almost that lawful for us, which is lawfull for no man, at least we think that which any man may do we may do also: But there is a golden mean between these extremes, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that finds it, for he alone shall demean himself like himself, like a Levite, like Gods holy one.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from this speciall title given to <hi>Levi,</hi> we may note how causlesly some are offended to hear
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101070:187"/>
those who minister about holy Things, distinguished from others by names of holinesse and peculiarity; to hear them called <hi>Clerus,</hi> and <hi>Clerici,</hi> as it were the Heritage of God; for so saith S. <hi>Hierome, Clerus dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, quia sors Dei sumus.</hi> But say they, are not the People also Gods heritage? Doth not S. <hi>Peter</hi> call them <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when he forbids Presbyters, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to domineer over Gods heritage? I confesse he doth: But those who reason after this manner come too near the language of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Num. 16. Moses and Aaron, you take too much upon you; Is not all the Congregation holy, every one of them? and is not the Lord among them? why then lift ye your selves above the Congregation of the Lord?</hi> If this reasoning had been good, wherein had these Rebels offended? It could not be denied them, that all the People were an holy People; for they might have alledged the testimony of God himself, avouching them to be his peculiar People, and an holy People unto the Lord their God; <hi>All the earth</hi> (saith he <hi>Exod. 19.) is mine, but you shall be my</hi> Segulla, <hi>my peculiar people, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Priests, and an holy Nation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it might be answered them, Though all the people were Gods peculiar people, and therefore his holy ones, yet <hi>Levi</hi> was his peculiar Tribe of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, and therefore comparatively his only <hi>holy one.</hi> All the Land of Canaan was the Lords; <hi>The Land is mine,</hi> saith he, and therefore it could not be alienate beyond the year of Jubilee, and yet for all this there were some parts of the Land specially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Holy unto the Lord: All the increase of corn, all the increase of wine, all the fruit of the field was the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:101070:187"/>
Lords, and yet the offerings alone were called holy unto the Lord. God himself cals them his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, his inheritance, and therefore gave them unto that Tribe alone, which alone he had made his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Tribe of his inheritance: So the offered Tribe lived of Gods offerings, the holy Tribe on the holy things. Again, why may we not call our Clergy Gods inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, when God himself cals the Levites his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites? <hi>Thou shalt</hi> (saith he <hi>Num. 8.) separate the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be my Levites;</hi> that is, my <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, my Clergy. Why may not we call the Ministers of Christ his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, when he himself cals them the gift his Father gave him out of the world? for so he saith <hi>Ioh. 17. I have declared thy name unto the men thou gavest me out of the world, thine they were and thou gavest them me:</hi> and again, <hi>Holy Father, keep them in thy name, even them whom thou hast given me.</hi> If you say he speaks here of all his Elect, the words following prove the contrary; for <hi>those</hi> (saith he) <hi>whom thou hast given me, I have kept, and none of them is lost but the child of perdition.</hi> Here he plainly affirms, he lost one of those his Father gave him, wherefore he speaks not of his elect ones, for those no man can take out of his hands. Again, <hi>ver. 18. As thou didst send me into the world,</hi> saith he, <hi>so I send them into the world:</hi> but I hope all the Elect are not sent, as Christ was sent by his Father. I conclude therefore, so long as God in the Law says specially of the Levites, <hi>They are mine:</hi> so long as Christ in the Gospel of his Apostles, <hi>They are mine, ô Father, which thou hast given me out of the world;</hi> it is neither arrogancy, nor injury, to style those who

minister about holy things with the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the inheritance of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>What <hi>Levi</hi> was, and what is meant by this Title Gods <hi>holy one,</hi> we have now shewed sufficiently. It remains we should come unto the words containing the blessing it self, which is called <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> the words themselves signifie <hi>light</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination and Integrity: good endowments certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whosoever shall enjoy them.</p>
                     <p>But because they are not only Appellative words, but also proper names of certain things, we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further what is meant by them; and that in a twofold consideration; First, specially and properly as they are names of certain things belonging in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall unto the High Priest: Then generally, as they are applied by <hi>Moses</hi> unto the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> The first again shall be twofold, what they were in the High Priest personally; or what they signified in him typically, himself being also a Type.</p>
                     <p>For the first, what is meant by these things, as they belong unto the High Priest personally, is a matter full of controversie; and therefore that we may the better proceed, we will first see the generals wherein all or the most agree; and after come unto the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars wherein they disagree. The first, wherein all agree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, that this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was some thing put in the Brest-plate, which was fastened to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod over against the heart of the High Priest: And thus much the Scripture witnesseth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 30. where God saith to <hi>Moses, And thou shall put in the Brest plate of Iudgement, the Vrim and the Thummim which shall be on Aarons heart, when he goeth in before
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101070:188"/>
the Lord.</hi> And for this cause as most think, was the Brest-plate made double, that the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> might be enveloped therein.</p>
                     <p>The second thing wherein all agree, is that this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was a kinde of Oracle whereby God gave answer to those that enquired of him; and from hence the Septuagint call the whole Brest-plate <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or Prophecy, which was by dreams and Visions: The second <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>afflatus Spiritus sancti,</hi> as was in <hi>Iob, David,</hi> and others. The third <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which was the Oracle. The fourth, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>filia vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> which was usuall in the second Temple after the Oracle had ceased; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. at Christs Baptism there came a voice from heaven, saying, <hi>This is my welbeloved son, in whom I am well pleased:</hi> and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. when Christ said, <hi>Father glorifie thy name: There came a voice like thunder, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to return again to our purpose; That <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was an Oracle of God, besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Jews and others, it is plain by Scripture, <hi>Num.</hi> 27. when God had commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to put his hands upon <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and to set him over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in his stead; he addes, <hi>And he</hi> (that is, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua) shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall ask
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:101070:189"/>
counsell for him by the judgement of Vrim before the Lord.</hi> So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. when <hi>David</hi> was to ask counsell of the Lord, he called for the Ephod, wherein the Oracle was: and whereas before he had once or twice asked counsell of the Lord concerning <hi>Keilah,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the objection how the Lord answered; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next by way of a <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> That <hi>Abiathar</hi> then Priest, when he fled to <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Keilah,</hi> brought the Ephod with him. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Lastly, in the second of <hi>Ezra,</hi> when certain of the Priests which returned from Captivity, could not finde their names written in the genealogies; it is said, that <hi>Ezra</hi> commanded they should <hi>not eat of the most holy things, till there rose up a Priest with Vrim and Thummim;</hi> that is, till God should by Oracle reveal whether they were Priests or no: whereby it also appears that this Oracle had then ceased.</p>
                     <p>And for more light to that we have in hand; it will not be amisse to observe, that <hi>Teraphim</hi> among the Idolaters, was answerable to the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> of the holy Patriarchs. Both were ancient, for <hi>Rahel</hi> is said to have stollen away her Fathers <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim:</hi> And <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> seems to have been used among the Patriarchs before the Law was given, because the making of it, is not spoken of among other things of the Ephod: And because God speaks of it to <hi>Moses</hi> demonstratively, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the Vrim</hi> and <hi>the Thummim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Both also were Oracles; for the Jews and others agree, <hi>Teraphim</hi> were small Images made under a certain constellation, which they used to consult both in things doubtfull, and things future, supposing they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:101070:189"/>
had a power to this effect received from heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; much like to puppets made of wax and like matter, which our Wizzards still use unto like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And therefore <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. we reade that the King of <hi>Babel</hi> among other divinations, consulted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of <hi>Teraphim: And the King of Babel</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>stood at the head of the two ways, to use divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, consulting with Teraphim, he looked in the liver.</hi> And <hi>Zac. 10. 2. Surely</hi> (saith the Text) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The Teraphims have spoken vanity, and the Soothsayers have seen a lie, and the Dreamers have told a vain thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, from this like use of <hi>Teraphim</hi> with the holy <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> we may reade <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> joyned both together as things of like kind, as <hi>Hosea 3. The children of Israel,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>shall remain many days without a King, and without a Prince, and without an Offering, and without an Image, and without an Ephod and Teraphim.</hi> Yea, of so near a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was this <hi>Teraphim</hi> unto the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> that <hi>Micah,</hi> he that <hi>had an house of Gods,</hi> when he had made an Ephod, because he had no <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> he put <hi>Teraphims</hi> in stead thereof, as we may gather <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. 18. where we may see also that when the children of <hi>Dan</hi> enquired of the Lord concerning their journey, it pleased him to give answer by the Idolish <hi>Teraphim.</hi> So we may gather likewise that the Israelites after <hi>Ieroboams</hi> schism, having no <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> used <hi>Teraphim</hi> in the Ephod, and therefore it is that <hi>Hosea</hi> threatens that they <hi>shall be without Ephod and Teraphim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having hitherto shewn how far it is agreed about
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:101070:190"/>
                        <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> in the next place the points of difference ought to be considered; which are either about the matter whereof it was made, or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how God answered by it.</p>
                     <p>For the matter, some will have it to be nothing else but the writing or carving of the great name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which was put within the folding of the brest-plate; and that it was called <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> because by the knowledge of the mystery of <hi>Iehovah</hi> in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, our minds are enlightned, and understandings made perfect.</p>
                     <p>Some other there are of the same opinion, but they will have it called <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> because by the virtue of that name written, <hi>Sacerdos verba sua illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strabat, &amp; perficiebat:</hi> And moreover they say the brest-plate was called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the brest-plate of judgement, because by it the Lord gave as it were sentence and judgement, what was to be done in hard and doubtfull matters. And this is the opinion of Rabbi <hi>Shelomo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some other will have it called the brest-plate of judgement, because that by it the judgement of the Judges, if it were amisse, was hereby as it were pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: because the High Priest was to bear the sins of the people: The Authors of this opinion are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by R. <hi>Shelomo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> saith, it was so called because by it the judgement and decrees of the Lord were known: And he thinks also that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made by the hand of the craftsman.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Nehemanides</hi> and R. <hi>Shelomo</hi> say, it was <hi>opus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum,</hi> and given to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount, or at least that God shewed him how to make it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:101070:190"/>
Some think it was nothing but the stones in the brest-plate, by the shining whereof God did <hi>annuere,</hi> by the not shining, <hi>abnuere.</hi> But <hi>Kimchi</hi> confutes this, because it is spoken of as a differing thing in the same place, where the stones are described: But he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says, it is not certainly known what it was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nehemanides</hi> saith, it was certain sacred names, by the virtue whereof the letters of the brest-plate were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and ordered, so that the Priest might read the answer of God: and that which caused shining was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vrim;</hi> &amp; that which made them legible, <hi>Thummim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The summe of these Opinions laid together is, That this Oracle was either the stones of the brest-plate themselves, or something in the folding of the brest-plate, which by a divine virtue did cause the stones to shine, and by the letters of the Tribes names in them, as it were to expresse the answer of God.</p>
                     <p>For concerning the manner of this Oracle, the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudists report thus much: First, no private man might consult with <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> but either <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he that was King or chief of the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, the Consistory or Judges themselves, and that in matters difficult and of great importance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he that enquired must stand with his face looking full upon <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the voice was to be a soft still voice, and not above one thing to be asked at one time: But if they asked two things at once, the answer was only unto the first; but in case of extremity, unto both: and such was <hi>Davids</hi> case, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. when he asked
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101070:191"/>
concerning the Amalekites, who had burnt <hi>Ziklag, Shall I follow this company,</hi> saith he, <hi>and shall I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them?</hi> The Lord answers, <hi>Follow, for thou shalt surely overtake them, and recover all.</hi>

                     <p>Now if you ask how the Priest knew the answer of the Lord? First, you must remember, there were twelve stones in the brest-plate, and in those stones the twelve names of the sons of Israel, either set or carved; and that there might be a full Alphabet of letters, there was also, say they, written upon the brest-plate, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and these two words <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is, joyned themselves together and made a word: which as I cannot conceive how it should be, so I think it lesse probable.</p>
                     <p>And thus hitherto have you heard the divers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the matter and manner of this Oracle of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> Here is variety enough, I leave to every one to make his own choice which he will beleeve; only give me leave to adde thus much in way of censure of them, which is, that all seem against reason and likelihood, to confound <hi>Vrim</hi> with <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi>
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:101070:191"/>
in making them one and the same thing called by divers names, in regard of divers effects and uses: which I can the lesse beleeve, because I finde <hi>Vrim</hi> alone used in matter of consultation with God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it seems <hi>Thummim</hi> had some other use. In the 27. of <hi>Numb. Moses</hi> commands <hi>Ioshuah</hi> in all businesse to consult the High Priest, <hi>by the judgement of Vrim before the Lord;</hi> but no speech of <hi>Thummim.</hi> Again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. it is said, that <hi>Saul</hi> asked counsell of the Lord, when he was to go against the Philistims; but <hi>the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Vrim, nor by the Prophets.</hi> Here also is <hi>Vrim</hi> spoken of, but no word of <hi>Thummim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If I may therefore speak what I think; I would say, that <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were a twofold Oracle, and for a twofold use. And that <hi>Vrim</hi> was the Oracle, or part of the Oracle, whereby God gave answer to those who enquired of him in hard and doubtfull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; therefore called <hi>Vrim,</hi> or lights, because as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is called darknesse; so is all knowledge a kinde of illumination or enlightening; and that which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledg is fitly called a light, because it dispels the darknesse of our minds.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Thummim</hi> was that Oracle or mean whereby the High Priest knew whether God did accept the Sacrifice or no; therefore called <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is, Integrity; because those whose Sacrifice God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, were accounted <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is, just and righteous in the eyes of God; because their Sacrifice was a shadow of Christs Sacrifice, by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation whereof we are justified and made righteous before God. For without doubt the Patriarchs and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:101070:192"/>
legall Church had some ordinary mean to know when their Sacrifice was accepted, else had they been behinde the Gentiles; for they had a sign to know when they did <hi>Litare,</hi> that is, when their false Gods accepted their false sacrifice; and as the Devil was Gods Ape in giving Oracles, so I verily beleeve he was in this also. Nay <hi>Iosephus</hi> expresly affirms it of the Jews, though for the particular I suppose he is mistaken: For he saith, that whensoever God did accept the Sacrifice, the Onyx stone on the Priests left shoulder shone with an admirable splendor; but this, saith he, ceased certain hundred years before his time: and no wonder, for when the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse drew near unto his rising, those dimmer <hi>Vrim</hi> and smaller stars must needs lose their light. Now that which <hi>Iosephus</hi> affirms of the Onyx stone on the left shoulder, I suppose was mistaken for the <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> on the left part of the brest-plate.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, as I said before of <hi>Vrim,</hi> so I think of <hi>Thummim,</hi> that it was in use among the Patriarchs of old, and that by some such means as this <hi>Abel</hi> knew that God accepted his Offering, and <hi>Cain</hi> that his was refused.</p>
                     <p>And thus much of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> considered personally in the High Priest; now I come to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it typically: for as the High Priest himself was a type of Christ, so must these Adjuncts of his also be types of something in Christ; which we shall not be long a finding out, if we remember again the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the words, and the use of the things themselves: <hi>Vrim</hi> is Light and Illumination; <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> Integrity and Perfection. By <hi>Vrim</hi> the Jews
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101070:192"/>
were ascertained of the counsell and will of God; By <hi>Thummim</hi> of his favour and good will towards them. All this agrees to Christ both in himself, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of us.</p>
                     <p>In himself, his brest is full of <hi>Vrim,</hi> full of Light and Understanding, <hi>in him dwell all the treasures of Wisdome and Knowledge,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith; He is the Wisdome of the Father by which the world it self was made. His heart is also endowed with <hi>Thummim,</hi> with all kind of Perfections; He was conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Originall sin, lived without Actuall sin; fulfilled the whole Law of God, which is the Law of <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> the Law of all Perfection.</p>
                     <p>Thus to Christ himself agrees both <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and so it doth also in regard of us, for he is an <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> both to us and for us: To us he is <hi>Vrim,</hi> a <hi>light which enlightneth every one which commeth unto the world:</hi> He is the light which shone in darknesse, but the darknesse could not comprehend it. He was that light by which <hi>the people</hi> (as it is said in <hi>Matthew 4.) which sate in darknesse saw great light.</hi> And of this Light <hi>Iohn</hi> came <hi>to bear witnesse, that all might beleeve in him, Ioh.</hi> 1. In summe, Christ is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Patris,</hi> the Word and Oracle of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by whom we know and learn the Fathers will: for so S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>cap. 1. No man hath seen God at any time, but the Son who is in the bosome of the Father, he hath revealed him unto us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is Christ only an <hi>Vrim,</hi> but also a <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim</hi> to us: For as by <hi>Thummim</hi> the Jews were ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of Gods favour toward them in accepting their Sacrifice: so by Christ comming in the flesh is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101070:193"/>
the unspeakable mercy of God to mankind, in that he would accept his Sacrifice once offered for the expiation of the sins of the whole world. This is that Good-will toward men, which the Angels sung of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as he was born; <hi>Glory be to God on high, peace on earth, and good-will towards men:</hi> Yea, glory be to God on high for this peace on earth, and for this good will towards men.</p>
                     <p>Thus we see Christ an <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> to us: now let us see how he is the same for us; and that is when his wisdome and righteousnesse is made ours by imputation: So his <hi>Vrim</hi> becomes our <hi>Vrim,</hi> his <hi>Thummim</hi> our <hi>Thummim,</hi> that is, his wisdome is made ours; his righteousnesse and favour with God made ours; for <hi>this is my welbeloved Son,</hi> said a voice from heaven, <hi>in whom I am well pleased.</hi> In brief, S. <hi>Paul</hi> comprehends both these together, where he saith, <hi>Christ Iesus is made unto us Wisdome, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> And so Lord, <hi>let thy Vrim and thy Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim be with thy holy one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus much for the speciall consideration of this <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> both personally and typically: Now I come unto the generall meaning thereof, as it concerns not the High Priest only, but the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> for this is the blessing of that whole Tribe. And in this large respect, the meaning cannot be proper, for so it belongs unto the High Priest to have <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> nor typicall, because the Priests only, and not the under Levites were types of Christ: but the sense must be analogicall, signifying some endowments common to all Levites, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon the brest of the High Priest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="377" facs="tcp:101070:193"/>
Now what these are, the words themselves import, namely, Light of understanding &amp; knowledge; this is their <hi>Vrim;</hi> and Integrity of life, this is their <hi>Thummim.</hi> The first makes them <hi>Doctores,</hi> the second <hi>Ductores po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli:</hi> He that wants either of these two, wants the true ornament of Priesthood, the right character of a Levit.</p>
                     <p>For though these endowments may well beseem all the Tribes of Israel; yet <hi>Moses</hi> specially prays for them in <hi>Levi,</hi> because by him they were to come to all the rest; and the want of them in him, could not but redound to all the rest; <hi>It a populus, sicut sacerdos:</hi> the Priest cannot erre, but he causeth others to erre also; the Priest cannot sin, but he causeth others to sin also. And this is it that <hi>Malachi</hi> saith from the Lord, <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 6, 8.</note> unto the Priests of his time; <hi>Ye are gone out of the way, and have caused many to fall by the Law:</hi> But the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites of old, (saith the same Prophet) <hi>The Law of Truth was in their mouth, and iniquity was not found in their lips: they walked with God in peace and equity, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many from iniquity.</hi> Here you see when the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites erre, the people erre also; when the Levites walk in equity, the people are turned from iniquity.</p>
                     <p>The Ministers of Christ must be <hi>Lux mundi,</hi> the light of the world; <hi>Vos estis lux mundi,</hi> ye are the light of the world; ye are the worlds <hi>Vrim,</hi> saith Christ unto his Apostles; for <hi>the lips of the Priest should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve knowledge, and they should learn the Law at h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s mouth.</hi> This light of knowledge, this teaching know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the <hi>Vrim</hi> of every Levite; and therefore Christ when he inspired his Apostles with knowledge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mysteries, he sent a new <hi>Vrim</hi> from above, even fiery tongues, tongues of <hi>Vrim</hi> from heaven: He sent
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:101070:194"/>
no fiery heads, but fiery tongues; for it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a Levite to have his head full of <hi>Vrim,</hi> unlesse his tongue be a candle to shew it unto others. There came indeed no <hi>Thummim</hi> from heaven, as there came an <hi>Vrim,</hi> for though the Apostles were secured from errors, they were not freed from sin: And yet we who are Levites, must have such a <hi>Thummim</hi> as may be gotten upon earth, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> bid <hi>Titus</hi> in all things to shew himself an example of good works: and this is a <hi>Thummim</hi> of Integrity.</p>
                     <p>But besides this <hi>Thummim</hi> the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel have received from God more especially another <hi>Thummim,</hi> like unto that which was proper to the High Priest; namely, the power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which is as it were a power of Oracle to declare unto the people the remission of their sins, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Christs Sacrifice: And this directly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to <hi>Thummim</hi> in the first sense.</p>

Caesarius</hi> brother to <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in his fourth Dialogue expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the sin of <hi>Ananias</hi> thus; <hi>Semel Deo dicatum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> saith he, <hi>sacrilegio vulneratus alienaverat, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatus negaverat:</hi> He alienated the money dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God, being wounded with Sacriledge, and when he was asked thereabout, denied it. Lastly, <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius,</hi> in whom we have the currant interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Greek Fathers, thus expounds the words of S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Neque enim invitos vos trahimus; sed cum ultroneè vobis placuerit offerre Deo victimam, rursus vos ipsos ad proprium usum insumere, Sacrilegium indubiè est:</hi> And then addes, <hi>Ideo &amp; Sacrilegorum poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na sunt percussi: Quanam? morte.</hi> Also <hi>Asterius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Marpurg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who lived near the time of <hi>Iulian,</hi> in his <hi>Hom. in Avaritiam,</hi> cals <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi>

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>I quote these Fathers the more fully, because many of our late Commentators omit the main sin, and dwell upon the circumstances only, as hypocrisie, vain-glory, covetousnesse, and the like. But we must distinguish between <hi>Ananias</hi> his fact, and the manner and circumstance thereof: The fact was Sacriledge:
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:101070:196"/>
In the manner of doing, other sins attended as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids. It will be plain, if we ask but these two que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions: First, what <hi>Ananias</hi> did? The Text wil make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>He purloined of the holy mony.</hi> This was his fact. Ask secondly, how and in what manner he purloined? The story will tell us, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly and hypocritically, making an appearance to the contrary. This then was but the manner and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of his fact, and so the <hi>species</hi> of the fact not to be placed therein.</p>
                     <p>Now this Sacriledge or Sacrilegious act commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Ananias,</hi> is in the words of the Text partly expressed, partly aggravated from the inexcusable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof. In the expression is spent the third verse; the aggravation is in the fourth. The crime or fact of <hi>Ananias</hi> is expressed two ways: First, by <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, by <hi>lying unto,</hi> or <hi>deceiving the Holy Ghost.</hi> For both these I suppose to mean one and the same thing; namely, the same fact of <hi>Ananias</hi> two ways expressed. The first, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Menelaus</hi> his Sacriledge (who stole the sacred Vessels) is expressed by it; <hi>Menelaus</hi> (saith the Author) <hi>supposing he had got a convenient time,</hi>

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101070:197"/>
or to break them. So <hi>Ananias</hi> his sin, was a lying unto, or breaking of promise with God: for having vowed, or promised unto him in his heart the whole price of the field, he brought him but part thereof. Both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions point out the same fact; which in regard of the matter, was stealing or purloining: in regard of the Vow and Consecration, a breach of promise or lying unto God. So that when <hi>Peter</hi> says in the third verse, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart; to lie unto the Holy Ghost, and to purloin of the price of the land?</hi> The latter is the explication of the former; and is, as if it had been said, <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, in purloining the price of the land?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what, will some man say, means this speciall expression of the Deity in the Person of the Holy Ghost? why is <hi>Ananias</hi> said, to have lied to the Holy Ghost, rather then to have lied unto God only? For lying unto God would bear the sense I speak of; should not then lying unto the Holy Ghost, seem to have something else, or something more in it? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Ananias</hi> his lie or breach of promise is applied thus in speciall to the Holy Ghost, in respect of the prerogative of that Person, as to stir and sanctifie, so to take notice of the motions of the heart: forasmuch therefore as <hi>Ananias</hi> his Vow and Promise which he broke, was not such as men could witnesse or take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, but such as his own heart or conscience only was privy to; hence it is said to have been done under the privity of the Holy Ghost, and he in the breach thereof to have lied unto him; because that which none but the inward man knoweth of, and is yet but in the purpose of the heart, is under his privity. There
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:101070:198"/>
is a plain place <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. to this purpose, <hi>I say the truth in Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witnesse in the Holy Ghost:</hi> that is, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, who is privy to my conscience, bearing me witnesse, or my conscience which the Holy Ghost is privy to. Some other places of Scripture I could name, which may receive light from this notion, but I am loth to meddle with them.</p>
                     <p>But for their interpretation, who expound this <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Holy Ghost,</hi> of <hi>Ananias</hi> his hypocrisie, I cannot well see how it can stand; For <hi>Ananias</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled not with the Holy Ghost, but with men; the Holy Ghost knew his heart well enough. And the hypocrite properly lies unto men, who guesse only by the outside, and not unto God, who knows the heart.</p>
                     <p>Others expound <hi>lying unto the Holy Ghost,</hi> as if it were lying to try whether the Holy Ghost in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles could discover him or not: But this is an harsh and forc'd sense. As for that in the 9. verse, whereon it is grounded; <hi>viz. How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?</hi> The word <hi>Tempt,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is mistaken, the notion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in Scripture being otherwhile, to provoke God by some presumptuous fact to anger; as it were to try whether he will punish or not, to dare God. There is an evident place for this sense, <hi>Numb. 14. 22. Those men,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>which have seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wildernesse, and have tempted mee now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice. 23. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they shall not see the land which I sware to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:101070:198"/>
their Fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me, see it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus much of the bare description of <hi>Ananias</hi> his sin: Come we now to the aggravation thereof; <hi>While it remained, was it not thine? and after it was sold, was it not in thy power?</hi> That is, before it was sold, was it not thine? and being sold, was not the money paid thee? was not the price in thine hand? Thou hast therefore no excuse for what thou hast done. For there were two cases which might have excused <hi>Ananias</hi> for bringing but part of the price: If either he had not been <hi>Dominus in solidum,</hi> the full Proprietary of what was sold; or had not received the whole price it was sold for. For, as for the first, it is a rule in Law, <hi>Quoties Dominium transfertur ad a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

So that if <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> had been owner but in part, he had power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but in part. Secondly, though he were <hi>Dominus in solidum,</hi> the full Proprietary of the field, and so had right enough to sell it, yet had not the whole price been received, and in his power and possession, he might still have been excused for bringing but part thereof. But <hi>Ananias</hi> could plead neither of these: for saith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; and <hi>when it was sold, was not the money it was sold for in thy possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> The first words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; (though there be no such speech again in Scripture) yeeld the sense I speak of plainly enough, nor will they bear any other meaning, unlesse somewhat forsaking the letter,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:101070:199"/>
we should with others construe them to imply, that <hi>Ananias</hi> was not constrained or urged to sell his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session at all, but might have kept it still: Which sense is most commonly followed, and hath the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Oecumenius</hi> in the words before alledged; <hi>Neque enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>invitos vos trahimus, sed quum ultronsè vobis placuerit offerre Deo victimam, rursus vos ipsos ad proprium usum insumere sacrilegium est.</hi> Therefore <hi>Beza</hi> translates the words, <hi>Nonne, si ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasses</hi> (so he renders <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>manebat tibi?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, this sense makes as much for the unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sablenesse of <hi>Ananias,</hi> as the other: for could he have alledged that what he had done for the sale of his land, was done not <hi>spontè,</hi> but <hi>coactè,</hi> not willingly, but by way of constraint, it might have excused him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that act only is taken to be of force in Law, which a man consents unto: But that which is done by constraint or compulsion, is not done with full and free consent, and therefore bindes not. So this sense agrees well enough with the story, only it may seem somewhat to strain the words: Howsoever if you had rather follow it, because of the authority, I will not contend. Only note thus much, that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack Translator inclines to the first sense; for he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>A second plea for the excuse of <hi>Ananias</hi> might have been in case he had not yet received the full price, and so had not the whole money in his hand. But this S. <hi>Peter</hi> also takes from him, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> must here be understood for the price of what was sold, or the field reduced to money: otherwise the contrary would be true to that which <hi>Peter</hi> intimates, namely, that when it was sold, it was now no longer in his power, because he had sold it. But the same words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>in thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> I understand to be as much as, in thy possession, or in thine hand; meaning, as I have said, that he had received the price. For not only that which a man hath dominion and propriety in, but that also which he hath but in bare possession, is rightly said to be in his power: for in the Law <hi>Ius possessionis</hi> extends farther then <hi>Ius dominii,</hi> namely, as far as <hi>habere,</hi> to have a thing; <hi>Habere autem dicitur, non solùm qui rei dominus est, sed qui rei quidem dominus non est, sed rem tenet;</hi> that is, as they speak, <hi>corpore possessioni in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistit.</hi> And in this sense the price which <hi>Ananias</hi> had received, is said to have been <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>in his power,</hi> that is, in his possession: which will not seem a forc'd exposition, if we consider that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> hath the same sense with <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or <hi>in manu</hi> in the Hebrew; which implies not dominion only, but also bare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session. As it is said of <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant, <hi>Gen. 24. 10. That all the goods of his Master were in his hand;</hi> as well as of the rich misers son, <hi>Eccles. 5. 14.

                     <p>I confesse there is another exposition usually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of these words, but it is such an one as directly contradicts the story; namely, that <hi>Was it not in thy
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101070:200"/>
power?</hi> should be, was it not in thy power to have kept the price when it was sold? But first there is no such word in the Text as to keep it, and so we are not bound to understand it. It is only said, <hi>was it not in thy power?</hi> And if any verb be to be understood to supply the sense, why should it not as well be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? <hi>was it not in thy power,</hi> to dispose it according to thy Vow? intimating there might be some just impediment after the sale, whereby he could not; especially he could not get the money. But to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, <hi>was it not in thy power?</hi> to be, was it not in thy power to have kept it? is directly against the drift of the story: For how did <hi>Ananias</hi> sin in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but part of the price, if he might have kept all? Is not his sin expresly placed in that he purloined of the price? what other fact of his is mentioned save only this? Nay, if this should be the meaning of the words, it would follow, a man might vow a thing unto God, and yet be at liberty when he had done, whether he would perform it or not: He might lie unto God, and yet be guiltlesse. Without doubt this exposition was it that so obscured the whole narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it could not appear, wherein <hi>Ananias</hi> his sin consisted. But his sin as I have already shewed out of the Fathers, was Sacriledge, and of that kinde where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov. 20. It is a snare to the man who devours that which is holy, and after vows to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi> He had dedicated the whole value of the field in his conscience, and the purpose of his heart was evident by the sale thereof to that end; and yet when he had done, he repented him, and brought but part thereof. This meaning is evidently contained in the

body of the narration, and therefore such a sense of any part as cannot stand with this, is in no wise to be admitted. He that considers it, will perceive the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of what I say.</p>
                     <p>Having thus cleared the words of the Text where there was any doubt or obscurity: Let us come to the Observations to be deduced thence; whereof the Relation affords us three evident ones: First, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge is a sin against God, and not against men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that that which is consecrate to God, must not be alienated to other uses. Thirdly, that it is an hainous sin which God thus severely punished. For the first, that Sacriledge is a sin against God, and not against men, is plain by the Text, <hi>Thou hast not lied,</hi> said <hi>Peter, unto man, but unto God.</hi> For whatsoever is sacred is his; yea, to be sacred is nothing else but to be set apart from mans interest to be Gods in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar propriety and relation. To steal then or allenate that which is sacred, is to rob God and not man; for he is robbed whose the propriety is, but of sacred things God is the Proprietary and not man. It is an error therefore to be observed among the Expositors of the Decalogue, who rank Sacriledge as a sin of the eighth Commandement, when Sacriledge as Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a sin of the first Table, and not of the second: A breach of the loialty we immediately owe to God, and not of the duty we owe to our neighbour. True it is, he that committeth Sacriledge, indirectly and by consequent, robbeth men too, namely, those who live of Gods provision; but Sacriledge it self is the robbing of God. This is evident by that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Malachi, Mal. 3. 8. Will a man rob God? yet ye
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:101070:201"/>
have robbed me;</hi> (saith the Prophet in the person of God) <hi>But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In Tithes and Offerings.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation. 10. Bring ye all the Tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The observation of this would be usefull in the question of the due of Tithes; for the state thereof is not rightly framed, when the <hi>Quaere</hi> is made, Whether Tithes are due to the Ministers of the Gospel, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as a duty of the people unto them: we should say rather, Tithes are due unto God; for so is the style of the Scripture, <hi>All the Tithes are mine:</hi> these I give to <hi>Levi,</hi> and not you. God maintains not his Ministers at others charges, but out of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue which he hath reserved to himself: As was well observed by <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, in his Book <hi>de Sacerdotum honoribus,</hi> where speaking of that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that honorable maintenance, &amp; without bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily toil, which God had provided for his Priesthood; to take away from them out of whose labours this maintenance did accrue, all occasion of upbraiding those who by Gods assignment were to receive it, he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>The people were commanded to bring their offerings first to the Temple, that thence the Priests might fetch them: It being not unworthy God himself, in token of gratitude
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:101070:201"/>
for his infinite bounty and benefits, to take some part back again from him upon whom he had conferred so great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; and seeing himself the giver of all good gifts, stood in need of nothing, it pleased him to transfer that honourable maintenance, which was so returned him by way of thankfulnesse, upon those that served at his Altar, and ministred about holy things:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (as he gives the reason) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>because they</hi> (the Priests) <hi>might take that their provision without being ashamed, as not comming from men, but from God the giver of all good gifts to every one.</hi> For they are his Ministers, and not the peoples, and therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their wages from their own Master who imploys them, and not from them. The stating of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus, would make the way to the resolution of the controversie more easie, and lesse invidious, whilest we should plead for God and not for our selves: for it is not needfull that all which is given unto God should be spent upon his Ministers, though it be true that their maintenance should be out of his Revenue, and that honorable &amp; competent. But there are many other uses for the imploiment of <hi>bona sacra,</hi> if there be more then is competent for them and theirs, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Churches, defraying of such as are sent to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and imploied upon other occasions of the Church, furnishing of treasures for a Holy War, the relief of the poor, the Orphan, the Widow, the Captive, and the distressed: All which belong to Christs provision.</p>
                     <p>The second Observation is, That that which is consecrated to God, may not be alienated to other
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:101070:202"/>
uses. The reasons whereof are; First, because none can alienate but he that hath the propriety, and is owner: <hi>Dominium transferre non potest, qui ipse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus non est:</hi> But in things consecrate to God, none hath the propriety but God. For certainly, a man cannot be said to have given that unto God, wherein he still reserves the Title to himself as the Owner: he that gives, transferres the <hi>Dominium</hi> from himself, unto him to whom the gift is made. If therefore that which is given to God, be Gods, then must those who go about to alienate it, dispose of that which is none of theirs: which, whether it be just or not, let any man judge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to alienate that which is given unto God, is a breach of vow or promise made unto him; <hi>A ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him,</hi> as my Text speaks. And if it be a sin not to perform what was vowed in the purpose of the heart only, as we see it was in this story of <hi>Ananias,</hi> much more is it to revoke a vow already performed. Nor will it serve turn to say, This reason may indeed concern the person himself that vowed, that he should not revoke again what he hath vowed; but doth not take away from the Common-wealth, or publike Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate their power to dispose of things subject to them. For howsoever it be true that every private person and his goods are under the tuition of the Publike, and the interest the Publike hath in either, cannot be given away by the sole act of a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yet in this case that rule hath place which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Almighty God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. concerning a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens vow in her Fathers house, or a womans vow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der covert; That <hi>if the Father or the Husband hear
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:101070:202"/>
the Vow, and the bond wherewith she bound her soul, and disallow it not, but shall hold his peace; then the vow shall stand:</hi> So when the Common-wealth or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Magistrate consents to and allows what is done, as in this case it is supposed they do, the vow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication is also irrevocable on their part.</p>
                     <p>Hence in Scripture it is made an inseparable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of that which is sacred or Gods, not to be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: As in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 14. it is said of the portion of land to be laid out for the Levites, <hi>They shall not sell it, neither exchange, nor alienate the first-fruits of the land;</hi> (mark the reason;) <hi>for it is holy unto the Lord.</hi> This was the reason likewise, why a Jew might not sell outright his possession in the land of Canaan, but only for fifty years term, or untill the year of Jubilee, because the whole land was holy, and Gods land, and they but <hi>usufructuarii:</hi> So saith God, <hi>Levit. 25. 23. The land shall not be sold for ever,</hi> or <hi>outright; for the land is mine, for you are but strangers and sojourners with me:</hi> therefore <hi>in all the land of your possession, ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</hi> Where he saith, <hi>ye are strangers and sojourners with me;</hi> the meaning is, that as the Gentiles who became Proselytes, had no inheritance in the land, but dwelt therein as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers; so was all Israel in the sight of God, who would have none accounted Proprietaries of that land but himself, having acquired it by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull conquest from the Canaanite. For although in the same land, some part were yet in a more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner the Lords land, yet comparatively, <hi>&amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid,</hi> the whole land was sacred and His: As all Israel was a peculiar and holy people, though the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:101070:203"/>
Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were in a more speciall sort the holy Tribe. Now if that which was but in a more generall sense holy and the Lords, might not be alienated; what shall we say of that which is holy and His in the most speciall manner of all? I speak all this while of that which is dedicate unto God absolutely, and not with limitation or for term of time only, for such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications I suppose there may be.</p>
                     <p>Now if any shall ask me, whether this assertion, That things dedicate to God are unalienable, admits not of some limitations? I answer, It may be; and that in two cases; If either it can be proved, that the donation made unto God were a nullity; or shewed, that God hath relinquished the right which once he had. But here the water begins to grow too deep for my wading; yet I hope I may say thus much, That whosoever he be that shall plead either of these two cases to acquit himself of Sacriledge, had need be sure in a point of such moment, that his evidence be good, and such as he can shew good warrant for out of Gods own book: To go upon bare conjectures will not be safe. And for direction and caution in this case, I will adde further, That not every sinfulnesse of the person who is the Donor, nor every default or blemish in the consecration, makes the act it self void. It appears in the story of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> in that oblation of Incense made by the two hundred and fifty Princes of the Congregation, whose service though it were so displeasing unto the Lord, that he sent fire from heaven to consume them; yet when all was done, he gave this commandment to <hi>Moses, Speak</hi> (saith he) <hi>unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the Priest, that
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:101070:203"/>
he take up the censers out of the burning; and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are hallowed. The censers of those sinners against their souls; Let them make of them broad plates for a covering of the Altar: For they offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed, Num.</hi> 16 37, 38. Mark here; though they were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by sinfull men, and in a sinfull manner, and were not to be used any more for censers, yet must they be applied to some other holy use, because they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sacred by having been offered unto the Lord. So Rabbi <hi>Solomo Iarchi,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Unlawfull for common use, because they had made them vessels of Ministery.</p>
                     <p>My last observation is raised from the judgement which befell <hi>Ananias;</hi> That it must needs be a hainous sin which God so severely punished, namely, with death: For there is no example to be found again in the whole New Testament, of so severe a punishment inflicted by the mouth of the Apostles, for any sin whatsoever. But this was the first consecration of goods that ever was made unto Christ our Lord, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was invested to sit at the right hand of God: And this transgression of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> the first Sacriledge that ever was committed against him; wherefore it was requisite that by the severity of the punishment thereof, he should now manifest unto men, what account he made, and how hainous he esteemed that sin; that it might be for an example to the worlds end unto all that should afterward beleeve in his name to beware thereof. So saith S. <hi>Hierome, Ananias &amp; Sapphira quia post votum obtulerunt quasi sua &amp; non ejus cui semel eavoverant, praesentem mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:101070:204"/>
vindictam, non crudelitate Sententiae sed correction is exemplo.</hi> For the first in every kinde is the measure of that which follows; &amp; though Sacriledge be not since punished by God as often as it is committed, by such a visible death, yet was it his purpose that by this first punishment we should take notice how great that sin was, and how displeasing in his sight, which was a punishment by the greatest visible judgement that could be.</p>
                     <p>The like severe example to this, and for the like end, was that upon him who at first profaned the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day in the Wildernesse by gathering sticks, <hi>Num. 15. 32, &amp;c.</hi> who by the sentence of God himself was put to death, and stoned by the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That the Jews hereby might know, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the like were not ordinarily afterward to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for the like sin, yet that the gravity thereof in the eyes of God was still the same, which that first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity intimated.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, it is worthy to be noted, that we finde three examples of such a kinde of coactive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, (if I may so term it) exercised either by our Saviour when he was here on earth, or by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; and all three for the profanation of that which was sacred. The first two by our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against those that profaned his Temple, by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and selling therein as a common place: For which at the first Passeover after his beginning to Preach the Gospel, he made him a whip and whipped such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faners out of it, saying, <hi>Make not my Fathers house a house of Merchandise, Ioh.</hi> 2. 13. Another time, which was at his last Passeover, <hi>He overthrew the Tables of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:101070:204"/>
the Money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and would not suffer any to carry a Vessel through the Temple, telling them, that his house was made for an house of prayer, but they had made it a den of Theeves; Mat. 21. 12. Mark. 11. 15. Luk.</hi> 19 45. The third exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is this which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> exercised upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> for Sacriledge. Whereby it should appear that how small account soever we are now adays wont to make of these two sins, yet in Gods esteem they are other manner of ones then we take them for.</p>
                     <p>Another argument of the hainousnesse of the sin of Sacriledge is, that there was no sacrifice appointed in the Law to make atonement for the same, if it were committed willingly and wittingly; but onely if it were ignorantly done: For so we have it, <hi>Levit. 5. 15. If a soul commit a trespasse, and sin through ignorance in the holy things of the Lord, he shall bring for his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe unto the Lord, a ram without blemish out of the flock.—And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and adde the fifth part thereunto.—And the Priest shall make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him, and it shall be forgiven him.</hi> Thus if it were done ignorantly; but if wittingly and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously, there was no atonement appointed for it: though for other sins there be, even to perjury it self: For, as it is in <hi>Mal. 3. 4. Will a man rob his God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another proof and testimony of the hainousnesse of this sin, is that so ancient a custome in Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons todade it with a curse; which to be no late custom (as some may suppose) taken up among Christians, but used both by Jew and Gentile before Christ was
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:101070:205"/>
born, may appear by that Decree of K. <hi>Darius</hi> for the building of the Temple of Jerusalem, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this execration; <hi>The God that hath caused his name to dwell there, destroy all Kings and People, that shall put to their hand to destroy this house of God, which is at Ierusalem. I Darius have made a Decree, let it be done with speed. Ezra</hi> 6. 12.</p>
                     <p>From this custome it came, that <hi>Anathema</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies such a Donary given unto a Temple, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed thing, or that which hath a curse with it. So <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in Hebrew, a thing cursed and destined to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and also a kinde of offering or consecration which had a curse laid upon it, namely, a curse to him that should meddle with it. Which kinde of consecration had this peculiar, that even the very individuall might never be altered, changed, or redeemed upon any terms, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 28. whereas other offerings might, so that a valuable thing or better were given for them. Such a consecration (I mean a <hi>Cherem,</hi> or consecration under pain of a curse in the very indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall) was that of the City <hi>Iericho,</hi> as the First-fruits of the conquests of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To these Arguments I will adde two or three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to this of <hi>Ananias,</hi> of the punishment of this sin, and so conclude. To begin then with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all: Was not the first sin of Mankinde, for which himself, his posterity, and the whole earth was accursed, a great and capitall sin? But this if we look well into it, was no other for the <hi>species</hi> and kind of the Fact, then Sacriledge: Such the ancient Jews conceived <hi>Adams</hi> sin to have been; namely, a <hi>species</hi> of theft; as may be gathered out of the Book <hi>De
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:101070:205"/>
morte Mosis,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> is brought in deprecating death, and answering God that his case was not such as <hi>Adams;</hi> for he transgressed by stealing, and eating what God forbad him to meddle with, and so was just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; But who could <hi>Adam</hi> steal from, save from God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And therefore I say the first sin of mankinde for the Fact, was the sin of Sacriledge: For whereas among all the trees of the Garden, which God gave man freely to enjoy, there was one <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> which he had reserved unto himself as holy, in token he was Lord of the Garden; Man by eating of this as common, violated the sign of his Fealty unto the great Landlord of the whole Earth, and committed Sacriledge: for which he was cast out of Paradise, and the whole earth accursed for his sake. Might I now say, that to this day many a son of <hi>Adam</hi> is cast out of his Paradise, and the labours of his hands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed for medling with this forbidden fruit? But to go on:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achan</hi> for nimming a wedge of gold, and a Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish garment of the devoted thing of <hi>Iericho</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, brought a curse both upon himself, and the whole Congregation of Israel.</p>
                     <p>For the Sacriledge of <hi>Eli</hi>'s sons, who not content with those offerings which God allowed them for their maintenance, robbed him of his Sacrifices to furnish their own Tables; God gave not only his people, but even the Ark of his Covenant into the hands of the Philistins.</p>
                     <p>For the Sacriledge of the seventh or Sabbaticall year, God caused his people to be carried captive,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:101070:206"/>
and the land lie waste 70. years. By the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> every seventh year the whole land was sacred unto the Lord; so that no man that year might challenge any right of propriety, either to sow his field, or prune his vineyard, or reap that which grew of it self, or gather the fruits of his vineyard undressed, only he might eat thereof in the field, as at other times any might of that which was none of his, as he travelled by, otherwise every mans field and vineyard was that year free as well to the Servant as the Master, to the Stranger as the Owner, to beasts as well as to men. The same year also were all servants and all debts sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred unto the Lord, and so to be released; whence that year was called <hi>The Lords Release.</hi> See <hi>Exod. 21. Levit. 25. Deut.</hi> 15. This consecration, being as much as the forgoing of the seventh part of every mans profits, the covetous Jews for many years neglected the observation thereof; For which sin the Lord, as himself professeth, caused them to be carried captive, and the land to lie waste seventy years without Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, till it had fulfilled the years of Sabbath which they observed not. For their Idolatry he gave them into the hands of the Gentiles their enemies: for their Sabbaticall Sacriledge, hee added this unto it, that they should beside their bondage, be carried captives into a strange Countrey, and their land lie desolate 70. years.</p>
                     <p>For the Sacrilegious profanation of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> in causing the <hi>Vessels of Gods House</hi> to be made his Quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-bowls <hi>for himself and his Lords, his Wives and his Concubines</hi> to carouse in; was the <hi>hand writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wall</hi> sent, which did so affright him, that the

Text says, <hi>His countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him so, that the joynts of his loyns were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</hi> And the same night Gods vengeance light upon him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in the days of the Greek Kings, God gave his own Temple and worship to be profaned, and his people to be trodden under foot by <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> a Gentile King; because they themselves had a little before profaned the same with sacrilegious hands, having betraid the Treasures and Offerings of the same unto a Gentiles coffers, and sold the sacred Vessels to the Cities round about them. 2 <hi>Mac. 3, 4. &amp; 5. cap.</hi>

For at the entrance into the Temple or House of God, <hi>Solomon</hi> built a large <hi>vestibulum,</hi> or Porch, on each side whereof stood those two famous Pillars of brasse, the one called <hi>Iachin,</hi> and the other <hi>Boaz:</hi> Between this Porch and the great brazen Altar (which stood without it) <hi>the Priests the Ministers of the Lord</hi> are here commanded <hi>to weep,</hi> and say, <hi>Spare thy people, ô Lord, and give not thine heritage to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</hi>

                     <p>This Rite of humiliation, we finde mentioned in two other places of the Book of Scripture: As first, in that humiliation of <hi>Ezra</hi> for the peoples marrying of strange wives, <hi>Ezra 9. &amp; Chap.</hi> 10. 1. where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rent his garment and mantle, <hi>he cast himself down</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>before the House of the Lord, (viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door or Porch thereof;) <hi>weeping, and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and said, Lord, I am ashamed to lift up my face to thee my God, for our iniquities are encreased over our head, and our trespasse is grown up unto the heavens.</hi> Another mention we have thereof in 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 7. 38. when <hi>Nicanor</hi> proudly threatned, that unlesse <hi>Iudas Maccabeus</hi> and his host were delivered into his hand, <hi>if ever he returned in safety, he would burn up the House of God: Then the Priests,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>entred in</hi> (namely, into the Courts of Gods House) <hi>and stood between the Altar and the Temple, weeping and praying.</hi> Which passage the Greek Interpreter of that Book, did not well understand, when he rendred it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, before the Altar and the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101070:208"/>
Temple. For <hi>Ioseph Ben Gorion</hi> hath expresly in the Hebrew, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the very words of <hi>Ioel</hi> in my Text, <hi>between the Porch and the Altar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A like custome whereunto, and as is probable taken up in imitation thereof, is that of ours, To read the Letany (or our <hi>Parce Domine, parce populo tuo)</hi> kneeling at a low desk in the body of the Church before the Chancell door, (as was ordered by the first Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Reformation when Procession was taken away) or at the bottome of the steps or ascent unto the Altar, as is used in the Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches.</p>
                     <p>And this may suffice for explication of the Rite which the Prophet here describeth: Now the Lesson we are to learn from hence is, That the nature of a right and religious Fast consists in an humble demis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and abjection of our selves before Almighty God, out of the apprehension of the greatnesse of his Majesty, and our unworthinesse to finde any favour at his hands, whom we have so much provoked by our sins. For this to have been the meaning of that Ceremony, besides the naturall signification of the deportment it self, appeareth by the <hi>Exordium</hi> I but now quoted of <hi>Ezra's</hi> confession, when he thus cast himself down before the Porch of the House of the Lord, weeping; <hi>Lord, I am ashamed</hi> (saith he) <hi>and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: For our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are increased over our head, and our trespasse is grown up to the heavens.</hi> Besides, thus to humble and bring us down, is the end why God sendeth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Plague, Famine, or the like, for the aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof these solemne supplications and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:101070:208"/>
are ordained. And therefore rightly at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our publique worship of God are we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to be humble, by some of the first words we are to utter; <hi>O come let us humble our selves, and fall down before the Lord with reverence and fear.</hi> Hence fasting and humbling a mans self go in Scripture for equipollent terms: <hi>My cloathing was sackcloth,</hi> (saith <hi>David, Psal. 35. 13.) I humbled my self with fasting.</hi> So <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himself, and thereby deferred his judgement, 1 <hi>King. 21. 29. Hezekiah</hi> humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, both he and all the Inhabitants of Jerusalem, 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 26. Manasseh</hi> is said likewise to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought the Lord and <hi>humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, 2 Chr.</hi> 33.</p>
                     <p>No disposition fit so and apt for devotion as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; no more powerfull means to prevail with God and appease his wrath, then this abjection of our selves; <hi>Satis est prostrasse Leoni;</hi> Let me with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence apply it unto the Majesty of God.</p>
                     <p>For all Eminency is worshipped with humility, reverence, and submission, that is, as we are wont and rightly to speak, <hi>by keeping a distance.</hi> Therefore the soveraign or supreme Excellency of God must be adored with the lowest demission and greatest stoop the soul can make. We finde by experience that that disposition of the eye, which fitteth us to behold the visible Sun, maketh a man blinde when he looketh down upon himself: So here, the apprehension of the transcendent excellency of God, ten thousand times brighter then the Sun, if truly admitted into our hearts, will darken all our overweening conceit of any worthinesse in our selves. The greater we would
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101070:209"/>
apprehend his power, the more sensible must we be of our own weaknesse; The greater we acknowledge his goodnesse, the lesse goodnesse must we see in our selves: The more we would apprehend his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the lesse we are to be puffed up with our own knowledge: As in a pair of skales, the higher we would raise one skale, the lower we pull down the other; so the higher we raise God in our hearts, the lower we must depresse our selves.</p>
                     <p>Hence we find the humblest natures, and the most humbled condition, to be the fittest for devotion; I say, the humblest natures are the most pliable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to Religion: whereas those which the world is wont to commend for brave spirits, of all others buckle the worst thereto: But let the world fancy what it will, God seeth not as man seeth; It is not the tallest <hi>Eliab,</hi> but the humblest <hi>David</hi> who is the <hi>man after Gods own heart;</hi> He that humbleth himself as <hi>a little childe,</hi> the same is the tallest and goodliest soul for the Kingdome of God: The Stars in the Firmament howsoever they here seem small to us, yet are bigger then the earth; so he that is despicable and small here in the eyes of men, is there a great one in the eyes of God. Let those therefore that think all worth resides in a lofty and brave spirit, remember, that the Devil was a braver fellow then any of them all, and that his high and lofty spirit, was the cause of his downfall and Apostasie from his Creator, and so of that damnation to everlasting fire prepared for him and his Angels.</p>
                     <p>And as the humblest nature, so the humblest or most humbled state and condition, is the fittest also
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101070:209"/>
for the exercise of devotion, as the poor and mean, rather then the rich and full. Wherefore <hi>Agur</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God, <hi>not to give him more then food convenient for him, lest being full he should deny him, and say, Who is the Lord?</hi> Such likewise is the state of adversity and affliction, whence it is that God useth this disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his corrections and judgements, to make us crouch and bow down unto him, when he seeth us ready to forget him. Whence <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 94. 12. pronounceth <hi>the man blessed whom the Lord chastiseth;</hi> and <hi>Psal. 119. ver. 67, 71. Before I was afflicted,</hi> saith he, <hi>I went astray, but now I have kept thy word. It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> For diseases, say the Physitians, must be cured by contraries: It was pride that caused the disloialty and rebellion both of men and Angels against their God and Maker; Whence it is that <hi>Syracides</hi> saith, <hi>Ecclus. 10. 12. The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker. 13. For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it, shall pour out abomination.</hi> If pride be the beginning of our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against God, then must lowlinesse be the proper disposition of those who fear and worship him; And so <hi>Tanto quisque est vilior Deo, quanto est pretiosior sibi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now then to return to our Argument of Fasting; we may observe beside the ceremony specified in my Text, that all other Rites or Ceremonies used by the Ancients in this solemne devotion, or yet continued by us, imply nothing else but lowlinesse and humility, partly to work and beget it, partly to expresse and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it. They are reducible to three heads: 1. of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:101070:210"/>
2. of gesture; 3. of diet. For habit, it was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>sackcloth and ashes,</hi> by the coursenesse of the sackcloth they ranked themselves, as it were, amongst the meanest and lowest condition of men; by ashes, and sometimes earth upon their heads, they made themselves lower then the lowest of the creatures of God: For the lowest of the elements is the earth, then which we use to say a man cannot fall lower, <hi>Qui jacet in terra, non habet unde cadat.</hi> For gesture, they sate or lay upon the ground, which in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church was called, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>humicubatio;</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ceremony both to expresse, and ingenerate or encrease this disposition of lowlinesse and abjection of our selves; and as frequently practised by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Fore-fathers, as it is seldome or never used amongst us. It were a thing most comely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly most profitable, if either these ceremonies, or some other answerable to them, were revived amongst us at such times as these. If we were all of us this day attired, if not in sackcloth, (which perhaps sutes not so well with the custome of our Nation) yet in the dolefullest habit of mourners; if we lay all groveling upon the ground; would not such a rufull spectacle, would not the very sight of so uncouth an assembly, much afflict and move us? The mournfull hue of Funerall solemnities, we know by experience, will often make them to weep, who otherwise have no particular cause of sorrow; how much more when they have?</p>
                     <p>But the principall ceremony, and which we still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is abstinence from meat and drink, whence this kinde of supplication hath the name of Fasting: the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:101070:210"/>
end thereof being as to bring down our bodies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better to humble our souls, so to expresse and testifie the same. <hi>Mores animi sequuntur temper amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum corporis:</hi> If the body be full and lusty, the minde will be lofty and refractory, and most unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed to approach the Divine Majesty with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and fear. How uncomposed is that heart to sue to God for mercy, and aversion of his judgements, which is fraught with rebellious, unclean and lustfull thoughts, like so many dogges barking within it? But these are all ingendred and cherished by full feeding, and cannot be easily quelled unlesse they be starved: <hi>When I fed Israel to the full</hi> (saith the Lord <hi>Ier. 5. 7, 8.) then they committed adultery and assembled by troups in harlots houses, &amp;c. Ieshurun</hi> (saith <hi>Moses</hi> in his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall song <hi>Deut. 32. 15.) waxed fat and kicked, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the Lord that made him, and lightly esteemed of the Rock of his salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> was fain to pinch his body, and bring it down with Fasting; <hi>I keep under my body</hi> (saith he 1 <hi>Cor. 9. ult.) and bring it into subjection, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>st that by any means when I have preached unto others, I my self should be a cast-away. Hilarion</hi> a religious young man, when after much abstinence and course diet he felt his flesh still unruly and rebellious; <hi>Ego, inquit, Aselle, faciam ut non Calcitres, nec te hordeo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>But as Fasting is a Physicall means (if it be used to purpose) to take down the loftinesse of our minds and affections, by subtracting the fuell and foment of our lusts, which is full feeding; so is it a ceremony
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:101070:211"/>
chosen for that naturall effect it hath to signifie and testifie, that by reflection upon our vilenesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse, we strike the sail of our high flying affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and humble our selves before the Majesty of Almighty God upon such occasions as these. For as we use feasting not only to beget, but also to expresse and testifie our erection and chearfulnesse of heart in times of joyfulnesse, (whence in the Old Testament, to <hi>rejoyce before the Lord,</hi> is put for <hi>to feast before him;)</hi> So is fasting, when we would intend our devotions, used, not only as a means to further, but also as a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; whereby we testifie our sorrowfull dejection and humiliation of minde before God.</p>
                     <p>Well then, you see what is the chief end we are to aim at in this our solemne abstinence, namely, to take down our proud hearts, and bring them to a state of lowlinesse and humility, a disposition so acceptable and prevailing with God; to check our high-moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting passions, and allay the smoaking flames of our unruly lusts; which as it is at all times requisite in some measure, whensoever we approach the Majesty of God to sue for mercy and forgivenesse; so then especially, and in a more then usuall manner, when God shakes the rod of his judgements over our heads, and biddeth us down and prostrate both soul and body before him, lest his wrath break us in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if we will not bow.</p>
                     <p>He that hath attained this, hath fasted well; he that hath not, may hereby know, he hath not done enough, or not as he should do. If the boiling of our lusts be cooled and calmed; if the swelling conceits of worth in our selves be taken down, with a true and feeling
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:101070:211"/>
apprehension of our vilenesse and wretchednesse through sin, which maketh us the most unworthy creatures in the world; if those ramping weeds of contempt and despising of others, be cropped and withered, (and these I can tell you will quite spoil a garden where many good flowers grow;) If after this manner we be affected, then are we humbled. If not, we are not sufficiently taken down; all our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is hypocrisie, nor will our devotions be accepted of that all-seeing Majesty who <hi>resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</hi>

a scene of sorrow without any rest or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This might breed some generall suspition, that <hi>Ab initio non fuit ita,</hi> but that he who made us Lords of his creatures, made us not so worthlesse and vile as now we are, but that some common Father to us all, had drunken some strange and devillish poyson, wherewith the whole race is infected. This poyson saith the Scripture, was the breach of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in Paradise, by eating of the forbidden fruit: for which <hi>Adam</hi> being called to an account by the great Judge, and laying the fault upon the woman which God had given him for an helper, God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes, as ye hear in my Text, to examine the Woman, saying, <hi>What is this that thou hast done?</hi> And she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me and I did eat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These words contain in them two parts; First, Gods Inquisition accusing. Secondly, the womans Confession excusing her fact. The first in the first words, <hi>And the Lord said unto the woman, &amp;c.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the last words, <hi>And the woman said, The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp;c.</hi> For the first words which God speaks being considered absolutely, are an indictment for some crime; as they are interrogative, they are an inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the same, and therefore I call them an Inquisition accusing. So the second are a Confession, as the woman says, <hi>I have eaten;</hi> but with an excuse when she says, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me;</hi> and therefore I call them, a Confession excusing.</p>
                     <p>In the Inquisition are two things to be considered, First, the Author and Person who makes it, which is the Lord God himself; So saith my Text, <hi>And the Lord God said unto the woman.</hi> Secondly, the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:101070:213"/>
it self, <hi>What is this that thou hast done?</hi> In the Person who comes and makes this Inquest, being the Lord God himself, we may observe and behold his <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, his wonderfull goodnesse, and unspeakable love to mankinde, which here reveals it self in four most remarkable circumstances: First, in his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; <hi>And the Lord said;</hi> When said the Lord? namely, not till <hi>Adam</hi> had accused her; she who was first in the sin, was last questioned for the same; and that too because her husband had appealed her. God knew and observed well enough the first degree, and every progresse of her sin, he needed no information from another, yet as though he were loth to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, as though he were loth to finde her guilty, yea as though he were loth to denounce the punishment which his Justice required, he comes not against her untill now; and that as though he were unwilling to come at all.</p>
                     <p>If we look back into the story, we shall yet finde a further confirmation thereof: How long did God hold his hand before he stripped the woman especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, of that glorious beauty of her integrity, and made her with opened eies to see her shamefull nakednesse? She had at the first onset of her conference with the Serpent, sinned a sin of unbeleef of God, and yet God spared her: In the progresse she sinned more in her proud ambition of being like to God himself, and to be wise above what was given her; and God yet spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her: She sinned when she coveted and longed once to eat of the forbidden fruit, when it began to seem more pleasing and desirable unto her then obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Commandement; and God yet spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:101070:213"/>
her: At last she takes and eats thereof, and so came to the heighth and consummation of her sin, and yet behold and see the clemency and longanimity of our good God, he paused yet a while untill she had given unto her husband also, and then, and not till then, he opened their eyes to see their wofull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</p>
                     <p>A lesson first to us men, if so be we think the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God worthy our imitation, to bear long with our brother as God bears with us; to admonish him, as it is in the Gospel, the first, second and third time, before we use him like an Heathen or a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can; <hi>to forgive him seven times,</hi> yea, (as Christ says to <hi>Peter)</hi> if he repent and ask forgivenesse, <hi>seventy times seven times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, this may be a cordiall of spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto us sinners, though we make a shift to keep our selves from the execution of sin, yet we finde our hearts full of sinfull thoughts, ungodly desires, and unclean lusts, and such like sinfull motions from the infirmity of our flesh: which notwithstanding we cannot ever expell or be rid of, yet let us hope that God out of his mercy will bear with our weaknesse, and passe by our infirmities, who bore with the sin of our first Parents untill it came to execution.</p>
                     <p>The second circumstance is the temper of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; in that he vouchsafes first to enquire of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and examine the fact, before he gives sentence or proceeds to execution. The like example we have <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. where it is said, <hi>The Lord came down to see the City and Tower which the children of men had builded,</hi> afore he would confound their language, or scatter
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:101070:214"/>
them abroad from that ambitious <hi>Babel,</hi> upon the face of the earth. Again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. the Lord says, <hi>I will go down, and see whether they of Sod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Doth the great God, the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth, deal with so unspeakable a temper with his creature, and is vile man, a base earth-worm, so austere unto his brother? It was the heighth of <hi>Eves</hi> whole ambition to be like unto God, but her off-springs ambition is to be most unlike unto him; He glories in mercy and clemency, we in rage and rash austerity: He hears his creature speak before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him, we condemn our brother before we hear him speak. Be wise and learned ye Judges of the earth, let this great example of God be the pattern of your imitation; yea let no private man condemne another rashly, untill he hath heard what he may say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as God himself here vouchsafed to go before us.</p>

The third circumstance is Gods condescent unto man, in that he sends neither Angels nor Ministers to examine our first Parents, and to make inquisition of their offence, but he comes himself in person to take notice thereof. When men are offended, especially great men, they will not deign to look upon, or to admit into their presence those that have offended them: How great therefore is this indulgence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who deigns here his presence to our most wretched and most naked Parents, who had so grievously sinned against him? How happily graced would a poor offender think himself, if he might be admitted to the presence of his Prince, there to say what he could either for his defence or excuse, or else to sue for mercy and move compassion? By how much therefore God is greater then the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the world, even as much as they are greater then nothing; so much is this indulgence of God here expressed in my Text to <hi>Eve,</hi> as before to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, surpassing all the favour and condescent of men, who sent not for man, but came himself unto him; yea, who vouchsafed then to seek them out, when they ran away from him.</p>
                     <p>Now all this is spoken <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, after the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, and therefore not so much to expresse what God himself did, as what men ought to do: Let it be a lesson therefore to those who are set over others, not to be too hard of accesse to such as are obnoxious unto them. If God himself vouchsafed so far unto his creature so wretched, much more should man unto his brother.</p>
                     <p>The fourth circumstance is the manner of his speech
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101070:215"/>
to <hi>Eve,</hi> in that he that was the Lord God should so mildly speak unto her, <hi>What is this thou hast done? The Lord God said it,</hi> saith my Text, but who would not think it rather the speech of a familiar and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling friend, then of so great a Judge, so greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: here is no word of asperity, but of lenity, no menacing, no upbraiding terms, but only, <hi>What is this thou hast done?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And should not we learn hence not to insult over such, whose offences make them liable either to us or others? should we upbraid, rail, triumph, and vomit our impotency upon them? certainly we seem not to remember what a gentle and commiserating Judge God is, or that our selves are men, and have to deal with humane frailty, and mans miserable condition, which we ought to behold with pity, and not handle with bitternesse.</p>
                     <p>THE next thing is, the inquisition it self; <hi>What is this thou hast done?</hi> Some reade, <hi>Why hast thou done this?</hi> expounding <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. But <hi>Eves</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer following where she saith, <hi>I have eaten,</hi> plainly argues the question was <hi>what</hi> she had done, and not <hi>why</hi> she had done it: And therefore I take the words as our Translation hath them, and understand this manner of asking by God to be a scheme of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to imply an exaggeration of the womans sin, as if he had said, O what an horrible sin is this thou hast committed? How grievously hast thou transgressed? O what hast thou done? And therefore, God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of her sin with exaggeration, she makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer with diminution; Indeed, she had offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she had eaten, but yet the offence was the lesse, for the Serpent had deceived her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:101070:215"/>
This then being the meaning of the words, let us behold in them the greatnesse of the sin of our first Parents, which made the Lord God himself to say, <hi>What is this thou hast done?</hi> The greatnesse of this sin I will first consider as it concerns them both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and then as in particular: The greatnesse of the sin in generall appears in these four considerations.</p>
                     <p>First, it was a transgression of such a Law, as was given only to prove man whether he would be under God or no: For the morall Law which was written and engraven in the hearts of our first Parents, and was for the doing of things simply good, and abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from things simply evill; such things as a good man would do, were there no commandment, and such things as he would not do, were there no prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; so that in these there was no triall whether man would obey God or no, only because he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, and meerly for obedience sake. And therefore had God ordained this Symbolicall Law, prohibiting a thing in it self neither good nor evill, neither pleasing nor displeasing unto God, but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, that mans observance thereof might be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and testimony, that he was willing to submit himself to Gods pleasure, only because it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And that it might yet the more appear, God made not choice of such a thing as man cared not for, but of a pleasant and desirable thing, whereunto the more his inclination was carried, the more by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining might his willing subjection be approved: The violating therefore of this Law, was an open profession, that he would not be under God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of him to be his Lord. And this is the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101070:216"/>
first respect, wherein appears the greatnesse of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> sin.</p>
                     <p>The second consideration arguing the same is, that he on whom God had bestowed so many glorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, whom he had as it were stuffed with so many excellent abilities, and adomed with so many precious graces, that he should sin against him, and set so light by his commandment: for of those to whom God had given so much, he might justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and expect much: Therefore those whom God hath furnished with the best gifts, either of knowledge or other abilities, they, if they sin, sin most grievously: so that in this respect the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the sins of their posterity, as much as their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity did our corruption. The greater the person, the greater his sin: The sin of a Prince greater then the sin of a vulgar person, and therefore in the Law there was a greater Sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the Prince and Priest, then of the people.</p>
                     <p>The third circumstance aggravating his sin, was the easinesse of the commandment, and the easinesse man had to keep the same, both in regard of himself, whom no itching concupiscence urged, as being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together free therefrom; and not as we his off-spring are continually vexed with the boiling thereof: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in regard of the thing it self he was to abstain from, being onely one fruit, in so great a liberty of all the garden besides. How easily might he have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd from one, to whom God had given the use of all saving this one? he wanted not to feed him, he wanted no variety of food, he had even enough to surfet on; only to approve his obedience to Him who
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:101070:216"/>
had given all the rest unto him, he was to abstain from one, and yet he would not: <hi>Quanta fait</hi> (saith S. <hi>Aug.) iniquitas in peccando, ubi tanta erat non peccandi fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitas?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth circumstance aggravating this sin, was the place, which was Paradise, as it were in Gods own presence, even afore his face: for as heaven above other parts of the world, is the place of Gods speciall presence; so was Paradise above other parts of the earth, as it were an heaven upon earth: the place wherein he singularly revealed himself, and therefore an holy place and the Temple of God. Do not men, otherwise giving the loose rein to wickednesse, yet abhorre to commit it in Gods Temple? How im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently contumelious was this sin therefore which was committed in Gods very Presence-chamber?</p>
                     <p>All these aggravations are common to both our Parents, which all laid together makes their sin as great as ever any was, saving the sin against the holy Ghost; for so the best Divines do think. But <hi>Eve</hi> addes one aggravation more to her weight, in that she was not content to sin her self alone, but she allured and drew her husband also into the like horrible transgression with her, whereby she was not only guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her own personall sin, but of her husbands also. And this added so much unto her former summe, that S. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 14. speaks of her as if she had been the only transgressour; <hi>Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, was in the transgression:</hi> So great and horrible a thing it is in the Eye of God, to be cause or mover of anothers sin: woe be unto them, who by any means are the cause of anothers
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:101070:217"/>
fall: And justly might God say to <hi>Eve</hi> for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect though there had been no more, <hi>What is this that thou hast done?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I come to the womans excuse, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me.</hi> In which words are three things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: The author, <hi>the Serpent.</hi> The action, <hi>Guile.</hi> The object, <hi>Me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the author, the Serpent; two things are inquirable: first, what the Serpent was indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> secondly, what <hi>Eve</hi> supposed him to be? For the first; I think none so unreasonable as to beleeve, it was the unreasonable and brute Serpent: for whence should he learn, or how should he understand Gods commandment to our first Parents? Or how is it possible a Serpent should speak, and not only so, but speak the language which <hi>Eve</hi> understood? For though some there be who think that beasts and birds have some speech-like utterings of themselves, yet none that a beast should speak the language of man. It remains therefore, that according unto the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, it was that old deceiver the Devil and Satan, who abused the brute Serpent, either by entring into him, or taking his shape upon him. The last of which I rather incline unto, supposing it (as you shall hear presently) to be the law of spirits, when they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse or commerce with men, to take some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible shape upon them, as the Devil here the Serpents, whence he becomes styled in Scripture, <hi>The old Serpent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the second question, what <hi>Eve</hi> took him to be, whether the Serpent or Satan? If we say she thought him to be the brute Serpent, how will this
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:101070:217"/>
stand with the perfection of mans knowledge in his integrity, to think a Serpent could speak like a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature? who would not judge her a silly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man now that should think so? and yet the wisest of us all is far short of <hi>Eve</hi> in regard of her knowledge then. Again, if we say she knew him to be the Devil; I will not ask why she would converse at all with a wicked spirit, who she knew had fallen from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; but I would know, how we should construe the meaning of the Holy Ghost in the beginning of this Chapter, where he saith, <hi>The Serpent was the subtillest of all the beasts of the field which God had made;</hi> and so implies the womans opinion of the Serpents wisdome was the occasion why she was so beguiled: otherwise to what end are those words spoken, unlesse to shew that Satan chose the Serpents shape, that through the opinion and colour of his well-known wisdome and sagacity he might beguile the woman.</p>
                     <p>For the assoiling of which difficulty I offer these propositions following: First, I will suppose there is a law in the commerce of spirits and men, that a spirit must present himself under the shape of some visible thing: For as in naturall and bodily things there is no entercourse of action and passion, unlesse the things have some proportion each to other, and unlesse they communicate in some common matter; so it seems God hath ordained a Law that invisible things should converse with things visible, in a shape, as they are, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: which is so true, that the conversing presence of a spirit is called a Vision or Apparition. And experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the Scriptures will shew us, that not only evil Angels, but good, yea God himself converseth
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:101070:218"/>
in this manner with men. And all this I suppose <hi>Eve</hi> knew.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I suppose further, that as spirits are to converse with men under some visible shape; so is there a law given them, that it must be under the shape of some such thing as may lesse or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble their condition: For as in nature we see every severall thing hath a severall and sutable physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or figure, as a badge of the inward nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is known as by a habit of distinction; so it seems to be in the shapes and apparitions of Spirits. And as in a well governed Common-wealth, every sort and condition of men is known by some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring habit, agreeable to his quality; so it seems it should be in Gods great Commonwealth, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the shapes which spirits take upon them. And he that gave the law, that a man should not wear the habit of a woman, nor a woman the habit of a man, because as he had made them divers, so would he have them so known by their habits; so it seems, he will not suffer a good and a bad spirit, a noble and ignoble one to appear unto men after the same fashion. And this also I suppose <hi>Eve</hi> knew.</p>
                     <p>Now from these grounds it will follow, that good Angels can take upon them no other shape but the shape of man, because their glorious excellency is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled only in the most excellent of visible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the shape of an inferiour creature would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable, no other shape becomming those who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the sons of God, but his only who was created after Gods own image. And yet not his neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as now it is, but according as he was before
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:101070:218"/>
his fall in that glorious beauty of his integrity. Age and deformity are the fruits of sin; and the Angel in the Gospel appears like <hi>a young man, his countenance like lightning, and his raiment white as snow</hi> as it were <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 5. Mat. 28. 3.</note> resembling the beauty of glorified bodies in immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, sublimity and purity.</p>
                     <p>Hence also it follows on the contrary, that the Devil could not appear in humane shape, whilest man was in his integrity, because he was a spirit fallen from his first glorious perfection, and therefore must appear in such shape which might argue his imperfection and abasement, which was the shape of a beast: otherwise no reason can be given, why he should not rather have appeared unto <hi>Eve</hi> in the shape of a woman then of a Serpent; for so he might have gained an opinion with her both of more excellency and knowledge. But since the fall of man the case is altered, now we know he can take upon him the shape of man, and no wonder, since one falling star may well resemble ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And therefore he appears it seems in the shape of mans imperfection, either for eyes or deformity, as like an old man, (for so the Witches say;) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is not altogether false, which is vulgarly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the Devil appearing in humane shape, hath always a deformity of some uncouth member or other; as though he could not yet take upon him humane shape entirely, for that man himself is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and utterly fallen as he is.</p>
                     <p>By this time you see the difficulty of the question is eased: now it appears why <hi>Eve</hi> wondred not to see a spirit speak unto her in the shape of a Serpent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she knew the law of spirits apparitions better
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:101070:219"/>
then we do. Again, when she saw the spirit who talked with her to have taken upon him the shape though of a beast, yet of the most sagacious beast of the field, she concluded according to our forelaid suppositions, that though he were one of the abased spirits, yet the shape he had taken resembling his nature, he must needs be a most crafty and sagacious one, and so might pry farther into Gods meaning then she was aware of. And thus you may see at last, how the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Serpents subtilty occasioned <hi>Eves</hi> fall; as also why the Dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, of all other beasts of the field, took the shape of a Serpent, namely, to gain this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of sagacity with the woman as one who knew the principles aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Here I observe that overmuch dotage upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived excellency, whether of wisdome or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else, without a speciall eye to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath ever been the occasion of greatest errours in the world, and the Devil under this mask, useth to blear our eyes, and with this bait to inveigle our hearts, that he may securely bring us to his lure. It was the mask of the Serpents wisdom and sagacity, above the rest of the beasts of the field, whereby he brought to passe our first Parents ruine. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wisdome of the long living Fathers of the elder world, having been for so many ages as Oracles to their off-spring, grown even to a people and Nation while they yet lived, was the ground of the ancient Idolatry of mankinde, whilest they supposed that those to whom for wisdome they had recourse being living, could not but help them when they were dead. This we may learn out of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> The men, saith he,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:101070:219"/>
of the golden age being once dead, became <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> they became godlings and Patrons of mortall men, &amp;c. So the opinion of the blessed Martyrs superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glory in heaven, was made the occasion of the new-found Idolatry of the Christian Churches, wherewith they are for the greater part yet overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And the esteem which <hi>Peter</hi> had above the rest of the Apostles in regard of chiefdome, even in the Apostles times was abused by the old Deceiver to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall the man of sin: This made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to say, <hi>the mystery of iniquity was even then working;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laboured as far as he could to prevent it, by as <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 7.</note> much depressing <hi>Peter</hi> as others exalted him. Nay, he puts the Churches in minde of this story of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents beguiling <hi>Eve,</hi> that her mis-hap might be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them; 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 2, 3. I am jealous over you</hi> (saith he) <hi>with a godly jealousie, for I have espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a chaste Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Christ. But I fear lest by any means as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilly, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</hi> And to come a little nearer home, have not our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries when they would get Disciples, learned this of the Devil, to possesse them first with an opinion of superlative learning in their Doctors surpassing any of ours? I will say no more in this point, but that we ought so to prize and admire the gifts and abilities of learning which God hath bestowed upon men, that the pole-starre of his sacred word may ever be in our eye.</p>
                     <p>THE next thing to be spoken of is, the action,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:101070:220"/>
                        <hi>Guile:</hi> and first, I shall shew what it is: To <hi>beguile</hi> is through a false faith and perswasion wrought by some argument of seeming good, to bereave a man of some good he had or hoped for, or to bring upon him some evill he expected not. Practice hath made it so well known, that I should not need to have given any definition or description thereof, but only for a more distinct consideration: whereas therefore I said, that guile wrought by forelaying a false perswasion or beleef, I would intimate, that it was nothing else but a practicall sophism, the premisses whereof are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit motives; the conclusion an erroneous executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now as all practice or action consists in these two; The choice of our end; and the execution of means to attain thereunto: so is this practicall sophism we call Guile found in them both, either when an evil end is presented unto us in the counterfeit of a good, and so we are made to embrace <hi>Nubem pro Iunone,</hi> and find our selves deceiv'd in the event whatsoever the means were we have used: or else we apply such means as are either unlawfull or unsufficient to attain our end, as being so mask'd that they appear unto us far otherwise then they are. With both these sorts or parts of guile the Devil wrought our first Parents ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; first, by making it seem a thing desirable, and by all means to be laboured for, to <hi>be like unto God:</hi> which was an ambition of that whereof man was not only not capable, but such as little beseemed him to aspire unto, upon whom God had bestowed so great a measure of glorious perfections, as he seem'd a God amongst the rest of the creatures. What unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was this, that he upon whom God bestowed so
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:101070:220"/>
much, as he was the glory of his workmanship, should yet think that God should envy him any degree of excellency fit for him? for this was the mask where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Devil covered both the unfitnesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the end he insinuated; but he beguiled them. Secondly, he puts the same trick upon them in the choice of the means to be used, which was to transgresse the severe commandement of Almighty God: Had the aim been allowable, yet could not the means have been taken for good, but only of such as were beguiled, in that the Devil made the woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve with his questioning the truth of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that the danger was not great, nor so certain as it seemed; or that evil which might be in the action, would be counterveiled with the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be attained thereby; the gloriousnesse of which end the Devil so strongly sounded, that it drowned in her imagination the least conceit of evil in the means. And as a man which always looks upward, sees not the danger in the path and way he walks in, untill he tumbles into a pit; so was it here with our first Mother, when thus the Devil beguiled her.</p>
                     <p>This first act of the Devil is that wherein we may behold as in a glasse, the art he still useth to tempt <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 11.</note> us unto sin, and bring us to utter destruction: All his method is nothing else but guile; he presents all things fair unto our face, and suffers not evil to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before us in its own ugly shape, for so every man would fly from it: when he would tempt a man to covetousnesse, he cals it thrift; when to bribes, he cals them gratuities; when to intemperance, forsooth it is good fellowship; when to cruelty, it must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:101070:221"/>
justice; when to prodigality, it must be taken for no other but liberality, and such like. This is that which the Scripture saith, <hi>The Devil transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into an Angel of light:</hi> when he draws to vice, he would seem to mean nothing but virtue; when he tempts to works of darknesse, he presents them as the works of light; when he plots our ruine and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting undoing, he bears us in hand, that all aims at our welfare and felicity.</p>
                     <p>This is that which is meant in the following verse, where it is said, <hi>The seed of the woman should bruise the Serpents head, but the Serpent should bruise his heel;</hi> as though the Serpent should love to assault at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and so as he might not be seen to intend any such matter before he had done the feat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fashion should be to come behinde a man, and as it were to catch him by the heel. For that this was the embleme of guile and deceitfull dealing, it may be gathered from the story of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> when as <hi>Esau</hi> being beguiled of the blessing by the craft of his brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> makes an allusion to his name; <hi>Well,</hi> saith he, <hi>may he be called Iacob, for he hath beguiled me now these two times:</hi> Now <hi>Iacob</hi> had his name in the beginning because he caught his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the heel, when he came out of the womb; for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies the heel, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is as much to say, as an Heeler, whence the allusion of <hi>Esau</hi> hath this sense, if we take it <hi>verbatim;</hi> My brother may well be called an <hi>Heeler,</hi> for he hath <hi>heeled</hi> me these two times: Now because to come behinde a man, and take him by the heel was foul play, therefore of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> an heel comes <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>(dolus, fallacia)</hi> guile, and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a verb signifying
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:101070:221"/>
to deceive or beguile, which is the second sense that <hi>Esau</hi> would imply by his allusion, that his brother might well be called a Beguiler, because he had begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him now these two times. But of this I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore we have seen the Devils practice, and learned that he works altogether by deceit, how wary should the consideration hereof make us to be in all the ways of our life? If we knew we had to deal with a man that used to beguile all that came into his fingers, in what continuall jealousie and suspition would we be? how would we cast about to find which way he might not circumvent us? how wary would we be to entertain any proffer from him? there could be nothing made seem so fair, but we would suspect some foul meaning to be in it. If we would be thus disposed in matters of lesser moment, how carefull should we be in greater? if where the ability of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is lesser, what manner of men should we be when we know the Arch-deceiver of the world is continually attending upon us, labouring to beguile us? should we here adventure upon any action rashly? No surely; but be first well advised. We should not be too confident in our own perswasions, lest they may prove the Devils suggestions: and though the reasons we apprehend be never so good, and the case seem never so clear, and the way we are to walk in never so secure, yet ought we to make some pause, and act a fit of jealousie afore we adventure.</p>
                     <p>And thus much of the Serpents action, <hi>Guile:</hi> Now I come to the object, <hi>Me. Me,</hi> that is, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the two. <hi>Me,</hi> so much endeared in the affection
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:101070:222"/>
of my Lord, that he could not but do any thing at my request. Of these two respects I will speak in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and first of the first. The Devil assaults us there where he finds us weakest, as here in this first sin he attempts the woman the weaker vessell; <hi>The Serpent beguiled me:</hi> for he knows this is the readiest way to overcome. A skilfull Commander being to take a City, will not make his battery on that part of the wall, which is strongly fortified, (for so he might make his shot in vain;) but will assault it there where it is least defensible, where a breach will be easily made, and yet entring he becomes Master of the whole, how well fortified soever: even so the Devil will be sure to force us there where we are least able to resist; if he finds any part not well bulwark'd with resolution, there he plants the Cannon of his temptation, and with an easie breach becomes Master of the whole piece.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may learn what to esteem of those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect courses concerning the Commandements of God, too frequent among the sons of men: There are many who resolve firmly against divers kinds of sins, that they will never be drawn by any means to commit them, but they have always some one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they demurre whether they should resolve to yeeld to or not, if occasion should be offered. Many will fortify themselves very strongly against the assaults of bribery, of covetousnesse, of theft, of promise-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of drunkennesse; but as concerning their lust they are unresolved what to do, if a temptation should assault them; &amp; so in others, there is some other incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation but slenderly guarded, when for the rest they
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:101070:222"/>
could glory how strongly they are fortified. But we must know, that when the Devil comes to assault us, he will passe by us where we are strength, and attempt us only there where our weaknesse lies; and then we shall find all our labour lost, and all our other strength to have stood us in little stead: For what wil it boot to guard the wals of our City never so strongly, if but one part be left unguarded for the enemies to enter? Is not all the enemies? A Ship though in other parts never so sound, will sink, if but one leaking hole be left unstopped. Let us therefore survey our hearts diligently, and finding where we lie exposed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, there most to strengthen our selves with reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                     <p>And thus I come to the second respect, why the Devil made choice of the woman, namely, because of the vehemency of her husbands affection towards her; so that to have gained her was to have gotten him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: for he seemed to think that her strength in her husbands affection was more powerfull to prevail with him, then his subtile motives were to overcome him; and indeed the event prov'd he was not much deceiv'd. Hence we are to observe that the Devil ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth advantage of the vehemency of our passions, to work our overthrow, if he once finde these to fasten his hold by, he then thinks he may lead us whither he list. To have gained our affections is as it were to have gotten a party within, which is a dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to further the invasion of an enemy; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when most of our passions are our favorites, which we can deny nothing they ask, and if they be once bribed, will work us wholly to the dispose of our arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemy. <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 27.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:101070:223"/>
That we may not therefore afford the Devil this advantage, and as it were reach him a rope to hang us withall, it behoves us so to govern and temper our passions and affections, that they transport us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Devils jurisdiction: which that we may the better do, it will not be unfit to set down some rules for performance thereof,</p>
                     <p>First, therefore it is best to resist our passions at the beginning, and to use the same policy which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with the Israelites, that they might not over-run his Country, in killing all their infants as soon as they were born. While the sore is green Surgeons seldom despair, but festered once, they hardly cure it: So it is with the passions of our minde, when they are first growing, they are soon curbed, but being a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, they will hardly be subdued.</p>
                     <p>The second means is, to inure our selves to crosse our passions when there is no danger, and to bridle our selves sometimes from ordinary and lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that we may do it with more ease when we are in danger; for how can he hope to be able to master his passions when dangerous temptations assault him, who never used them to it in the time of his security? We know that men who would fit themselves for the Wars, will practice in the time of peace when there is no enemy near, and will toil and labour when they might be at rest, will lie hard when they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a soft bed, will watch when they might sleep, and all to make themable to indure the like when they shall have need: the like must we do, that we may get an habit to crosse and subdue our passions when we shall have need.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="437" facs="tcp:101070:223"/>
The third means is, to fly occasions which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense the passions whereunto we are inclined: <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones faciunt latrones,</hi> saith the Proverb, Occasion makes him a theef, which else might have been an honest man; wherefore he that commits himself to Sea in a boisterous tempest is worthy to suffer ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; and he that willingly puts himself in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of infected persons, may blame himself if he fall into their diseases.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, but chiefly, when thy passions are most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, then seek for succour from heaven, fly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of Christ as the chickens under the hen, when the kite seeks to devour them: beat at the gates of mercy, and crave grace to overcome thy misery: He is thy Father and will not give thee a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, if thou ask him Fish: humble thy self before him, open thy sores and wounds unto him, and the good Samaritan will pour in both wine and oyl, and thy passions shall melt and fall away as clouds are dispelled and consumed by the Sun.</p>
                     <div type="verse">

                           <bibl>VERSE 14.</bibl>
                           <q>And the Lord said unto the Serpent, &amp;c.</q>
                        </epigraph>
                        <p>THese words contain in them the Serpents doom and destiny, pronounced upon him by the great Lord of Heaven and Earth; They contain in them two parts: First, the reason of this sentence in the words, <hi>Because thou hast done this:</hi> Secondly, the sentence it self in the words following, <hi>Thou art cursed above all cattell, &amp;c.</hi> The reason of this heavy doom is, <hi>Because he had done this.</hi> What <hi>This?</hi> namely, because he had beguiled the man and woman, which God had made, and caused them to transgresse his great commandment. He therefore that is the cause and occasion of anothers sin, is as hatefull to God as the door, and is liable to as great, or rather a greater punishment then he: for the Serpent here for causing hath this doom, as well as the man and woman for doing. Nay, which is to be observed, his doom is the first read unto him, as if he were the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offender, and not to the man or woman till he was done with: What should this mean, but that his fault being the mover, was more grievous in the eyes of God then theirs? which is the reason also, why the woman comes in the next place to have her sentence, because she had been a sin-maker, and was guilty not only of her own personall sin, but of her husbands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; whence the man who had sinn'd only himself, and not caused others to sin, had his judgement last of all. I might also confirm the same from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:101070:224"/>
of their severall judgements, in that the Serpent alone is doom'd to be accursed, and no such word spoken either of the man or the woman.</p>
                        <p>But I shall not need to tarry here to prove how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearfull a thing it is to be the author of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sin: We know they are the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Mat. 18. 6, 7. Wo unto the world because of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and woe unto the man by whom a scandall commeth; it were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul (1 Cor. 8.) would eat no meat as long as the world lasteth, rather then make his brother to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</hi> Would they would consider this, who are not content alone to sin themselves, but play the Devil in corrupting others. It seems they long to be double damn'd. I would also they would think of this, who make no conscience at all by extremities and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other grievances, to drive a man to perjury, and other grievous sins, and yet think themselves free, when they should know, that he that is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of anothers sin, makes anothers guilt his own, and shall share in the punishment every whit as deep as he.</p>
                        <p>But this shall suffice to have observed in the first part, the reason of the Serpents doom. Now I come to the second, the doom it self: wherein the words as you see have all relation to the Serpent, for <hi>the Lord said unto the Serpent, Thou are cursed &amp;c. Thou shalt go upon thy brest, &amp;c.</hi> But because this Serpent was more then a brute Serpent, the Devil himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief agent in this his instrument, it is a thing much controverted, upon which of these this curse is
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:101070:225"/>
here pronounced. Some would have it spoken only of the brute Serpent, because here is a comparison made with cattell and beasts of the field, thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the Serpent one of that number. Besides, Satan they say was accursed before this time, and some of the words in this curse cannot well be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any but the brute Serpent, as that <hi>he should eat the dust of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Others would have this curse pronounced only upon the spirituall Serpent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, because the brute Serpent was only an instrument abused by the Devil, and neither knew what was done, nor could do withall; and why should it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be punished? Others would divide the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, applying the first part of the curse in the 14. verse, to the brute Serpent, the latter in the 15. verse, to the Devil or spirituall Serpent; because as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the promised seed of the woman, which should destroy the Serpent and his seed, must needs be meant of Christ and Satan; so the former words are most fitly appliable to the brute Serpent only: But against this may be said, that the same <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> spoken of in the first part of the curse, is all one with the <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> in the latter; and therefore of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the first is meant, of the same is also meant the latter. There is therefore a fourth opinion, that this curse is throughout pronounced upon both, both upon the Serpent and the Devil: In which, though there be some difference about the manner how, yet I imbrace it as the truest, as not only conceiving it may be so, by the fitnesse of all the parts so applied to both; but think moreover that this only ought to be the meaning and no other, if it be conceived as I am now to shew.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="441" facs="tcp:101070:225"/>
For in the first place, the Devil when he beguiled man, came not as a naked spirit, but in the shape and figure of a Serpent, (as I have shew'd heretofore;) and therefore that his punishment in the manner might be sutable and answerable to his offence, he was to receive his doom likewise under the figure of a Serpent, and the style thereof framed unto a Serpents condition: for it is the constant method of the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God to brand the punishment with the stamp of the sin, that the offender thereby might not only know what he felt, but also read why he suffered. Why was <hi>Adonibezeks</hi> thumbs and great toes cut off, but that he might read therein, as he did, his former cruelty? <hi>Threescore and ten Kings having their thumbs and toes cut off, gathered meat under my Table. As I have done, so God hath requited me.</hi> Why was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his Host rather drowned in the Sea, then slain in the field, but that all the world might read it was for his cruell Edict to drown all the male children of the Hebrews? Why did <hi>Absalom</hi> lie with <hi>Davids</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, but to put <hi>David</hi> in minde that he had lien with <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife? And why was the curse of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil shaped here in and unto the condition of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but because he had beguiled man in a Serpents shape?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the Serpent; The fashion, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and subtilty of the Serpent above all the beasts which God had made, the Devil had abused to gain credit with the woman, that he was an excellent and a most sagacious spirit, and therefore might be able to pry farther into Gods meaning then she could, which was the cause of her attention, and so of her ruine. For
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:101070:226"/>
I have shewed heretofore that the woman in the state of integrity knew well enough, that as it was the law of spirits in their commerce with men, to present themselves under the shape of some visible thing: so it must be likewise under the shape of some such thing, as may more or lesse resemble their condition: And that as the glorious spirits might take no other shape but of man, the glory of visible creatures: so the fallen spirits could not then afore mans fall, take any other shape but of a beast, thereby to bewray his abasement: yet because the Devil here took upon him the shape of the most wise and most excellent of beasts, he so bleared the womans eyes with an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his excellency and sagacity, that in a manner she forgot, or regarded not, that he was one of the evil and abased spirits, which was the ground of her miserable ruine and overthrow.</p>
                        <p>Now because the excellency and sagacity of the Serpent had thus been the occasion of mans confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by being made the lying counterfeit of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils excellency and wisdome, and the mask whereby he so covered his vilenesse, that the woman took him not to be as he was indeed: Therefore God in his wisdome thought good to change the copy, and henceforth to blurre and deface that unhappy physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomicall letter, and by abasing the Serpent for the time to come, to make him an everlasting embleme and monument, wherein man might hieroglyphically read the malice, vilenesse and execrable basenesse of that wicked spirit which had beguiled him, to hate him (as now we do the Serpent) with mortall hatred, and by his unlucky and brained fortune, to expect the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:101070:226"/>
Devils destiny: In a word, that which was once used for a mask to cover the Devils knavery, should for the future be a glasse wherein to behold his villany.</p>
                        <p>These being the reasons which have led me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this curse in an equall sense, both of the brute Serpent and the Devil, and in the literall applied unto the Serpent, yet therein shaping out the malediction of the Devil, as truly as the Devil had taken upon him the Serpents shape: Let us now come to the particular handling of the words; and first consider them, as they are the curse of the unreasonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Secondly, as they include the Devils male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                        <p>But for the better understanding thereof, before we can proceed, two things are to be resolv'd: First, how it could be just with God to punish the brute Serpent, who was <hi>Instrumentum</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and had neither will to sin, nor yet knowledge of what the Devill had done; especially, if we suppose as I have hitherto, that the Devil took only the shape of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which the Serpent could not do withall? for this argument hath driven some to affirm, that the whole curse was to be understood only of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Serpent, and not at all of the naturall. But why should this stumble them more as concerning the justnesse of God, then that in <hi>Adams</hi> censure in the 17. ver. where the whole earth is cursed for <hi>Adams</hi> sake, <hi>Cursed be the earth for thy sake, &amp;c.</hi> But what had the earth done? or how was it guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Again, in the sixth Chapter following it is expresly said, <hi>That because God saw the wickednesse of man was great in the earth, he said, I will destroy both
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:101070:227"/>
man and beast, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the aire.</hi> But how were the beasts, the creeping things, and the fowls of the air partakers of mans wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? what had they done more then been abused by him? which they could not avoid he being their Lord and Master. And should not we think that Law of God just, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. where if a man commit abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination with a beast, the beast is commanded to be slain as well as the man, who only had sinned? This proves that objection to be wholly insufficient: But yet the difficulty of the resolution, How this may stand with Gods justice, remains as before; which therefore comes now to be resolved.</p>
                        <p>First, we know that all the beasts of the field, all the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the Sea were made for the use and service of man in one kinde or other, as he should have occasion to use them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if man had stood in his first creation, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the creatures should have been sutable to his excellency and integrity, and so far more noble then now it is, that even the creatures might be partakers of his happinesse then, that since they yet look for the glorious liberty of the sons of God to come. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but when man was once fallen, the service of the creature was altered, and became a bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> terms it, that is, gnoble &amp; sutable to the corrupt condition of man under sin: those which should have been imploied excellently for the use of his integrity, are now to serve him ignominiously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his sin and misery; namely, either to be the means to punish him for his sin, or to relieve him in his misery. To punish him, all the creatures for
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:101070:227"/>
his use are become base, corrupt and unworthy, and so nothing so usefull for him as they had been: The earth will not bring forth for him, but with his labour and toil, and then too when it should bear him corn, it brings forth thorns and thistles: The creatures which should serve and honour him, do often seise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and destroy him. And thus are the creatures imploied for mans use, indeed but a wofull use to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and punish him for his sin all the days of his life. Another way notwithstanding they are usefull and serviceable for his good, as helps to relieve and better him in this his condition of sin; as to be made docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the wrath of God to move him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and emblemes to know the condition of his most deadly enemy the Devil, and how he ought to abhorre and hate him, and the hope and expectation of conquering and triumphing over him in the blessed seed of the woman. And for this use and service was the Serpent abased and made vile, according to his curse in my Text; that as he was made excellent to serve him in integrity, so he was now abased, to be made fit to do him the best service in his misery. And what injustice could this be in God? when he made him at first so as he made him for the service of man, and now when he marr'd him, he marr'd him likewise for mans service.</p>
                        <p>The second thing to be resolved is, Whether this curse were pronounced only upon one individuall Serpent; or whethet upon all Serpents in generall; or upon some one only kind which the Devil had thus abused? Of one individuall Serpent it cannot be, because there is mention here of the seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:101070:228"/>
and seed of the woman, which implies a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many Serpents; and besides, this curse was to be a monument not only to him but to all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, as long as the world lasted, but one individuall Serpent lived not so long. Neither is it credible to be spoken of all kinds of Serpents in generall, because there is almost as great a variety of Serpents as of four footed beasts of severall kinds and species, and why should any kind suffer, save that only which had been abused to offend? Besides, I make no doubt but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Serpents went at the first Creation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their brests as now they do, and were every whit as base as now they are, excepting the generall decay of all creatures since the fall. It remains therefore that it was only one kind of Serpent which bore this speciall malediction; and that such a kind as was not only the noblest of all the kinds of Serpents, but as it seems far excelling all the Creation besides (man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly except) for beauty, wisdome and sagacity, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by this curse became not only baser then the rest of the beasts of the field, but even as base and vile as the vilest kind of Serpent. And therefore it could not be the Basilisk, as some have held, though it be the most poisonfull of all others, and as it were a King among Serpents, as the name imports; for if <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Solinus,</hi> who report the former, say true, this Serpent here accursed, should rather be any other kind then that, because the Basilisk (upon their report) goes with his brest and fore-part of his body advanced, <hi>(erectus à medio incedens,</hi> saith <hi>Plinie,</hi> or as <hi>Solinus, mediâ corporis parte serpit, mediâ arduus est &amp; excel sus)</hi> but this Serpent here was from the hour of his
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:101070:228"/>
doom, to go for ever upon his brest, which I wonder they considered not, who from the advanced posture of the Basilisks body have conceived the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: For as by this example we may beleeve that the Serpent now accursed, did so before his curse; so that he should still do so, it is a most direct gainsaying of Scripture to imagine.</p>
                        <p>But to come to the words of the doom; which, as you see, are first generall; then particular. Generall in these, <hi>Thou art cursed above all cattell, and above, &amp;c.</hi> What it is to be accursed, we shall know, if we first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what it is to be blessed. To be blessed or happy, is nothing else, but an all-fruition of good, or to have a sufficient provision and furniture of good, both for being and well-being: So therefore that creature is happy and blessed which hath a sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all good for the being and preservation of it self; which wants neither endowments inward, nor means outward for the attaining of that end, whereof it is by nature capable. To be accursed is to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of this; to be despoiled either of indowments internall or inherent, without which it hath no digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the creatures; or externall, without which it cannot live or preserve it self, but with much penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, difficulty, toil and danger. Whatsoever therefore among the beasts of the field, (for with such only is the comparison made) is for inherent perfections of all the most unworthy and base; or for the outward furniture of means for the preservation of that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being by unprovision of all others the most wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and miserable; this is that which is accursed above all cattell, and above every beast of the field.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:101070:229"/>
And such was the Serpents condition to be for the generall.</p>
                        <p>And now for the particulars; Let us go on and see how they are expressed, and that is in three things: First, <hi>To go upon the brest,</hi> or to have the posture of the body groveling on the earth; whereby (as I shall shew presently) is implied the abasement of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, to have for meat <hi>the dust of the earth;</hi> wherein is shewn its unprovision of food for the maintenance of its life, being of all beasts of the field to have the basest and coursest fare. Thirdly, to be in continuall, mortall, and irreconcilable enmity with man, both his Lord and the Lord of the rest of the creatures: from whom it should be in continuall danger and fear of its life, and once espied be sure to have its brains dash'd out by him. And which makes the misery so much the greater, to be no way able to be revenged of his enemy other then to come una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares behind him, and then neither not able to reach above his heel; as being most unequally matched, he walking aloft with his head and whole body advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, while the miserable Serpent shall lie groveling on the ground, ready to be trodden apieces under his feet.</p>
                        <p>Of these three particulars let us speak severally; and first of the first, <hi>Vpon thy brest shalt thou go.</hi> In the Hebrew it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which some turn, upon thy belly: which interpretation hath been one great cause of the difficulty to understand the meaning of this malediction: For if the shape of the Serpent were after the fashion it is now, it is not possible to imagine how it could ever have gone otherwise then
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:101070:229"/>
upon the belly; for to think that ever it went an end, were a conceit more worthy to be derided then to be beleeved. By which means there appeared no other way of evasion out of this difficulty, but to affirm that the Serpent indeed went upon his belly from the beginning; but either it was not so toilsome to him, or not for a curse unto him till now, which for my part, it being so far from the letter of the Text, I could never yet beleeve. I had much rather in this follow the Vulgar, or <hi>Ieromes</hi> Translation, which reads, <hi>super pectus tuum gradiêris;</hi> for upon the belly I beleeve the Serpent went from the first Creation, but not upon the brest untill this present malediction. The brest of the Serpent I call the upper part of the Serpents body, from the navell to the head; the other part of the other half downward, with which though at the first he walked prone to and upon the earth, yet was the other part, his brest and head, reared up and advanced, untill for having been abused to the ruine of mankind, he was now with his whole body to creep groveling upon the earth. And perhaps thus much the Septuagint meant to insinuate by their Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is <gap reason="foreign">

But no particularity of signification can from that place be gathered, the speech being of cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things, which go as well upon the brest as the belly, and the belly as the brest.</p>
                        <p>Since therefore the word here used neither hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth our opinion, nor much furthereth it, we will come to such other grounds as may prove our asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Serpents going with brest advanced afore the fall of man, and not groveling till his malediction. And first let it be considered there is no impossibility of it in regard of the frame of the Serpent, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:101070:230"/>
both by their advancing themselves when they assault a man, (which the Painters expresse in their Pictures) and also when they swim through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is with their head and some part of their brest raised above water, even as a Swan holdeth up her neck, as I have heard affirmed by such as have been eye-witnesses: and lastly, <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Basilisk, that the Basilisk walks so still; as I shewed a little before. And it may be as when the Giant-like stature of mankind was diminished after the stood in a manner throughout the world, and for many ages, yet was there by Gods disposition, still a race of Giants left even till the time of <hi>David,</hi> for a monument and witnesse of the truth of a far bigger stature in former times, which else could not so easily have been beleeved or imagined. Such were the <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zummims</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, the sons of <hi>Anak</hi> in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>Goliah</hi> in the time of <hi>David;</hi> and it may be there are yet some in some part of the world to be found. So I say, as these seem to have been preserved by God, as a memoriall unto men, that they were not now as at the first; so it may be it was the will of God and is, amongst so many kinds of Serpents to preserve this one, that it should not as the rest go groveling upon the earth, but might be as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth of the malediction of the rest to all posterity. Thus much of the possibility, which would be far greater, if we should with S. <hi>Basil, Ephrem, Bar Cephas,</hi> and many others affirm that the Serpent had feet, namely, some short ones beneath the navell: for feet are not essentiall to the nature of a thing, as appears by the lame, who can live without them, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:101070:231"/>
by others, sometimes by the defect of nature born without them. And those who can beleeve the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull change of man by his fall, of an immortall creature to become mortall; of one to have been born with all glorious endowments both of body and soul, now to be brought into the world the most unfurnished of the creatures. Those who beleeve the great alteration of the earth it self, when it was accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for mans sin; the diminution of the time of mans life, and of his stature, even since the flood. Can any who believe these things, think it so incredible for the Serpent once to have had some small feet, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to have had none, being a creature wherein God intended to leave a monument for ever? But of this I will determine nothing, neither doth my assertion simply depend upon it, but may well enough consist without it.</p>
                        <p>But because possibility is not sufficient of it self alone to infer a probability, I have therefore one thing to adde more thereto, namely, the reason and cause even in nature (supposing still Gods abasing of the Serpents first creation) of this alteration of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the Serpents gate from that it was at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                        <p>First, we know the more excellent and sublime the nature of a creature is, the more it raiseth it self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the more ignoble and baser, the more it fals downward. This we see in the elements themselves; the fire the most excellent and operative of the four, raiseth it self above the rest: The earth the basest and most unactive of all, is also of all the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="453" facs="tcp:101070:231"/>
Secondly, as there is this difference in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so there is in the mixed bodies; some consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a more sublime and excellent temper, others of a more base and ignoble mixture: and that as in other, so amongst such creatures as live and move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this their noblenesse within discovereth it self in the body without, by advancing them natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their gate and gesture; whence man being of all creatures living upon the earth of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper and sublimed condition of nature, is therefore of all other the most advanced in body:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pronáque cum spectant animalia caetera terram,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Os homini sublime dedit, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, experience will tell us, that even amongst men themselves, those who are of a more exalted nature, either by heroick tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or predominancy of heat, are also more advanced in the posture of their bodies. Among beasts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the basest is the most creeping, the noble Lion advanceth his head and brest so far as the frame of his body is thereof capable, and so the rest: and of all creatures we may observe besides, that such creatures have the most sagacity, who come most near to walk upright as a man doth.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the Serpent were of so sublime a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the first, as thereby it was more subtle then any beast of the field which God had made, how could so excellent a temper, the ground of so much sagacity, but advance the body thereof, as far as the frame and shape thereof could admit? On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if afterward the Serpent became the most abased and accursed of all the beasts of the field, how should
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:101070:232"/>
not this alteration of his former temper and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, make the gesture of his body also su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, by stooping and groveling upon the earth? Who knows not that the naturall position of man is erected agreeable to his excellency above other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures having life and motion? and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so much hath the dejection of his primitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for sin weakned in him this propension, that were it not for education, it is supposed, yea and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirmed, that he would walk upon all four like a beast. And shall we wonder that the malediction of the Serpent, exceeding that of mans, should produce as much as this?</p>
                        <p>So then to conclude this first particular of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents curse; I understand it, from the ground afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, as insinuating the cause by the outward and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible effect, according to the manner of the Scripture; namely, the abasement and fall of the Serpents whole nature from his primitive perfection, discovered by the fall of his once advanced body, thenceforth to go groveling upon the earth: Even as the despoiling of the nature of man, of the inward indowments of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is by the same sacred trope, insinuated by his outward nakednesse; that is, the obsruration of that glorious and celestiall beauty, which he had before his sin: The difference whereof was so great; that he could not endure afterward to behold himself any more, but sought for a covering, even to hide himself from himself.</p>
                        <p>And now I come to the second particular; <hi>Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</hi> The coursest diet that any living creature hath allowed him: None of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:101070:232"/>
the beasts of the field with whom he is compared, are thus poorly provided for; nay, not any other, unlesse the base earthworm, not worthy to be named among the creatures. Even with this vilest of creatures is now ranked that once so noble a creature, the Serpent. Which yet is not so to be understood, as though the Serpent did not sometime eat something else, for they sometime devour birds, frogs, and such like; but that this is the ordinary fare which God hath provided him, and if at any time he getteth any other, he goeth beyond his limits. Whence <hi>Esay</hi> 65. among the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the new Jerusalem, this is reckoned for one, That <hi>the Serpent should eat dust;</hi> that is, be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the diet God had appointed him, and not to encroach upon the food appointed for others.</p>
                        <p>But why did God appoint him this food? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, even to continue him in that accursed and vile condition to which he had dejected him: For food is for the repairing and preservation of nature, and the goodnesse and badnesse thereof doth make the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the body better or worse. Hence according to the degrees of excellency in the creatures, their food is finer or courser: Plants suck the moisture of the earth; beasts live most upon plants, but man of the flesh of cattell, fowl, and fishes: Since therefore the Serpent was to have no better fare then the dust of the earth, as it argues the basenesse of his nature, which can with such food be nourished; so doth it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily imply his continuance in that his dejection and vilenesse: whereas otherwise it were not impossible, because his nature for the essence is still the same it was, if his diet were as it had been, for him to improve
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:101070:233"/>
himself more near to his primitive temper then now he is. But God who had decreed he should ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under this malediction, appointed also the means to retain him therein.</p>

It containeth two parts; The Enmity, and the Event and managing thereof. For the enmity, how it is verified concerning the brute Serpent, experience telleth: It is some part of the happinesse of the creature, to be the favourite of man who is the Lord thereof; what honour could betide it greater then this? But between the Serpent and Man is the most deadly enmity, and the strongest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy that is amongst the beasts of the field: Such an one as discovereth it self both in the <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>sensitive</hi> faculties of them both: For the first, their humours are poison each to other; the gall of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is mans deadly poison; and so is the spittle of man affirmed to poison the Serpent. For the sensitive antipathy, it appears in that the one doth so much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:101070:233"/>
the sight and presence of the other; mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is at nothing so much astonished, as at the sight of a Serpent; and like enough the Serpent is in like manner affected at the sight of man; And that more especially, as the Naturalists affirm, of a naked man, then otherwise. As though his instinct even remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the time of his malediction, when he and naked man stood before God to receive this sentence of everlasting enmity.</p>
                        <p>And whereas the words of the Text do in speciall point out the woman in this sentence of enmity; the Naturalists do observe, that is greater and more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with that sex, then with the male of mankinde: Insomuch that <hi>Rupertus</hi> affirmeth, that if but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked foot of a woman doth never so little presse the head of a Serpent before he can sting her, both the head and body presently dieth, which no cudgell, or other weapon will do, but that some life and motion will still remain behinde: <hi>Hoc</hi> (saith he) <hi>ita est, ipso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, qui per industriam exploraverunt, fide relatione comperimus. Lib. 3. de Trin. c.</hi> 20. You know my Author.</p>
                        <p>The remaining words of my Text do expresse the managing and event of this enmity, which is far more dangerous and unlikely on the Serpents part then on Mans; for man is able to reach the Serpents head, where his life chiefly resideth, and where a blow is deadly: but as for the Serpent he shall not be able to prevail against man otherwise then privily and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and that but in his lowest part, namely, when he shall passe him unseen, to sting him by the heel. And that this is the nature of a Serpent it appeareth
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:101070:234"/>
in the words of <hi>Dans</hi> blessing, <hi>Gen. 49. Dan shall be a Serpent by the way, an Adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</hi> And to make an end of this discourse also, it is a thing to be observed in the nature of a Serpent, that assoon as he perceiveth man ready to throw or strike at him, he will presently roul his body for a buckler to save his head; even as though he had some impression of that doctrine, which God here read him in my Text, <hi>Ipse conteret tibi caput;</hi> Beware thy head.</p>
                        <p>And thus hitherto I have considered these words as they are the curse of the brute Serpent; now I am to go over with them again, to shew how they are propounded unto us by God, as a glasse wherein to behold the Devils malediction: the Serpent being made now the discovery of his vilenesse, which once he abused for a mask to hide it from the woman. As therefore the Serpent is the most accursed of all the cattell and beasts of the field; so is the Devil the most accursed spirit amongst all orders and degrees of spirits; namely, of the highest of Angels become the abjectest of spirits, more base &amp; accursed then the most cursed damned soul, having little or nothing left him of that good which was sutable to a spirituall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and this is the state of the Devil for the generall, answerable to that of the Serpent.</p>
                        <p>Now for the particulars: The first is, <hi>Vpon thy brest shalt thou go:</hi> How doth this befit the Devil? The Devil hath no bodily brest to go upon: But as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Serpent, that this groveling signified the abasement of his whole nature from his primitive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; so in the Devil it signifies, his stooping down
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:101070:234"/>
and falling from his most sublime and glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A wonderfull stoop this was, when that which had been advanced as high as heaven, was made to fall down as low, yea lower then the earth it self; This is the Devils going upon his brest, this the groveling of that once so highly reared posture; according to that description of <hi>Iude ver.</hi> 6. who cals them <hi>the Angels that kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation:</hi> agreeable to that of S. <hi>Peter 2 Ep. c. 2. v. 4. God spared not the Angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second particular is, <hi>The dust of the earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</hi> The food wherewith spirits are fed, is analogicall, spirituall and not corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, we must therefore here seek out that, which in them hath the fittest resemblance with corporall food. The life of Angels consists in the continuall contemplation of the excellent greatnesse, wonderfull goodnesse, and glorious beauty of the essence of God, both as it is in it self, and as it is communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his creatures. This is that which our Saviour intimates, <hi>Mat. 18. 10. Their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> The food of Angels whereby this their intellectuall life and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is strengthned and continued, is that unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy and delight which accompanies this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God, and which they finde in the beholding of whatsoever else hath any conformity or sutableness with him, his power, his wisdome, his glory, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: According to that in the Gospel, <hi>There is joy in heaven, and in the presence of the Angels of God, for one sinner that repenteth.</hi> This is that Manna which
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:101070:235"/>
feeds the blessed Angels, and which makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariable and unsatiable in their contemplation, and imitation of God, as corporall food enableth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the continuance of corporall works.</p>
                        <p>And such as this had been the Devils fare, had he not fallen from his first estate by sin: whereas now in stead of that Manna, he is fain with the Serpent to feed of a food as course and as base as the dust of the earth; for as of a glorious Angel he is fallen to be a damned spirit; so is his diet answerable to continue him in that damnable estate; namely, a food clean contrary to that of the blessed Angels, and a very earth to their heaven; A most execrable joy, and a malicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in whatsoever is opposite to the power, the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the goodnesse, the glory of God his Creator: this is that he hungreth and hunteth after, and nothing but this. If there were no sin, no confusion, no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of creatures in the world, the Devil would be soon starved; for this is that he preys after, this is that carrion he seeks for, when he goeth about, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may devour.</hi> I have read of a people of <hi>America,</hi> that will eat no flesh before it be stinking rotten, and then it seems to them most tender and delicate: These are of a diet like unto the Devil, for nothing but garbage and carrion are his dainties, the more rotten with sin, the more pleasing to his palate, that which stinks most in Gods nostrils, that smels the sweetest in his.</p>
                        <p>The last part of this curse remains, <hi>I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between thee and the woman, and between thy seed, &amp;c.</hi> In which we will first consider the parties who are to be at this deadly feud: Secondly, the event and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:101070:235"/>
they have one against the other: For the first, the parties are on one side said to be the <hi>Serpent and his seed:</hi> on the other side, <hi>The woman and her seed.</hi> By the Serpent we are to understand Satan the Prince of darknesse and Father of Devils: This Serpents seed in the first place are the whole crue of Devils and damned spirits, who are fallen from their first estate and condition. These are the Serpents first-born, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him not by corporall generation, nor as they are spirits, but by spirituall deformation, as they are Devils: For it is the opinion of Divines, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan fell first himself, and afterward propagated his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie by drawing others after him, over whom therefore he worthily deserveth to have the principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and chiefdome; in which respect also were there no other, yet he might be called their Father, and they his sons or seed, as we know the use of the Scripture is, to call Princes Fathers, and Subjects sons. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter off-spring of the Devil being a second brood, are the whole company of wicked and reprobate world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: for that such as these are the spawn of that foul fiend, it appears clearly by the words of our Saviour to the Pharisees, <hi>Ioh. 8. 44. Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 10. The children of God</hi> are opposed to the <hi>children of the Devil:</hi> Therefore Christ cals <hi>Iudas a Devil, Ioh.</hi> 6. And <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 13. 10. cals <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, <hi>A child of the Devil.</hi> The case is plain: And as the Vanguard consisted of the first crue, so these latter are the Rere of Satans Army.</p>
                        <p>Now on the other side against this Army of Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, stand <hi>the Woman and the Womans seed.</hi> The
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:101070:236"/>
woman though only named, excludes not the man, who was to be at enmity with the Devil as well as the woman: But the reason of this unusuall Trope, which cals the kind by the name of the weaker and inferiour sex, is because of the words following, <hi>of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>he seed,</hi> wherein is contained the great mystery of Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, under whose colours, and in whose power alone this Army is both to march and overcome: for this great Captain was to be, as you know, the seed of the woman only, and not of the man; <hi>A Virgin should conceive a Son, whose name is called Emmanuel.</hi> Whence it comes to passe, that some <hi>by seed,</hi> will have no other seed to be understood, but the person of Christ only; both because he is alone that seed of the woman, which is not the seed of man; and because S. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3. 16. in those words, <hi>In thy seed shall all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth be blessed,</hi> expoundeth <hi>seed</hi> singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and individually of Christ himself alone. But if it be well observed, the case here is not the like; for the seed of the woman, is opposed to the seed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which seed cannot chuse but be taken collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Satan and all his regiments of Devils and hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds. And why should not also the seed of the woman be understood of Christ mysticall, that is, of Christ the Head with all his members, who are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into him by faith into one mysticall body? For although they are naturally the seed of man as well as of the woman, yet spiritually by this incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they are the feed of the woman only, as is their Head with whom they are one: And this it is which makes them of the party against the Serpent, for till they once became the seed of the woman only, there was no enmity betwixt them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="463" facs="tcp:101070:236"/>
The seed therefore of the woman, I expound to be Christ and his Members: He <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the seed of the woman by nature, they <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>ment into him. Hence appears the difference of these two Armies; First, in Satans Army all march under their Father, who begot them; but Christs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my sighteth under the Colours of their elder brother, the first begotten seed of the woman. Secondly, in their ranging Christ and his Army are as one body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one Spirit; the Devil is far more disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thirdly, in their fighting, for in Satans Army every Souldier useth his own strength, and fights with his own weapons; but in Christs Army the whole strength lies in Christ their Generall: All our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is on his back, and our weapons guided by the power of his hand. So we may learn out of S. <hi>Paul, Ephes. 6. 11, 12. Put on</hi> (saith he) <hi>the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the Devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darknesse in this world, against spirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in high places.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus then having seen the marshalling of these two Armies, which are at so deadly an enmity, let us at last see the successe of their skirmishes, and of the stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems which they practise one against the other: these are described on the Devils part very terrible, that his <hi>head</hi> should be mauled. But on Christs side the losse should be very small, the Devil prevailing but to the wounding or <hi>bruising of his heel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what is this <hi>Head</hi> of the Serpent? and what the <hi>Heel</hi> of the womans seed? Those who understand
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:101070:237"/>
the seed of the woman singularly of the person of Christ only, make his head to be the Godhead, against which the Serpent could prevail nothing; but his heel to be the manhood, which the Serpent so bruised at his Passion, that the grave became his bed for three days together: This indeed is true, and no marvell, for the head is as it were the whole bodies epitome. But we who have expounded <hi>the seed of the woman</hi> collectively, of Christ and his Members, must also in this mysticall body find a mysticall head, and a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall heel: and so in like manner for the Serpent and his seed.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Head</hi> therefore, or if you had rather, <hi>Headship,</hi> is nothing else but Soveraignty: The <hi>Serpents head</hi> is the Devils Soveraignty, which is called <hi>

                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rincipatus mortis,</hi> the Soveraignty of death; namely, both <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè</hi> and <hi>effectivè;</hi> that is, such a Soveraignty as under which are only such as are liable to death both temporall and eternall; and such a Soveraignty whose power consists not in saving and giving of life, but in destroying, and bringeth unto death both of body and soul. Under the name also of death understand, as the Scripture doth, all other miseries of mankind, which are the companions of this double death I speak of: This is that damnable head of the Serpent, the Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Soveraignty of Satan. Now the Sword whereby this Soveraignty was obtained, the Scepter whereby it is maintained, or as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>the sting</hi> of this Serpents head, is <hi>Sin:</hi> This is that which got him this Kingdome at the first, and this is still the right whereby he holds the greatest part thereof: <hi>Imporium iisdem artibus conservatur, quibus acquiritur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="465" facs="tcp:101070:237"/>
This Soveraignty of the Devil, which once over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed nigh all the world, the womans seed should break in pieces and destroy, which according to this Prophecy, we see already performed in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and the grounds laid long ago for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all that remaineth. As saith S. <hi>Iohn Ep. 1. c. 3. v. 8. The Son of God is revealed for this purpose, that he might destroy the works of the Devil.</hi> And Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self said, that <hi>the time was come that the Prince of this world should be cast out;</hi> and bade his Disciples <hi>be of good chear, for he had overcome the world.</hi> If you would see what a wonderfull victory he hath long ago got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Serpent, when after a terrible battell he overcame and destroid the Soveraignty of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Romane Empire, see it described in the 12. of the Revelation, <hi>where a Michael</hi> (that is, Christ) <hi>and his Angels, fought against the great Dragon and his Angels,</hi> till the Dragon with all his Army was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, and <hi>their place found no more in heaven,</hi> that is, he utterly lost his Soveraignty in that state; whence there was a voice in heaven, <hi>Now is come salvation, strength, and the Kingdome of our God, and the power of his Christ.</hi> And what he will at the length do with the remainder yet of the Devils Soveraignty, you may finde in the 19. and 20 of the <hi>Revelation; For he must reign,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>untill he hath put all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his feet,</hi> untill he hath destroyed all power, rule, and authority adverse unto him: And then, last of all destroying death by giving immortality to our raised bodies, shall surrender up his Kingdome unto his Father, as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p>But Satan, saith my Text, shall prevail something
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:101070:238"/>
against him, for the <hi>Serpent shall bruise his heel.</hi> What is this <hi>heel?</hi> Those who understood the seed of the woman singularly, as I told you, made it Christs Manhood. But how we expound the seed Christs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body, what shall we make the heel thereof? I could say that by it were only meant a light wound; or the Devils assaulting the Body of Christ <hi>ex insidiis,</hi> at unawares, for that is his fashion since the great overthrow, which our <hi>Michael</hi> gave him, to work his feats underhand, and to undermine our Lord in his members: But this though true is not full enough. It may seem therefore the fittest, to make hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Christians, who professe Christ outwardly, but inwardly are not his, to make those the heel of his mysticall body: for against such the Devil we know prevaileth somewhat, and by them annoyeth the rest of the Body with his venome, though he be far enough yet from impeaching our Lords Headship, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty. But will you give me leave to utter ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceit? If the blessed souls in heaven be the upper part of Christs mysticall Body, the Saints on earth the lower part of the same; may not the bodies of the Saints deceased, which lye in the earth, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the heel? for I cannot beleeve, but they have relation to this mysticall Body, though their souls be severed from them, and yet must that relation be as of the lowest and most postick members of all. If you will admit this, then it will appear presently, what was this hurt upon the heel, when Christ had once mauled the Devils head; for the Text seems to intimate that the Devil should give this wound after his head was broken.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="467" facs="tcp:101070:238"/>
I will hold you in suspence no longer; read the 13. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and see what follows upon <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> Victory over the Dragon, what the Devil did when he was down: He forms a new instrument of the wounded Roman Empire, by whose means under a pretence of the honour given to the precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the Saints and Martyrs, he conveyed the poison of Saint-worship, and Saint-invocation into the Kingdome of Christ, with which wound of the heel, the Devil comming on the blinde side, the true Church had been long annoyed and limpeth still.</p>

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:101070:241"/>
should beleeve in his Name: And this so generally <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 11.</note> and grantedly, as could never have been, at least so early, unlesse they had learned thus to apply it by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>For, in the age immediately succeeding them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the second 100 year after Christ, we find it alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to this purpose by <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the Pillars of that Age: The former of them flourishing within little more then 30 years after the death of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the latter a Disciple of <hi>Polycarp</hi> S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Scholar. In the Age following, or third <hi>Seculum</hi> it is alledged by <hi>Tertullian, Zeno Veronensis,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian:</hi> In the fourth <hi>Seculum</hi> by <hi>Eusebius, Chrysostome, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> and in the after ages by whom not? Nor is it alledged by them, as some singular opinion or private conceit of their own, but as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Tradition of the Church; whence in some Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, (as that of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Liturgy of S. <hi>Mark)</hi> it is inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hymne, or Preface, which begins <hi>Dignum &amp; justum est,</hi> the conclusion of the Hymne or Laud there being, <hi>Gratias agentes offerimus rationalem &amp; incruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thus you see the antiquity of Tradition, for the meaning and application of this Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>But for the <hi>Christian Sacrifice</hi> it self, whereunto it is applied, what the ancient Church understood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, what, and wherein the nature of this Sacrifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:101070:241"/>
is a point, though most needfull to be known, yet, beyond belief obscure, intricate, and perplext. He that shall make tryall, will finde I say true. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and learned Prelate of ours acknowledges as much: <hi>Apud veteres Patres</hi> (saith he) <hi>(ut quod res est liberè fateamur) de sacrificio corporis Christi in Eucharistia incruento, frequens est mentio, quae dici vix potest quantopere quorundam, alioqui doctorum hominum, ingenia exercuerit, torserit, vexaverit.</hi> The reason of this obscurity hath grown partly from the changing of the notion of the Church thereabout in following times; partly by the violence of the controversies of this last Age; whilest each party finding the knot, and studying not so much the right way of untying it, as how to give the least advantage to the adverse party, have infinitely intangled the same, and made it more indissoluble then before.</p>
                  <p>I have acquainted my self long with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and spent many a thought thereabout; using the best means I could conceive to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. Namely, Not so much to relye upon the opinions of modern writers, as to peruse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the passages of the Ancients themselves, and their Forms of Liturgies, out of which I was assur'd the truth might be learned, if I were but able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them.</p>
                  <p>What I have found and learned, I desire to give an account of in this place, as I shall have occasion; the Argument being such as befits no other Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but the Schools of the Prophets. Nor will the discourse be unprofitable for such, as mean to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the writings of the Fathers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:101070:242"/>
of the Church: there being nothing in them so like to stumble the reader as this.</p>
                  <p>To come then to the matter: where I will chalk out my discourse in this order.</p>
                  <p>First, I shall premise, as the ground thereof, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the <hi>Christian sacrifice,</hi> as the ancient Church meant it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Explain the meaning of my Text, by application thereto.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Prove each part of the Definition, I shall give; by the Testimonies of the Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and Liturgies of the first and best Ages, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing therewith such passages, as may make for the better understanding either of the Testimonies I bring, or of the matter it self, for which they are brought.</p>

                     <p>TO begin with the first; The definition of the Christian sacrifice; under which name first know, That the ancient Church understood not, as many suppose, the meer Sacrament of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Christ, but the whole sacred Action or solemn Service of the Church assembled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this sacred Mysterie was then a prime and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part, and as it were the Pearl or Jewel of this Ring; no publike service of the Church being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. This observed and remembred, I define the Christian sacrifice, <hi>ex mente antiquae Ecclesiae,</hi> in this manner:</p>
                     <p>An oblation of Thanksgiving and Prayer to God
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:101070:242"/>
the Father through Jesus Christ, and his Sacrifice commemorated in the Creatures of Bread and Wine, wherewith God had first been agniz'd. So that this sacrifice as you see hath a double object, or matter; First, Praise and Prayer, which you may call <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium quod.</hi> Secondly, The commemoration of Christs sacrifice on the Crosse, which is <hi>Sacrificium quo,</hi> the sacrifice whereby the other is accepted. For all the Prayers, Thansgivings, and Devotions of a Christian, are tendred up unto God in the name of Jesus Christ crucified. According whereunto, we are wont to conclude our Prayers with <hi>Through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> And this is the specification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the worship of a Christian is distinguisht from that of the Jew. Now that which we in all our Prayers and Thanksgivings do <hi>vocally,</hi> when we say <hi>Per Iesum Christum Dominum nostrum,</hi> the ancient Church, in her publick and solemn Service, did <hi>visibly,</hi> by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting him according as he commanded, in the symbols of his Body and Blood: For there he is commemorated and received by us for the same end, for which he was given and suffered for us; that through him we receiving forgivenesse of our sins, God our Father might accept our service and hear our prayers we make unto him.</p>
                     <p>What time then so fit and seasonable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our devotions unto God, as when the Lamb of God lies slain upon the Holy Table, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive visibly, though mystically, those gracious Pledges of his blessed Body and Blood? This was that <hi>sacrifice</hi> of the ancient Church, the Fathers so much ring in our ears. The sacrifice of praise and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101070:243"/>
prayer through Jesus Christ, mystically represented in the Creatures of Bread and Wine.</p>
                     <p>But yet, there is one thing more my definition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, when I say <hi>through the sacrifice of Iesus Christ commemorated in the Creatures of Bread and Wine, wherewith God had first been agniz'd.</hi> The Body and Blood of Christ were not made of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bread and common Wine, but of Bread and Wine first sanctified, by being offer'd and set before God as a present to agnize him the Lord and giver of all: according to that, <hi>Domini est terra &amp; plenitudo ejus.</hi> And, <hi>Let no man appear before the Lord emptie.</hi> Therefore as this sacrifice consisted of two parts, as I told you, of Praise and Prayer, which in respect of the other I call <hi>sacrificium quod:</hi> and of the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of Christ crucified, which I call <hi>sacrifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um quo:</hi> so the symbols of Bread and Wine traversed both; being first presented as symbols of Praise and Thanksgiving to agnize God the Lord of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the <hi>sacrificum quod:</hi> Then by invocation of the Holy Ghost, made the symbols of the Body and Blood of Christ, in the <hi>sacrificium quo.</hi> So that the whole service throughout consisted of a reasonable part, and of a materiall part; as of a Soul and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of which I shall speak more fully hereafter; when I come to prove this I have said, by the testimonies of the Ancients.</p>

                     <p>ANd this is that Sacrifice which <hi>Malachi</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, the Gentiles should one day offer unto God; <hi>In omni loco offeretur incensum Nomini meo &amp; Mincha purum, quoniam magnum erit Nomen meum in Gentibus, dicit Dominus exercituum.</hi> Which words I am now, according to the order I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to explicate and apply to my Definition.</p>
                     <p>Know therefore, that the Prophet, in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, upbraids the Jews with despising and disesteeming their God; forasmuch as they offered unto him for sacrifice, not the best, but the lame, the torn and the sick; as though he had not been the great King, Creator, and Lord of the whole World; but some petty god, and of an inferior rank, for whom any thing were good enough. <hi>If I be a Father, where is mine honour? If I be</hi> Dominus, <hi>where is my fear? saith the Lord of Hosts unto you, O Priests that despise my name! and ye say wherein have we despised it? Ye offer polluted bread upon mine Altar, and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The Table of the Lord is contemptible;</hi> or, not so much to be regarded: that is, you think so; as appears by the basenesse of your offering: For the Present shewes what esteem the giver hath of him he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth therewith. But you offer that to me, which ye would not think fit to offer to your <hi>Prorex,</hi> or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, under the King of <hi>Persia:</hi> which shewes you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have but a mean esteem of me in your hearts, and that you beleeve not, I am He that I am; because you see

But know, that howsoever I now seem to be but the Lord of a poor Nation; yet the days are coming, <hi>When from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and in every place, incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the Heathen, saith the Lord of Hosts;</hi> it follows, though <hi>you have prophaned it,</hi> in that ye say, <hi>the Table of the Lord is contemptible;</hi> whereas <hi>I am a great King, and my Name shall be dreadfull among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the dependence and coherence of the words. Now to apply them: <hi>Incense</hi> (as the Scripture it self tels) notes the <hi>Prayers of the Saints.</hi> It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that, wherewith the remembrance was made in the sacrifices, or God put in minde: <hi>Mincha</hi> which we turn <hi>Munus,</hi> is <hi>oblatio farrea,</hi> an offering made of meal or flower baked, or fryed, or dryed, or parched corn. We, in our English, when we make distinction call it a <hi>meat-offering;</hi> but might call it a <hi>bread-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> of which the <hi>Libamen,</hi> or the <hi>drink-offering,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an indivisible concomitant, both are implyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name <hi>Mincha,</hi> where it alone is named.</p>
                     <p>The Application then is easie; <hi>Incense</hi> here notes the rationall part of our Christian sacrifice, which is Prayer, Thanksgiving, and Commemoration: <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> the materiall part thereof, which is <hi>oblatio farrea,</hi> or a present of Bread and Wine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="479" facs="tcp:101070:245"/>
BUT this <hi>Mincha</hi> is characterised, in the Text, with an attribute not to be overpast; <hi>Mincha purum: in omni loco offeretur incensum nomini meo &amp; Mincha purum;</hi> The meat-offering, which the Gentiles should one day present the God of Israel with, should be <hi>munus purum,</hi> or as the Septuagint <gap reason="foreign">

Some of the Fathers take this <hi>Pure</hi> offering, to be an offering, that is purely or spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered: The old sacrifices both of the Jew and Gentile, were offered <hi>modo corporali,</hi> by slaughter, fire, and incense: but this of Christians should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered onely <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> onely; which the Fathers in the first Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to be sacrificed without sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing rites: This sense of <hi>Pure</hi> sacrifice is followed by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as may appear by his words <hi>ad Scapulam;</hi> where speaking of the Christian Liturgie, <hi>Sacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> (saith he) <hi>pro Imperatore, sed quomodo praecepit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, pura prece; Non enim eget Deus, Conditor Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, odoris aut sanguinis alicujus.</hi> Also in his third Book against <hi>Marcion, cap. 22. In omni loco offertur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censum Nomini meo—&amp; sacrificium mundum;</hi> that is, (saith he) <hi>gloriae relatio, benedictio, &amp; hymni,</hi> which he presently cals <hi>munditias sacrificiorum:</hi> The
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:101070:246"/>
same way go some others: But this sense, though it fitly serves to difference our Christian sacrifice, from the old sacrifices of the Jews and Gentiles, and the thing it self be most true; yet, I cannot see how it can agree with the context of our Prophet, where the word <hi>Incense</hi> (though I confesse mystically un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood) is expressed together with <hi>Munus purum:</hi> For it would make the literall sense of our Prophet to be this; <hi>In every place Incense is offered to my Name, and an offering without Incense.</hi> And yet this would be the literall meaning, if <hi>Pure</hi> here signified <hi>without Incense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us hear therefore a second Interpretation, of this Puritie of the Christian <hi>Mincha,</hi> more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the dependence of the words; and that is <hi>a conscientia offerentis,</hi> from the disposition and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the offerer, according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Tit. 1. 15. To the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbeleeving, is nothing pure, but even their minde and conscience is defiled: They professe they know God, but in their works they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him.</hi> The Jews offering was prophane and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because it proceeded not out of a due beleef, and a conscience throughly perswaded of the greatnesse of their God; that he was the Creator and Lord of the whole earth, but rather some <hi>petty</hi> and <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> god, like the gods of other Nations: But the Gentiles, who should see him not onely the God of one Nation, but universally acknowledged over all the earth, should have no such reason to doubt, but firmly beleeve him to be the Great God, Creator of heaven and earth, and worship him as such, and so
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:101070:246"/>
their offering be a <hi>pure offering,</hi> not polluted with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. And it is to be observed, that all the ancient Christian Liturgies begin with this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For the summe of the Eucharisticall Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, when the Bread and Wine is first presented before God, is comprehended in that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glorie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to this way of interpreting the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>Christian sacrifice;</hi> to wit, from the conscience, and affection of the offerers, the Fathers mostly bend: <hi>Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 34. Sacrificia non sanctificant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem (non enim indiget Deus sacrificio) sed conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ejus, qui offert, sanctificat sacrificium, pura ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istens. Quoniam igitur cum simplicitate Ecclesia offert, justè munus ejus purum sacrificium apud Deum deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Oportet enim nos oblationem Deo facere, &amp; in omnibus gratos inveniri fabricatori Deo, insententia pura &amp; fide sine hypocrisi, &amp;c.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whom I alledged before for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation, averse from this; for in his fourth Book <hi>Con. Marc. c. 1. Sacrificium mundum,</hi> that is, saith he, <hi>simplex oratio de conscientia pura.</hi> But this conscientious purity they seem to restrain, at least chiefly, to freedom from malice; as that <hi>singular puritie</hi> whereby this Christian sacrifice is differenced from that of the Jew; because none can offer it, but he that is in charity with his brother; according to that in the Gospel, <hi>When thou bringest thy gift unto the Altar, and remembrest thy brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee—go first and be, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:101070:247"/>
in the beginning of this Christian service, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con was anciently wont to cry, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Let no man have ought against his brother;</hi> and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>osculum sanctum,</hi> the kisse of reconciliation. Thus the Fathers of the first Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> took <hi>Sacrificium purum,</hi> as appears <hi>Can.</hi> 5. where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that which is offered <hi>omni si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multate deposita.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But according to this exposition, the <hi>puritie</hi> of the Christian sacrifice will not be opposite to the pollution of the Iewish, in the same kinde, as it would, if more generally taken, but in another kinde, and so the sense stands thus: <hi>You will not offer me a pure offering, but the Gentiles one day shall, and that with a puritie of another manner of stamp, then that my Law requires of you.</hi> And thus I have told you the two wayes, according to which the ancients understood this puritie; and I prefer the latter, as I think they did.</p>
                     <p>But there is a third Interpretation, were it backt by their Authority, (which I confesse it is not) which I would prefer before them both: and I think, you will wonder with me, they should be so silent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Namely, that the title of <hi>Puritie</hi> is given to the Christian <hi>Mincha,</hi> in respect of Christ whom it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and represents; who is a sacrifice without all spot, blemish, and imperfection. This the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis of this sacrifice, to that of the Jews, might seem to imply: For the Jews are charged with offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring polluted Bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon Gods Altar; whereby what is meant the words following tell us: <hi>If you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evill? And if you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:101070:247"/>
the lame and sick, is it not evill?</hi> And in the end of the Chapter, <hi>Cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth to the Lord a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thing.</hi> Now, if the sacrifice of the Gentiles be called <hi>pure,</hi> in opposition to this; is it not so called, in respect of that most perfect, unblemisht, and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable sacrifice it represents, Iesus Christ the Lamb of God? I leave it to your consideration.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, That this Commemoration of Christ, according to the style of the ancient Church, is also a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, That the Body and Blood of Christ, in this
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:101070:248"/>
mysticall Service, was made of Bread and Wine; which had first been <hi>offered unto God, to agnize him the Lord of the Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, That this Sacrifice was placed in <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> onely of Christs sacrifice upon the Crosse, and not in a reall offering of his Body and Blood anew.</p>
                     <p>When I shall have proved all these by sufficient Authority, I hope you will give me leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my Definition for true; <hi>That the Christian sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ex mente antique Ecclesiae,</hi> was, <hi>An Oblation of Thanksgiving and Prayer to God the Father, through Iesus Christ and his sacrifice, Commemorated in the creatures of Bread and Wine, wherewith God had first been agnized.</hi>

But, you will say, the Fathers even so early had swarved from the style of the Apostolick Age, during which these kinde of terms were not used; as appears, by that we finde them not any where in their Epistles and writings: But what if the contrary may be evinced? that this language was used even while the Apostles yet lived: For grant they are neither found in the Acts of the Apostles, nor in S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peters</hi> writings; yet this proves not they were not used in the Apostles times, no more then that <gap reason="foreign">

But to confine the Apostles Age, within the limits of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> and S. <hi>Peters</hi> lines, is a generall mistake: For the Apostles Aage ended not till S. <hi>Iohns</hi> death <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 99. and so lasted as long within a year or thereabouts, after S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peters</hi> suffering, as it was from our Saviours Ascension to their Deaths; that is, one and thirty years. And this too for the most part, was after the <hi>Excidium</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> in which time, it is likely the Church received no little improvement in Ecclesiasticall Rites, and Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; both because it was the time of her greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and because, whilest the Iews Polity stood, her Polity, for its full establishment, stood in some sort suspended.

                     <p>The mystery of which Rite they took to be this; That as Christ by presenting his Death and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Father, continually intercedes for us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; so the Church on Earth semblably, approaches the Throne of Grace, by representing Christ unto his Father, in these holy Mysteries of his Death and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>Veteres enim</hi> (saith <hi>Cassander) in hoc mystico sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificio, non tam peractae semel in cruce oblationis, cujus hic memoria celebratur, quam perpetui Sacerdotii &amp; jugis sacrificii, quod in Coelis sempiternus Sacerdos of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert, rationem habuerunt; cujus hic Imago per solennes Ministrorum preces exprimitur.</hi>

of the children of Israel; that is, to put God in minde of them: he makes it in this respect to have been a lively figure of the Christians <hi>Eucharist;</hi> For, saith he, <hi>Ista est commemoratio sola, quae propitium facit Deum hominibus.</hi>

                     <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                     <p>THe fourth particular propounded was this; That the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, or Lords Supper is a Sacrifice, according to the style of the ancient Church.</p>
                     <p>It is one thing to say, that the Lords Supper is <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> and another to say, that Christ is <hi>properly</hi> sacrificed therein. These are not the same; for there may be a Sacrifice, which is a representation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet a Sacrifice too: And such is this of the New Testament, a Sacrifice wherein another Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that of Christs death upon the Crosse, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated: Thus the Papists gain nothing by this Notion of Antiquity, and our asserting the same; For their tenet is, that Christ in this Sacrifice is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly sacrificed; which we shall shew in due time that the Ancients never meant.</p>
                     <p>To begin with this: As in the Old Testament the name of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was otherwhile given to the whole action in which the Rite was used; sometimes to the Rite alone: so in the Notion and Language of the ancient Church, sometimes the whole Action or Christian service (wherein the Lords Supper was a part) is comprehended under that name; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Rite of the sacred Supper it self, is so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and truly, as you shall now hear.</p>
                     <p>The resolution of this Point, depends altogether
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:101070:258"/>
upon the true Definition of a Sacrifice, as it is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all other Offerings. Which, though it be so necessary, that all disputation without it, is vain; yet shall we not finde, that either party inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed in this question, hath been so exact therein, as were to be wished. This appears by the differing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, given and confuted by Divines on both sides; the reason of which defect is, because neither are deduced from the Notion of Scripture, but built upon other conceptions: Let us see therefore, if it may be learned out of Scripture, what that is which the Scripture, in a strict and speciall sense, cals a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                     <p>Every Sacrifice is an oblation or offering: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very offering is not a Sacrifice, in that strict and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per acception we seek. For Tithes, First-fruits Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings in the Law, and whatsoever indeed is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto God, are oblations or offerings; but none of them Sacrifices, nor ever so called in the Old Testament: What offerings are then called so? I answer, Burnt-offerings, Sin-offerings, Trespasse-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and peace-offerings. These, and no other, are called by that name.</p>
                     <p>Out of these therefore must we pick the true and proper <hi>ratio</hi> of a Sacrifice: It is true indeed, that these Sacrifices were offerings of beasts, of beeves, of sheep, of goats, of fowls; but the <hi>ratio</hi> of any thing consists not in the matter thereof; As the gowns we wear, are still the same kinde of apparel, though made of differing stuffs: These Sacrifices also were slain, and offered by fire and incense: But neither is the <hi>modus</hi> of any thing the <hi>ratio</hi> or essentiall form
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:101070:259"/>
thereof. That therefore may have the nature and <hi>formale</hi> of a Sacrifice which consists of another matter, and is offered after another and differing manner; Those we call Sacraments of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, Circumcision and the Passeover, were by effusion of blood; ours are not, and yet we esteem them neverthelesse true Sacraments; and so it may be here.</p>
                     <p>To hold you therefore no longer in suspence, a Sacrifice, I think should be defined thus; An offering, whereby the offerer is made partaker of his Gods Table, in token of Covenant, and friendship with him, &amp;c. more explicately thus: An offering unto the Divine Majesty, of that which is given for the food of man; that the offerer partaking thereof, might, as by way of pledge, be certified of his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Covenant, and fellowship with his God, by eating and drinking at his Table. S. <hi>Augustin</hi> comes toward this Notion, when he defines a Sacrifice (though in a larger sense) <hi>opus quod Deo nuncupamus, reddimus, &amp; dedicamus, hoc fine, ut sanctâ societate ipsi adhaereamus;</hi> for to have society and fellowship with God, what is it else, but to be in league and covenant with him?</p>
                     <p>In a word, a Sacrifice is <hi>oblatio foederalis;</hi> for the true and right understanding whereof, we must know, that it was the universall custome of mankinde, and still remains in use, to contract covenants and make leagues of friendship, by eating and drinking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When <hi>Isaac</hi> made a covenant with <hi>Abimelec</hi> the King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> the Text saith, <hi>He made him and those that were with him, a feast, and they did eat, and drink,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:101070:259"/>
and rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, Gen.</hi> 28. When <hi>Iacob</hi> made covenant with <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> after they had sworn together, he made him a feast, and <hi>called his brethren to eat Bread, Gen.</hi> 31. When <hi>David</hi> made a league with <hi>Abner,</hi> upon his promise to bring all Israel unto him, <hi>David made Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and the men that came with him a feast, 2 Sam. 3.</hi>

                     <p>Now for the Gentiles, <hi>Herodotus</hi> tels us, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians were wont to contract leagues of friendship, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vinum, &amp; Epulas,</hi> in a full feast, whereat their wives, children and friends were present. The like <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports of the Germans: Amongst the Greeks and other Nations, they eat bread and salt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Unto which comes neer that ceremonie, somewhere used at weddings; that the Brdegroom, when he comes home from Church, takes a piece of cake, tasts it, then gives it to his Bride to taste it likewise; as a token of a covenant made between them. The Emperour of <hi>Russia</hi> at this day, when he would shew extraordinary grace and favour unto any, sends him bread and salt from his Table: And when he invited <hi>Baron Sigismond</hi> the Emperour <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Ambassador, he did it in this form; <hi>Sigismunde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edes sal &amp; panem nostrum nobiscum.</hi> Hence that Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>

Yea it is a rule in Law, that if a man drink to him, against whom he hath an accusation of slander, or other verball injurie, he loses his Action, because it is supposed he is reconciled with him.</p>
                     <p>Such now, as were these covenant-feastings and eatings and drinkings, in token of league and amity between men and men; such are Sacrifices between man and his God; <hi>Epulae foederales,</hi> wherein God deigneth to entertain man, to eat and drink with or before him, in token of favour and reconcilement. For so it becomes the condition of the parties, that he which hath offended the other, and seeks for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and forgivenesse, should be entertained by him, to whom he is obnoxious; and not <hi>è contra,</hi> that is, that God should be the <hi>Convivator,</hi> and man the <hi>Conviva.</hi> To which end, the Viands for this sacred <hi>Epulum,</hi> were first to be offered unto God, and so made his, that he might entertain the offerer, and not the offerer him. For we are to observe, that what the fire consumed was accounted as, and called by himself, the <hi>meat of his fire-offerings;</hi> the rest was for his guests, which they were partakers of, either by themselves, as in all the <hi>peace-offerings,</hi> or by their proxies, the Priests, as in the rest; to wit, the <hi>Holocausts, the sin and trespasse-offerings.</hi> The reason of which difference was, I suppose, because the one
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:101070:260"/>
was <hi>ad impetrandum,</hi> or <hi>renovandum foedus;</hi> where therefore a Mediator was needfull; the other, to wit, the peace-offerings, <hi>ad confirmandum &amp; consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandum,</hi> onely: wherein therefore they addressed themselves before the Divine Majesty with greater confidence. If any shall object, that the Holocaust was wholly burnt, and consumed, and so no body partaker thereof; I answer, it is true, the beast, which was slain, was wholly burnt, and so all of it, as it were Gods Messe. But there was <note n="*" place="margin">Levit. 23. 13, 18.

stand good: Now this will appear, first in generall, by that expression of Scripture, wherein the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which God makes with Man, is expressed by eating and drinking at his Table, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. Those, to whom the Lord opens not, plead for themselves: <hi>We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets, &amp;c. Cap. 22.</hi> Our Saviours tels his disciples; <hi>I appoint you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed me; that ye may eat, and drink at my Table in my Kingdom. Apoc. 3. 20. Behold I stand at the door and knock; If any man hear my voyce, and open the door, I will come in unto him, and sup with him and he with me:</hi> But these passages, you will say, shew rather how fitly sacrifices might be feasts of amity between God and men, then prove they were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: Hear therefore such proofs, as I think come home to the point.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Every sacrifice,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Mark 9. is salted with salt.</hi> This salt is called <hi>Levit. 2. The salt of the Covenant of God;</hi> that is, a Symbol of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity thereof. Now if the salt, which seasoned the sacrifice, were <hi>sal foederis Dei:</hi> what was the sacrifice it self, but <hi>Epulum foederis?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Moses</hi> cals the blood of the burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings and peace-offerings, wherewith he sprinkled the children of Israel, when they received the Law, <hi>the blood of the Covenam, which the Lord had made with them: This is,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which the Lord hath made with you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and above all, this may most evidently be evinced, out of the 40. <hi>Psalm;</hi> the whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof is concerning sacrifices: There God

saith, <hi>Gather my Saints together unto me, which make covenant with me by sacrifice,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>and take my Covenant in thy mouth? seeing thou hatest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp;c.</hi> Statutes here, are Rites and Ordinances, and particularly those of Sacrifice, which who so bringeth unto God, and thereby supplicates and cals upon his Name, is said, <hi>to take the covenant of God in his mouth;</hi> Forasmuch as to invocate God with this Rite, was to do it by way of commemoration of his Covenant, and to say, <hi>Remember Lord thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and <hi>for thy Covenants sake, Lord hear my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and supplication.</hi> For what hath man to do with God, to beg any favour at his hands, unlesse he be in Covenant with him? whereby appears the reason, why mankinde, from the beginning of the world, used to approach their God, by this Rite of sacrificing; that is, <hi>ritu foederali.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I adde in this last place, for a farther confirmation; That, when God was to make a Covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Gen.</hi> 15. he commanded him to offer him a Sacrifice; <hi>Offer unto me</hi> (saith he, so it should be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) <hi>a heifer, a she-goat, and aram, each of three years old, a turtle Dove, and a young pigeon;</hi> All which he offered accordingly, and divided them in the midst, laying each piece or moity one against the other; and, when the sun went down, God in the likenesse of a smoaking furnace, and burning lamp past between the pieces, and so, as the Text sayes, <hi>made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Abraham,</hi> saying, <hi>Vnto thy seed will I give this
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:101070:262"/>
land, &amp;c.</hi> By which Rite, of passing through the parts, God condescended to the manner of men; And note here, that the Gentiles, and Jews likewise, in their more solemn covenants between men and men, (which were made under pain of curse or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration) used this Rite of Sacrifice, whereby men covenanted with their God, as it were to make their God both a witnesse, and a party with them. And here the Jews cut the Sacrifice in sunder, and past between the parts thereof; as God did here with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> which was as much, as if they had said, Thus let me be divided, and cut in pieces, if I violate the oath, I have now made in the presence of my God. The Gentiles, besides other ceremonies, used not to eat at all of these sacrifices, but to fling them into the sea, or bury them in the earth; as if they had said, If I break Covenant, thus let me be excluded from all amity and favour with my God; as I am now from eating of his Sacrifice. Hence came those phrases; <hi>secare foedus,</hi> in the Hebrew; of <hi>ferire, percutere &amp; icere foedus;</hi> in Latine: of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in Homer, <hi>à feriendis, percutiendis, &amp; secandis sacrificiis in foederi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus sanciendis;</hi> Though this manner of speech may be also derived from their ordinary <hi>Epula foederales,</hi> wherein they killed beasts, which the Ancients in their ordinary diet did not.</p>
                     <p>Having thus seen what is the nature of a Sacrifice, and wherein the <hi>ratio</hi> thereof consisteth, it will not be hard to judge, whether the ancient Christians did rightly, in giving the Eucharist that name, or not: For that the Lords supper is <hi>Epulum foederale,</hi> we all grant, and our Saviour expresly affirms it of the Cup in the

                        </gap>, <hi>This Cup is the Rite of the new Covenant in my Blood, which is powred out for many, for the remission of sins;</hi> evidently implying, that the bloody sacrifices of the Law, with their meat and drink-offerings, were Rites of an old covenant, and that this succeeded them as the rite of the <note n="*" place="margin">Eusebius (Demonst.

There is nothing then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to make this sacred <hi>Epulum,</hi> a full sacrifice, but that the Viands thereof should be first offered unto God, that he may be the <hi>Convivator,</hi> we the <hi>Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae</hi> or the guests.</p>

                     <p>MY last task was to prove, that the rite of the Lords Supper is indeed a Sacrifice, not in a Metaphoricall but a proper sense; and this, if the nature of Sacrifice be truly defined, is no whit repugnant to the reformed Religion.</p>
                     <p>To evidence which I shewed, that a Sacrifice was nothing else but a Sacred-feast, wherein God mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally entertained man at his own Table, in token of amity and friendship with him: which that he might
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:101070:263"/>
do, the Viands of that feast were first made Gods by oblation, and so eaten of, not as of Mans, but Gods provision.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing then wanting to make this sacred <hi>Epulum,</hi> of which we speak, full out a Sacrifice, but that we shew, that the Viands thereof were in like manner first offered unto God; that so being his, he might be the <hi>Convivator,</hi> man the <hi>Conviva,</hi> or the guest: And this the ancient Church was wont to do; this they beleeved our blessed Saviour himself did, when, at the institution of this holy Rite, he took the Bread and the Cup into his sacred hands, and <hi>looking up to heaven gave thanks and blessed:</hi> And, after his example, they first offered the Bread and Wine unto God, to agnize him the Lord of the Creature, and then received them from him again in a Banquet, as the Symbols of the Body and Blood of his Son. This is that, I am now to prove out of the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Antiquity, not long after, but next unto the Apostles times, when it is not likely the Church had altered the form they left her, for the celebration of this Mystery.</p>
                     <p>I will begin with <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as the most full and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in this point; He, in his fourth Book <hi>cap. xxxii,</hi> speaks thus; <hi>Dominus Discipulis suis dans consilium Primitias Deo offerre ex suis Creaturis, non quasi indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genti, sed ut ipsi nec infructuosi, nec ingrati sint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eum, qui ex Creatura est panis, accepit, &amp; gratias egit; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, Hoc est corpus meum; &amp; Calicem similiter, qul ex Creatura est, quae est secundum nos, suum sanguinem con fessus est; &amp; Novo Testamento novam docuit oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, quam Ecclesia ab Apostolis accipiens offert Deo, ei

                     <p>Lastly, this oblation of the Bread and Wine is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> parallel of the Lords Supper, and the Sacrifices of the Gentiles: <hi>You cannot</hi> (saith he) <hi>be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels;</hi> namely, because they imply contrary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, incompatible one with the other. A sacrifice, as I told you, being <hi>Epulum foederale;</hi> Now here the <hi>Table of Divels</hi> is so called, because it consisted of Viands offered to Divels, (so S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly tels us) whereby those that eat thereof, eat of the Divels meat; <hi>Ergo, The Table of the Lord</hi> is likewise called his Table, not because the Lord ordained it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it consisted of Viands offered unto him.</p>

                        <pb n="520" facs="tcp:101070:266"/>
Having thus, as I think, sufficiently proved what I took in hand, I think it not amisse, to answer two questions, which this discourse may beget. The first is, How the Ancients could gather out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, that our Saviour did as hath been shewed? I answer, they beleeved, that he did as the Jews were wont to do; But they did thus. How will you say doth this appear? I answer, it may appear from this, The Passeover was a Sacrifice, and therefore the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands here, as in all other holy Feasts, were first offered unto God. Now the Bread and Wine, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour took when he blessed and gave thanks, was the <hi>Mincha</hi> or meat-offering of the Passeover: If then he did as the Jews used to do, he agnized his Father and blessed him, by oblation of these his Creatures unto him, using the like or the same form of words, <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus tu Domine Deus noster, Rex mundi, qui producis panem è terra;</hi> And over the Wine; <hi>Benedictus tu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Deus noster, Rex mundi, qui creasti fructum vitis:</hi> Moreover the Church <hi>ab initio</hi> applied that precept of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 4. 23. If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, &amp;c.</hi> to the Eucharist; for they beleeved, that he would not enact a new law concerning legall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which he was presently to abolish; but that it had reference to that oblation, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>The other question is: If all this be so, how is not our celebration of the Eucharist defective, where no such oblation is used? I answer, this concerns not us alone, but all the Churches of the West of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man communion, who, as in other things they have depraved this mystery, and swarved from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:101070:266"/>
pattern therof, so have they for many Ages disused this oblation of Bread and Wine, and brought in, in lieu thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a reall and hypostaticall oblation of Christ himself; This blasphemous oblation, we have taken away, and justly, but not reduced again that expresse and formall use of the other: Howsoever, though we do it not with a set ceremony, and form of words; yet in deed and effect we do it, so often as we set the Bread and Wine upon the Holy-Table: For whatsoever we set upon Gods Table, is <hi>ipso facto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, and offered unto him: According to that of our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>The Altar sanctifies the gift;</hi> that is, consecrates it unto God, and appropriates it to his use: In which respect, it were much to be wisht, that this were more solemnly done, then it is usuall; namely, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time of the administration, and by the hand of the Minister, in the name and sight of the whole congregation, standing up, and shewing some signe of due and lowly reverence, according, as the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con was wont to admonish the people in Ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>THe sixt, and last thing to bee proved was, That Christ is offered in this Sacrifice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratively onely and not otherwise. Though the Eucharist be a Sacrifice (that is, an

Oblation) wherein the offerer banquets with his God, yet is Christ in this Sacrifice no otherwise offered, then by way of commemoration onely, of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice once offered upon the Crosse; as a learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of ours hath lately written, <hi>objectivè</hi> onely, not <hi>subjectivè.</hi> And this is that, which our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self said, when he ordained this sacred Rite, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>But this commemoration is to be made to God his Father, and is not a bare remembring or putting our selves in minde onely, (as is commonly supposed) but a putting of God in minde; For every Sacrifice is directed unto God, and the Oblation therein, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be, hath him for its Object, and not man. If therefore the Eucharist be <hi>Sacrificium Christi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorativum,</hi> as ours grant, then must the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration therein be made unto God: and if Christ therein be offered <hi>objectivè,</hi> that is, as the object of the commemoration there made, (as that learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop speaks) if the commemoration of him, be an oblation of him, whom is this oblation, that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, made unto, but God?</p>
                     <p>Well then, Christ is offered in this sacred Supper, not <hi>hypostatically,</hi> as the Papists would have him, (for so he was but once offered) but <hi>commemoratively</hi> only, that is, by this sacred Rite of Bread and Wine, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, and inculcate his blessed Passion to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we put him in minde thereof, by setting the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents thereof before him; we testifie our own mindefulnesse thereof unto his sacred Majesty, that so he would, for his sake, according to the tenour of his Covenant, in time be favourable and propitious unto us miserable sinners.</p>
