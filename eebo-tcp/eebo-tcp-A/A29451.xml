         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Very good! Therefore Kings, and all that have like
authority in every Nation, muſt needs have their civil
power <hi>from God,</hi> and that <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediatly;</hi> there
being no intermediate power between <hi>his</hi> which is the
principal, And the miniſterial, which is the Kings: as
there is no natural power between that of the Principal
Cauſe, and that of the Inſtrumental, in any work of nature.</p>
               <p>What then can any perſons whatſoever have to do, to
queſtion, or controul that Supreme Perſon, whom God
hath thought fit to uſe as his own Miniſter? What if ſuch
a Soveraign Prince be as ill a Governour as <hi>Nero</hi> was? <hi>He,</hi>
was once ſuch a Miniſter of God; to whom, as bad as he
was, the Apoſtle commands <hi>every ſoul,</hi> that is, <hi>all,</hi> but ſuch
as have no ſouls (nor conſciences neither,) to be ſubject to;
and that, even for conſcience ſake.) But, the Chriſtian
Kings of this Nation have ever been Nurſing Fathers to
the Church, not perſecutors of it, as that Tyrant was; and
are therefore (upon that account) much more true, proper
and immediate Miniſters to <hi>Him</hi> that is the only Supreme
Head of the Church, than that Heathen was.</p>
               <p>There is not therefore leſſe obedience due to theſe, but
more: Howſoever, ſince they are the <hi>Miniſters of God,</hi> and
as <hi>his Miniſters, entruſted</hi> of him, they muſt needs have
full power and authority from God <hi>to purſue that truſt:</hi>
Therefore, as the whole Nation cannot acquit the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

God,</hi> (in committing to his truſt a part of his own univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal

rightful power, upon which the purſuance and effectual
performance of the ſame truſt dependeth.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a falſe and groundleſſe inſinuation, that
becauſe <hi>Kings are Gods Miniſters for his peoples good;</hi> Ergo
the people of God, that is, the <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts,</hi>

               <p>That which is <hi>from the people,</hi> and only <hi>under God,</hi> is
not <hi>of God,</hi> or <hi>from Him.</hi> And what is this but expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradictory to the words of the Apoſtle? <hi>There is no
power,</hi> or <hi>the power is not but from God.</hi> There are two
great Kingdoms, the Kingdom of Heaven, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the world, and God is immediately by himſelf the

our King,</hi> Iſa. 33. 22. <hi>King of Nations,</hi> Jer. 10. 7. <hi>The
Kingdom is the Lords, and He is the Governour among the
Nations,</hi> Pſal. 22. 28.) Therefore the Apoſtle exhorting
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40365:4"/>
the Chriſtians to be ſubject to the Civil Government, gives
this reaſon of his exhortation, <hi>For the power</hi> (though meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Civil) <hi>is of God.</hi> And leſt men ſhould think it is <hi>of God,
but</hi> as the Univerſal Cauſe of all other things, and not as
the ſole and immediate Author and Diſpenſer of it, He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
denies it to be of <hi>any other: The power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is
not but from God.</hi> For, let it be conſidered, if it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all underſtanding, to think the Apoſtle would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
Chriſtians to obey the Civil Power, only upon this
<hi>general</hi> account, that it is from God as all things elſe are,
and not otherwiſe. For, upon that account the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
muſt needs alſo carry them to obey a thief, and that for
conſcience ſake; for even a thiefs power by which he is
able to rob and do miſchief, is (in this ſenſe) as much from
God as the moſt lawful power that is.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles meaning therfore muſt neceſſarily be (and
in that the difference lies,) that the Civil power which the
Magiſtrate as the Miniſter of God is endued with, is the
<hi>ſpecial</hi> donative and gift of God, which the other is not;
yet they both agree in this, that they are both (as all things
elſe are) <hi>immediately</hi> from God: As indeed whatſoever
He doth, He doth by Himſelf <hi>immediately,</hi> not <hi>mediately,</hi>
(as is falſly fancied.) For how can He that is immediately
preſent every where, and in every thing, ſtand off at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in any work of his? How then, in the collating of
the Civil power? If it be his Authority and Power that
is in His Miniſter, the Supreme Magiſtrate, it is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt all truth and ſenſe, to imagine that He gives it
not immediately by Himſelf, who muſt do every thing by
Himſelf immediately that is done by Him. And if it were
not Gods own Authority which is in the Supreme Civil
Magiſtrate, who only in himſelf without Commiſſion from
any earthly Power, <hi>beareth the ſword;</hi> ſince God alone
in the Lord of life, and every man is created in his image,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40365:5"/>
it were abſolutely impoſſible that it ſhould be juſt and
lawful for the Magiſtrate to take away the life of a man in
any caſe imaginable. And as for the <hi>whole people,</hi> not
having the power of Magiſtracie perſonally committed to
them of God, they have no more power of the life of any
man, than any one private perſon hath. If then the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all Soveraignty or Supreme Authority, by which the
life of man, in any caſe, may lawfully be taken away, be
only Gods own peculiar, and not mans, it is impoſſible

               <p>He therefore that hath a publick, known, certain, and
unqueſtionable right to govern as ſupreme Magiſtrate, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ancient inheritance (which is the beſt and cleareſt
right that can be had of any thing,) or by any other juſt
and lawful means, the ſame hath all civil power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to govern only and immediately from God, whoſe
peculiar it is. In as much then as the right and juſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to govern, is ſolely and immediately from God,
where that right and power is once fixed, (by what means
ſoever it firſt came ſo to be,) it is <hi>there fixed by God;</hi> and
can never lawfully (without a ſpecial command from God)
be refixed or diſannulled by man.</p>
               <p>If this may not be deemed, as it really is, a clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;
let it be duly and impartially conſidered, whether
there be any at all, or the like evidence for the oppoſite
opinion, which is here laid as a <hi>Principle,</hi> without any proof;
and as a main foundation, upon which a very great weight
relies.</p>
               <p>Yet, without doubt, the ſolidneſſe of this <hi>Principle</hi> is
the more to be ſuſpected, becauſe none but Heathens and
<hi>meere</hi> Polititians have ever held it, till it came to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
by ſome in this Nation, a few years ſince.</p>
               <p>And thoſe firſt Authors fell into it, meerly upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40365:5"/>
account of <hi>Infidelity;</hi> to wit, in that they either knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of, or did not believe that the only true God is the
worlds Creator, and (by that ſpecial right) the ſole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
thereof; and conſequently, that all power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is ſolely and preciſely His; which (then,) it is
impoſſible that any ſhould have a right to give but <hi>He.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then, that <hi>Salus populi,</hi> the peoples eternal
<hi>ſafety</hi> is (indeed) the only ſupreme end in immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to Gods glory, it would be well conſidered by
them all, and eſpecially by them that muſt <hi>anſwer</hi> for them
all, and for themſelves too, whether it be not the only ſafe
way to that Supreme ſafety, (yea and to their temporal
ſafety too,) to do that wherein they cannot do amiſſe: <hi>to
reſtore an ancient Right:</hi> For, to do this, is no more nor
leſſe but what natural righteouſneſſe it ſelf requires, as
the proper and inſeparable act and duty of it. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, the whole torrent of the Scriptures are for it,
and not one ſillable (ſo much as ſeemingly) againſt it. It
may be conſidered alſo that the ſaid oppoſite Opinion and
Principle hath no foundation at all in Scripture, (nor in
the reaſon of a Chriſtian:) For, therein, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the peoples giving Civil authority, or making a
King, but where that King was made before of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the peoples conſent, or notice of ſuch a thing. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there in Scripture any Example of a peoples caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off finally their Allegiance, but of the ten Tribes: And
yet that was by a ſpecial appointment of God; but this
was more than they then knew; and therefore, to them,
it was as their own act; and being ſo, God puniſh'd them
for it with perpetual and final dereliction to Idolatry. There
are <hi>no ſafe untrodden paths</hi> in the way to Heaven.</p>

Power is abſolute and uncontroulable two wayes; firſt,
by being ſo in it ſelf intrinſecally; ſecondly, by being ſo
in relation to men; that is, though it be controulable by
God the immediate Author of it, yet by men it is not.
This uncontroulable authority in relation to men, muſt be
found, and is; in all ſupreme Magiſtracie: For if ſupreme
or chief Magiſtracie be controulable in them that juſtly
poſſeſſe it by any other men, (of what quality, or in what

either have uncontroulable power, or they have not:
If they have not, then may they alſo be controuled by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

there is ſome uncontroulable power beneath that which is
in God: And if ſo, then certainly it can only be where
God, from whom all power is, hath plac'd it; that is, where
it hath ever viſibly reſided, and practically appeared, by

<hi>time out of minde.</hi> If it hath ſo reſided and appeared time
out of minde in thoſe that think they may controul it in

But if on the contrary, it hath been publickly and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally

any true Chriſtians beſide themſelves, the unworthieſt
indeed of all other to be ſo accounted. And exactly ſo
it is in the Civil State: Any number of perſons once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined

will immediately beſtow upon themſelves very liberally

a Party not very conſiderable in compariſon of the whole,
takes upon them to talk of the <hi>whole,</hi> as if there were no

Or, if they ſpeak, <hi>as in behalf</hi> of the whole, (whoſe mind

But the whole people (after too palpable Experiment of

                  <hi>[That Supreme Magiſtrates are inferiour to the whole,

that makes up the <hi>whole?</hi> Or if it be meant not
of <hi>every,</hi> but of <hi>any</hi> one, <hi>ſeverally</hi> taken, it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
unleſſe it be, That the Supreme Magiſtrate is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
only to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>

the ſubverſion of the Fundamental Laws, Cuſtomes, and
Conſtitution of the whole <hi>Civil Body</hi> of the Kingdome.
And how ſoon ſuch a <hi>Party,</hi> well armed, will call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the <hi>Whole,</hi> experience enough hath taught all men
to know: And then all the reſt of the whole Nation is at
their mercy, and that without remedy: For the Supreme
Magiſtrate hath no authority over them as they are a
combined pack of Rebels conjoyned in a cloſe conſpiracy,
whatſoever authority He may have over <hi>every individual,</hi>
in <hi>ſeveralty</hi> from the <hi>reſt,</hi> now call'd the <hi>whole.</hi> Who ſees
not that this Doctrine is meerly Anabaptiſtical, ſtriking
at the root of all Magiſtracy properly ſo called? For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
power can be pretended or imagined to be in the
whole people, (which is indeed the whole,) it is no ſuch
thing as <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> And if there be any ſuch power that
can juſtly nullifie or check all Magiſtracie, the moſt rigid
Anabaptiſts will require no more, to warrant any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
for the utter ſubverſion of it. But, that there ſhould

that is in them,) but only the <hi>Civil</hi> power of <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,</hi>
is a meer <hi>Chimaera.</hi> All the individuals, and every

perſons,</hi> endur'd with no more civil authority than any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40365:7"/>
one of them is by himſelf alone: Conſequently, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Magiſtrate muſt needs be above and Superiour to
the <hi>Whole</hi> number of them all. There is a ſure way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
in Logick, which they call <hi>Induction;</hi> by which,
out of a full enumeration of every individual, an Univerſal
is undoubtedly concluded: And <hi>Univerſal</hi> is that <hi>Whole</hi>
that is made up of nothing elſe but of every particular or
individual contain'd under it. That the Supreme Magiſtrate
therefore is Supreme to every individual (without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
(which are meer private perſons all) but inferiour to
the <hi>Univerſal</hi> or <hi>whole,</hi> (for all that) is too much a nicety
(at beſt) for the whole weight of mens <hi>ſalvation</hi> to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it being no leſſe than <hi>damnation</hi> that God hath already
denounc'd againſt them that <hi>practically</hi> er in this particular.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it may be here conſidered, that that which in
every Nation makes the ſeveral individuals to become one
<hi>Whole,</hi> is that whereby they are incorporated as members
of the <hi>Civil Body</hi> of a Kingdom or Common-wealth; and
that is, the anciently received, accuſtomed <hi>fundamental</hi>
conſtitution of it: This therefore diſſolved, either in all,
or in any of the Eſſentials of it, the whole Compages and
joynting together of this Body is utterly diſſolved with it.
If therefore the Supreme Magiſtrate, (who, in every an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Kingdom can be no other but the King,) being the
ſole Head of the Civil Body of ſuch, be taken away, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and baniſhed, and the Kingdom (by conſequence)
ceaſe to be what it was and hath ever been, the people are
no more one <hi>Whole</hi> (however held together by conſtraint)
than a heap of ſtones; and the only foundation of true ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and of all civil adminiſtration that can be juſt, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away And, to prevent this fatal miſchief, and for no

               </p>
               <p>It can never therefore be poſſible in this or in any other

the <hi>ſame</hi> that were complained of in a far greater meaſure,

a Government (that not reſerved that is moſt eſſential to
it,) infers an <hi>Univerſal Parity,</hi> leaving none in more <hi>juſt</hi>

(the only known Legal Government once diſſolved,)
what ſhould ſuch <hi>juſt</hi> authority in any over others be
grounded on? What then have any to do in ſetting up a
new Government more than others? And why have not
others a better right to re-enforce the old, than any can
ever have to erect a new? Nothing can here make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,

               </p>
               <p>If the common peace, juſtice, and the ſafety of the
people be the End of Government, then is Government
the Means to that End; which no Government can ever
be, if it be <hi>not juſt:</hi> And no new Government ever can
be ſuch. And the Change of an ancient Government in
any Original and Fundamental part, is the erecting of a
New one. And for this cauſe it is, that the Wiſdom of
God in <hi>Solomon</hi> commands us to fear the Lord and the
King, and forbids to meddle with them that are given to
<hi>change:</hi> to wit, becauſe the change of a ſettled and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

neceſſarily <hi>unjuſt:</hi> (beſides the moſt unjuſt Subverſion of
the great End, the <hi>common peace,</hi> and <hi>ſafety of the people,</hi>

be juſt in themſelves, yet none can be juſt in this
or any other Nation, but that which is eſtabliſhed upon

<hi>property</hi> of them can never be made over abſolutely to any
other. Whoſoever therefore hath a juſt Right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
hath it only by Communion therein with God, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40365:10"/>
His Miniſter in the adminiſtration of it, and not from
men. Hence it was, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (of old) when they
deſired to have a King as other Nations had, went and
made their addreſſe directly and immediately to God. For,
till then, God had kept the adminiſtration it ſelf over
that people in his own hand; which is an evident indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
where and in whom all civil power is properly recide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and this plainly ſhews that from <hi>Him alone</hi> it can be
communicated to them that are His Miniſters in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
diſpenſation of it. In as much then as the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cannot be diſpenſed without the <hi>publick Militia</hi> and the
<hi>publick Treaſury,</hi> theſe alſo as well as the power it ſelf are
entruſted <hi>by God</hi> into the hands of His Supreme Miniſter
and Vicegerent, and not by the people. More eſpecially,
the <hi>Militia,</hi> being the more publick <hi>Sword of juſtice,</hi> can
never juſtly be in any hand, but his, to whom God himſelf,
the only Lord of life, delivers it.</p>

the preſent practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Concluſion muſt needs be falſe, becauſe the
Aſſumption is not only falſe, but impoſſible to be true;
unleſs it can be thought a thing poſſible that a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40365:11"/>
Nation ſhould at firſt commence, and for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of years uphold, maintain and continue ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
as is founded upon ſuch Laws, Uſages and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
as are againſt the Laws of that true Religion that is
profeſſed by them; and not only that, but againſt reaſon,
nature and grace; and conſequently, irreligious, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
unnatural and graceleſſe. Such a Government
certainly there neither is, nor ever was, in any Nation,
Chriſtian, Mahumetan, or Heathen: It being a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that any whole Nation ſhould ſo far ceaſe to be
men, as to erect and continue a Government, and eſtabliſh
Laws, and give way to Cuſtomes that are againſt that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and humane nature by which they are <hi>men,</hi> and not
Horſes, Mules, Lions, Tygers, Beares, or Wolves: Or,
that they ſhould be of any Religion good or bad, and make
Laws contrary to that Religion that is profeſſed by them.</p>
               <p>The reſult upon the whole matter is this; If this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
and moſt abſurd Aſſumption be not true, the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
practice</hi> upon the confidence of the truth of it, is not
to be juſtified, but to be juſtly condemned, and either to
be repented of, or finally puniſhed (perhaps in this world,
but certainly) in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Next to thoſe Principles, it follows thus;</p>
               <p>Theſe and many the like Principles of common reaſon
have been diſtilled into the judgments and conſideration
of the free people of this Nation, by means whereof it will
not be an eaſie matter for any Rulers in any form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
whatſoever, to reduce them again unto their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
yokes of bondage and ſlavery.</p>
               <p>Here's the deſperation of all firme, ſtable and conſtant
ſettlement in any forme of Government whatſoever. For
if theſe Poſitions muſt be all taken for undoubted Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and the practical Application of them left to <hi>private</hi>
perſons, that is, indifferently to <hi>the free people of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40365:11"/>
there can never be any Sedition or Inſurrection but may
be juſtified: For if the Parties to it may themſelves be
judges, it were madneſſe in them not to condemn ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the preſent Government (how good ſoever) to be
bondage and ſlavery.</p>
               <p>But, becauſe it is here intimated, that the free people
of this Nation have been under <hi>former yokes of bondage and
ſlavery,</hi> it would be conſidered, firſt, whether bondage and
ſlavery was really and truly the condition of the people of
this Nation in former times: Secondly, how much worſe
their condition of ſuch former (falſely called) bondage and
ſlavery was, than the (pretended) <hi>Liberty,</hi> wherewith they
have ſince been vexed, harraſſed, impoveriſhed and (little
leſſe than) ruined; and under which they muſt expect to
ſuffer the ſame horrid Exactions of immenſe ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
as long as any new Government ſhall ſtand; which can
no longer ſtand than the vaſte charge of a huge Army ſhall
uphold it. This the poor enſlaved and miſerably depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>free people of this Nation</hi> do all in general ſo very well
underſtand, (it having with heavy ſtrokes been beaten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their heads,) that a few ſugared words, and fair promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
(from them that profeſſe they will keep none, and have
broken all they have already made, though bound with
ſacred and ſolemne Oaths,) will never be heartily beleived,
or much regarded.</p>
               <p>But, if under the ancient Government there was any
ſuch thing as <hi>real</hi> bondage and ſlavery (beſide the bondage
which poor Copiholders are ſtill like to endure under thoſe
that knew how to <hi>free themſelves</hi> from the Court of
<hi>Wards;)</hi> it would be conſidered whether the fault was in
the Law, or in the forme of Government, or in the Office
of governing, or in the perſons in whom the publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
reſided?</p>
               <p>The Government and the Forme of it, were certainly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40365:12"/>
without exception: For, three ſimple forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there are that are lawful and juſt in themſelves by the
confeſſion of all men; and the ancient and only lawful
Government of this Nation hath all that is good in all
the three; and is therefore in <hi>it ſelf</hi> the beſt Government
in the world. Conſequently there could be no fault, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it were in the perſonal Adminiſtration; and then it
would again be conſidered, whether there was any ſuch
thing as was reputed a fault; and whether that, that was
deemed a fault, were any fault at all, ſince they that will
<hi>deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> will alſo <hi>ſpeak
evil of thoſe things which they know not.</hi> And then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Governours are obliged to a <hi>Papal infallibility,</hi>
under the penalty of having their heads taken off at their
own gates? And laſtly, Whether it be juſt to puniſh and
perſecute with the Sword, and utterly to drive into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Exile, and for ever to diſſeize of an ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Him or them that have never offended?</p>

Government it ſelf are utterly inconſiſtent with, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
deſtructive to the <hi>Publick Safety:</hi> That is, all our
Law-givers, Kings and Parliaments in all former ages
were either ignorant of what was conducing to that End,
or maliciouſly bent againſt it; and the whole people that
have generally promiſed, proteſted, covenanted and ſworn
to maintain the ancient Government and the known Laws
of the Land, were either all out of their wits when they
did it, or never had any, till the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of theſe
rare Principles came forth, and ſhined upon them. And
yet (for all that,) the Publick Safety (which was never
much endangered till theſe bleſſed dayes) hath been ever
hitherto effectually preſerved, no man can imagine how!</p>
               <p>But if this new Doctrine may paſſe for current the Uſe
and End of all Promiſes, Covenants, Proteſtations and
Oaths is utterly loſt; and conſequently, it muſt be a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Gods name in vaine to promiſe any thing upon
Oath in any caſe. For needs muſt that be in vaine that can
never attain the End that is pretended for it. The only
end of an Oath by which a Promiſe is confirmed, is the
<hi>unqueſtionable aſsurance</hi> of the effectual performance of
that which is promiſed: If then in this, he that promiſeth
may be faſt or looſe, as he himſelf ſhall judge the real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
conducing or not conducing to Publick Safety,
the undoubted Aſſurance which that Oath ſhould cauſe
being the greateſt uncertainty, the Oath is abſolutely <hi>taken
in vain;</hi> and conſequently perjurious in the very taking of
it, as well as in the enſuing contempt, if not performed:
For, that God is not invoked in the Oath taking to give
teſtimony to a lye, muſt meerly depend upon the <hi>fallible</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40365:13"/>
opinion of <hi>every one</hi> that takes that Oath, touching what
is, or is not conducible to Publick Safety.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that Promiſes, Proteſtations
and Oaths <hi>are only binding unto the Publick Safety,</hi> there can
be nothing more abominably and ſcandalouſly falſe. For,
that the ſpecial matter of the Promiſe or the <hi>thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Oath,</hi> is <hi>that only thing</hi> to which the Oath and the
Promiſe (as ſuch) do properly oblige, is a truth too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to be contradicted, or doubted of. Otherwiſe, when
a Witneſſe hath ſworn, or promiſed by Oath, <hi>to ſpeak the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,</hi> he may ſafely neglect
this ſpecial matter of his Oath, and ſpeak any thing or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
in caſe he be convinced in his judgment that the
diſcovery of ſuch a truth is inconvenient for the <hi>Publick
Safety.</hi> If the caſe be not the ſelf-ſame, when men have
ſworn or promiſed by Oath, <hi>to bear faith and true Allegiance
to the King, his heirs, and lawful ſucceſſors,</hi> wherein lies the
difference? Why doth not the Oath in this caſe <hi>bind ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
to the <hi>ſpecial matter</hi> of it, as well as in the former, or
in any other?</p>
               <p>If Oaths be binding only to the Publick Safety, or to
ſome other real or pretended End, <hi>and not at all to the perſons
of thoſe</hi> men to whom the promiſes (thereby confirmed,)
are made, nor to the <hi>ſpecial matter,</hi> to wit, the actual and
effectual performance of what is promiſed, two groſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities
will follow; Firſt, that there can be no ſuch
thing as perjury, or breach of Oath committed by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in any caſe imaginable. For that man is mad that will
ever judge that to be <hi>Publick Safety,</hi> wherein his <hi>own</hi> is
not included; and a mans <hi>own ſafety</hi> is that which every
man doth naturally and neceſſarily deſire, and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
purſue (according to his power, and the uttermoſt
of his underſtanding) in all his actions: Therefore, if an
Oath binds only to this End, he ſtedfaſtly aiming at this,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40365:14"/>
                  <hi>in the non-performance of his Oath,</hi> is guilty of no breach of
it, in what caſe ſoever it be: and ſo, perjury is <hi>ſimply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi>
in any caſe imaginable.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That all promiſes confirmed by Oaths,
are to no purpoſe at all, (be the caſe what it will, or can;)
For, they either have no <hi>binding force</hi> at all, or they muſt
needs binde to the <hi>performance</hi> of them, and that to the
<hi>perſon or perſons</hi> to whom they are made: if therefore they
binde to neither of theſe, they ſignifie juſt <hi>nothing;</hi> and
conſequently, all Oaths taken in confirmation of them are
abſolute perjuries and blaſphemies. For, the Oath bindes
only and preciſely to what the promiſe doth; becauſe the
Oath bindes only to make good the promiſe, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
cannot be made in the aire, but muſt neceſſarily be
made to ſome perſon or perſons; If therefore the promiſe
binde not to the <hi>perſons</hi> of thoſe men to whom it is made,
nor to the performance of what is promiſed, no more doth
the Oath; and ſo nothing at all comes of either, but pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
wrong to the perſons abuſed, and deluded by them,
and a blaſphemous invocation of God to be witneſſe to
a lie.</p>
               <p>The Authors of equivocations and men al reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had not the wit to think of this new device, to elude
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: Thoſe inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were but toyes to <hi>this.</hi> This had they happily hit on,
and could in their little modeſty have owned, they might
have allowed the taking of thoſe Oaths as lawful, even in
the plaine ſenſe which the words do expreſſely ſignifie,
though they had held the real and actual performance of
them never ſo unlawful: For now, they and all the world
are taught (to the high Scandal of the Proteſtant Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
that all Oaths and other Obligations (of what kinde
ſoever) <hi>are not at all</hi> binding either to the real and true <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi>
of them, or <hi>to the perſons</hi> of thoſe to whom they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40365:14"/>
are made, (though both theſe be expreſſed in the plaine
words of the Oath;) but <hi>only to the Publick Safety,</hi> (though
this be never mentioned at all therein:) Thus might thoſe
holy Fathers have eluded the Obligation of thoſe Oaths,
and of all other put upon them, or upon any of their party:
Eſpecially, if they had conſidered withal, that that which
was <hi>Publick Safety</hi> to their foes, was no <hi>Publick Safety to
them,</hi> (their <hi>own,</hi> being leaſt of all included in it:) and ſo the
ſaid Oaths could binde them to nothing at all, if <hi>only to that
which they</hi> (in all reaſon) muſt eſteem the Publick Safety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal. 15.</hi> Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy Tabernacle, &amp;c.—He
that ſweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.</p>
               <p>Alſo, that Oaths ſhould be binding only to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Safety, and not at all to the perſons to whom they are
made, nor to the real and true performance of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
thereby, is irrefragably confuted by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Oath of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the
<hi>Gibeonites.</hi> How comes the Oath of Allegiance (back'd
by thoſe other, of the Proteſtation and the Covenant,) to
be leſſe binding to the perſons of the King and his Heirs,
than <hi>that</hi> was to the perſons of the <hi>Gibeonites?</hi> And how
is <hi>real and effectual performance</hi> leſſe neceſſary for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of perjury now, than it was then? Let all the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
of old O lay their heads together to give a clear ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical
anſwer.</p>
               <p>But this will appear to be the harder undertaking, if it
be farther conſidered, that, by the late and preſent practice
upon the Principle aforeſaid, two of thoſe three qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which God<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 4. 2.</note> himſelf hath annexed to all Oaths, are
utterly deſpiſed and made nothing of; to wit, Truth and
Righteouſneſſe. For, firſt, the <hi>Truth</hi> that muſt be found in
the Oath, conſiſteth in the <hi>full Congruity of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi>
(in the real performance of it,) <hi>with the words of the
Oath,</hi> under which the promiſe is made. As, in the Oath
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40365:15"/>
of Allegiance, <hi>J. A. B. do promiſe, that from henceforth I
ſhall bear faith and true Allegiance to the Kings Highneſs, his
Heirs and lawful Succeſſors:</hi> If the Faith and true Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the King and his Heirs here promiſed, do and ſhall
fully anſwer to the words of the Oath henceforth; then,
in <hi>that congruity</hi> of the thing promiſed (and effectually
performed) with the expreſſe words of the promiſe, is the
<hi>truth</hi> of that Oath; But, if this <hi>Truth</hi> be wilfully neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the contrary thereto (upon whatſoever pretence)
admitted, it is (unavoidably) the moſt abſolute and formal
perjury that men can ever poſſibly be guilty of. And then,
if <hi>truth</hi> be wanting, the other qualification of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
muſt needs be ſo. For if the Faith and true Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
promiſed were not due by Law (as by all Law, Divine
and Humane, it is,) yet the ſolemne and expreſſe promiſe
of it, and that upon Oath, muſt needs put the dueneſſe of it
paſt all diſpute. Therefore the failer of truth, in the diffor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
between the duty promiſed, and the words of the
promiſe (which the Oath includeth,) doth neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the failer of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> alſo; it being the ſpecial and
proper act of Righteouſneſſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>to render to all their dues.
If the righteous ſcarely be ſaved</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 18.</note>, where ſhall the <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
(and <hi>perjurious</hi> too) appear?</p>
               <p>There is another device to elude (if God could be
mocked) the Obligation of this Oath: And that is, That
when they took it, they then did really and <hi>truly intend</hi> to
perform it, (though they have ſeen cauſe ſince to be of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
minde:) and, that the <hi>truth</hi> of that their firſt <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is <hi>all</hi> the truth that belongeth to the Oath for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
How cunning ſome men can be, to damn their ſouls!
Meer Polititians and formal Atheiſts muſt they needs be,
that can with any confidence put all the little hope they
have of Heaven upon the validity of that, which (upon the
leaſt conſideration) muſt needs appear to themſelves to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40365:15"/>
juſt nothing. For, (unleſſe they took the Oath
with <hi>no judgment,)</hi> they cannot but know, that their
inward intention of keeping it, was not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
therein: Nor did they at all ſwear, <hi>to intend
then the performance of it;</hi> but, <hi>from thenceforth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it.</hi> Therefore the truth of their intention (if there
were any,) never was nor is any thing at all to that
ſpecial truth which ought from thenceforth (that is,
in all time to come,) to be bound in the ſpecial matter
of the Oath, which is only and preciſely the real and
effectual performance of that formal act and duty, of
<hi>bearing faith and true Allegiance, &amp;c.</hi> And, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
truth of intention, is nothing to the truth, or
is not the formal truth of the real performance of that
duty, (which is the only thing promiſed by the Oath;)
So is it nothing at all conducing to the ſpecial and
proper <hi>End</hi> of it: For, the End of that Oath was not
to diſcover the ſecrets of mens hearts, (the knowledge
whereof belongs to none but God and themſelves,)
but to bind them to their <hi>External and Civil duty.</hi>
The failer of <hi>truth</hi> therfore as touching <hi>this,</hi> is (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all contradiction) that foul and groſſe perjury, for
which there can be no Apology, nor pardon without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>If this Nation therefore ſhould ſo far forget their
natural and neceſſary duty of Allegiance to their
only lawful Soveraign, as to break through the
ſtrongeſt obligation of this moſt ſolemne publick and
legal Oath and divers others by which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
and ſworn the due performance of it, ſuch a
National Wickedneſſe committed in an open, bold,
and daring manner, involving an Atheiſtical defiance
of the God of Truth by whom they have ſworn,
would very ſoon draw down upon them a National
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40365:16"/>
and fatal judgment; <hi>and that infallibly:</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
hereof is, becauſe this kind of impiety not only
diſhonours God obliquely, (as all ſinne doth,) but
directly darkens the glory of God in his great Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of <hi>Truth,</hi> wherein he alone excelleth all other that
are falſely called ſo. And becauſe the ſcandal of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
breach of this National Oath can know no limit,
it can be no leſſe than a total Eclipſing (as much as in
men lies) of the glory of God (which he will part with
at no rate) in the eyes of all the Nations of the world.
And in this kind of ſin, this is ſingular and proper,
that, for this, if wilfully committed, no man may
pray, that God would remit or avert the temporal
and ſpeedy vengeance that is due unto it: becauſe
this is the only proper <hi>Expedient</hi> for that neceſſary and
indiſpenſable Vindication of Gods glory in the eyes of
men, being by that kind of ſin cauſed (as much as in
men lies) to be diſreputed among all other Nations
to be <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> or, <hi>the only true God.</hi> And the
wilful Breach of this Oath is the more horrid, in that
it is committed againſt the higheſt, cleereſt, greateſt
and moſt publickly known Right in all the world. 1 <hi>Cor.
6. 7, 8.—Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do
ye not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded? Nay, you
do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren;</hi> What
aggravation then were this! <hi>And that your publick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
even the greateſt nurſing Father of the Church,
the trueſt <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> and (under God) the
greateſt Patron of the pureſt Profeſſion of that Faith
in all the world, and by all other Nations (holding the
ſame Profeſſion) ever ſo accounted.</p>
               <p>But, leſt they that have never in their proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
taken that Oath aforementioned, ſhould think
themſelves to be little concerned in it, it is here to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40365:16"/>
farther noted, 1. That the Law of God, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of the inviolable and fundamental Law of the
Land (without which the eighth Precept as well as
the fifth, of the moral and eternal Law of God would
have nothing in this Land to take effect upon,) doth
of it ſelf (before and without that Oath) oblige the
conſcience of every one of the free people of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to perform the duty of bearing faith and true
Allegiance to the lawful and rightful King and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thereof. 2. That the Oath of Allegiance and
every other legal Oath to the like effect, being once
taken by the whole Nations Repreſentative in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and in the capacity of ſuch a Repreſentative,
muſt neceſſarily oblige the Nation repreſented, no leſſe
than the Repreſentative it ſelf; and that (according
to the tenor of the Oath,) <hi>from thence forth;</hi> that is,
in all time to come. And this appears evidently by
the example of the Oath of the Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to
the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> The Princes being the whole peoples
Repreſentative, and for that cauſe, ſtiled <hi>the Princes
of the Congregation,</hi> the whole people ſtood obliged by it,
(though not formally taken by every one,) and that <hi>for
ever after.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 1, 2.</note> And this appears by the heavie judgment
of God upon <hi>Sauls</hi> family, four hundred and thirty
years after, for the breach of that National Oath, though
He himſelf had never formally taken it.</p>
               <p>For though an Oath be <hi>vinculum perſonale,</hi> yet that
is no reaſon why in ſuch a caſe it ſhould not binde the
conſciences of thoſe perſons that (formerly) took it
not, but rather why it ſhould; to wit, becauſe thoſe
perſons that took it, took it not only in their own
formal capacity, as ſo many ſingle men, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in their Publick and Repreſentative capacity, as
ſuſtaining the <hi>perſons</hi> of all the reſt of the people; In
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40365:17"/>
which caſe, the <hi>perſons</hi> of all other repreſented by
them are obliged by that Oath; it being even to <hi>them,</hi>
at leaſt by <hi>interpretation,</hi> a <hi>perſonal</hi> Oath; and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
perſonally took it: For, in this caſe, or any other
the like, <hi>Quod quis facit per alium, facit per ſe;</hi> That
which any one doth by another in his ſtead, he doth
by himſelf. Therefore as the whole people do by their
freely choſen Repreſentative conſent to the enacting
of a Law, ſo to the taking of this legal Oath, and are
therefore no leſſe obliged perſonally by both than
their Repreſenters are.</p>
               <p>All the Perſons therefore of the whole people that
ſhall formally conſent to the Breach of this National
Oath, are as formally guilty before God both of that
Perjury and injuſtice as any particular perſons are,
in what capacity or place of Authority ſoever they
be.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all but one, which is rather implyed,
than expreſſed, and is to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That it
is lawful to juſtifie one iniquity by another: Or,
that, becauſe ſome perſons have done ſuch things, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may do the like. Or, (more expreſſely,)
That, <hi>ſtrange and unknown practiſes,</hi> never done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>nor at all juſtifiable by any known Lawes, and
(doubtleſſe in reſpect of the letter of the Law,) very il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
actions</hi> (and thoſe in expreſſe contradiction to
divers National Oaths,) may lawfully and juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be done; (and that) by perſons, that are not
the whole or the greater part of the whole number
of thoſe, in whom the Supreme Government is (by
the ancient conſtitution and uninterrupted uſage, and
known Law and Cuſtome of the Nation,) really
and of right exiſting: And that ſuch unknown and
ſtrange practiſes, (extending to the totall diſſolution
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40365:17"/>
of the only known legal Government,) being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
by no known Law, Divine or Humane, by
no former Precedent, good or bad, nor by any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Rule and juſt Meaſure of Civil Righteouſneſs,
may yet be juſified by the pretended Light of the
aforeſaid Principles, falſely called Principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reaſon, Juſtice and Equity.</p>
               <p>What S. <hi>Ireneus</hi> of old ſaid of the horrid and
groſſe Hereſies of the Valentinians, <hi>That the meere
diſcovery of them was Confutation enough,</hi> may very
well be ſaid of this no leſſe horrid and heretical Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The pretended <hi>Light</hi> of the aforeſaid Principles,
(much like that of the Quakers, is here confeſſedly
oppoſed to all the known Law of the Land. And
yet, beſide the whole body of all the known Laws of the
Land, and true Cuſtomes of the Nation, there is not
any thing imaginable, by which the ſeveral perſons
of it are or can be actually united and formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
a <hi>Civil Body.</hi> And, that, where there is no
<hi>Civil Body,</hi> there can be no civil Authority, is as
plain and certain, as that twice two is four, or thrice
three, nine. By what Authority then could or can
any ſuch ſtrange and unknown practices be done, which
(by the Actors own confeſſion) are not only beſide,
but directly contrary to all known Law?</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for a ſtream to riſe higher than
the Fountain out of which it flows. The known Law
of the Land, and the fundamental Cuſtomes of the
Nation (and not the light of any principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reaſon, which all the Nations of the world are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
partakers of,) being the only proper and formal cauſe
of the very conſtitution of the <hi>Civil Body</hi> as ſuch, muſt
needs be the only fountain of all <hi>Civil Authority</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40365:18"/>
lawful Power in it: <hi>This</hi> therefore can never riſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or reach farther than that Law, Cuſtome, and
civil Conſtitution. Therefore whatſoever hath beene
done, by what perſons ſoever, beſide, or beyond,
or more directly contrary to the known Law, Cuſtome
and civil Conſtitution of the Kingdom, hath been done
by <hi>no civil Authority or lawful power.</hi> And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whatſoever hath ſo been done, (by what perſon
ſoever, or in what capiacity ſoever,) muſt neceſſarily
infer the guilt of that <hi>unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> which nothing
but true repentance can remove; and no repentance
can be true, if the ſin it ſelf be wilfully perſiſted in.</p>
