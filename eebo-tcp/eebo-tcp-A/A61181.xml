            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

1 St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Chap. 2. Part of 21st, and 22d Verses.</bibl>
               <q>Christ also suffer'd for us, leaving us an Example, that ye should follow his Steps, Who did no Sin.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Subject of our Devout Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on this Blessed Day, is our dear Redeemer's Passion; and the last most bitter part of it, his <hi>humbling</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>himself</hi> so, as <hi>to become Obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cross; and the Preaching of this Cross,</hi> though (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us) <hi>To them that Perish it is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Foolishness,</hi> yet he also assures us, <hi>to as many as are Saved, it is the Power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that none of Us should be found in the number of those, who <hi>Perish</hi> by foolishly despising the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a Crucified Saviour, but rather that we may all be wise to Salvation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100565:3"/>
by meekly adoring this Power of God, and the wondrous Depths of Divine Love in it, and by rightly applying the unspeakable Fruits of it to our selves, our Church has taken all imaginable care to represent it to us in the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and efficacious manner, and to fix it firmly on our Minds and Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by frequent and affectionate Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of all its Parts and Aggravations.</p>
            <p>So that if we shall reflect on the whole Annual Circle of our Publick Devotions, 'twere easie to observe, that our Saviour's Sufferings are therein oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reiterated, and more in proportion, insisted on, than perhaps any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our <hi>pure and undefiled Religion:</hi> Our Church in this, as in all things else, exactly following the Blessed Pattern of the first, and purest Ages, as they did the Gospel of Christ; which seems to dispense, and measure out to us, the benefits of all Spiritual Truths, even of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100565:3"/>
his Glorious Resurrection it self, only according as we shall lay hold on the Merits of, and be conformable to his Death. For so, (among many other Scriptures to the like purpose) we read, That <hi>if we have been planted together in the likeness of his Death;</hi> if so, and upon no other terms, then <hi>we shall be also planted</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 5.</note> 
               <hi>in the likeness of his Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore in order to this, and to introduce, as at this time, the Passion of Christ with the greater Solemnity, well did the Church Ordain, That the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Period of our Regular Abstinence, and Repentance every Year, should immediately go before this particular Season; wisely judging, the severest Mortifications of our selves, to be the best Preparations for our meeting wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily our Lord dying, and rising again for us; and that some more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Method of Zealous Piety, and Stricter Retirement from the World,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100565:4"/>
was necessary to fit us duly for a Time, and Commemoration so Sacred.</p>
            <p>Nay farther yet, When the very Day of his dying did nearer approach, to shew what ought to be the chief Matter of our Private Contemplations, as well as Publick Worship, during the whole Week preceding, (which has been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remarkably honour'd with the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Name of <hi>The Holy Week,)</hi> has not our Excellent <hi>Liturgy,</hi> Day by Day, without Intermission, with a Succession of Divine Offices, the like not enjoin'd us in any other Week of the Year, continually repeated and inculcated on our Memories this one charming Truth, That <hi>our Lord, our Love, was Crucified?</hi> So that scarce any thing else has all this while sounded in our Ears, in these Holy Places, but some one or other step of our Saviour's sad, and dolorous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the <hi>Field of Blood;</hi> till now at length we are brought thither, and to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100565:4"/>
the very Day, when <hi>He cried out, It is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. John 19. 30.</note> 
               <hi>finish'd, and gave up the Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We having been so lately conducted through this wholesome course of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities and Contritions, all teaching us to Die to Sin, as our Lord Died now for our Sins; I cannot but believe, that what had been else the proper Business of the Preacher on this Day, is already in great part here done to my Hands; that You are all come hither tenderly affected with a deep Sense, and melting Remorse, for what Christ suffer'd, as at this time in our stead.</p>
            <p>And if, by GOD's Grace, Your Hearts are thus already touch'd from above, then all that is left for me to do, will be only to assist You, not so much in raising, as in directing to the best Uses, Your Devout Affections al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rais'd: To consult together with You, in the Fear of GOD, how all this Grief, and Sorrow, which so deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100565:5"/>
possesses Your Souls, may become a true Christian Grief, and Godly Sorrow; How by Degrees we may advance it into Spiritual Gratitude, Hope, Love, Zeal, and <hi>Full Assurance of Faith;</hi> and at last into <hi>Joys unspeakable, and full of Glory:</hi> Which, as sure as God is true, will come to pass in the event, if we shall make his precious Death and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not only the steady Object of our Belief and Admiration in those parts of it, wherein we cannot imitate Him; but also of our unwearied Imitation, and constant Practise in those Things, wherein he <hi>left</hi> behind him <hi>an Example,</hi> for <hi>us to follow his Steps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So you see it is, that my Text instructs us, in the only saving way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating our dear Lord's Sufferings; that we should consider them not only in themselves, and their Cruel and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Circumstances, but in their Gracious Ends, Influences and Powers:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100565:5"/>
As Christ was the Person <hi>Suffering;</hi> as he <hi>suffer'd so much,</hi> and as he suffer'd <hi>for us: For us,</hi> as an unvaluable Randsom to atone GOD's Justice, that we may relie on it; <hi>For us,</hi> as an unblameable Original of Meekness, Holiness, Charity, and Resignation to the Will of GOD, that we may Copy after it.</p>
            <p>In these few Words therefore, we behold our LORD's Passion display'd to our View, in its brightest Glory, its condescending Humility, its most obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Endearments, and its principal Uses.</p>
            <p>First, Its <hi>Glory,</hi> in that it was <hi>Christ</hi> who <hi>suffer'd; Jesus the Christ, the Christ of God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. Matt. 16. 20.</note> who is <hi>Lord of all things, the Lord and Giver</hi>

               </gap> wicked Men, or the Rage of Hell disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Him, but the Wrath of GOD provoked, could inflict on Him, not in the least on His own Account, but only for our sakes.</p>
            <p>Which next follows, and is the most endearing part of all, that <hi>He suffer'd for us;</hi> the Creator for the Creatures; <hi>the Just for the Unjust;</hi> the Judge for the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals: <note place="margin">1 St. Pet. 3. 18.</note> Yet <hi>for us,</hi> loaded with all this Weight of our Guilt, and with all these just Causes of His Prejudice, he <hi>suffered,</hi> for our Justification, for our Salvation; but in the mean time, and in order to that, for our <hi>Example!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, The Excellency of <hi>the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he has left us to follow,</hi> is specified in such an eminent Instance, that <hi>He did no Sin,</hi> as would indeed make us utterly to despair of ever following it, were it not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100565:6"/>
for his Grace strengthning us, his Mercy forgiving us, and his Spirit supporting us: All which he has faithfully promis'd, and <hi>no Guile was ever found in his Mouth.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The first Particular in my Text, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Grace of our LORD's Passion is magnifi'd, is, that the Person now suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was <hi>the Christ of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not here stay to enumerate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly the many High Prerogatives, and Glorious Appellations, which are heap'd on this great Person, as he was <hi>the Christ,</hi> throughout the Holy Scriptures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>He</hi> was <hi>the Alpha, and Omega, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi>

            <p>It may suffice, that all over this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd Book, He is amply declar'd to be, what the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> has Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely contracted into few words; <hi>The Son of God; The only begotten of God; The Heir

               <hi>our Sins,</hi> then, and not till then, <hi>He sate down on the Right Hand of the Majesty on High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then was <hi>the Christ,</hi> appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Time, coming in the fulness of Time, sent from the Bosom of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, by his Death to raise us from the Death of Sin; whereof our first, and Temporal Death, was the fatal Consequence; and our second Eternal Death, had been else the irreparable Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>

            <p>By this one Adorable Counsel, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, that were themselves so vastly distant, and whose distance our Sins had widened so much more, were to be join'd, and for ever Reconciled: <hi>Mercy and Truth were to meet together, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Peace to kiss each other:</hi> There <note place="margin">Psalm 85. 10.</note> was to be an Atonement on the one part, a Forgiveness on the other: Satisfaction was to be made by the Free Sufferings of a Man; Salvation to be bestow'd by the Free Grace of GOD. Wherefore both Natures, the Human, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, were to be United in one <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since GOD was pleas'd to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our Mortal Condition, so highly, by this near Conjunction, he made our Nature in his <hi>Christ,</hi> as Glorious, and Perfect, as it was capable to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100565:8"/>
The Preparations for his Appearance, the Signs that foretold him, the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that made way for him, his Personal Perfections, his Teaching, his Actions, his Sufferings, did all exceed all Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Human Greatness or Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>So Sacred was his Authority, that all other True Divine Teachers, from the beginning of the World to his Birth, though they had gone before him in the Flesh, yet received their Power, and Commission from him by the Spirit. Whatever Wonders they wrought, whatever Truths they taught, all was done, and spoken with relation to him, and in subservience to his Religion.</p>
            <p>We know, that not only he himself, but even his Types, Forerunners, and Shadows, had many of them, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of working Miracles, the Gift of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the common Course of Nature, and controuling the setled Laws of the

Creation, as they pleas'd. The Prophets had it: <hi>Moses</hi> had it above all others. Yet they all had it only with depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him, and by a Title deriv'd from him; as they were his Figures, Ministers, and Substitutes; to prepare, and enable the World, by Degrees, to receive this <hi>Great Mystery of Godliness, God manifested in the Flesh;</hi> This last, and universal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> of <hi>Life, and Immortality brought</hi>

               <hi>I know that Messias cometh, who is called Christ; and when he is come, he will teach us all things,</hi> said the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman in St. <hi>John</hi> the 4th, and Vers. 25. And in the same Chapter said many of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans, Now we have heard him our selves, we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World,</hi> Vers. 42. And the same St. <hi>John,</hi> who loved him most, and therefore probably knew him best, (for the greatest Love of GOD is the best way to the greatest Knowledge of him.)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100565:9"/>
               <hi>The Messias,</hi> (says he) <hi>is, being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. John 1. 41.</note> 
               <hi>the Christ:</hi> The very <hi>Messias,</hi> whom the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, all the Wise, Devout and Inspired part of it; all the time it was a True Church, so earnestly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and desired; as he was to be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards also <hi>the Desire of all Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They long before beheld him, though but darkly, in the Visions and Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Fathers, the Characters and Inspirations of their Prophets, the Veils of their Ceremonies and Sacrifices, the Ornaments of their Temple, the Office of their <hi>High Priests;</hi> which were all, as the Law it self was, <hi>only Shadows of good things to come,</hi> whereof <hi>He was the Body;</hi> they <note place="margin">Colos. 2. 17.</note> had all a borrowed Meaning, and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical <note place="margin">Hebr. 10. 1.</note> End; they were all fixt on the Great <hi>Messias;</hi> by Him they were Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated; and in Him alone they were all Consummated.</p>
            <p>By the United Expectation of the <hi>Jews</hi> all along, according to the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100565:9"/>
Prediction, and no doubt by a right Tradition, antienter than that, their <hi>Messias</hi> was to appear after the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and before the Destruction of their Temple and Nation. They themselves, just then, when Christ came, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, and every Moment, expect his coming. All their Circumstances agreed in that time: All their Descriptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center'd in his Person: All their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than gave over; the End of them all being in him once obtain'd. And that People has since had no more visible Communion with GOD, which had so much before.</p>

their <hi>Messias.</hi> He, <hi>Unto whom the gather ing of the People was to be;</hi> He, towards <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> whom all the Antient Ages of GOD's Church before him, did look forward, and upon whom all the Ages of it since, have look'd back: The former Times to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel him; the later Times to reveal him; both to Believe in, and to be Saved by him alone; for which end, and with respect to him, all the Miseries and Joys of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it self, are provided, and accordingly, shall be dispens'd, to punish those that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, to reward those that Obey him.</p>
            <p>These, and whatever other such, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Expressions of Excellency, the Holy Scriptures have attributed to our Lord, as he is <hi>the Christ;</hi> as they are all on the one side, so many evident Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of his <hi>Eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> so on the other, they ought to be esteemed as so many Marvellous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and astonishing Amplifications of the Merciful Condescention of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100565:10"/>
which is my next particular. This very <hi>Christ suffer'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any shall now inquire, from what Period of Time we may justly date the Beginning of his Passion; without all Question, his Sufferings took their Rise from the very first Moment of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming our Flesh: Since for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of GOD only to become Man, was infinitely to suffer: That <hi>He,</hi> who <hi>was in the Form of GOD, and thought it no</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Robbery,</hi> but his inviolable Right, <hi>to be equal with GOD, should be made of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and take on him the Form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and be made in the Likeness of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was made in the Likeness of Man. Was not that an inexpressible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement of the Glories of his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? But, as if that were not Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Degradation enough, to that is added, his stooping down to the low, and abject Form of a <hi>Servant.</hi> The great GOD of Heaven, who is otherwise <hi>No
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100565:11"/>
Accepter, or Respecter of Persons among Men,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 10. 34. Gal. 2. 6.</note> nor does he prefer the highest before the lowest, upon any inequality of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions here below; yet, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was to put on our Humanity, he then became, as it were, an Accepter of Persons on the other side, and chose to appear in the vilest, and most despicable State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Children of Men; which is, that of <hi>a Servant,</hi> and the being <hi>made of no Reputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, with his very taking our Nature, did his <hi>Sufferings</hi> begin; and thence were continued through all the humble Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his Birth, and Kindred, and Conversation; through a Life of Poverty, Simplicity, and Self-Denial; and as the Evangelical Prophet describes him, <hi>As a Man of Sorrows, acquainted with Grief; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isai. 53. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and rejected of Men:</hi> Till he came at length to that, which still deserves Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically to be call'd, <hi>His Passion;</hi> when he was also <hi>smitten of God, and afflicted,</hi> to <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100565:11"/>
his dreadful Conflict with GOD, and himself in the Garden, and his Sweating Drops of Blood there; to the Buffetings, the Revilings, the Scourges, the Spittings, <hi>the contradiction of Sinners he endured:</hi> The <note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 3.</note> Cruel Insolency of his Enemies; the fierce Rage of the Superstitious <hi>Jews;</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Scorn of the <hi>Romans;</hi> the Theives Crucifi'd with him; the Murderer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before him; the Gall and Vineger given him to Drink; the Nails in his Hands; the Spear in his Side; the very August Name of King, objected to him in Contempt; the Painful and Shameful Crown of Thorns put on his Head, with Ignominious Mockery: And, at last, that inutterable Torment darted into his very Soul immediately from GOD himself, which compell'd him for a time, almost to Despair, and to sink under its Weight. Surae we are, it made him cry out, <hi>My God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. Matt. 27. 46.</note> 
               <hi>my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that black and dismal Moment of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100565:12"/>
his expiring on the Cross, what insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Suffering</hi> must his have been, which could even appear to stagger such a Faith, and eclipse his Assurance of the Presence and Love of his <hi>heavenly Father!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many Deaths, and extream A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of Death must he then have felt! When, as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> says, <hi>The Lord laid on him the Iniquity of us all:</hi> And <note place="margin">Isai. 53. 6.</note> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> here expresses it, <hi>He his own</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 St. Pet. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>self bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree?</hi> And not only ours, but the Sins of the whole World; since St. <hi>Paul</hi> has also taught us in his own Person, that every Sinner, as such, carries no less a Load about with him, than a whole <hi>Body of Death!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly the bare mention of our Lord's <hi>thus suffering,</hi> though so plainly related, could not but convince any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> and unconcern'd Person pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by, that <hi>never any Sorrow was like his Sorrow.</hi> But there is still something more behind, that methinks should never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100565:12"/>
any of the Sons and Daughters of Men to pass it by as indifferent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd: And that is the third part of my Text, He <hi>suffer'd</hi> all this <hi>for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For us he suffer'd.</hi> For himself he could <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> not die. <hi>Death is the Wages of Sin;</hi> and <hi>the sting of Death is Sin.</hi> Death could <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> have no Dominion over him on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <hi>He did no Sin.</hi> But if any of us shall say so of our selves, <hi>The Truth is not in us.</hi> Wherefore <hi>for us,</hi> or which is all one, <hi>for our Sins,</hi> in our place, <hi>he suffer'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Sin must be acknowledg'd to be a breach of the Wise, Holy, and Upright Law of GOD: And for every breach of such a Law, a severe Punishment is due, unless some fitting Expiation be made. And that He only could have perform'd. Could any other Creatures for us? Alas! all their value bears no proportion to such a Forfeiture. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, such as they are, we had no right to use them to that purpose, since GOD
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100565:13"/>
alone, not we, had the Propriety in them before. Nor could we our selves have made an Equitable Satisfaction. Alas! Were it not for this Redeemer, we had wanted an Atonement not only for our Iniquities, but for our best Righteousness.</p>
            <p>Wherefore seeing neither we our selves, nor any other for us, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any just Price towards our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; to whom could we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course? Whither should we flee for Refuge, but to that <hi>one GOD, and one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Mediator between GOD and Man, the Man Christ Jesus?</hi> Flee to him we did not neither: Nor could we first; rather he sought us out, found, overtook us flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him. In that deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the <hi>Good Samaritan had Compassion on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. Luk. 10. 33.</note> 
               <hi>us,</hi> weltring in our Blood, in our Sins that required his Blood; <hi>To bind up our Wounds, and heal our Bruises, and love us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hos. 14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>freely:</hi> Freely it must have been, or not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100565:13"/>
Thus <hi>for us,</hi> incompass'd with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Frailties and Corruptions; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with so many Pollutions of Original and Actual Sins; blacken'd with so many repeated Ingratitudes towards Heaven: <hi>For us,</hi> sinful Men. Men! sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Dust and Ashes; Worms and no Men;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 22. 6.</note> (for so the Scripture accounts of every Sinner; condemns him to have lost the very common Privilege of being a Man; which at best is no great Matter to boast of, as Man has made himself: For <hi>Man</hi> does but <hi>walk in a vain Shadow,</hi> whereas <note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note> Sin makes him worse than a Shadow; <hi>worse than the very Beasts that perish;</hi> and of Beasts the most contemptible, even a Worm of the Earth:) However, <hi>for us,</hi> in this dejected and depraved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Christ</hi> undertook, <hi>Christ suffer'd:</hi> Not only became our Intercessor, our Pledge, our Ransom, our Surety; but our Propitiatory Offering, our Bloody Sacrifice; to atone <hi>for us,</hi> by undergoing <hi>himself</hi> the Divine Vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100565:14"/>
What shall we say then? If our Lord's <hi>Suffering</hi> in this terrible manner, was able to shake the whole Frame of the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, as it did; if it could disorder the very Inanimate and Insensible Parts of it, though they were altogether Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of its Guilt: If it could rend the Veil of the Temple, and split the Rocks, and darken the Sun, and overspread the Face of the Earth with thick Darkness, and open the Graves, and make Dead Bodies arise, and walk abroad: What powerful Effect then? And, What irresistible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence should all this have upon us? Who, in as much as we are all Sinners, had but too great a share in being the Causes of his thus <hi>Suffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What passionate Relentings, What vehement Desires, What fervent Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings should the Remembrance of all this excite in our Souls towards him? What <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> Carefulness; yea, What clearing of our selves; yea, <hi>What Indignation; yea, What
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100565:14"/>
Fear; yea, What Zeal; yea, What Revenge,</hi> against Sin and Iniquity, that occasioned all This? What <hi>Resolutions of better Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> What Vigilancy, What Prayers, What Tears, What Vows for the future should it Solemnly engage us in, against those our Transgressions, which cost him so Dear, no less than his Immaculate Blood, and weigh'd down for a Time, his Righteous Soul into Hell?</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Christ Suffer'd for us,</hi> to pay an Inestimable Price for our Demerits; and by his own Merits, to make us Sinners acceptable in the Sight of God, who <hi>is of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hab. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>purer Eyes, than to behold Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, may we now safely conclude from hence, That the whole design of our Redemption, was absolutely finish'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God, and Him, and Us, merely by <hi>his Suffering for us?</hi> Yes, entirely, as to the Meritorious part of it, tho' we should all beware of Negligence, or Presumption, on that Account: For there still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100565:15"/>
enough to be done on our part.</p>
            <p>His share was in Truth, All in All, and All in every Part. It was completely to purchase Salvation for us. But then must begin, and then only can begin, our share, which is still, To <hi>Work out that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> So that although, all our Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can only proceed on the sure Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Purchase: Yet withal, it must indispensably proceed thereupon. And let us not be deceiv'd; if, as we are told, even our best <hi>Working</hi> in this Life, cannot be without some <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> What <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> will our not Working at all be?</p>
            <p>Consider I beseech you, The Free Grace of our LORD's Redeeming Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by his Blood, <hi>The Blood of the New</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29. 13. 20.</note> 
               <hi>and Everlasting Covenant,</hi> as large and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive as it is, yet can be of no Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to us in Particular, but to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our Condemnation for neglecting it, unless we not only Accept and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it by Faith, but Embrace and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100565:15"/>
it with a Living Faith. And then Faith only lives in an Evangelical Sense, not only when it Breaths and Professes, but when it Moves and Works, then it most Lives, when it Operates Vigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly in a Conscientious Obedience to his Precepts, and a Diligent and Dutiful Conformity to his Example: Which is the Reason, my Text assigns, of our LORD's <hi>Suffering for us,</hi> that he might <hi>leave us an Example,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> should <hi>follow his Steps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know there are some, that call themselves Christians, who rejecting the great Fundamental Doctrine of our LORD's Suffering for us, as a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice, allow no other End of his Coming, and Living, and Dying in the Flesh, but that he might shew us the way to Heaven, by his Teaching, and <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not, in this Audience, labour to confute this; or to prove <hi>Christ</hi>'s
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100565:16"/>
having been a Real Sacrifice, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sufficient Atonement for Sin, <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self once offer'd:</hi> Since in the whole Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> of the Gospel, especially in St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, and that to the <hi>Hebrews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> this Truth seems to be so perspicuously confirm'd. Only let me add, his being offer'd to GOD, as our Sacrifice, was a thing so Necessary, that without it, in Vain had He been proposed to us, as our <hi>Example:</hi> Both these great Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Suffering, being so insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Mixt and United, that wherever they shall be found divided, neither o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them can be Effectual. <hi>Christ</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been to us a Pattern of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, such as we could have had the least hope to follow, had He not also been a Propitiation for our Sins. And that Propitiation will prevail with the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge of all the World,</hi> only for such as, in some Degree, or other, sincerely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Practice after his Pattern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100565:16"/>
Upon no less, nor any other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, has He undertaken to cleanse and res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue us from the Guilt and Slavery of our Sins, but only, as we shall strive to exercise that Capacity, which He has also obtain'd for us, of <hi>following the Steps</hi> of his Graces.</p>
            <p>It must be Confess'd, without his Righteousness imputed to us, we can never be Justifi'd in the Sight of God. And his Righteousness is never impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any, but only those, by whom either, in Deed, or in Will, it is Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I say, not only in Deed, but in Will, because our Gracious GOD, who worketh in us both to Will, and to Do of his Good Pleasure, is sometimes pleas'd, <hi>To accept the Will for the Deed:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> But never so, as thereby to give us any Incouragement to come short of, or to omit the Deed.</p>
            <p>I say then again, our Blessed LORD can never be a comfortable <hi>Example,</hi> but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100565:17"/>
only to those, for whom He was a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And He never suffer'd effectually for any as a Sacrifice, but such, as unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly desire, and endeavor, to make Him their <hi>Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being granted, that it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every one that <hi>calls on the Name of Christ,</hi> not only to trust in Him as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but to <hi>follow His Steps</hi> as our <hi>Example.</hi> It will next be very well worth our while to examine carefully, where we may find an accurate Copy of that <hi>Example:</hi> In what Holy ground we are to search, for the Genuine Marks of those Heavenly <hi>Steps</hi> we are to tread in.</p>
            <p>For that, the Greek Word in my Text, which is translated <hi>Example,</hi> may suggest to us a certain Rule of Direction in this whole Matter: The Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, such a Type, Prescript, and Original Draught, as is left us in Writing, whence we may transcribe it into our Lives.</p>
            <p>So that you see, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100565:17"/>
to leave us a mere uncertain hear-say, changeable, traditionary Doctrine of our Lord's Example; but such a One, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at first taken as near the Life as could be, was then written down, once for all finished, and <hi>once delivered to the Saints,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. Jude v. 3.</note> as indeed every part of it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be shewn in the Holy Word of GOD, which is our fix'd Standard of all Truth and Goodness, and next to <hi>Christ</hi> and His Spirit, our only Infallible Guide of Faith and Manners.</p>
            <p>This, says our Apostle, is the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>He has left us,</hi> for <hi>you to follow:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd it first into our Trust, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, who were Eye-witnesses of all, by us to be faithfully transmitted down to you, the Saints of all Ages to come. An Example most Holy, and most Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, both of our and your Imitation, in that <hi>He did no Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So my Text proceeds to make out the Perfection of His <hi>Example.</hi> But here,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100565:18"/>
alas! we must stop, when <hi>He took on Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self our other Infirmities;</hi> yet, <hi>Sin was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi> He was a spotless <hi>Example</hi> to us of Holiness: But such as we can never be to one another. 'Twere Blasphemy in us to imagine, that we can ever be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from Sin in any Degree of Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with him: Well were it for us, if we might be so, in some Degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to Him.</p>
            <p>And let us not Despair, for that we may be, if we shall do what we are here advis'd, and what, through His Grace we may do: If we shall still have him in our View, and Write, and Speak, and Live after the perfect Copy of so great a Master; and stedfastly follow his Steps, though it be only, as his Friends and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> followed him to the Cross, <hi>afar off.</hi> However, if we shall keep his <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 49.</note> Example unmoveably before our Eyes, and perpetually strive to Walk answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to it; then, whatever we shall Do,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100565:18"/>
or Speak, or Think well, though very imperfectly, he will accept; and, where through Human Weakness, we shall fail, he, out of the inexhaustible Riches of his own Mercy, will supply all the Good that is wanting, and pardon all the Ill that remains.</p>
            <p>An Example seems to be some visible Image, or sensible Pattern of something extraordinary in its kind; so exhibited to common Observation, that others may direct their practise by it, and learn to excel in the same kind.</p>
            <p>And great is the force of Examples: Great on both Sides; either in leading us to Good, or seducing us to Evil.</p>
            <p>By common Experience, Examples are found to have far greater Influence on the Minds and Actions of Men, than the most Excellent Precepts singly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</p>
            <p>Examples have a Natural, Living, and vigorous Efficacy, by Secret and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100565:19"/>
Charms, they are generally wont to insinuate much farther, than the best Commands, or Intreaties, or Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by themselves can reach.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Wisest Laws can only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and require Obedience, by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Punishments, or promising Rewards, good Examples do more softly affect the Passions, and captivate the Imagination, and gently frame the Will to themselves: Convincing Mens Understandings, that the Good ought to be done by the bright lustre attending all Goodness, when brought into Example; and also proving to our very Eyes and Senses, that it has been done by others, and therefore may be done by us, if it be not our own fault; and shewing the easiest Method, and most graceful Manner of doing it.</p>
            <p>Since therefore in all things relating to Practise, Examples have so prevalent an Authority, much more than any other way of Teaching; let me seriously Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100565:19"/>
to you all, the <hi>following</hi> this most. Consummate Pattern of <hi>our Lord,</hi> and the being made like to him, above all other Examples: A Duty so Incumbent on all Christians, that our very first Initiation into his Faith, our Baptism obliges us to it, as the distinguishing Badge and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our Holy Profession.</p>
            <p>And let me assure you, Great, Happy, and Illustrious, would soon be the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of such an imitating Christianity: Such as shall Teach us, in the first place, most studiously to imitate <hi>Christ</hi> himself; and next him, his Disciples, Apostles, and first Companions, <hi>To be followers of them,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule, concerning himself, <hi>as they were of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This would undoubtedly make us Disciples of Christ, according to his own Heart, who has declared himself to be not only the Truth, but <hi>the Way,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">St. John 146.</note> 
               <hi>the Truth, and the Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This would speedily take off our Minds
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100565:20"/>
from eager Disputes, and fierce Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and employ them about plain and unquestionable Truths and Duties. This would quickly abate much of the vehement and tumultuous Spirit of Zeal, but increase the temperate Heat, and useful Fire of it. This would soon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and sweeten all that Sharpness, Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erness, and Peevishness of Conscience, which so generally prevails, and change it into a Conscience void of Offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Man. This would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Men rather to be innocent, and holy themselves, by constant looking towards Him, who was so, than to find fault curiously, or to object subtily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst others: Rather to be industrious in doing well, as He did, than to be critical in blaming what others do amiss.</p>
            <p>This, in short, is the best way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Primitive Power of the Gospel, by restoring the Primitive Method of its wonderful Rise, Increase and Progress.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100565:20"/>
This, in stead of making all Practise eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate in Speculation, would more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably reduce Speculation into Practise. This would bring Religion more into publick View and Notice, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence more into Credit and Fashion. And whereas nothing can be a greater Scandal to any Church, than for the Members of it to be Rigid in their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of others, and yet loose in their own <hi>Examples;</hi> This would make the Loveliness of our <hi>Examples</hi> to correspond with, and even to adorn the Beauty of our Churches Doctrines and Precepts.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to urge this yet farther, with a special regard to You of this Place. For You thus indefatigably to Copy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Blessed <hi>Example</hi> of our Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> were the certain means for You to prove the greatest Blessings to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein You live; that is, to become Good, as well as Great <hi>Examples</hi> to it: You I mean, many of whom GOD has
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100565:21"/>
placed in so high a rank of Dignity and Honour in this World, that whither You will or no, whatever You do, Your Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise cannot but be a powerful <hi>Example</hi> to others.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in the Name of GOD, let us all raise up our Thoughts, and make our Imitation Aspire and Ascend towards Him, who <hi>is the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>of our Faith;</hi> who <hi>has Ascended on High, and has led Captivity Captive, and has receiv'd Gifts for Men; yea, for the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Rebellious</hi> also; <hi>That the Lord God might</hi> not only teach us by his Doctrine, but <hi>dwell among us</hi> by his Example.</p>
            <p>To this End, we all have, or may have in our Hands this Blessed Book of the New Testament of his Blood. Here only is to be found, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the uncorrupt Original, and native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of his Holy Life and Death. Hence only let us take it, as from a pure and unmixt Fountain. Let us often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100565:21"/>
in our Minds, and Imprint deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this unerring <hi>Idea</hi> of him on our Hearts. Let us incessantly Compare, Measure, Judge of, and Correct all our Thoughts, Words and Actions, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Exactness of this Model.</p>
            <p>As we should always Adore, and Worship all his inimitable Praises and Perfections; so let us also imitate all his imitable Graces. Let us most imitate those of them, that are most fitted to our peculiar Conditions. So let us imitate them altogether, that our Zeal for some of them may not make us averse from any of the rest.</p>
            <p>So let us observe his Mortifications, as not to neglect his Charity. Nor let our Love of his Communicative Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness exclude our Observance of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Institutions. Rather let us care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mingle them all in our practise, as he did in his. As he did, let us harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously joyn the good Duties of Society
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100565:22"/>
with those of Retirement; the private Devotions of Solitude with the Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Virtues of Conversation.</p>
            <p>Thus, in every Step of his irreprova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Life and Death, we shall not fail to meet with something excellent, and most proper for us to trace out, and deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in every Step of ours. When we find him in the Stable, or the Manger, have we not his great Humility? When in the Throngs, and Assemblies of the City, his Mild, Charitable, and Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Behaviour to set before our Eyes? When among Publicans and Sinners, his gentle Gravity, and winning Authority in reproving Wickedness and Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: When with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> his avowed contempt of proud Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and censorious Hypocrisie: When in the Temple, his fervent Zeal: When in his Journeys by Sea or Land, his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about doing good: When alone in the Wilderness, his unaffected Sanctity,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100565:22"/>
and meek Severity: Every where we have his Innocency, his Temperance, his Modesty, his Affability, his Justice, his Mercy and Universal Beneficence.</p>
            <p>But, as this Day most requires, since we have now seen him in his Agony in the Garden; in the Judgment-Hall Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd and Condemn'd; and thenceforth <hi>brought</hi> as a <hi>Lamb to the Slaughter, and as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 53. 7.</note> 
               <hi>a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb, so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not his Mouth;</hi> so meekly, either bearing the Cross himself, or Crucify'd on it: <hi>When he was Reviled, Reviling not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 St. Pet. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>again; When he Suffer'd, Threatning not; but committing himself to him that judgeth Righteously:</hi> And since (according to the Words immediately foregoing my Text) <hi>This is acceptable to God; for even hereunto were</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vers. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>we call'd:</hi> Now particularly let us learn to imitate his Patience, Equanimity, and Long-Suffering; his <hi>forgiving Injuries, and loving Enemies; His Blessing them that Curs'd him; His Praying for them who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100565:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
used him, and Persecuted him;</hi> and lastly, his entire Obedience to the Will of Heaven, express'd in that most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Word of Submission, amidst such ineffable Tortures, <hi>Not as I will, but as Thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we shall thus follow his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Steps to Mount <hi>Calvery,</hi> we shall also shortly follow him to Mount <hi>Olivet:</hi> If we shall thus be Partakers of his Death, <hi>by dying to Sin,</hi> we shall also be Partakers <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> of his Resurrection, <hi>by living to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness here, to Glory hereafter;</hi> Which I beseech Almighty GOD to Grant us all. <hi>Amen.</hi>
