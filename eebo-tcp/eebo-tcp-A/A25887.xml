            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When his favourites came to be ſufferers for his name, he is then wont to viſit them more then at other ſeaſons.

This was <hi>Johns</hi> caſe. Ye have his experiment regiſtred here, <hi>Chap. 1. ver. 9, 10. I John who alſo am your brother, and companion in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, and in the Kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt, was in the Iſle that is called Patmos, for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt; I was in the Spirit on the Lords day.</hi> 'Tis thought that <note place="margin">Engliſh Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. on <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 1.</note> all contained in this book was revealed to him on that one day.

            <p>The more lightſome any thing is, the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the more glorious any thing is, the more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull. <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, ô thou Citie</hi>

               <hi>of God,</hi> ſayth the Pſalmiſt, of the Church: which is therefore a great wonder, becauſe all the Luminaries of heaven concur to the making up of the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and that in a poſture ſutable to the ſtations they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99460:5"/>
hold in the firmament. There the higheſt lights are the ſtars, the loweſt the Moon, the Sun in the midſt. So here; the ſtars are allotted to the Churches head, the Moon to her feet, the Sun to thoſe parts of the body that are between both. She is all over glorious, and conſequently altogether admirable, becauſe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome all over; for her head is crowned with ſtars, her body apparelled with the Sun, and ſhe hath the Moon for her footſtool, ſo as to tread in paths of light.</p>
            <p>If any here diſcern no glory in the Church to be wondred at, but ſay of her, as they of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa. 53. 2. ſhe hath no form or comlineſſe; and when we ſhall ſee her, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire her:</hi> it is not for want of light in her, but of ſpirituall ſight in them. A skilfull painter, to an ignorant man that wondred at his gazing ſo much on a curious peece, ſayd, Friend; <hi>Si meos oculos haberes,</hi> hadſt thou myne eyes, thou wouldſt be raviſhed with the ſight of this picture as I am; and inſtead of wondring at mee, fall a wondring with me. So, if wee had the eyes and ſpirit of <hi>John,</hi> the Church of Chriſt would appear a great wonder to us, as it did to him.
<q>A great wonder in heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We read of a door opened in heaven, and of a call that <hi>John</hi> had to come up thither, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1. That was the Scene of all his Viſions; there did this great wonder appear to his mentall eyes. And well it might, ſeeing, the Church (whoſe hieroglyphick it is) hath her originall from heaven, her tendency to heaven, her converſation in heaven, and her dependance upon heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Her originall from heaven. <hi>Except a man be born</hi>

Mihi patria Coelum,</hi> may be the motto, of every Saint during his pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the World, <hi>Heaven is my Country,</hi> there I was born, and I am returning thither, which is the next thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Her tendency to heaven.

            <p n="4">4 Her dependance upon heaven, knowing as ſhe doth that <hi>every good and perfect gift is from above, Jam.</hi> 1. 17. ſhe accordingly expects from thence ſupplies of grace to help in every time of need.

            <p>Let us now proceed to ſhew more diſtinctly, what this great wonder in heaven was, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>A woman.</q>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a married woman. That's the importance of the word in other places, as in <hi>Chapter</hi> 21 of this book <hi>Verſe 9; Come hither and I will ſhew thee the bride, the Lambs wife,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the decency of the allegory requires it ſhould be ſo taken here, becauſe we finde the woman with childe, and in her travell. Being ſo taken it imports a myſtery, one of the greateſt in all Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſt as her husband. <hi>Paul</hi> who was well skild in Goſpel-ſecrets (to which the depths of other Sciences are but ſhallows) gives the title of <hi>great</hi> only to two Evangelicall myſteries: that of our Saviours incarnation, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. laſt. Without controverſie, great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> and this of the Churches mariage to Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ. 5. 31, 32 For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and mother, and ſhall be joyned unto his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeake concerning Chriſt and the Church.</hi> That which was one of <hi>Pauls</hi> great myſteries, might well be part of <hi>Johns</hi> great wonder. But I forbeare to inlarge upon't, becauſe I haſten to a diſcovery of this womans rare perfections; the firſt whereof is her being
<q>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99460:7"/>
Clothed with the Sun.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That which ſome <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay hath ſavour in it, <hi>Lumen eſt umbra Dei, Deus eſt lumen luminis.</hi> The light is but the ſhadow of God, God is he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth light it ſelfe. Now of all viſible lights there is none ſo radiant as the Sun: Scripture accordingly ſtyleth God <hi>a Sun and a ſhield, Pſal.</hi> 84. 11. and Chriſt is called <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſſe, Mal.</hi> 4. 2. He it is, and no other perſon or thing, whom we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Sun in my Text. The reſemblances are many. Chriſt and the Sun agree.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In point of Sovereignty. The Sun is the Prince of Planets; a body ſo glorious that all admire, many adore it for a God, becauſe they ſee more Majeſty in it, then any thing elſe that can be ſeen. Whence it is, that the idolatrous <hi>Chaldeans</hi> (as <hi>Bodin</hi> obſerves) gave <note place="margin">Bodin. theatr. Natur. lib. 5. p. 617.</note> it the name of <hi>Baal</hi> a Lord; whereas the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> with whom were the Oracles of God, call it <hi>Shemes,</hi> which ſignifieth a ſervant; for ſo it is to him that made it. Chriſt tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, but is indeed the Lord of all. And as God made <hi>the Sun to rule by day,</hi> and to diverſifie ſeaſons of the year <note place="margin">Pſal. 136. 8.</note> by its approches and receſſes: So hath the Father appointed Chriſt to be King of Saints; and upon his various aſpects depend the Churches Summer and <note place="margin">Revel. 15. 3.</note> Winter, the ſouls Spring and Fall, the ſeed-time of grace and harveſt of glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In point of ſingularity. There is but one Sun in the firmament, which made that great Conquerour ſay, <hi>The heaveus could neither bear two Suns, nor the earth two Alexanders.</hi> Looke to Chriſts perſon, it is <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> but one; although there be two natures in him. When the light which was created the firſt day, did, as it were,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99460:7"/>
aſſume a ſtar three dayes after, that ſtar and the light made but one Sun; ſo when the Word, who was God from all eternity, aſſumed fleſh, in fulneſſe of time the Word and fleſh made but one Chriſt. Looke to his office, he is ſo a Mediatour, as not to admit of any copartnerſhip in the work. <hi>To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things and wee by him,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 6. <hi>One God, and one Mediatour between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>Is Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided?</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> elſwhere. We may ſay, is Jeſus multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed? <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 13.</note> No verily: As but one Sun, ſo but one Saviour. <hi>None but Chriſt</hi> (as the Martyr cryed) <hi>None but Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 In point of neceſſity. When men would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the removall of ſomwhat abſolutely neceſſary, they uſe to ſay, this were <hi>Solem è mundo tollere,</hi> to take the Sun out of the World. If that were removed, how would all beauty vaniſh, and (as ſome think) all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſe? The potters wheele (ſay they) could not turn upon earth, if the Sun ſhould not move in heaven. So take Chriſt from a ſoul, 'tis impotent to all good, <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing, John</hi> 15. 5. Were it not for the Sun it would be perpetuall night in the world, notwithſtanding all the torches that could be lighted; yea notwithſtanding all the light of the moon and ſtars. It is neither the torch-light of naturall parts and creature-comforts; nor the ſtar-light of civill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and common gifts; nor the moon-light of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary faith and formall profeſſion, that can make it day in the ſoul, till the Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſe and ſhine there. Once indeed there was a time, when fruits were produced without a Sun; when God, to prevent the idolizing of this creature as the only cauſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99460:8"/>
of all fertility, enabled the earth to bring forth on the third day, whereas the Sun was not made till the fourth: But never was there any the leaſt moment of time ſince the fall, wherein man could bring forth fruit to God without the cooperation of Chriſt. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that hath not the Son hath not life, 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 12. Neither can any vitall action be performed but by his ſpecial grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In point of purity. Other creatures admit of ſome defiling mixtures, the ſun doth not. It looks upon filth, but contracts none. Chriſt is <hi>a lambe without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and without ſpot.</hi> Such as caſt aſperſions upon <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> him in the dayes of his fleſh, calling him glutton, wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber, and friend of Publicans and ſinners, did but act the mad mans part, throwing dirt at the Sun, which none could poſſibly faſten upon. He came indeed into a ſinfull world, but as a Phyſitian among his ſick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, to cure them without taking the ſickneſſe of them, being antidoted by his Divinity againſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. He hath an hand even in ſinfull acts; as they are acts <hi>(for in him we move)</hi> but not in the ſinfulneſſe of them: ſhines into the noyſome dunghils of our <note place="margin">Acts 17. 28.</note> hearts with beams of grace, yet continues moſt pure. He was borne of a ſinner, lived and converſed with ſinners, dyed with and for ſinners, yea as a ſinner, yet had not in himſelfe the leaſt ſin of his own to anſwer for.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In point of ſufficiencie. There is in the Son a fulneſſe of created glory. All the light that had been diſperſt throughout the great fabrick of the new-born world for the firſt three dayes, was gathered together on the fourth into that one body. So <hi>it pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that all fulneſſe ſhould dwell in Chriſt:</hi> And the <note place="margin">Col. 1. 19.</note>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99460:8"/>
ſeuerall graces that ſhined in the Patriarks, Fathers and Prophets of old under the Law, were all to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="6">6 In point of efficiency. The efficacy of the Sun appears in imparting three things, Light, Heat, and Influence,. Each whereof is ſo qualified, as to reſemble the grace of Chriſt in ſundry particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Sun imparts light, a diſcovering, guiding, cheering, growing light.</p>

               </gap> of the only true God, and of their Redeemer; we ſhould never know either our ſins or our duties, our dangers or our priviledges but for Chriſt. With him only is <hi>the fountain of life, and in his light we ſee light.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 36 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Guiding. <hi>Luke 1. 78, 79. The day-ſpring from in high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi> The dim light of nature in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people ſhines a little, but is not ſtrong enough to guide, like that of a gloworm or rotten ſtick. The light of worldly wiſdome and policie in men of great
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99460:9"/>
parts, but prophane ſpirits ſhines more ſtrongly, but miſguides; like the meteor, which Philoſophers call <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> we the Lanternman. There is a third kind of light that ſhines ſtrongly, and guides too, but the head only, not the feet; I mean that of hypocrites, who contemplate things of God, but reduce not their brain knowledge to practice. Yea a fourth, that guides both head and feet, yet but into a way of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; namely that wherewith they are enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who have a forme of godlineſſe, but deny the power of it: whereas this, we are ſpeaking of, doth not only ſhine but guide, not the head only but the feet, and that not into the way of formality, but of faith, which is the only way of peace both with God and with conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Cheering. <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 7. truly light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun.</hi> How ſweet are the diſcoveries made by Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſouls! what a pleaſant thing is it for ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eyes to behold the Sun of righteouſneſſe, moving and ſhining in the ſpirit of a convert, as in its own proper Spheare! Such as are darke are accounted melancholy rooms: well may they be melancholy ſouls that want the cheering light of Chriſt. But <hi>bleſſed is the people</hi> Pſal. 89. 15. <hi>that know the joyfull ſound; they ſhall walke, O Lord, in the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi> We may invert it, and ſay, Bleſſed are the people, O Lord, that walke in the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; they ſhall know the joyfull ſound: they ſhall enjoy a continuall jubilee in their hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Growing. It increaſeth more and more from breake of day, and is in this reſpect a fit emblem of that grace which Chriſt communicates to his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99460:9"/>
members, the nature whereof is to be growing till it come to arrive at perfection. That in <hi>Eſay 8. 20. To the Law and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light</hi> (no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) <hi>in them,</hi> intimates a remarkable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">

               </note> the knowledge of Saints and Hypocrites; the former is like the morning light, <hi>that ſhines more and more to the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4. 18. <hi>But evill men and ſeducers</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> foretold) <hi>waxe worſe and worſe;</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond place, the ſun imparts Heat, a melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inflaming, quickning heat.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Melting. When the ſurface of the water is glaz'd with ice, the Sun-beams diſſolve it. The grace of Chriſt hath a like operation upon frozen hearts; which are never truly melted into contrition but by Evangelicall beams. The Law, like a hammer, may breake ice in peeces; but what remaynes is ice ſtill: the Goſpell diſſolves it into water; 'tis no longer ice then. <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn,</hi> Zech. 12. 10. No ſuch kindly mourners, as they that have hearts melted with Chriſts heat, and heated with ſenſe of Chriſts love.

            <p n="2">2 Inflaming. The Sun-beams falling upon a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe create a fire. So doth the Spirit of Chriſt (who is therefore called <hi>a ſpirit of burning,</hi> Iſa. 4. 4.) when hee falls upon the ſpirit of man. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us, while hee talked with us by the way, and while hee opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> Luke

            <p n="3">3 Quickning. Some creatures have no other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the ſun, nor other mother but the ſlime. This perhaps is one reaſon why the ſun is compared to a bridegroom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. becauſe his beams are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lificall. The grace of Chriſt is ſo much more, <hi>the laſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. <hi>hee that hath the ſon hath life,</hi> 1 John 5. 12. yea, a double life (for no leſſe will ſerve his turn) the one of righteouſneſſe, all being naturally dead in law by reaſon of guilt; the other of holineſſe, all being dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, till quickned by him, the end of whoſe comming was <hi>that we might have life, &amp; that we might have it more abundantly,</hi> Joh. 10. 10.</p>
            <p>A third thing, which the Sun communicates, is its influence; the ſtrength, and univerſality whereof are conſiderable here, we have an intimation of both, Pſal. 19, 4, 5, 6. <hi>In the heavens hath God ſet a taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for the Sun; which is as a bridegroom comming out of his chamber, and rejoyces as a ſtrong man to run his race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven; and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99460:10"/>
1. It is a ſtrong influence, as may be evidenced by the Suns concocting of ſuch ſolid bodies, as gold and precious ſtones are, in places that are ſo remote from his owne ſpheare. Were not the influence of Chriſt exceeding forcible, how could it poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie crooked, purifie filthy, ſoften hard, and rayſe dead ſouls, as it uſeth to do, all on the ſodain? 'Tis <note place="margin">Fortiter, ſed ſuaviter.</note> true indeed, that the operations of his grace are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably ſweet; but it is no leſſe true, that they are withall incomparably ſtrong. To make uſe of the Pſalmiſts Metaphores; Our Lord Jeſus, in reſpect of the former, may be ſaid to come as a bridegroom out of his chamber, clothing himſelf with all ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of cariage on his wedding day: of the latter, to rejoyce as a ſtrong man to run a race, bearing down whatever oppoſeth him in the way.</p>
            <p n="2">2 'Tis univerſall. No viſible creature but ſhares more or leſſe in the benefits of this influence. So Chriſt being <hi>the light that lightneth every one that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as the ſun hath different operations upon different objects, <hi>e. g.</hi> wax and clay, ſoftning the one, hardning the other; a chicken and a toad, increaſing the wholſomneſſe of the one, the poiſon of the other: ſo upon ſeverall men within the pale of a viſible Church, Chriſt preached to all hath ſeverall works. Some are made ſofter, ſome harder; the ſpirits of fome are ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Miniſtery of the Goſpell, of others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered.

            <p>I beleeve you expect ſome application of what hath bin already delivered, before we cloſe with the ſecond verſe; and will therefore briefly infer ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, firſt from the whole viſion, then from the womans ſeverall perfections, and laſtly from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thoſe perfections.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Inferences from the whole viſion. Which are two.</p>

            <p n="2">2 That the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> differs much from the woman in my Text; the Apoſtaticall Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Apoſtolicall Church of Chriſt: As not being clothed with the Sun, but with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp, <hi>Revel. 17. 4.

            <p n="3">3 Inferences from the order of theſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That men will never contemne the world till they have learned to put on Chriſt. The woman is firſt clothed with the Sun, then gets the Moon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet, not till then. The world taſtes bitter to a ſoule that hath got the reliſh of Chriſt, and is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">Cui incipi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> only to ſuch as know him not. The ſtars that ſhine with ſome luſtre all the night, when the ſun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the morning hide their heads and appear not, being ſo out-ſhined, as to be obſcured by that more glorious light. Such are all worldly excellencies to a ſoule wherein Chriſt is riſen. A man can then ſlight the things, for which he formerly valued himſelfe. To <hi>Zacheus</hi> gold is not the ſame thing after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and before it. Now he makes reſtitution, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99460:19"/>
cares not how little hee leave himſelfe, ſo he be not left by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That men will never prize the Goſpel as their Crown, till they have learned to contemne the world. The Moons being under the womans feet, goes before her having a crown of twelve ſtars upon her head. Thoſe in the parable who had no minde to come to the marriage ſupper, but deſired to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, <note place="margin">Luke 14. 13, 19, 20.</note> fetch all their excuſes from worldly affairs. That in <hi>Pſal. 119. 36. Incline my heart unto thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and not to covetouſneſſe,</hi> implies that an heart inclined to covetouſneſſe will never give the Oracles of God their due eſteem. <hi>Luther,</hi> who gloried in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ventured all for it, is reported to have profeſt that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as tempted by Satan to that ſin. The Pope tryed to win him by money (which it ſeems was more rhen the Devill had done) but upon tryall made, the anſwer which his agents returned was, <note place="margin">Germana haec beſtia non curat aurum.</note>

            <p>Hitherto of the firſt Verſe. Come we now to that other part of the deſcription, which concerns the Churches weake and perillous condition, laid down in the ſecond.
<q>And ſhee being with child, cryed travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered</q>
            </p>
            <p>Where there is a kinde of gradation, the ſteps whereof will help to bound, and likewiſe to metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize our diſcourſe, after this manner. Shee is with childe, her being with childe introduceth a travell; that travailing is attended with pains, thoſe pains force her to cry.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The woman was with childe. This Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99460:19"/>
being the laſt peece of Scripture, hath a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the former canonicall books, well nigh in all the paſſages of it. Moſt of the phraſes in this chapter ſeem to be alluſions, either to the ſtory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as related by <hi>Moſes;</hi> or of Chriſt as reported by the Evangeliſts. For example, the womans crying may looke back to the dolefull cry of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by reaſon of bondage; her flying into the deſart and nouriſhment there, to the wilderneſſe into which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was led, and where Manna was ſent them from heaven to feed upon. Her being delivered of a man-childe, to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s bringing forth of Chriſt; being watched by a Dragon ready to devoure her childe, to <hi>Herods</hi> lying in wait to murther Chriſt, the childs being caught up to God and his Throne, to our Saviours Aſcention, and ſitting at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. In conformity to which notions it may be ſaid, that as the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt, when ſhe had been over-ſhadowed with the Holy Ghoſt; ſo when the Spirit came down at Pentecoſt upon the Apoſtles, the Primitive Church fell with childe. The words are <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2 This being with child brought her in time unto her travell, which conſiſted partly in the pious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of zealous Chriſtians to bring in others to <note place="margin">Naſcitur indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne per quem non naſcitur alter.</note> Chriſt, (it being a principle with ſuch, that he walkes unanſwerably to his new-birth, who doth not deſire

            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Her travell was accompanyed with ſore pains, which were increaſed by the oppoſition ſhee met withall from two ſorts of men, Perſecutors and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. That which aroſe from the one ſort was more violent, that which came from the other more fraudulent; but both exceeding dolorous. The former had more of the Lyon in it, that terme Scripture puts upon Tyrants; <hi>Jer. 4. 7. The Lyon is come up from his thicket, and the deſtroyer of the Gentiles is on his way;</hi> the latter more of the Fox, which is the name given to ſeducers, <hi>Cant. 2. 15. Take us the Foxes.</hi> Satan in the one ſhewed himſelfe a Dragon, and a Serpent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99460:20"/>
in the other. Lion and Fox, Dragon and Serpent, all conſpire to inlarge the Churches ſorrows.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Being thus in paine ſhee could not hold from crying out;</p>
            <p n="1">1 To God in her prayers. As <hi>Acts</hi> 4. from the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Verſe</hi> to the 31. <hi>They lift up their voyce to God with one accord, and ſaid, Lord, thou art God, &amp;c.

And now, Lord, behold their threatnings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 To men in her Apologies. Thoſe of <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, thoſe of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian</hi> and others afterwards, what were they elſe but the cryes of this woman, travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered? This may ſuffice for a briefe explication of the words.</p>
            <p>The way to improve them in this Auditory will be to accommodate theſe materials to the State of things among our ſelves.</p>
            <p>AFter ſome overtures of a <hi>Match</hi> in the Reign of <note place="margin">Applicat.</note> King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> the Reformed Church in this Kingdome was ſolemnly <hi>marryed</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, when the Scepter was ſwayed by <hi>Edward the Sixth:</hi> that godly young Prince (as became the Bridegrooms friend) rejoycing greatly becauſe of the Bridegrooms voice. The famous nine and thirty <hi>Articles</hi> of her <hi>Confeſsion</hi> then framed, were an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigne of her <hi>being with child,</hi> and that a thorow <hi>Reformation</hi> was then <hi>conceived,</hi> though but concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Many and fore were the <hi>breeding fits</hi> ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99460:21"/>
with in <hi>Queene Mary's</hi> days, and ſuch as gave occaſion to fear that ſhe would have <hi>miſcarried.</hi> But God ſent her eaſe from heaven under the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Princes: in which condition ſhe went on for a long while, drawing ſtill neerer and <hi>neerer her time.</hi> Six yeers agoe, after this Parliament had ſate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while it was generally believed that ſhee was <hi>falſe into her travell.</hi> And, in the midſt of all thoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which have befaln <hi>England</hi> ſince, her friends encouraged themſelves with this hope, that the <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> and <hi>ſharper</hi> her <hi>pains</hi> grew, the liker ſhee was to be ſpeedily <hi>delivered of that man-child,</hi> which was by them ſo greedily expected. But, behold, as if all theſe had been but fore-runners of <hi>her labour,</hi> not <hi>bearing-throws,</hi> ſhe continues ſtill <hi>in pain:</hi> inſomuch as they now begin to think ſhee has not <hi>gone her full time,</hi> and earneſtly to deſire ſhee may; becauſe they feare nothing more than an <hi>abortive Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, evident it is, not only that her pains are multiplyed, but that they are cauſed, partly by the malignity of her enemies, who have embroyled her in a bloudy Civill War, and thereby given her occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to breath out the Prophets complaint, <hi>Jer. 4. 19, 20. My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noyſe in mee, I cannot hold my peace, becauſe thou haſt heard, ô my ſoul, the ſound of the trumpet, the alarm of War. Deſtruction upon deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is cryed, for the whole land is ſpoyled.</hi> Partly from the animoſities and diſagreement of her members, then which nothing is more dolorous to quiet ſpirits.

May it never come to be upon you; may you never come to be partakers of other mens ſins in ſo high a degree.

            <p n="3">3 Encourage the woman in her travell, as <hi>Rachels</hi> midwife once did, <hi>Gen 35. 16, 17. Rachel travelled, and ſhe had hard labour, and it came to paſſe when ſhee was in hard labour, that the midwife ſayd unto her, fear not, thou ſhalt have this ſon alſo.</hi> Shee had born <hi>Joſeph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now the midwife puts her in hope of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> We have already through the unſpeakable bleſſing of God upon your Counſels and Forces, obteined deliverance from a mighty adverſe power, that would have ruined us. Reformation is that which we are now groaning for: what ſatisfaction would it give to heare you ſaying to <hi>England, Fear not, thou ſhalt have this ſon alſo?</hi> The Church (as I intimated before) is ſayd to travell in the labour of thoſe, her agents, that are called to employments of the greateſt moment and difficulty; ſuch are Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and to the firſt of theſe ſorts it belongs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the other two. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and it may be obſerved, that there is mention twice made of his ſpeaking comfortably to certain perſons, 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 22. Hezekiah ſpake comfortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the Lord:</hi> And again, <hi>Chap. 32. 6. He ſet Captains of War over the people, and gathered them together, and ſpake comfortably to them.</hi> If our faithfull and valiant Souldiers have not received due encouragement, let them have it, I beſeech you, to the full: and let mee have leave to ſpeake a few words in behalfe of our godly Miniſters; whoſe aſſiſtance (how uſeleſs ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may be accounted in other affairs) cannot be ſpared in Eccleſiaſticall Reformations. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but by the concurrence of

There is therefore need that both our hands ſhould be employed in doing good. Now the two hands of a Chriſtian Kingdom are the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry thereof. The buſineſſe of Reformation cals for both. As we commonly uſe our hands for the waſhing and cleanſing of each other. So if the Miniſter be extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, the Magiſtrate may correct him; then the right hand waſheth the left: If the Magiſtrate doe amiſſe, the Miniſter may admoniſh him, then the left hand clenſeth the right. But he that makes uſe of one hand to cut off the other with, deſtroys his body: ſuch would our condition be, if either Miniſters ſhould ſuffer the Magiſtracy to be cryed down; or Magiſtrates permit the Miniſtry to be debaſed. Scripture and experience bid us hope, that <hi>Amalek</hi> ſhall then be foyled, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevail, when faith in Chriſt, and zeal for truth ſhall ſupport both theſe hands, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> did thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> upon the mount.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for a concluſion of all, let the prayer of faith be of greateſt activity when the woman is found to be in greateſt extremity. Time was when things were at ſuch a paſſe even with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>a day of trouble, rebuke and
