            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ingenious Gentleman Dr. J. B.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Doctor,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am heartily glad that a Person of your Learning
and Parts has taken up the Cudgels against the whole
College of Physicians; and notwithstanding your
great Modesty have <hi>set your Face</hi> against so Learned and
Ingenious a Society. I must confess, I have a prety
good stock of Confidence my self, and perhaps dare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
any single Person whatever, nay even Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but to attack such a Body of Men of Learning and
Sense, I must yield is a Task only fit for your Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who I dare boldly say can rail as bluntly as any
Oyster-Wench at <hi>Billingsgate.</hi> Therefore as you have
began to make 'um appear a parcel of Sots, and perjured
Villains (as your witty Queries seem to import) I beg
the Favour of you to go on <hi>without any Consideration</hi> (as you
have done already) and perhaps in time you may prove
'um all Whores, and Rogues, Vagabonds, Persons that
had neither Fathers, or Mothers, and what not? For if
any can prove it, I believe it must be you, no Body else
daring to attempt to prove Matters of so great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
because they want your Learning and Knowledg
to go through with it. Take only this Caution, <hi>Dear
Doctor,</hi> in the Management of your Affairs: Let not the
Multitude of Business distract your Regular Thoughts
(your Head being a little out of order sometime) lest
you grow apt to forget what you have said of 'um be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:104358:3"/>
and as you have in the Lump call'd 'um a parcel of
Perjur'd Villians, so don't publickly talk and <hi>say that the're
about 10, or 12 Honest Fellows amongst 'um.</hi> This w'ont do
my Friend; to say they are <hi>all Rogues,</hi> and some of that
<hi>All</hi> are honest Men, is a little Illogical, neither doth it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
much of an University Education, thô it may suit
well enough perhaps with Yours. The Irish Evidence
that ignorantly swore a Person of Quality into the Popish
Plot, thought he could make no juster Retaliation to him
than by swearing of him out again. Now if you intend
to follow the steps of this worthy Evidence, and as you
have stigmatized the Fellows of the College with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of hard Names, so to make 'um amends you will
endeavour to give 'um as good Characters as Moral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
and Christianity obliges you to do; I think you
propose a fair method of Reconciliation, and perhaps even
against their own Inclinations, out of meer Compassion,
and not respect to your Merit, they may vouchsafe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you into their Society. This Advice, my Friend, I
think is very seasonable, and were I a Member of the
Colledge I would endeavour all I could to procure your
Admittance upon your Submission: but if you will still
continue in an obstinate and perverse Humour of railing,
I think you will justly forfeit that good Opinion which
Indifferent Judges have of the Hardship of your Case (if
any such there were) and be fit only to be bray'd in that
necessary Instrument of your former Profession, a Mortar.
These are the real Sentiments of,</p>

                  <p>I mind no Plots not I, but a Plot to get good store
of Patients, if I can, but I think they never were so Healthy.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>So, what? you seem to speak a little concern'd, and look
as if something had vexed you, what's the Matter Doctor?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Matter?</speaker>
                  <p>Let me tell you, Mr. <hi>Trueman,</hi> I have been a
Physician in <hi>London</hi> almost Forty Years, and I never knew so
little Business to do in all my Life-Time. 'Tis a <hi>Damnable
Healthy</hi> Town grown since I knew it first. I have known the
Time when I could go out and pick up 10 or 12 <hi>l.</hi> in a Morning,
come Home to Dinner and empty'd, so out again after to Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104358:4"/>
But I am sure the Times now are so hard that if my
good Father had not conveniently step'd aside, I could no more
have brag'd of living by my Wit, as some Men do, than the
D—s of <hi>N</hi>—can of her Chastity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray Doctor, not too severe. Why Damnable Healthy?
Do you wish the Nation a Plague, or an Epidemick Sickness,
purely to promote your own private Interest? Such Expressions,
methinks, become not Men of your Education, nor indeed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
much of Religion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
                  <p>What do you talk of that to a Physician? I thought you
had known the World better than so. Is not every Body for
their own Interest, be Religion what it will? Do's not the
greatest Pretenders to Holiness cheat with <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> as oft
(if not oftner) as he that says <hi>Dam me it cost me so much,</hi>
when he knows that he Lies at the same time he Swears? and
all this to promote a Trade. All the Excuse being, <hi>a Man must
live,</hi> Customers always expect some Abatement of what we ask.
Nay I have known an Apothecary set down 4 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> for a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Bolus, when it has been about a Farthing-worth of
Crabs-Eyes in a little <hi>London</hi>-Treacle.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, Doctor, that may be. That's 4 <hi>s.</hi> for the Word Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick,
and 6 <hi>d.</hi> for the Bolus. Pretty cheap on my Word. But
this is not to the purpose to explain what you mean by Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Healthy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, Sir, are you always teazing me to explain my
meaning? Then if you will have it, I'll tell you. You know
that every Body wishes well to themselves; now Health is the
greatest Enemy to our Interest and Profit that can be.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>But ye take care sometimes to subdue that Enemy of

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
                  <p>Good Mr. <hi>Trueman</hi> don't make Reflections upon our
Profession, when the Apothecaries after a long Siege have bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
down the Walls, then the World says we destroy'd the
Town; what reason is there in this?</p>

                  <p>Troth very little, I confess, if it be so; but however I

                  <p>No, no. But to go on. I call that Damnable Health
(thô I know it bears another Sense) when the Sickness is not
great enough to require the skill of a Physician, but every igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Apothecary assumes the Cure, and pretends to know more
than the learned'st Physician of us all.</p>

Peoples Health? Would you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, but I would, by all means, only let 'um do their part
in their own Sphere, and within their own Limits or Bounds.
For when Men have no lawful Authority to Act, that Action
may be call'd Damnable, that is, such an Action as may justly
be condemned by all Wise-men. Now 'tis plain that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries
have no lawful Commission to do what they do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and consequently they may be justly condemn'd for doing
such an Action. So that if the Patient dies under such an one's
Hands, the Law judges him a bold Empyrick; and all Men
of Reason, the Patient a Fool, especially if he were able to pay.</p>

this Nicety of examining Words alone; I see you are angry
with the Apothecaries for invading your Province. However,
you have one Comfort left that your Good Father Broke, and
left you an Estate.</p>

Doctors but those who have regularly done their Exercises for
Physick in one of our Universities; that's plain. But hold a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

Now I know he will be blooded by no Body else; I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him that all the Surgeons are Blunderers, as to Bleeding.
Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> is a Good-natur'd Gentleman. He believes that
no Body understands the curing a Disease, or an Ulcer, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any Thing, but an Apothecary. Faith he is one of the
honestest Gentlemen in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>You make him a fine Gentleman indeed. Honest! For
no other reason as I see but because he suffers himself to be
made a Fool of by such as you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Mr. <hi>Trueman,</hi> assure your self, he's a Man of very
good Sense: All the Apothecaries in Town say so, and then I
am sure it must be true. He pays well, and takes Physick free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
besides I particularly know his Constitution: after Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he must take a Purge or two, then some Cordial Powders,
Dulcifiers of the Blood, and two or three odd Things more,
But as I was saying, this Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> has a Vein as fine, and as
small as the finest Silk you can imagine: I'll tell you what I did
to learn to let him Blood, I took a fine, nay super-fine Cobweb,
and pick'd out of it one of the smallest Filaments, or Threads I
could find: This Filament or Thread of the Cobweb, as I told
you, I lay upon a convenient place, as I remember upon a
piece of white Paper, then I took my Lancet, and without the
least Hesitation, divided it soquickly, all the whole length, to
the great Admiration of the Standers by, that—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>This was very admirable indeed, and almost like the
Virtuoso's learning first to swim on a Table in order to swim in
the Water. But suppose this true, do's this make you a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

                  <p>O, Sir, I hear you: But I sate up late last Night, and
am a little Drowsy. But I heard you say you were a Man of

still how do's this make you a Surgeon? You may as well say

My two Acquaintance! Hah! Hah! Hah! a pretty Mistake!—
but true enough: For a Man must be acquainted with his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness

(I thank our kind Stars) had ever less Encouragement; if you
but profess your self an Apothecary, and then undertake any

you are an Able Doctor, and a Good Surgeon, at any time.</p>

                  <p>Faith, Mr. <hi>Trueman,</hi> they generally are. I my self
have turn'd out several Doctors out of Families, because they
would not prescribe Physick <hi>plentifully,</hi> and in large Quantities.
I have perswaded my Patients, that they did not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their Distemper; so have brought in another who has
<hi>swingingly dos'd 'um.</hi> I could tell you of a Sir <hi>Harry</hi> that paid
an 100 <hi>l.</hi> for Physick in six Weeks, and I accepted it, being a
Friend, without requiring one Penny for my own Fees.—You
don't know the Mystery of Trade.</p>

                  <p>In plain English, I know not what you call Mystery,
but I now know the Roguery of that Doctor and you too.
What an 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 6 Weeks? Bless me, what did she take?
I believe she swallow'd Guinea's made into Bullets for the
Gripes, so discharg'd 'um again for the Gold-finders. For I

to hear the Apothecary brag of his Skill in
Surgery and Physick; I could not imagine what he had to set
up with, but a large stock of Impudence: I know all his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
in his Shop did not cost above Fifty Pound, and in Six
Weeks Time has he made an hundred Pound of one part of it?
Such Reflections as these wou'd make a Man burn his Books,
and curse the Gentility of his Education. It seems indeed
wonder to me, that so many Gentlemen who serve in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and have oft-times many Younger Sons to provide for,
do not find out a way to suppress these griping Empyricks, and
Quacks, that their Children may be the better able to support
themselves in a Genteel Profession, answerable to the Expence
they have been at in their Education. In troth 'tis a thing
worthy Consideration.</p>

                  <p>Truly, Doctor, I am of your Opinion, but in such
Points our English Gentlemen of what Sect soever are generally
of the same Temper with those they call Church of <hi>England</hi>-Men,
that is, <hi>lazy and slow in prosecuting a Publick Interest, but
active enough to promote their own private Advantage.</hi> And this,
to give you but one Instance, is evident enough in the Choice
of a Parliament-Man, where the active Dissenter generally gets
the Day, because the lazy Church-Man won't stir to manage a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104358:9"/>
Publick Cause and choose honest Representatives, tho' his own
private Interest may be often promoted by the assistance of such
a Publick Friend.</p>

                  <p>Why I'll tell you now. Some of them took their
Degrees at <hi>Leyden,</hi> some at <hi>Padua,</hi> some at <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> some in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> others incorporated at <hi>Cambridg,</hi> or Commenced
Doctors, as an Honour conferred on them, being in the Retinue
of some Great Person, as Ambassador, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all these
<hi>in reality</hi> are <hi>no Doctors;</hi> and consequently every Member of
the College that is such cannot rightly be called Doctor.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not, good Mr. <hi>Gallypot,</hi> is not a Doctor of Physick
bred in Foreign Universities as much a Doctor as one bred at
our Universities? As to their Titles I see no Difference.</p>

                  <speaker>Gallyp.</speaker>

to be educated regularly in one of our own Universities, and so
Commence Doctor in One's Turn.</p>

                  <speaker>Gallyp.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Sir, I say they are not properly Doctors. For
then an Apothecary, or Farrier may go to <hi>Leyden</hi> a Year or
two, come afterwards to that <hi>free and unquestioning</hi> University
of <hi>Cambridg</hi> to be dubb'd Doctor, and straightway be admitted
into the College of Physicians.</p>

                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>I suppose you mean by <hi>properly Doctors,</hi> such Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as you require, they want. Else I should (as in other
Cases) think they were properly so. For a Church is properly
a Church, so and so Built, and Consecrated. And a Logger-head
arguing very silly is properly a Logger-head. Besides I
doubt such Remarks come Home upon your Self.</p>

Surgeon of Note will have 120 <hi>l.</hi> or more, an Apothecary 50 <hi>l.</hi>

made a pretty handsome Ulcer. Then I Blister'd him, and

Let's put him upon the proof of any one Apothecary in Town.
If he should at last prove it, why 'tis but one Maungy-Hound

                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, <hi>Tom,</hi> my Advice to a Patient is as soon as he is
Ill, to send for some Doctor of the Lower Rank, of whose
Learning and Skill in Physick he has an Opinion; and in case
he grow worse, to send for one of greater Fame, Reputation,
and Vogue in the World to joyn in Consult: For the Diligence
of the one, who has less Fame, and Vogue in the World (tho'
perhaps equal in Learning and Skill really, tho' not thought so
in the Eye of the World) may, and oft do's make amends for the
supposed greater Skill of the other Physitian, by which means
the Patient may more reasonably, and upon juster grounds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Cure. Besides the Hurry, and Multitude of Business
that distracts the Heads of Men in great Practice, and makes
'um either forget what they did formerly in the like Cases, or
at least write but cursorily, and as they say, iust for their Fee,
would by this means be a little tempered; and by the constant
Attendance and Observation of the Diligent Physician, the
supposed Great Man may be put in mind of using some
more proper Medicines for the Patient, which perhaps he
would otherwise forget. These, Gentlemen, are my real
Sentiments.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T. Gallyp.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, Master, I like your Discourse very well,
seeing you make no Remarks on Apothecaries. Besides perhaps
it may open Peoples Eyes to employ me the sooner, for tho' I
am an Old Apothecary, I am but a Young Doctor. For I visit
in either Capacity, either as an Old Apothecary, which is as
good as a Young Doctor, or as a Young Doctor, and that's as
good as t'other again.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>But I thought you had left off Shop, and stuck only to
your Doctorship.</p>

                  <speaker>T. Gallyp.</speaker>
                  <p>What. Sir, I believe you heard me jest a little

                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, I'll say nothing to you about your Degree, for to
me you are an Apothecary still, and no other; to you as such,
and to ye all I direct my Speech, 'tis my Opinion that ye all
ought to be forced to take moderate Prizes, and be content
with honest Gains.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>So we are: What wou'd you propose?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>In Troth, Mr. <hi>Pestle,</hi> my Proposal will signify but
little I know; but were I to advise the Law-makers, they
should make a Law that no Apothecaries Bills should be
paid till first Taxed by Two or more Doctors, appointed
in every District, or Division, in and about the City of
<hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very fine indeed: How is that Practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not? as well as the Attorney's Bills by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonotories.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>That's only when the Client thinks himself over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>So should this be, when the Patient thinks himself
over-rated in Medicines. This would prevent the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Cheats put upon the Patient oft, and be decided
without the unnecessary Suits of Law. I am well assured
that very oft 'tis cheaper to see a Doctor and pay you for
Medicines, than employ one of ye as Doctor and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
too.</p>

                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>Very fine again: You, and your Politicks, You
wou'd make the Doctors our Governours, wou'd you? Good
Mr. <hi>Trueman,</hi> we beg you Excuse, we are His Majesty's
Free-born Subjects. And after all, pray, Mr. <hi>Trueman,</hi> How
do the Doctors understand to make Medicines? How do
they understand the Prices of Drugs? Puh! you talk you
know not what. Come, let's leave him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pestle,</hi> by your leave a little. How did all the
Apothecaries learn to make Medicines at first? 'Tis very
probable that Men of Learning, Study and Industry (such
which the World has call'd Physicians) first found out the
use of Herbs, Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Out of these, proportionably
mixed, formed Compound Medicines; and their Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
taught the Apothecaries the general use of these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines:
Which made the Apothecaries use <hi>these Weapons
first formed against all Diseases</hi> (as I beg leave to call 'um)
<hi>peculiarly against the First Inventor,</hi> to destroy him Root
and Branch if possible. Like the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi>
who thought it good Policy (tho 'twas neither Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
nor Christianity) to destroy the Natives wholly; to
make the Possession of their Countrey more quiet and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
The Gentility of their Profession, I confess, has
been a great hindrance to them in reaping those Advantages
as they might (and with more Honesty than any of ye) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have done.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>E'en let 'um be Genteel still. I don't think 'um
indeed such Fools, as that they cannot make Medicines if they
will; but why can't they keep their Learning and Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to themselves, and let us alone?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>O, Sir, I am glad you allow 'um to be capable of
learning to make Medicines if they please. Now, Mr. <hi>Pestle,</hi>
to tell you the plain Truth, I hear they have actually made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
good Medicines at the College, and continue so to
do; neither do I think it so very difficult to understand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104358:16"/>
making Compound Medicines, and prizing of them: For
if I know the Price of every Simple, sure 'tis very easy
for me to guess what the whole Mass cost, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a farther Calculation tell you what an Ounce, half
an Ounce, or a Dram of that Mass may be sold for: Thus I
have made it plain that they can make Medicines, and prize
'um too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pestle.</speaker>
                  <p>How can they tell tho' when a Medicine is good?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tr.</speaker>
                  <p>Very easy, Mr. <hi>Pestle,</hi> they have taste, and sight to
judge by as well as ye, by which they discern the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Simples that make every Compound, and the Goodness
also of that Compound. Besides, if ever they have bought
good out of your Shops, (and yours is always right prime
good, ye know) or have made good, they may, and I
believe can make the like again.</p>

                  <p>I don't pretend to be a Projector; but I think the

themselves, and sell them out at easy Rates. What
they design by forming a Fund by Subscription, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I at present know not, but one of 'um told me t'other
day that they design to make that a Fund for buying in
Drugs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and making of all sorts of Compound Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
necessary for the Sick, selling them out again for
small profit, sufficient only to pay about a dozen Servants, and
the Prime Cost of the Medicines, with a Penny in the Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Over-plus to the College. By which means the
Doctors will be sure to have such good Medicines, and so
well prepared as to rely on them, not to be sophisticated;
or, for want of any one prescribed, to be supply'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in the room of it, as you Apothecaries oft do: If
you han't one Thing, you in your mighty Wisdom will
put in another in the room of it; so that the Physician
may prescribe till Dooms-day, and the Patient will be
never the better, if ye substitute what Medicines ye please,
and after that put what Prices ye please.</p>

                  <p>Prices Sir? I sell as cheap as any Apothecary in
Town; I never have above 6 <hi>s.</hi> and 8 <hi>d.</hi> for a Pint of Pearl Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
in my Life, an you go to that.</p>

                  <p>Not so passionate, Good Mr. <hi>Pestle,</hi> I believe you sell
as cheap as your Brethren, but all damn'd dear, and much
to the Oppression of the Poor. To remedy which they
propose to sell a Pint of good Pearl Cordial for Eighteen
Pence, or thereabouts. A Cordial Bolus for a Groat, which
ye reckon sometimes 1 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> and sometimes 2 <hi>s.</hi> A Quart
of Bitter Drink for 1 <hi>s.</hi> for which I my self have pay'd 5 <hi>s.</hi>
and 8 <hi>d.</hi> And so proportionable for all other Medicines.</p>

                  <p>What if they do? Why then the Poorer sort of
People will buy of them, because they are sure of good
and cheap Medicines. The better sort will think it Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

to save 5 <hi>s.</hi> in 6 <hi>s.</hi> and 8 <hi>d.</hi> if they can, to help pay
Taxes, and not have a Bill after a great Sickness brought
in, enough to renew their Sickness again. Even the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all will be apt to be influenced by their Physicians,
when they tell 'um that there are the only Medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
which they can rely on. In short, every Body will
be willing in their Illness to go to such a Place, where they
can with great probability be assured of Good and Cheap
Medicines.</p>
