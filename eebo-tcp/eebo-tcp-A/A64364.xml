            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now a year, and almost another, since I wrote a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for private Use, about the <hi>Worship of Images:</hi> A Practice most scandalous to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and (as some use it) so extremely ridiculous, that the very <hi>statue,</hi> had it any apprehension, would mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly bow it self, and prevent the <hi>Adorer.</hi> From that small beginning has arisen a Book sufficiently big; but of the less solidity by reason of the hasty growth of it. More art, together with more hours of leisure would have made it a lesser Volume. For in writing of Books, as in carving of Statues, the cutting away of each superfluity is a work of skill and time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51259:4"/>
But if this Volume were equally great and good, it would be the more suitable Present for your <hi>Lordship,</hi> to whom the Dedication of it is due, whether the <hi>Author</hi> be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or <hi>that which be hath written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Author</hi> he hath had long dependance on your Honourable Family; such as may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most be dated from that happy time in which these Islands were disenchanted, and received their true and undoubted Soveraign, in place of that Spectre of Authority which then walked at <hi>Whitehall.</hi> He is possessed of one Living by the Bounty of the then Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain your Father, whose most generous kindness and condescension must for ever be remembred by him. And seeing the Noble offer makes the favour, and not the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he owes to your Lordship his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for another. Many other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from your <hi>Honourable Person and Family,</hi> and therein from <hi>your most excellent Lady,</hi> (whose eminent and exemplary Virtues sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the very heighth of her Birth and Quality) as in Gratitude I must not forget, so in good manners I ought not here to repeat them at large; for it would be a rude abuse of your Lordships patience to turn this Epistle into a second Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51259:4"/>
               <hi>For the Book it self,</hi> some part of it was meditated, the whole revised at your Castle of <hi>Kimbolton;</hi> a place where your Lordship does yearly offer new matter to the admiration of Travellers, who speak with such praise of the <hi>Fair Villa's of England.</hi> It was enlarged, and now at last published, not without the desire of some of your Lordships very Learned Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who by their own accurate Pens have made amends to the world for any trouble they may occasion by mine. It hath already some hope of your favourable acceptance; and therefore it lays it self with the greater assurance at the feet of your Honour.</p>
            <p>Where it offendeth either <hi>in Matter or Form,</hi> (for in an heap of so many particulars some which are not very current may pass through my hand undiscerned;) I beg not Patronage, but excuse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the matter,</hi> I would hope that the main of it is passable, because I have used as its touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone the Doctrine and Worship of that Church, in whose Communion (by Gods good Providence) I have always lived, the Church of <hi>England:</hi> a Church of unparallel'd sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and invincible Truth. The <hi>Country</hi> was one of the last of those which the <hi>Arms</hi> of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> subdu'd; and the <hi>Church</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:51259:5"/>
such that it can never be conquered by the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Modern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, I have said many things which the Church hath not said; for I was unwilling to disgust any curious Reader, by serving up nothing but what had formerly been often set before him. But against the Church I am not conscious that I have written a syllable. And for some Speculations which might have been subject to misconstruction, I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to (that which they call <hi>the best keeper of Secrets)</hi> the <hi>Fire.</hi> If any offensive phrase or notion have escaped me, as soon as I am shewed it, I shall be readier to blot it out, than I was ever to write it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching my manner of writing,</hi> I crave leave to observe a few things about <hi>the stile,</hi> and <hi>the temper</hi> of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>stile,</hi> had it been my Talent, it had not been possible in such an Historical and Philological Argument to have made any considerable use of it. A Discourse into which the words of other men of differing Professions, Ages, Countries, Languages and stiles, are so frequently woven, must needs be uneven and parti-coloured.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Temper</hi> observed in this writing, I have endeavour'd to abstain from
<pb facs="tcp:51259:5"/>
all unnecessary heat and severe Language. For I cannot perswade my self that the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft of Error can be removed, or so much as weakned by the meer scratches of the Pen. It hath also been my care not to misrepresent the opinions of those from whom I differ. Yet I am sensible that this very Impartiality, with which I move in the middle path, will draw upon me the censorious lashes of many Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots who place themselves on either hand. Those whom <hi>Jesuitick Bygotry</hi> possesseth will say I have maliciously blackned their Church. Others whose over-rigid humour must needs pass for the only Protestancy, whose Religion sheweth it self in nothing but in a fierce and indiscreet zeal against <hi>Popery,</hi> will think my Pen hath flattered. They will cry out that it hath imitated his pencil, who drew the loose <hi>Gabrielle</hi> in the figure of chaste <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have (I hope) avoided both those Extremes: Most certain I am, I have studied to do so. And if just moderation must be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I am willing to be a sufferer in so good, so honourable a cause.</p>
            <p>There are another sort of Enemies of whose Censures I am also in some expectation, though in no fear at all: I mean the lower sort of
<pb facs="tcp:51259:6"/>
               <hi>Criticks,</hi> into whose Province of <hi>Philology</hi> I have sometimes stepped. This sort of men seemeth to me like those wretched <hi>Barbarians on the Coast of Guinea,</hi> whose Idol is a certain <hi>Bundle of Feathers.</hi> Religious men of the warmest temper are not more earnest about matters of Faith than these are in questions of wit, and debates about words and tittles. For though the interest of the thing they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about be insignificant, yet they think that power and mastery in any thing is worthy their zeal. If I have but mispelled the name of some Heathen-god, I expect severe usage from such Grammarians. But though they shall prove angry, I will not retaliate. It is not worth the while to keep up a controversy begun about a trifle, and to bandy light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters backward and forward by eternal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>But I trespass upon your Honour by the liberty of this Discourse, and by introducing these Pedantick people who make so absurd a figure in Courts.</p>
            <p>This only I have to add: If there be any thing useful in this writing, I know your Lordship will accept it for its own sake. And for that which is useless, or defective,
<pb facs="tcp:51259:6"/>
I hope it may obtain pardon through the submission of the Author, who is,</p>

               <hi>Superstition,</hi> if we have regard only to the bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivations of its names in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, is no other than a single branch of Idolatry. It is the worship of the <hi>Divi, coelestes semper habiti,</hi> (as the Law of the twelve Tables speaketh) that is, of the Sempiternal Daemons; and also of those, <hi>Quos in coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum merita vocârunt</hi> (as the same Law distinguisheth); of such Hero's and superexisting Souls as were, through their eminent and exemplary virtue, translated from Earth to Heaven. Yet in the notion of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Superstition, consisteth not so much in the bare worship of such invisible Powers, as in that servility and horror of mind which possessed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers, and inclin'd them (like those who flatter Tyrants) to hate them, and yet to fawn on them, and to suppose them apt to be appeased <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>But there is still behind its proper and especial
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51259:10"/>
notion; and the Synod of <hi>Mechlin</hi> hath attempted to set down a true description of it. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> having commanded the abolishing of all Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, the Fathers of this Synod go about to explain the meaning of that Precept; and they do it <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Mech. inter. Conc. Max.</hi> c. 3. <hi>de Imag.</hi> p. 801.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the following manner. <q>This Synod (say they) teacheth, that all that use of things is superstitious, which is performed without [the warrant of] the Word of God, or the Doctrine of the Church, by certain customary rites and observances, of which no reasonable cause can be assigned: And when trust is put in Them, and an expectation is raised of an event following from such Rites, and not hoped for without them, from the intercession of the Saints. Also when, in the worship of Saints, they are done rather out of rashness and lightness, than out of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Religion.</q> But this description is in many respects defective. For many of the Usages which it decrieth, do not relate to Religion, and they deserve rather the names of follies, impertinences, and ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous inchantments: unless a man would distinguish concerning the kinds of Superstition, and call some, the <hi>Superstitions of common life,</hi> and others, the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions of worship.</hi> The rites of the former kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more Superstitious, if their event be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from some presumed Saint; for then an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent custom becomes an impiety, or the usage of a Magical charm, by which invisible powers are depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, for the production of visible effects. If (for instance sake) a man shall fall into that conceit which hath possesled many, even <hi>Origen</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51259:11"/>
But if he maketh such use of words [sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>Adonai</hi> or <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> which <hi>Origen</hi> believeth to lose their vertue, if turn'd into any other language:] and hopeth thence for the event from God, through the intercession of some Spirit; he deserveth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof due to a superstitious man, who, by supposing a Divine attendance on his Trifles, doth highly disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God and his Saints.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the Synod of <hi>Mechlin</hi> absolve such Rites from the guilt of Superstition, by adding to the intercession of Saints the prescription of the Church; for that cannot alter the nature of things, though it may render some Rites, indifferent in their nature, expedient, not to say, necessary, in point of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the preservation of Peace and Order.

I should therefore chuse, in this manner, to describe Superstition. <q>It is a corruption of publick or private worship, either in the substance, or in the Rites of it; whereby men (actuated by servile motives) perform, or omit, in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;

or urge upon, or forbid to others, any thing as in its nature Religious or Sinful, which God hath neither required, nor disallowed, either by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of right Reason, or by his revealed Will. It is the paying of our Religious Tribute, to God or an Idol, in Coin of our own mintage. The positive part of it is the addition of our own numberless, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, or decent, inventions, to the prescriptions of God, in the quality of Laws and Rites, equal, or superior to those by him enacted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> An observance of a very great number of such Rites and Ceremonies in the worship of God, as admit of excuse or praise in their single consideration, is a part of this Superstition: For it prejudiceth the substance of our duty, by distracting our attention, and is unagreeable to the Christianity which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess; because it is not, as was the <hi>Mosaic,</hi> a Typical Religion.

               <hi>Latin,</hi> and oftner in his <hi>English,</hi> a great number of Rites enjoyned the Priest, and dayly performed by him. I will give a few instances in both kinds.</p>
            <p>In the very beginning of the Order of the Mass, this is the authentick Rubrick. <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>Again, There is a superstitious levity and want of decence in many Rites, which render them unfit for the solemnity of Divine Worship. The watchings of women on the Eve of the Nativity, together with the consequent nursings and rockings, used sometimes by those of the Roman Communion, are in some degree superstitious. They are apt to raise in the mind a mean and common Idea of our Lord's birth, and they give manifest occasions to profane men, to make
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51259:12"/>
ridiculous a very solemn part of our Christian Faith. In the worship and procession of some Images, the Rites are so apish, that they are fit only for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of such an Idol, as that in <hi>India,</hi> spoken of by <hi>Vincent le Blanc,</hi> which had its Statue made of the Tooth of a Monkey. The very Rituals, and Missals, and Ceremonials of <hi>Rome</hi> prescribe, too often, very idle and unbecoming Rites, and make a kind of Farce to be the part of the Priest, or rather his humour, who in Carneval-time, went dressed half in the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,</hi> and half in the <hi>French</hi> fashion. <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note> on a very solemn time, the Eve of <hi>Easter.</hi> By order of that Missal, all the Lights of the Church are extinguish'd, that they may again be lighted by new consecrated Fire.

Of the like levity most of their forms of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration may be justly accused. Such is that of the Benediction of a Bell, <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pontif. Rom.</hi> part 2, fol. 68, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> which is ceremoniously washed with Salt-water, and Crossed by the Bishop, and by his Ministers carefully wiped.</p>
            <p>Such is that of the Dedication and Consecration of a Church, in which the Bishop filleth the Two Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lines of the <hi>Area,</hi> with the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabets, writing first from the Corner on the left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand at his entrance, the Row of the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters, with the end of his Pastoral-Staff; and then the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> ones from the corner on his right-hand. <note n="b" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Such is that of the Benediction of Chrism, <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pontif. Rom.</hi> part 3. fol. 186.</note> or a mixture of Balm and Oyl. There the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop breatheth three times Cross-wise, over the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Phial. Then Twelve Priests, after having bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to the Sacrament on the Altar, and the Bishop, proceed to the Table where the Phial is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. There they successively imitate the Bishop, breathing three times cross-wise over the mouth of the Vessel: which being done, together with their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beisance, a second time to the Sacrament, and the Bishop, they retire for a season. Now it is not readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined, by what vertue such forms as these affect the <hi>Italians,</hi> who are a grave and steddy people. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Rites solemn enough, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> sometimes observe; as appeareth at large in <hi>Goar</hi> and <hi>Habertus.</hi> And, methinks, those <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Journey of 14 <hi>English</hi> to <hi>Jerus.</hi> p. 29.</note> might have better employ'd their Artists, than in making a narrow passage through two Pillars, in order to their creeping through, in imitation of the strait Gate, which leadeth to Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>Last of all, The Laws and Rites of Worship which man inventeth, how few and decent soever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, become Superstitious, as soon as they are made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51259:13"/>
equal with the express Laws of God. This Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our Saviour condemned in the Pharisees, who usurped the Legislative Power of God, and taught sometimes for necessary Doctrines the commandments of men. <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 15. 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.</note> They made some of their Traditions equal to the most Moral Laws of <hi>Moses:</hi> Nay, they often were more fond of the Issue of their own Fancy, than of the Edicts of God. They were wont to say, <note n="b" place="margin">

Lightf. in Matt.</hi> 15. 2. p. 185, 186.</note> That <hi>the words of the Scribes were more amiable than the words of the Law.</hi> Also, That <hi>the words of the Elders were more weighty than the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Many of them vilified the Written Word in comparison of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> or Oral Tradition of the Elders, which they call'd <hi>The Foundation.</hi> They held the breach of a Traditional Rite, to be as capital as the violation of a Moral Law; <hi>Rabbi Jose</hi> teaching, That <hi>the eating of bread with unwashed hands, was as great a wickedness as the humbling of an Harlot</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Drusius,</hi> on <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 2.</note>. Hence our Saviour defended the breach of this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Disciples, not as it was an innocent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but as it was imposed as a necessary part of Religion: the neglect <hi>of which defil'd a man,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 20.</note> and rendered him as guilty in Gods sight, as if he had broken a written Law. Nay, they judged of their Saintship rather by the obedience they paid to their own Inventions, than by their observation of Gods Commands. Thus, by the device of their <hi>Corban,</hi> they made a false estimate of Charity; believing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Righteous, whilst they violated the indispensable Law of Love to their Parents.</p>
            <p>Some Usages there are not commanded by God, yet acceptable to him, if our high estimation of them, and our indiscreet zeal in their use or imposition, does not become the dead Fly in the Spikenard. I cannot discern such Superstition, as others think they have

I mean this, of those persons by whom it doth not appear, but that the inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention doth accompany the outward sign. A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Christian is not offended at him, who on a solemn occasion maketh the sign of the Cross on himself, as an external sign of his Christian Religion. Neither doth he censure those, who well understanding their own tempers, do use fasting before the Eucharist, as an help to devotion: or those who use abstinence on a <hi>Saturday</hi> with discretion; by way of preparation (as is alledged <note n="b" place="margin">Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ.

And he is not well-grounded in the Faith and Charity of a Christian man, who brandeth all those with Superstition, that comply with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Rites, which are neither in their number many, nor indecent, or immoral in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; neither are they required as Usages in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves necessary to Salvation. They are enjoyned and used for the sake of order and comeliness, without which a Church is as it were undressed, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in ungrateful and unbecoming circumstances, to the devout, who with Reason conceive some difgust, as well at the nakedness, as at the paint of their Mother.</p>
            <p>There are, then, certain Free-will-offerings both of Churches and single persons, which God Almighty [who as Learned men think, accepted voluntary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Thanksgiving in the infancy of the World; and who most certainly accepted of voluntary dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Feasts under the very Law of <hi>Moses,]</hi> will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51259:14"/>
not despise under Christianity; when they are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with piety, humility and prudence. But if any shall perform or enjoyn such Rites, under the notion of indispensable duties; if they shall value them as the weightier matters of Religion, and impose them, as such, with fierceness and intemperate zeal; or if by negative scrupulositie, they shall place Religion in the meer abhorrence of them; they so far cease to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devout, and become ridiculously and uncharitably superstitious. God hath not required such things at their hands in such manner, or such a mighty dread of them; neither is he pleased with such <hi>Will-worship.</hi> Softer words are not to be used towards them who so highly exalt their imagination, as to make it the measure of Gods Will, and inforce those observances, or omissions, as heavenly Laws which the great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Church hath left to the discretion of his Christian Subjects. Their Usurpation is insuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who make more duties and sins than God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth or forbiddeth: And nothing but blind and slavish Superstition subjecteth the neck to their uneasie yoke. <note n="a" place="margin">

            </head>
            <p>IDolatry is either Metaphorical or Proper. By Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Idolatry, I mean that inordinate love of Riches, Honours, and bodily Pleasures, whereby the passions and appetites of men are made superior to the Will of God: Man, by so doing, making as it were a God of himself and his sensual temper. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man worshippeth <hi>Mammon;</hi> he valueth his Gold, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Philo Jud. de Monarch. l.</hi> 1. p. 813.</note>, <hi>as a Divine Image:</hi> As if the Image of God were cast, in eminent manner, in that thick Clay spoken of by the Prophet, with which the <hi>Issachars</hi> of the world do lade themselves. Such Idolatrous estimation of Money, gave to a Mine in <hi>Friebert,</hi> which contained in it exceeding rich Ore, that high and mighty name of <hi>Himmelfurst,</hi> or the Prince of Heaven. The Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man, rather than he will want high place, or popular fame, he will in unjust Wars, and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duels, offer himself a sacrifice to Honour; an Idol on whose Altars more blood hath been profusely shed, than on those of <hi>Moloch</hi> or <hi>Bellona.</hi> To the Glutton, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of Fasting saith of him, after his sharp manner,) <q>His Belly is his God, his Paunch is his Altar, his Cook is his Priest, his Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are his Graces, and his Belching is Prophesie.</q> The unchast man owns nothing so Divine as his Harlot, and borroweth the phrases of his Courtship, from the Goddesses and the Shrines, the Temples and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, of the Theologers of the Gentiles, that is, their Poets. Now this excessive value of the things of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51259:15"/>
World, is a very high and impious presumption: But because it setteth not up Mammon or the Appetite, as a god, or an object of Religious worship; therefore I call it Metaphorical, and not Proper Idolatry; in which latter subject only, I am at present engag'd.</p>
            <p>This kind of Idolatry which I call Proper, is by many supposed a matter of nice and difficult specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They think the notion of it too abstruse for common heads; yea, too hard for some Scholastick ones, which are not very accurate in dividing a <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min-seed.</hi> And yet the Holy Writers do every-where reprove the people for this sin, supposing its nature to be commonly understood: and sure it is no other than that which is briefly describ'd by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Hilary.</hi> 
               <q>Then (saith St. <hi>Cyprian)</hi> is Idolatry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when the Divine Honour is given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So <hi>Hilary</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Deacon (sometimes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken for St. <hi>Ambrose,)</hi> doth, in this, place the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Idolatry, That it usurpeth the Honour of God, and challengeth it in right of the creature.</q> Not unlike to these descriptions is that which we find in the Book of the Reformation <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Reform. Leg. Eccles. Tit. de Idol.</hi> c. 2. p. 32.</note> of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws, begun by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. <q>Idolatry (saith that Book) is a Worship, in which not the Creator, but the creature, or some figment of man is adored.</q> To this worship of the Creature, the Scripture doth frequently give the name of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This it hath done, partly in compliance with the Jewish Idiom, which calleth any thing that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable, dirty or unclean; the persons of that people being desecrated by corporal pollutions. It hath also done it, by reason of those very unchast Actions and Rites, by which many of the Idols of the Gentiles were served; though in the worship of some few, and particularly in that of <hi>Vesta,</hi> the great observance was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51259:16"/>
Chastity. But the Scripture hath, especially, given to Idolatry that name of uncleanness, because it was an alienation of the hearts and bodies of the Jews from the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> who had, as it were, chosen that Church as his Spouse on Earth. For the like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Witchcraft is a sort of Idolatry, because it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Covenant with God, and entreth into solemn league and compact with Daemons.</p>
            <p>Now if this common notion seemeth, too briefly, or too generally propounded, I am ready to make a particular enlargement of it in the following definition. <q>Idolatry is a sin, which by inward reverence or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signs, giveth to some other object, in an act or habit of Religious Homage or Worship, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is either essential to God; or being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, yet appertaining to God only till he hath declared his actual communication of it, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at all communicated, or not in that extent or continuance of vertue, which seemeth thereby to be attributed to it.</q> This definition containeth in it three branches, which are also three degrees of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Idolater giveth away, sometimes, the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential and incommunicable Honour of God. This he doth two ways; first, when he dethroneth God in his imagination, and setteth up some other object in his place. Thus the <hi>Babylonians</hi> offended, whil'st they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored the primitive <hi>Baal,</hi> the Sun, as the best and greatest Deity, not only in their World or Empire, but likewise throughout the Sphere of all things. He doth it, <hi>Secondly,</hi> when admitting of God, he addeth another principle equal to him; for he that divideth the Empire of God, diminisheth his Honour: He makes him cease to be God, that is, to be One and Supreme. This presumption <hi>Pliny,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. nat. Hist.</hi> l. 2. c. 7. p. 3.</note> chargeth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51259:16"/>
in effect, on <hi>Democritus,</hi> giving to his two Principles, the names of <hi>Poena</hi> and <hi>Praemium,</hi> Punishment and Reward; or (as I think) more properly, Avenger and Rewarder. The like fault is found in the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Theology, which constituteth (as they say) two Principles; the one the fountain of Good, under the name of <hi>Oromasdes;</hi> the other the source of Evil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Arimanius:</hi> Although it may appear from <hi>Theodorus,</hi> in his Book <note n="a" place="margin">

Cod.</hi> 81. p. 199.</note> of the <hi>Persian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> that both (according to <hi>Zarasdas</hi> or <hi>Zoroaster)</hi> were the off-spring of <hi>Zaruam,</hi> who was own'd as the Prince of all things, and the Father of <hi>Hormisda</hi> and <hi>Satanas,</hi> and called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Fortune. Such Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is likewise charged on the <hi>Americans</hi> of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who are reported <hi>(b)</hi> to have had Two thousand gods, and amongst them two principal ones, <hi>Tezcatlipuca</hi> the <note place="margin">c <hi>Gages New Survey of the West-Indies.</hi> c. 12. p. 116, 117.</note> god of providence, and <hi>Vitzilopuchtli</hi> the god of the wars. It may be that there was a Deity own'd by them superiour to both these: For what else was intended by that great and superiour Image plac'd on the top of the Chappel of Idols <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gage ibid.</hi> p. 117.</note> in the City of <hi>Mexico?</hi> It was either the Statue of the Supreme God, or of the supreme Demon of their Precinct. And why should it not be thought that <hi>Mexico</hi> own'd one God as well <hi>as Peru,</hi> in which the Soveraign Principle (as <hi>Acosta</hi> instructeth us) was called <hi>Pachacamac</hi> and <hi>Vira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocha,</hi> inferiour to whom they esteemed the Sun and Thunder, their two Principles, (as I guess) of Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Idolater giveth to some other object, that Honour which might have been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Gods Authority, but hath been entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by his Wisdom, whilest no actual communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it hath been any way declared. This impiety of his is likewise of two kinds. For he giveth the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51259:17"/>
Honour which God hath wholly reserved, to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object, either with respect to some inherent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with which he supposeth it to be indu'd by God; or with regard to some external Relation which he supposeth to be owned by him. In the first kind the barbarous <hi>Goths</hi> offended, whilst they worshipped <hi>Nocca</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ol. worm. monum. Danic.</hi> l. 1. c. 4.</note> [a kind of <hi>Neptune</hi> amongst them] as one to whom a superiour Power had committed the government of their Seas and Rivers; whil'st that Idol possibly, had not so much virtue communicated to him, as might still one puff of Wind, or crush a Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In the second kind, they would have transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, who in the Temple of <hi>Dagon</hi> should have done Religious, though relative and inferiour, reverence to his shapeless Trunk, or even to his Statue in the perfection of its beauty; God having never own'd it as his Image, or the Image of any Deity, or Angel, substituted by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Idolater giveth Honour to an Object which God owneth and replenisheth sometimes with virtue, in the quality of the Fountain of that Virtue; whilst God hath not indued it with that constant Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it self, but used it as the instrument of his Works. The Power which healeth Diseases not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by Physick, doth not so essentially belong to the Prerogative of God, that he cannot communicate it perpetually to Angel or Man, and invest him in it, without diminution of his own Omnipotence. For it implyeth not a contradiction, for a creature to be able to alter the whole Texture of so little a frame as mans body: Neither is it impossible for man to be, by God, indued with a knowledg, which in a certain precinct, may, by signs in nature, to men unknown, and past their finding out, foretel several accidents which God determineth not to over-rule; such as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51259:17"/>
Plagues, or healthful Seasons; Famine or Plenty: For this knowledg, though it is not mans natural Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, is not Omniscience. Yet whil'st this is done by Gods immediate Power, and man is but instrumental in it, he becomes an Idolater, who owneth and thanketh man as the efficient cause. And he is guilty two ways: Either whilst he owneth the Instrument as the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cause, during the time that God maketh use of it, or after God hath ceased to work by it. In the first kind, the Impotent people, who were healed at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> had offended, if they had given thanks to the Angel as to the principal Physician. And against this kind of Idolatry St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when seeing the multitude transported with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at the recovery of the Cripple, <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 3. 12.</note> He thus bespake them, <hi>Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power, or holiness, we had made this man to walk?</hi> The offence of the second kind is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than this first, because it doth not only give to Gods Instrument the honour due to the Divine Efficient Cause; but it also giveth Divine honour to that, which is not now so much as the Instrument by which God worketh. And this becomes a very Idol indeed, a vanity or lie, or nothing at all of that which it is esteemed to be. The Magical Rod in the Temple of <hi>Isis,</hi> in imitation of that of <hi>Moses,</hi> was but an Idol, if it was an Instrument of any wonders; for it was not the Rod of God, but of a Demon. This matter may also be illustrated, both by the instance of the Brazen Serpent set up by one of Gods Vicegerents, and, upon its abuse, destroyed by another; and by that of the Cup of <hi>Joseph.</hi> This Cup by which he Divined, was, probably, an instrument used in some Sacrifice, some drink-offering; and in the use of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51259:18"/>
which God vouchsafed him a Spirit of Prophesie, with relation to the affairs of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> afterward made use of this Cup, or any other in form of it, without any precept or promise from God Almighty; and trusted in it, as in the cause of Divination, they then were Idolaters in this last kind of that impiety. And this, one would think, was the <hi>Egyptian</hi> practice, who readeth <hi>Lucian</hi> in his Book of Sacrifices, <note n="a" place="margin">Or rather in his <hi>Jupiter Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaedus.</hi> p. 700. for I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it in his Book <hi>de Sacr.</hi> though <hi>Pignorius,</hi> in <hi>Exp.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or, a drinking Pot, a God. And such a Cup may that be thought, which is described in the hand of <hi>Isis</hi> in her Mystical Table, rather than a Measure, as <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> contendeth; as likewise that mentioned by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi>

But this, as it referreth to <hi>Joseph,</hi> is but conjecture; scarce so much as opinion: I therefore dismiss it. Yet I must not dismiss the Argument it self, till I have further distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished both concerning the Objects or Idols of that Honour which is given from God; and the ways by which it is translated from the proper to the false Deity.</p>
            <p>These Idols are either Personal, Internal, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Objects. By Personal Objects, I mean the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters themselves, who become their own Statues, and worship their very selves by the estimation they have of their Persons, as Christs, or of their Souls as real portions of the Essence of God; the fancy of some followers of <hi>Plotinus</hi> of old, who said, <q>Their Souls at death returned to the seminal Reason;</q> and of some Quakers at this time, who say, as <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51259:18"/>
Internal Objects are the false <hi>Idea's</hi> which are set up in the fancy, instead of God and his Divine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For he who fancieth God under the <hi>Idea</hi> of Indefinite Amplitude or Extension of matter, or of Light or Flame; or under the notion of an irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tyrant; and applies himself to him as such, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the use of any visible external Statue or Picture; is as certainly an Idolater, as he who worshippeth a Graven Image; for he giveth Divine Honour to an <hi>Idea</hi> which is not Divine. Only here, the Scene being internal in the Fancy, the scandal of the sin is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by abated.</p>
            <p>External Objects, are such which have a subsistence distinct from the Phantasms which are by motion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed on the Brain. And the Catalogue of these is a kind of Inventory of nature. I will here give only a summary account of them, for the particulars are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. Idolaters have worshipped Universal Nature, the Soul of the World, Angels, the Souls of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; either by themselves, or in union with some Star or other Body. They have likewise worshipped the Heavens, and in them both particular Luminaries and Constellations; the Atmosphere, and in it the Meteors and Fowls of the Air; the Earth, and in it Man, together with the accidents of which he is the subject, such as Fortitude and Justice, Peace and War. And further, on earth they have deified Beasts, Birds, Insects, Plants, Groves, Hills, artificial and artless Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and Statues, Pictures and Hieroglyphics [mean as that of the Scaribee <note n="a" place="margin">

But he is therefore deficient in his computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither was it his purpose to make it accurate. Thus the Image of God who made all things, has (as in a broken mirror) been beheld, without due attention, in the several parts of the frame of the World, and by the foolish Idolater distinctly adored: And this adoration being used towards external Objects, and not confined to mans secret thoughts, hath with the more success and scandalous dishonour to God, been propagated in the World. And this remindeth me of the distinction which I designed also to make, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ways by which Gods Honour is derived on creatures. For it is either done by the inward estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, directing its intention in an Act or course of internal Worship; or by the external signs of Religious Reverence. It is done by both these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or by either of them apart. There is no publick worship without manifest signs of it; the heart in it self not being discern'd by mans eye, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51259:19"/>
discovering it self by external tokens. <q>The <hi>Ifrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> (saith St. <hi>Cyril)</hi> worshipped the Calf; and they did it, <hi>by crying out these are thy gods (f).</hi>

In them the mind and the outward signs of it went together. But others, by the meer outward shews of Adoration, how unconcern'd soever they may have kept their minds, have committed Idolatry: Such as the <hi>Thurificati</hi> in the Primitive Church, who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Gospel, offered Incense before an Heathen Idol; that being made a sign of their departure from Christianity, and their approbation of Gentilism. They thereby did an act of open dishonour to the true God; and they used external means apt to incline others, either to worship Idols instead of Him, or to confirm them, if they were already Idolaters, in their detestable profaneness. Such Idolaters (it may be) were some <hi>Englishmen,</hi> who went to Sea with Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in order to the discovery of a North-West passage to <hi>Cataia, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and <hi>East-India.</hi> On the 29th of <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1585, <note n="b" place="margin">

They found this Land an heap of Islands, on one of which they went on shoar. There some few of the Natives made towards them; and amongst that little herd of barbarous people, one pointed first upwards wirh his hand to the Sun, and then smote his breast with very vehement force. The <hi>English</hi> aptly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting this sign as an acknowledgment of the Deity of the Sun, and an Oath by that Idol, of fidelity and peace, used the same sign themselves; gaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Friendship and Traffick with a few Salvage People, at the expence of the most valuable thing, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God.</p>

This Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he, in effect, renounceth, who pretending to the heart of a Christian, hath the tongue of a Blasphemer, or the gesture of an Idolater: who, whatsoever secret thoughts he entertaineth concerning God, saith open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him, that he is not Supreme: or, what inward hatred soever he conceiveth against Idols, sitteth in their Temples, and eateth of their Sacrifice. <q>Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ceremonies (as is said <note n="d" place="margin">

            <p>Hitherto I have pursued the notion of Idolatry in a positive way, according to the proper nature of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in which the Act passeth towards the Object. But it may not be amiss to take a little notice of a kind of negative impiety, which precedeth this positive false-worship; and to which, some it may be would give the name of negative Idolatry. I mean by this, that denial of any thing in the <hi>Idea</hi> of God which is proper to it, succeeded by a Worship of Him according to that maimed and unagreeable <hi>Idea.</hi> For the Idea of God being so intire that, by any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it becometh the Idea of something else; he that first removes part of the Idea, and then adores the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; adores, as God, that which is not like him. He, for instance sake, who denies the constancy of Gods knowledg of human affairs, yet worships him at certain times, in which he owneth him to have that knowledg (after the manner of those foolish Gentiles who worshipped the Sun by day, and revelled by night when they thought he saw not;) such a one, by breaking of such a necessary part of Gods Idea, as renders it not his Image, and yet adoring it as such, first makes an Idol, and then doth it homage. So the god of the <hi>Muggletonians</hi> rob'd of his Spirituality, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity, subsistences; what is he but their Idol?</p>
            <p>The Premisses being considered, it will thence follow That in giving the Honour of God, supreme or subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, to any other thing, be it internal <hi>Idea,</hi> or person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

Principle, or outward Object, with respect to any supposed, inherent, Divine Power, original or deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or to any external Relation, by internal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and by the external signs of it, or by either of them, consisteth the Notion of Idolatry; the thing designed in this Chapter.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Causes and Occasions of Idolatry in the World.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT hath appeared in the foregoing Chapter, what kind of evil Idolatry is and how it hath spread it self into numberless branches. In this Chapter, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is to proceed further, and to inquire into the Root of it, and to consider from what Causes and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions it hath sprung; and on what rotten and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional grounds it is bottom'd. The general Cause of Idolatry, is the degenerate estate of the Soul, exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self in the headiness of the Will, which hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to folly, under the wild conduct of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Sense. The Scripture calleth this distemper, <hi>The vanity of the mind;</hi> and to it it ascribeth the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Idols. Of such Worshippers St. <hi>Paul</hi> observeth, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>That when they knew God,</hi> [or had means of knowing him, by the reasoning of their minds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the beauty, order, and excellence of his Works of Creation and Providence], <hi>they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imagination, and their foolish heart was darkened.</hi> In this estate of moral darkness they mistook, and confounded the Objects they met
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51259:21"/>
with; and honoured the Creature instead of God.</p>
            <p>It is difficult, if not impossible, at this distance from persons and things, to tell the causes and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all their mistakes: Neither could it have been done fully by the wisest of those times. For the love of Idols in some, like that of Persons in others, was an unaccountable passion. That therefore which I here undertake, is not a full, certain, and manifest; but a competent, and probable account.</p>
            <p>Those who worshipped Universal nature as an entire Object, or the several visible parts of it distinctly, were led to such adoration, by one more general Cause, and by divers which were more special. The more general cause of the worship of material nature, either in its own form, or in the shapes put upon it by Art, is the natural inclination of the mind in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to help it self by sensible Objects. The substance of God Almighty is not an Object which our mind can comprehend, much less is our acutest sight able to reach it. This Principle many own'd amongst the Heathens. Such were they mention'd by <hi>Porphyrie</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Porphyr. ap. Euseb. de praep. Evangel.</hi> l. 3. c. 7. p. 98.</note> who, that they might signify the invisibility of Gods Essence, painted his Statues with black. Such were the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> remembred by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who did therefore make the Crocodile an emblem of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that creature, by the help of a pellucid mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane descending from his forehead, was able (as they vulgarly conceited) to see with closed eyes, without being seen. Now man living, as it were, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Heaven and Earth, his coelestial mind being united to a body of gross flesh and blood; his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing receiveth instruction through the gates of the outward senses, and is, in especial manner, assisted by Phantasms which Light pictureth in the Brain. This frame of man rendreth him covetous in his specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51259:22"/>
of the help of some external and visible Object. And amongst the numerous progeny of mankind, there are very few heads metaphysical enough for that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of the <hi>Arabians</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">

Arab.</hi> p. 2.</note>; <hi>Shut up the five Windows, that the House may be fill'd with Light.</hi> It is the same thing to the vulgar, not to appear, and not to be; and they would therefore have a visible Deity, and one who might in a more bodily manner be present with them. For this Reason, when <hi>Osiris</hi> was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped throughout <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his living Image was visible only in the superior part of it, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Memphis;</hi> the Priests took occasion to set on foot a Schism; and those of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> would also have a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bull, that their Deity might be as visible and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to them, as to the other <hi>Egyptians.</hi> This Reason the <hi>Brachman</hi> gave to <hi>Monsieur Bernier</hi>

            <p>This Affection then for Sense, this wisdom of the Flesh, is a general Cause of the Worship of material Idols. But they being of divers kinds, have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly divers more special Causes.</p>
            <p>Such who worshipped Universal Nature, or the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme of the material World, perceived first that there was excellency in the several parts of it; and then, to make up the grandeur and perfection of the Idea, they joyned them alltogether into one Divine Being. Thus, probably, did Idolaters: But Atheists also serv'd themselves on this Pretence, as they do at this day,

            <p>Those who worshipped Nature in the parts of it, were such (as <hi>Pliny</hi> observeth) who laboured under a weakness and narrowness of imagination. It was his opinion <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin. ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prà.</hi> p. 3.</note>, <hi>That frail and wearied mortality, mindful of its own infirm condition, distributed Nature into its several parts, that every one might worship that portion of it which was useful to him.</hi> Usefulness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was a common motive; And <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmeth (in his first Book of the <hi>Nature of the Gods) That the Egyptians consecrated no Beast, from whence they did not derive some profit.</hi> And in his second Book of the same Argument, he citeth it, as the saying of <hi>Perseus</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Zeno, That they were held to be Gods, from whom great advantage accrued to mans life.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any name so commonly given, amongst all Nations, to Divine Power, as that which signifieth the Goodness of it.

Then, also, did the Holy Virgin appear to him in glorious splendor, and bid him not fear. And she, further, gave him order to call the Ecclesiasticks of the City, and in her name to promise them, that if they digged in that place, they should find her Image. The poor man fearing they would not believe his report, she promised to enable him with this sign: to wit, That he finding his Child dead at home, should be able, by his word, to raise it to life again before them. This being done, the Image is sought and found (for they that hide, have ill memories if they can't find again); and it is plac'd in a magnificent Temple, and it becomes famous for working Miracles [true as that of its own discovery]. By such Arts as these, the people being induced to think that Images were the dwelling-places of Divine Powers, it was difficult for them that had blind zeal, thenceforth, to suspend their Religious veneration. The like means inclin'd them to worship Beasts or Birds, as shrines and living Statues of some Deity.

by strange appearances, real or invented, at the time of their death.

And this conceit they further inculcated, by adding a Star to the top of his Statue. Such Canonization of Heroes hath likewise been promoted by strange effects, done or counterfeited at their Sepulchres; and sometimes by their obscure manner of going out of the World, which the people esteem'd an heavenly translation. <hi>Empedocles</hi> hoping this way to arrive at Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, threw himself secretly into the flames of <hi>AEtna;</hi> but his two Pattens which that Gulf of Fire cast up, discovered his vain and miserable end.</p>

            <p>Towards all the Idolatries already mention'd, much was contributed by the figurative expressions of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, especially by their Apostrophe's in the Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of departed Hero's; as also by the elegant fictions of Poets, whose invention hath been justly reputed one of the great store-houses of Idols. And for the Idolatry of Qualities, I know not whence to fetch it so readily as by going thither. For though the first ground of it was the consideration of many of these Qualities, in their eminent degree, as means by which the Pagan Heroes were Deified <note n="b" place="margin">

               </note>; yet Poetry helped on that cause, by shaping these Qualities into personal Powers, negotiating, as it were, betwixt Heaven and Earth, and conveighing them, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did the Soul of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> into a more heavenly habitation. Poets design to move, to surprize, to make deep impression on the People. They cannot do this so readily, by proposing abstracted Truths to the mind, as by cloathing them in such Metaphors and Pictures as may affect the brain. Hence it is that they have used such a variety of fictions, in which they have cloathed every thing they say, with the appearances of a Person. Peace, and War, Fame and Justice, have such personal shape and action given to them, as is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51259:27"/>
necessary for the making a greater impression upon the Hearers. For (to give an ordinary instance in this matter) it doth not so much affect us when a man says barely, that a Kingdom shall want sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Bread, as when he describes famine riding towards us pale and meager upon a Sceleton of Man or Beast attended with thousands of such ghast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects; from whence the uncloathed bones stare upon us, and tell us that we after the dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of hunger and thirst, enforcing us to prey upon Toads and Serpents, upon our Relations, and our very selves, shall become lean, languishing, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they.</p>
            <p>By this transitory view of the Causes and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Idolatry, so full of folly, error, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, it manifestly appeareth, upon what weak and clay-like feet the Idols stand, which the world hath worship'd with so vigorous a Devotion.</p>

            <p>THe Nature and Causes of Idolatry being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, I intend in the next place to inquire into the time of its Birth, so far as the silence or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Tradition will permit. It is one of the Aphorisms of <hi>Philo</hi> the Elder (if he were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book of <hi>Wisdom),</hi> that Idols <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Wisd.</hi> 14. 13.</note> were not from the beginning: And it is a question among the Learned, whether Idolatry was any of those pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which defiled the old World, and brought the deluge upon it. It doth not appear that it was extant before the flood; and many believe it to be no older than <hi>Cham. Tertullian,</hi> it is true, was of opinion that Idolatry began in the days of <hi>Seth,</hi> and that <hi>Enoch</hi> restored true Religion, and is for that Reason said in Scripture <hi>to have walked with God.</hi> He hath given us his opinion, but he hath concealed the grounds of it: And I can think of nothing so likely to move him to this belief, as the reverence he had for the fictitious Prophesie of <hi>Henoch,</hi> which he often citeth <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Tertul. de Idolatr.</hi> Sect. 4. p. 87, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—<hi>Idem</hi> Enoch <hi>simul &amp; culto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Idoli &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricatores in comminatione praedamnat.</hi>

               <hi>The last and first of evils.</hi> So monstrous a sin, if it had been in those early times committed, it would, a man would think, have been as soon reflected on by <hi>Moses,</hi> as the violence or injustice which then filled the earth, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 6. 11, 12, 13.</note> or the unclean mixtures of the <hi>sons of God</hi>

            <p>In the infancy of the World, there were many Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which might prevent the sin of Idolatry.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51259:29"/>
conviction of him who was the head of the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Line, unrighteous <hi>Cain</hi> himself, who having seen God in his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> could not propagate either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Atheism or Idolatry, though he was the Father of evil manners: By these, and perhaps by other Causes to us unknown, it might come to pass, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Idols was either not in being, or at least, not in frequent exercise in those first Generations.</p>

                  <hi>Maimon. de Idolatr.</hi> c. 1. p. 3.</note> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Idolatry to the times of <hi>Enos,</hi> but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth <hi>Enos</hi> himself of that gross and stupid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For thus he begins that short Book which he hath written on that Subject. <hi>In the days of</hi> Enos <hi>men erred very greatly; and the minds of the wise-men of that age were overborn with stupidness: Even</hi> Enos <hi>himself was one of them who thus erred. Now this was their error, the worship of the Stars. A very rash and</hi> rude reflexion upon so holy a Patriarch, and relishing of Rabbinical dotage. For certainly divers of those Writers, if any others, have had a flaw in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations; though <hi>Maimonides,</hi> amongst them all, may be allowed the largest intervals of sobriety.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cham,</hi> therefore, rather than from <hi>Enos,</hi> the Learned derive the beginning of Idolatry; though I know not whether, under him, it may not be dated a little too soon. The heart of <hi>Cham</hi> being before the flood deeply depraved, it was rather hardened by the escape, than warned by the mighty danger of that general Deluge. Insomuch that it was just with God to give him up to the further seducement of his sensuality, and to the visible power of the old Serpent, who may seem to have been, for a time, chained down by the Curse in Paradise, but was now (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) let loose again for the punishment of those, whom Gods severe and miraculous discipline did not cleanse of their folly. He therefore is esteemed the Father of Idolatry, that Monster in Religion, which in his corrupt Loyn was, by degrees, multiplied into innumerable heads. But <hi>S. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in two places beginneth Idolatry at the confusion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and with <hi>Belus</hi> rather than <hi>Cham</hi>

But all will not allow this kind of reasoning to have place here; such Philosophical considerations being thought by them matters much later than the times of <hi>Babel.</hi> But for the building of Towers or Pyramids as <hi>Altaria,</hi> or high Altars, to the Sun and other heavenly bodies, the practice is ancient, and very general. The Sun was not, meerly, a god of the Hills; yet the Heathen thought it suitable to his advanced station, to ascend them, and to worship him upon ascents, either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or, as was necessary in such flat Countries, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; that they might come as nigh as they could to the Deity they worshipped.

               </note>, the Priests of the Sun, called by the remarkable name of <hi>Jaovas,</hi> worshipped their Idol on the top of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, round, steep and rocky Hill; a full league in its winding Ascent. The builders of the Hill or Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> surely, designed that much higher yet; so high that it might hide its head in the Clouds, and would, it may be, have put it, had it been finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the like Idolatrous use. It is reasonable for me, here to expect an objection from the Scripture, which seemeth to impute the building of the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> to another end. <hi>Come,</hi> say the builders in the Eleventh of <hi>Genesis</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note>, <hi>let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth.</hi> To this objection two things may be replied; First, the end expressed is not exclusive of that which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; and it is not a wonder, if vain men to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage one another, how many ends soever they had, did propound that of their pomp and glory. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, these builders designed a City, and not only a Tower which was but the Appendix to it, though such a necessary one as an Altar is to a Temple. And their design of getting them a Name, might rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the City, than distinctly to the Tower. They
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51259:31"/>
intended to build a place of fixed Residence, which might be, as it were, the Head, and Center, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of all Towns, whenever their Families should so encrease as to need further room for habitation. They were resolved against the incommodities of a wandring life, and they purposed to unite themselves into a more orderly body, and to become a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion instead of a multitude. And this was the way to get them a Name, to be the first City of the World, and to be owned as the Mother-Place of all Nations.</p>
            <p>But I am not so fond of this private fancy, as to contend further about the Legitimacy of it. In this I am more assured, that the Lights of Heaven, which in the clear firmament of those Countries, appeared so often and in such lustre, (whilest the Sun by day shone gloriously; and the Moon and Stars shewed beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the night, to them who lay either on the ground, or on flat Roofs, and found no evil influence from them); and which obtained afterwards the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from their continual motion, were the first Idols of the World. Amongst these, the Sun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling, he was made the principal Idol, and was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more in honour than at <hi>Babylon.</hi> Accordingly we read, so soon, of <hi>Bell,</hi> [the <hi>Babylonian]</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi> [the <hi>Phenician</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Name], in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology of the Gentiles, This Idol was originally, and principally, the Sun; though great men likewise, when deified after their deaths, obtained that Name, as a Title of highest renown. And from the many names of Canonized Heroes, given to the Sun, hath risen a great part of that uncertainty and confusion, with which the Reader is perplexed in the Labyrinths of Heathen Mythologers.</p>

            <p>To the worship of the Sun, Moon and Stars, and other appearances in Heaven or the Air, such as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets and Meteors, (for the worship of the former, was apt to draw on that of the latter) succeeded the false Religion towards Heroes, confounded, as I guess, with original Demons or Angels.

If other Demons were worshipped (as no doubt they were, being permitted to appear to them); it is a question whether the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did not, by them, misunderstand the deified Souls of some of their Ancestors, distinctly, or confusedly remembred; rather than natural <hi>Genii,</hi> or Angels: For such Beings owed much of their manifestation, as such, to the Tradition conveyed in the Loyn of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Gentiles acknowledged one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether they made Religious Application to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:51259:34"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether upon the concession of such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and Application, they may be, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are chargeable with Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> then, I enquire how far the Gentiles owned one supreme God. This enquiry is not capable of any nice and accurate resolution. For there is no one Systeme of the Gentile Theology; as there is of Judaism, Mahometanism, and the Christian Religion. Divers persons, in divers places, had divers apprehensions concerning a Deity; and divers Rites of worship. And those distinct Rites, by the commerce of Nations, were often so mixed together, that they made a new kind of Religion.</p>
               <p>It is not unlikely, that the dregs of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, whom God had given up to bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishness of mind, did rise little higher than Objects of sense. They worshipped many of them together; each as supreme in its kind, or no otherwise unequal than the Sun and the Moon, or the other coelestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by the adoration of which, the ancient Idolaters, as <hi>Job</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Job 31. 28.</note> intimateth, denied [or excluded] the God that is above. <hi>Porphyry</hi> himself, one of the most plausible Apologists for the Religion of the Gentiles, doth own in some, the most gross and blockish Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of mean Objects. He telleth us <note n="b" place="margin">

World. For few Heads are exercised by Philosophy; and we meet not with one Peasant of a Thousand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selves, who asks how the Sun enlightens this Globe, though he believes the body of it no bigger than his Bushel. Such Heads are inclined to turn the Truth of God into a Lie; to exchange the Sovereign Deity for that which is esteemed a God, but is not; and to multiply the kinds of it, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of considerable effects and appearances whose Causes are only known to the Secretaries of Nature.</p>
               <p>It is more probable still, that many Gentiles reached no higher in their devotion than to Demons. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> taxeth them <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 20.</note> with offering to Devils and not to God. The same Apostle inform'd the <hi>Lycaoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 14. 15.</note>, that the design of his Preaching, was the converting of men from vanities [that is, from their many Idols which were not what they were judged to be: which being no Deities, were in that respect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and vanity] unto one God, the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God; from whom therefore, these many Idols had withdrawn many of the Heathen. The Inferiour objects had thrust the Superiour out of possession, as in the Case of that woman under the Papacy, who is said to have forsaken God for the Virgin; and the Virgin in Heaven, for that Lady (as she called her) which she saw before her eyes in the Church <note n="c" place="margin">D.

               <p>Some of the Gentiles who knew God [that is, had means by the things that are seen <note n="d" place="margin">Rom; 1. 20, 21.</note> of ascending to the knowledg of the invisible Creator] did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

               <p>THis is the common oppinion, concerning many of the Gentiles; but there is not sufficient reason to believe the same thing concerning them all. For it is evident from the History of ancient and modern Idolatry, and from the Writings of some of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; that the acknowledgment of one supreme Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not wholly banished from all parts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan World. But herein, likewise, some of them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erred.</p>
               <p>For, first, There were those amongst them who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Universal Nature, as that one supreme Deity. This Deity the <hi>Egyptians</hi> vailed, sometimes under the names of <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Isis,</hi> before whose Temple <hi>Sai,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witnesseth, this Inscription was to be read: <hi>I am all that which was, and is, and will be hereafter.</hi> And in her Image were placed the emblems of all the kinds of things with which Nature is furnished <note n="b" place="margin">See the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Ifis</hi> in <hi>Kirch.

side, and Feminine on the other. It had the Sun on one of its breasts, and on the other the Moon: And on the Arms were to be seen a very great number of Angels, together with the Heavens, Mountains, Seas, Rivers, the Ocean, Plants and Animals; and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts in Nature as make up the Universe. Yet I cannot say that this was the Statue of their supreme Deity: For they tell us, concerning it, that this was the Image which God set before his Son when he made the World, as a pattern by which he should form his Work. But I may say it more truly, of some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of <hi>Isis,</hi> that they supposed her supreme, and did adore her, not, with others, as the inferiour Earth, but in the quality (as I just now noted) of universal Nature.

               <p>BUT it is not fair to fight always on the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of Nature. I come therefore in the next place, to acknowledg, that some Gentiles used a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner Reason than others, and owned one supreme God, the King of the World, and a Being distinct from the Sun, or the Universe, or the Soul of it.</p>
               <p>This appeareth from the Confession of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and from the words of the Gentiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>First, Divers of the Fathers, though they shew the generality of their gods to have been but creatures, yet they confess they had amongst them, some appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of one supreme, eternal Deity. S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> in a second Discourse in his sixth Tome concerning the Trinity <note n="b" place="margin">S. <hi>Chrys. op, vol.</hi> 6. <hi>de Trin.</hi> p. 189. B.

For it is Gentilism</hi> (said that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>which teacheth men to worship a creature, and to set up one Great[or greatest] God, and others of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour order.</hi> In this Discourse St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the Gentiles adored the one Sovereign God (for him the <hi>Arians</hi> believed in, and were in that point good Theists, though no Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians), notwithstanding he accuseth them of Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Polytheism. S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> speaks the same thing, and in more plain and direct words <note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And (to come to the second way of proof above mentioned) S. <hi>Cyril</hi> is very copious in the authorities which he produceth out of the Heathen Writers, in order to the strengthening of his Assertion, that they believed in one infinite God. He introduceth <hi>Orpheus</hi>

Secondly, Because the worship of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in how high a notion soever he was sometimes taken, was not looked upon only by it felf, but as the principal worship in the Religion of the Gentiles, giving denomination to the other parts of it. For the worship of <hi>Jupiter</hi> was, in effect, an acknowledgment of the whole Gentilism of <hi>Rome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:</hi> And he that had adored <hi>Jupiter,</hi> would by that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51259:40"/>
have been judged, to have been likewise a devout Servant of <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and the rest of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Idols. However, under this name, some of the wise Gentiles did mean the supreme Deity, distinct from their College of Demons: and I suppose <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> that Philosophical Prince, to have been one of them. He says, indeed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thundering Legion, <hi>That they prayed to a God which himself knew not</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </gap>.—</note>: Not that he owned not one supreme God, but that he understood him not in the subsistences of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in which quality the Christians applyed themselves to him. Thirdly, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> when thought of under the notion of one highest God, whatsoever he was in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, he was actually but an evil Demon. For the Persons and things which he countenanced could never be approved of by the true and righteous God.</p>
               <p>Let it then be granted (for why should men oppose the evidence of plain words?) that some Gentiles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a notion of that God who is one and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.</p>

               <p>In answer to this enquiry, I purpose to shew, that they are still charged; that they might be guilty not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that concession of owning one God; and that in divers respects, that guilt was actually contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them. They are charged with this high offence, by <hi>Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Minucius Faelix, Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian de vanitate Idolorum, Arnobius, Lactantius, Julius Firmicus Maternus,</hi> and

                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Kings 17. 26, 27.</note>. If now <hi>Julian</hi> and some other Heathens entertained so worthy a notion of God, they are, so far, acquitted of that sort of Idolatry which establisheth the Polytheism of some or many eoequal Gods; but still they might be, in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, the worshippers of Idols.</p>
               <p>That they might be so, appeareth from the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Idolatry, in which it is shewed that the giving away the honour of God to another Object is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that crime, though it be not his supreme ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Though we do not take the Crown of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable honour from him, and, by our fancy, place it on a creature. It appeareth again from the practice of the Jews, who are by God himself accused of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, even when they in part owned and worshipped him, and before they were wholly led into captivity, and mingled again among the Heathen. They had not forgotten, perfectly, the God of <hi>Israel</hi> in whose Law they read; though like Adulteresses, they shared their Love with Idols. Wherefore God Almighty required <hi>Hosea,</hi> not (as I think) in a literal sense, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way of a Prophetical Scene, to take unto him an Adulteress <note n="b" place="margin">Hosea 3. 1. 2, 3.</note>; thereby personating the state betwixt himself and the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> who, though they had not rejected him as their true and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Husband, yet they had gone a whoring after the inventions of the Gentiles, and provoked God to give them a Bill of Divorce.</p>
               <p>Whilst I am here affirming, that a people who own one God, may yet commit Idolatry, I mean not this meerly of such who judge him to be, Nature, the Sun, or the Soul of the World, all which are finite or imaginary Objects, and by consequence, Idols, as often as they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51259:43"/>
are adored in the place of God: But I speak even of the Gentiles who own'd one true incomprehensible Creator; who with <hi>Callicratidas</hi> the Pythagorean <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>FIrst, their Idolatry consisted in the worship of the Statues of God. This, indeed, was not the highest degree of that false Religion, for they did not, hereby, dethrone God, and give to the creature his most essential perfections; but yet they gave away such honour as he had not bestowed who was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of it. They did so, in the worship, both of the natural, and of the artificial Statues of God. The Principal natural Statue was the Sun. For some of the Philosophical Gentiles made not the Sun it self the ultimate Object of their worship, but they adored God in it. Hence they gave to <hi>Vulcan</hi> [that is, the Sun] the Name, sometimes of God, and sometimes of Fire, as <hi>Plutarch (c)</hi> instructeth us out of <hi>Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Statues or Images of God. The same excellent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher upbraideth the Persians for neglecting the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the fruitful Earth, and the glorious Sun, and the great path of Commerce, the Sea; and chusing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51259:43"/>
the devouring Fire as their Statue and their God. In which words, he supposeth the presence of a Deity in the Fire, and the Fire to be only the Statue or Image of it, according to the <hi>Persian</hi> Theology.</p>
               <p>Now, in Two things, consisted the Idolatry of the Heathens, whilst they worshipped the natural Statues of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They were Idolatrous in setting up those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Statues, as the places of Gods peculiar Residence. And this the Fathers objected to the Heathens; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that Christianity represented God, as one that filled the World, and not as one that dwelt (like a Star) in some coelestial Sphear; and taught them in their Prayers to him, to exalt their thoughts above all material Heavens: Or (as <hi>Origen</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orig. contr. Cels.</hi> l. 7. p. 362. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c.</note> is pleased to express it) <hi>above even supercoelestial Places.</hi> And for this they had Reason: For the Gentiles, by worshipping creatures as Gods Statues, gave Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative honour to them, whilst he owned them only as his workmanship, and not as his especial Images or Temples. Thereby, likewise, they bred in their minds a dishonourable Idea of God, as of one who, like a finite Being, dwelt in certain places. This was not the notion of him amongst all, but the worship of him by natural Statues made all of them prone to it. <hi>Plato</hi> himself was under the Temptation. He was not come to any determinate belief concerning the Stars, whether they were Gods, or only the Statues of them. But, upon supposition that they were Statues (the part to which he is most inclined) he would have them honoured beyond all Statues on earth, as being made such by a Divine Power <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom.</hi> p. 983, 984.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Gentiles were guilty of Idolatrous Worship, in making some, at least, of the natural Statues of God, voluntary and authoritative disposers
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51259:44"/>
of good and evil, under God, in the World; though not as the supreme dispensers of them. They believed the Stars to be animated [at least with an assistant form] and as <hi>Maimonides</hi> reporteth of them <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Maimon. de Idol.</hi> l. 1. c. 1. p. 3.</note>, created by God for the Government of the World. And we receive it upon the valuable Authority of <hi>Garcilasso de la Vega</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">L. 2. c. 1:</note> that the <hi>Ynca's</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> adored the Sun as the visible Deity, by which the greater God, who was invisible, ruled this World.</p>
               <p>A due confideration of this Fancy amongst the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, leadeth us to the true Original of Astrology, and to a right account of <hi>Talismanick</hi> Statues. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Astrology pretendeth to be Natural and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical, and to solve the effects it foretelleth (if any it doth, besides those of Light and Shadow, as in Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) by the mechanical influence of the Stars, which variously combine their light and heat. But the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian, Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Astrology was, in truth, an Astrological Magick, built upon the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis of their Demons, and the Heavens which they governed. And they did not think that the Stars wrought a mighty effect, or impregnated a Talisman, by their proper virtue, but as they were either Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences themselves, or divinely influenced and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Demons which resided in them, and governed part of this lower World. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Diod. Sic. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl. Hift.</hi> l. 2. c. 30. p. 113.</note> assigned Twelve Gods as Governours of the year, and apportioned to each of them one sign in the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack. To these they added Thirty Auxiliary Gods in Thirty Stars, of which Fifteen were to have inspection on things below the earth; and Fifteen above it. And in the Kalendar of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>

Quintilis</hi> or <hi>July, Ceres Sextilis</hi> or <hi>August, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can September, Mars October, Diana November, Vesta December.</hi> At this day the Astrological Judgments refer to demonology. Thus <hi>Saturn</hi> the severe Demon, is made to signifie malicious persons; <hi>Mars</hi> the Bloody Demon, furious, proud, valiant persons; and by their Influence to dispose to such Qualities. The Horoscope or Ascendant is made the principal of all Angles, or if not that, then the <hi>Culmen Coeli</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> and this judgment at first came from the worship of the Sun the principal Demon, and most reverenced in those Angles.</p>
               <p>In this worship then, although subordinate, The Gentiles placed Gods Authority where God himself had not done it; and their Hopes, and Fears, and Thanks, respected certain Creatures, when they were due to God, dispensing good and evil immediately by himself; or if by them, doing it by them as ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Causes, not as sharers in his Government. But of this, more, when I come to consider their worship of Demons; of which, the Stars themselves were one sort to some of them, whilst they ascribed to them a high degree of perception and voluntary Power. They thought of the Sun as of an Archangel; though the Disciples of the Philolaick Systeme called it only the Organ of God <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dorylaits, ap. Censor. de die nat.</hi> c. 13. p. 57.</note>, and the Divine Harp, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Harmony which its motion gave to the rest of the coelestial Bodies.</p>
               <p>Again, they erred in their worship, about the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and instituted Statues of God.</p>
               <p>Some of these Statues were, possibly, at first, no more than monumental Pillars, and Records of some extraordinary work of God, discerned to be the effect of his finger, by proof of sufficient Reason: And so far the Gentiles were commendable, as well as <hi>Jacob</hi>

               <p>But I cannot go on in praising them, for the honour they gave to other kinds of Statues, which their fancy erected to the supreme God.</p>
               <p>Of these, some had less Art bestowed on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great pieces of Wood or Stone, without any Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of Man or Beast, of Fish or Fowl, carved or painted on them.

Such Statues they worshipped two ways, first, as the Symbols of Gods especial presence: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as pledges of his favour to them, wheresoever he was, so long as they held them in possession; and both ways they egregiously offended. They offended by worshipping such Statues as the Symbols of Gods espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial presence. For thereby they ascribed the relative honour, due to Gods true Shechinah, to an Object which was exalted to that Divine condition, not by his approbation, but by their fancy. And if their fancy was moved to this false estimation, by some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing effects wrought before them, upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Religious Rites, they were Idolatrous in that case, by honouring the power of Demons asGods Omnipotence. For God permitted evil Spirits to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce those Pagans, by strange and uncommon opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wrought at their Statues, who refused to live in the use of their Reason. Further, They transgressed in using Statues as the pledges to assure them of Gods favour, so long as they remained with them. Such were the <hi>Ancilia,</hi> and the <hi>Palladium</hi> introduced by

               <p>A Second branch of the Idolatry of the Gentiles, even of their Philosophers, and men of deep disputation, was the worship of Demons.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> By worshipping Demons as Powers which, under God, had a considerable share of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, by Commission from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By worshipping Demons which were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, or wicked and accursed Spirits.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By their immoderate officiousness towards these inferior Deities, which left them little leisure for attendance on the supreme God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Gentiles committed Idolatry by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Demons, as Powers which, with subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, did, by his allowance, manage a great part of the Government of the World. They did not deny the supremacy of God, but they imagined that he ruled not the World by his immediate Providence, but by several Orders of Demons and Heroes, as his Substitutes and Lieutenants.

only useth his Angels, and it may be useth not departed Souls so far as this amounts to; it is plain Idolatry to worship Demons, as did the Gentiles, in that quality of divine Lieutenants. For from them they expect good and evil; them they fear, them they thank. When God sendeth fruitful Seasons, and by them Plenty, they send up their acknowledgments to the Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. When God healeth them, they sacrifice to <hi>AEscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> as to him that removed their distemper from them. This is a very great Iniquity, and the common grounds or occasions of it are highly unworthy of the true God. For most of them who believe not his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Providence, do measure his actions by those of worldly Potentates. They conceive him out of state, to do little by his own person; or out of ease and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to commit the management of his affairs to others, both by temporary command, and by standing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. As if the greatest variety of business could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract or weary him, who is Infinite in Knowledg, and Greatness, and Power. Thus St. <hi>Cyril</hi>

                  <hi>THirdly,</hi> The Gentiles were Idolaters in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Statues or Images of Demons or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe's, either as those Powers were reputed the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God; or as they were really evil spirits. The Religious Honour given to the Prototype was Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and therefore the Honour done to the Image respecting the Prototype, was such also. So he that bows towards the Chair of an Usurper, does give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the honour of the true Soveraign; because the external sign of his submission is ultimately referred to the Usurper himself.</p>
               <p>The Honour which the Gentiles did to their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, redounded generally to their Demons; for their Theology did not set up such Images (whatsoever vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar fancy or practice did) as final objects of worship, or Gods in themselves. It set them up as places of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Residence, wherein the <hi>Genii</hi> were thought to dwell, or to afford their especial presence in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and other Supernatural aids; as the true God was said to dwell amidst the Cherubims.

               <p>But let us return to our Argument from this short digression. In pursuit of it, it ought to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that the Writers of the Old Testament seem to speak very differently from <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> in this matter of the Worship of Images and Statues. They seem to upbraid the Gentiles as the Worshippers of the very Statues themselves, without further reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God or Demons. There stood in <hi>Zion,</hi> then a Fort of the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> certain brazen Images, as <hi>Talismanical</hi> Protectors of it <note n="e" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Greg.</hi> Notes on the place.</note>; in them the people trusted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that <hi>David</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 6, 7, 8.</note> could not take that Fort till he had removed those divine Guards. With these <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> reproached the people, calling them <hi>the Blind and the Lame, which his soul abhorred;</hi> that is, such
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51259:54"/>
Idols as had eyes and saw not; feet, and walked not. Other Prophets argue with Idolaters from their own experience; and appeal to them, whether their Idols could hear, or see, or help them? and whether they were not the works of mens hands which they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 41. 7, 21, 22, 23, 24, 29. &amp; 44. 9, to 20. &amp; 45. 20. &amp; 46. 6, 7. Hab. 2. 18, 19, 20. Zach. 10. 1, 2.</note>? They mock them as such who prayed for a prosperous Journey, to an Idol that could not move; and who worshipped one part of a dead Tree, which by the other part of it, served for fuel; for fuel, not for their Altars but for the ordinary fires of their Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin. They do not deride them as vain men who trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a creature which had no power or virtue in it but what it derived from God, as a late <hi>French</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor seems to suggest <note n="b" place="margin">

One would be apt to conclude from such scoffs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that the Gentiles made their very Images their ultimate Gods.</p>
               <p>They did so by interpretation, but not by direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind, unless they were the very scum of the scum of the world. Those who had any measure of understanding discoursed after the manner of <hi>Clinia</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Eleventh Book of Laws <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus,</hi> l. 11. p. 930, 931.</note>. <q>Of the Gods (said <hi>Clinia)</hi> some are seen; to others, which we see not, we erect Images and Statues. And though these Statues be in themselves without life; yet we esteem them animated Deities, and believe whilst we worship them, that they are very favourable to us.</q> The barbarous <hi>Americans</hi> made the same distinction with the Philosophical <hi>Clinia.</hi> They were upbraided by Frier <hi>Gage</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51259:54"/>
answer from them. They told him that themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Image to be but wood of it self; but that they knew also by their own ears, that it had spoken to them: they thence concluded that a God was in it, and that on such a miraculous voice, they rightly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their devotion. This excuse then was common, but so was not such extraordinary operation as the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> spake of. If it had been vulgarly notorious among the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Assyrians,</hi> the Prophets would scarce have appealed to them, whilst they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of the nullity and vanity of their Images; for then the people might have refuted their Argument by professing their experience of signs and wonders. But nothing was done Supernaturally by many of their Statues. Their Priests and Statesmen deluded them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with their Tales and Arts; and they sacrificed many of the Provisions for their BELS, to their own stomack. <hi>Haly</hi> speaketh <note n="a" place="margin">

Hence (as he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) Sythes and Clubs, and Thunder-bolts were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages to their Idols. I will end these Instances with a Discourse of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s in his fourth Epistle. <q>For Idols, who is there that doubts whether they be void of all perception? But when they are by an honourable sublimeness, placed on their Thrones, and observed by them who pray and offer Sacrifice; those Idols by the likeness of animated members, and of organs of sense (though indeed there be no life in them) do so affect the minds of vveak people, that they appear to them to live and to breathe: They do so especially through the veneration of the multitude, vvhilst so pompous and so divine a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is bestovved on them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There being then in most of such Idols, no divine virtue, but an artificial form and motion; they vvho worshipped them, whatsoever they intended to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51259:56"/>
in them, were truly said to worship them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. This I may illustrate by the confession of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi> who was once himself a Pagan Infidel <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Arnob.</hi> l. 1. p. 22, 23.</note>. <q>I worshipped (said he), Oh my blindness! such Gods as came out of the Smith's Furnace, and such as were fashioned by the Hammer and Anvil. I worshipped the bones of Elephants:</q> [for they, as <hi>Peireskius</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Prophets therefore used an Argument most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodable to the Gentiles, and tending the most ready way to their conviction. For if they vvould not have been most sottishly credulous <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <hi>See</hi> Isa. 46. 1, 2.</note>. The Fathers in their Disputations with the Heathens, do frequently use this Argument against their Images, and deride them for worshipping things which can neither help men nor themselves <note n="e" place="margin">

                  </note>. And thence by the way, I take leave to observe that if they believ'd the Bread to be Christs real natural body, they argued with Inconsistence.

Judg among your selves (said he in effect) whether this Statue thus framed can be a God, what divine power soever you think to reside in it; yet you do by interpretation, make it your God, because you worship that which is before you, and there is nothing but the Image it self; nothing in it, no virtue issuing from it.

And the Prophet does not only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue against an Idol as against a thing made with hands, but also as a Statue which contained in it no more of Coelestial influence than a common Image. For he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth in the sixth verse, that it was to be broken; and in the fifth, seventh, and eighth verses, he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that it could not save them from Captivity, but on the other hand, exposed them to it.</p>

               <p>LAst of all, the Gentiles were Idolaters by justling out the Worship of the Supreme God, or very much of it, through their officiousness in the service of Inferior Deities. They could not but be guilty if they gave away Gods honour, in whole, or in part. And in part at least, it is certain that they converted it to the use of Creatures. God who governeth the World
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51259:57"/>
ought to have received the honour of their devout Prayers, and becoming Sacrifices; and the greatest part of these, and sometimes the whole of them was offered to Daemons. For who esteemeth that Tenant faithful to the honour and interest of his Lord, who payeth the greatest rent to another, and offereth him a pepper-corn, though he hath reserved the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and the very reception to himself. Divers Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters cannot be at the same time observed with equal duty: and Devotion cannot flow in the same plenty, in divers streams, as in one. Therefore when <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> multiplied Deities, and introduced Statues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> their Religion was immediately much debased: when they had many <hi>Jupiters,</hi> and a great croud of other Deities, and every Deity had its Statue, its Altar, its Sacrifice, its Temple; little time was left, and as little zeal for the Worship of the God of Heaven and Earth. To him some of them scarce ever said a Prayer, or offered a Sacrifice. <hi>Porphyry</hi> thought not such services to be agreeable to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Porphyr. de Abstin.</hi> l. 1.

Jul.</hi> l. 2. p. 60, 61.</note>, but he concluded that men were to adore him, <q>Without words, without Sacrifices, in silence, with a pure mind. But this was a Worship so abstracted,</q> that few other Heathens either performed it, or so much as understood it. Yet some might do both. For <hi>Confusio</hi> the famed Philosopher of <hi>China</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Israelites</hi> by their Constitution were of all Nations a people the most averse to Idolatry. Their first Commandment prescribeth the Worship of one God. Their second forbiddeth external religious honour to graven Images; which by the exhibition of that honour, whatsoever they were before, become very Idols. Wherefore St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> thus renders the sense of the Command, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self an Idol.</hi> And the contention about the Translation of <hi>Pesel,</hi> by Graven thing, Idol, or Image, is with respect to the design of <hi>Moses,</hi> an unnecessary Grammar-War. This second Command against the Worship of Images, the <hi>Jews</hi> have esteemed the great Command of all. Their very Moneys have had on the <hi>Obvers</hi> the name of <hi>Moses</hi> inscribed; and on the <hi>Revers,</hi> that second precept or prohibition <note n="b" place="margin">

by them in the name of God, by which they often called their false Deities. It may seem to forbid not so directly the breach of <hi>Neder,</hi> a Vow to the Lord, as <hi>Schefugnah,</hi> (according to the distinction of the <hi>Jews)</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Fagius</hi> on Numb. 30. 3. and see Deut. 20. 10.</note>, a Vow by the Lord, or by his Name, when that Name was used in signifying some Idol. I say it may seem so to do; for that it does so, I rather guess than affirm. In this conjecture I am helped by <hi>Tertullian:</hi> That Father discoursing concerning the unlawfulness of naming the Gods of the Gentile-world <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertull. de Idololat.</hi> Sect. 20. p. 97, 98.</note>, maketh use of this distinction; he teacheth that the bare na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of them is lawful, because it is necessary in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but he condemneth the naming of them in such manner as if they were really Gods. After this distinction he pursueth the Argument in this manner: <q>The Law saith <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 23. 13.</note>, You shall make no mention of the names of other gods, neither shall they be heard out of your mouths. This it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that we should not call them gods.

But if they must be called gods, I should add something by which it may appear that I do not own them to be Gods. For the Scripture it self calls them gods, but then it addeth [by way of discrimination] <hi>their gods, or the gods of the Nations.</hi> In such manner <hi>David</hi> called them gods, when he said the gods of the Nations were Devils—It is a customary wickedness to say, <hi>Mehercule.</hi>—And it proceeds from the ignorance of some who know not that they swear by <hi>Hercules.</hi> Now what is swearing by those whom [in Baptism] you have forsworn [or renounced] but a corrupting of the Faith with Idolatry?

Idols are <hi>Elilim,</hi> or vanities: they are very lyes, at once to use the terms the Prophet gives them, and to allude to the <hi>Syriack</hi> Version of the third Command, <hi>[Thou shalt not take up the name of the Lord thy God with a lye.]</hi> He therefore who sweareth by them without distinction, calling them gods, or giving them any names which signifie Divine Power; He that sweareth, or voweth by <hi>Coelum</hi> or <hi>Coelus,</hi> that is, the Heavens; by <hi>Pluto,</hi> or the Earth: such a one does not only dishonour the <note place="margin">See Josh. 23. 7. <hi>Neither make mention os the name os their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow your selves unto them.</hi> See Jer. 5. 2, 7.</note> name of the true God, but he doth also by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forswear himself; for he sweareth by an Idol, lie, or vanity; vowing by its help to perform his Oath, which therefore he cannot by that means perform, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he trusteth to an helpless thing, though by his trust he honoureth it as a Divine Power.</p>
               <p>Further, one great end of the fourth Command was the prevention of Idolatry. The seventh day was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as a Memorial of that one God the Creator of the World, and the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> and they who kept it holy, kept it holy to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and made profession hereby that they were not Gentiles, who worshipped many Gods, but the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> who served but one, the God of that Patriarch, and of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>

To him God spake <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 31. 12, 13, 16, 17.</note> saying, <hi>Speak thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the children of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you, throughout your Generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord who doth sanctifie you, [or set you apart as my Worshippers, distinct from those who worship Idols.]</hi>—<hi>Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the Sabbath throughout their Generations, for a perpetual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. It is a sign between me and the children of</hi> Israel <hi>for ever. For in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, and on the seventh day he rested [or ceased] and was refreshed, [or was pleased with that exceeding good and beautiful frame of things, which his Wisdom, Goodness and Power had made.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A like end there was of the Levitical Sacrifices. God needed them not; the Sacrifice of a pure and humble mind was more agreeable to him who is an Intellectual Spirit. But the <hi>Israelites</hi> doted on such a gross manner of expressing their devotion. And seeing they must needs offer Sacrifice, it pleased God to give them a Law which might at once indulge them in their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and restrain them from sacrificing unto Idols; whilft it appropriated that service to God alone, and denied it to Angels and Men.

               <p>IT appeareth then that God gave the <hi>Jews</hi> sufficient antidotes against Idolatry; and it is as manifest that their folly rendred them very often ineffectual. They by their ritual inclination, by cohabitation, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, by apish affectation of foreign modes, learned the <hi>Egyptian, Assyrian,</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Idolatries. Some of this leaven brake out in the Wilderness. There they began to lean towards the worship of false gods by ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the true one (as shall be shewed) in the unmeet Symbol of the Golden Calf. Hence God in his just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51259:60"/>
gave some of them up to the direct worship of false gods <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 7. 39, to 43. Amos 5. 25, 26.</note>, besides the true one, though not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without him. They worshipped <hi>Moloch</hi> (as some think <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Thorndik.</hi> Epilogue, c. 25. p. 298.</note> by the Tabernacle which the Priests took up, and <hi>Remphan</hi> by a Star, and the Host of Heaven. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst that Host of orderly Lights, some have placed the Prototype of <hi>Apis,</hi> and supposed him to be the Sun. But it seemeth absurd to say, that God permitted the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> to fall into the worship of the Sun afterwards, because they had worshipped him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>At the entrance of the People into <hi>Canaan,</hi> that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration who had seen the hand of God so remarkably upon their disobedient and Idolatrous Forefathers, and who by his Miraculous power and mercy were possessed of part of the good Land, did in pious manner adhere to him. And when <hi>Joshuah,</hi> under whose wise and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful conduct they had been brought over <hi>Jordan,</hi> advised them at his death, to renounce the Idols of their Fathers, and of the <hi>Amorites</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Josh. 24. 14, to 29.</note>, they with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous earnestness cried out, <hi>God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other Gods.</hi> And they ratified this holy resolution of theirs by a solemn Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and <hi>Joshuah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joshuah</hi> being dead, and that pious Generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered to their Fathers, <hi>There arose</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Judg. 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>another Generation after them who knew not</hi> [or <hi>owned not] the Lord,</hi>—<hi>but served Baal and Ashtaroth.</hi> This Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous disposition continued in the people under their Judges <note n="d" place="margin">Judg. 2. 16, 17, 18, 19. e 1 Sam. 4.</note>, insomuch that in the time of <hi>Eli (e)</hi> the <hi>Palladium</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Ark of the Covenant, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to fall into the hands of the <hi>Philistins.</hi> They were a very terrible enemy to the <hi>Israelites</hi> for many years: and in order to the removal of their yoke, and to the regaining the favour of God, <hi>Samuel</hi>

Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim</hi> [The Idols of the Sun <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Grotius</hi> on Judg. 2. 13. p. 2002. <hi>ap. Crit. maj.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> after the coming of the Messiah, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the motives of their Religion, Political Reasons against Images or Idols. For they have been forced by a just vengeance pursuing such bloody murtherers, to live dispersedly under both Christian and <hi>Mahometan</hi> Power. And in Dominions of both kinds the Worship of Graven Idols, (besides that their zeal against them, and for their Sabbath was instrumental, as the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Party, to keep them still in some sort of body), would have much obstructed their Toleration. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> would have been, from the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, averse to them; their Law forbidding all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51259:62"/>
and graven or painted Images. In pursuance of this Law, their zeal defaced the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, which had upon them the Image of their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. It did so formerly, but since that time it is so much cool'd, that they do not believe the Coin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned by the Superscription. Nay, they prefer the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Ducats which have Images upon them, before their own <hi>Sultanies</hi> which have none, but are stamped according to the will of their Prophet <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clav. Pand. Hist. Turcic.</hi> p. 139.</note>. But so it is often seen, that the principle of Avarice becomes much stronger than that of false Religion.</p>
               <p>In the days of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were noted amongst the Gentiles as the Worshippers of one God; and, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever their opinion was concerning Angels, they were not observed for any external worship with which they honoured them. That Apostate maketh this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and the Gentiles of his Age; that the Gentiles <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Julian. ap. Cyr.</hi> l. 9. 306.</note> worshipped many Gods [or Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,] but the <hi>Jews</hi> one God only. And those unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers pretend, at this day, to the strictest observance of the second Command.</p>
               <p>It may be here taken a little notice of, how the <hi>Jews</hi> have been often accused by the Gentiles, and amongst them by <hi>Juvenal, Petronius,</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> as Worshippers of the Clouds. If this reproach had been cast upon that Religion whilst the Ark remained in the most holy place, I should have thought it occasioned by that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cloud which shadowed the Mercy-seat, and towards which the high-Priest did make his obeisance. But the scandal cannot be traced (so far as my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg leads me) beyond the days of <hi>Augustus.</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>

Whether it was of Heaven or of Men;</hi> of Divine or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority. Afterwards he was induced to think that the Slanderers of the <hi>Jews</hi> mistook them for the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who made so much noise about their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and AEons.

               <p>But it is not my purpose to write an entire History of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Worship, or to tell how often they served one God, and how often they worshipped many.

Against the Authorities of <hi>Philo, Lactantius,</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> before-cited, I put into the ballance the words of <hi>Aaron. Aaron</hi> called the Idolatrous Festival, a Feast to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> making use (as <hi>Micah</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Judg. 17. 3.</note> did afterwards) of the most Revered name of God. I argue not here from the bare imposition of that word, for Idolaters did learn to give to Creatures that <hi>incommunicable Name</hi>

But I argue from the reverence which is due to <hi>Aaron</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect high Priest of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> He offendeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely against charity and good manners, who think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of such a person, that he would pacifie a clamorous people with so vile a condescension. He had a better <hi>design,</hi> howsoever the madness of the people perverted it. It cannot be thought that the God whom he served in so Sacred an Office, should be so soon forgotten by him, and so ungratefully and wretchedly dishonoured in a base <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idol, passing under the most separate name of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> It was ill enough that he set up a Symbol of Gods presence where he had not appointed him <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 12. 13. <hi>Take heed to thy self that thou offerest not thy burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in every place that thou seest.</hi>

It was a crime sufficiently high that he had erected an undue Statue, or an arbitrarious external sign of Gods presence, though not an Image of him; for such the Cherubims were not. For I suppose he took his Pattern from part of what he saw in the Holy Mount, when the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God came down upon it, attended with Angels.

at the Appearance of <hi>Apis,</hi> he imagined them triumphing at that defeat of his Forces which he had newly sustained. By this it is plain, that the Idol <hi>Apis</hi> was ancient, but to me it seemeth not to have existed at all as such before the death of <hi>Moses.</hi>

And they have so confounded Fable and History, that both have been swallowed by many without distinction. This confusion hath hapned in nothing more than in their Historical Theology; and I think the story of the Idol <hi>Apis</hi> may serve as a considerable example of it. <hi>Herodotus, Pliny, Strabo, Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> all make different descriptions of it: And the Image of that Idol in the Table of <hi>Isis</hi> does still differ from each Character in those Writers <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Pignor. de mens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Selden</hi> himself will own as truth.

There was scarce any Idol set up there, but in one respect or other it was referred to that glorious body. It scarce shined upon any thing, which was not at some time or other consecrated to it.

               <p>THE Objections of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> being thus removed out of my way, I proceed in inquiring after the true and original <hi>Apis. Apis</hi> was not ultimately the living Ox, but some Deifi'd Person, of whom the Ox was the Symbol; or (as <hi>Diodorus (a)</hi> reporteth) the <note place="margin">g <hi>Diod. Sic. l. 1. Bibl.

He was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to own so mean and dishonourable a thing of his Heathen Gods, as to acknowledg them to have been dead men; wherefore he would needs perswade the world that <hi>Apis</hi> was sacred to the <hi>Moon</hi> only. This he would infer from the white spot on the right side of <hi>Apis,</hi> in the form of the <hi>Moon.</hi> That Mark indeed is mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus;</hi> but in more ancient times the Ox had no such Character on him. <hi>Herodotus</hi> is accurate in his description, and he omitteth not his minute marks, of which this of the <hi>Moon</hi> is none. <q>The Bullock (saith he) called <hi>Apis</hi>

He mentioneth the Famine at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the supply by <hi>Apis.</hi> But concerning him he knows not whether he were a King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or a Father of a lesser Family at <hi>Memphis.</hi> Of this <hi>Apis,</hi> whoever he was, he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth further out of an uncertain Gentile Historian, that he had a Temple at <hi>Memphis</hi> built in honour of him: Also that within the Temple an Ox (the Symbol of a good Husbandman) was preserved, and honoured di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely by the name of <hi>Apis.</hi> The name of <hi>Serapis</hi> join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that of <hi>Apis</hi> in <hi>Suidas,</hi> and that City of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> mentioned by both of them, do plainly shew whence this Fable came, from modern <hi>Grece,</hi> not from ancient <hi>Egypt. Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> knew no such King of <hi>Egypt</hi> as <hi>Apis;</hi> neither is there any such Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al name before the days of <hi>Moyses,</hi> in the Chronology of <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> or <hi>Manetho;</hi> though the latter had set it down, time enough, for the name of an Idol. It is true, that in <hi>Syncellus</hi> the seventh King of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>Egypt</hi> is called <hi>Serapis.</hi> But the Judicious Reader of <hi>Syncellus</hi> will have little regard to him in this point; both because he findeth the third King in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue set down by the late, and plainly <hi>Greek</hi> name of <hi>Aristarchus;</hi> and because he cannot but know that <hi>Serapis</hi> came very late out of <hi>Grece</hi> to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> As he was originally a <hi>Grecian</hi> Deity he was no other than <hi>Pluto,</hi> of whom the three-headed <hi>Cerberus</hi> was the Emblem; he having dominion (an Empire given him by their fancy) over the Water, gross Air, and Earth, though principally over the latter of them <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Kirch. Oed. Synt.</hi> 3. c. 5. p. 194.</note>. In <hi>Egypt</hi> he was received with great devotion, as if
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51259:69"/>
he had been a kind of husband to their <hi>Isis,</hi> when she signified the Earth; and a god proper for their <hi>Nilus,</hi> and their fertile soil. To this invention they soon added, and sometimes they confounded him with their <hi>Apis</hi> and <hi>Osiris;</hi> and sometimes they honoured him as the <hi>Sun,</hi> or Nature, or the Soul of the World. In the Temple of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his mighty Image reached one side of it with its right hand, and the other with its left; and it was made of all woods and metals; and by an artificial window (as has been said already) it admitted the Sun-beams. In some of its Statues he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Head, <hi>Neptune</hi> in the Belly, as also <hi>Pluto,</hi> and other Stygian Deities; in the Ears, <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> in the Eyes <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. Ibid.</hi> p. 195.</note>. Thus it fared with this Idol, which when Superstition had dressed it, was the least part of its former self.</p>
               <p>There is something in the name <hi>AEsculapius</hi> which soundeth like <hi>Apis,</hi> and on him some have fixed. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is of sufficient Antiquity, if he be (what a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man <note n="b" place="margin">

               <head>PART 6. <hi>Of the</hi> Egyptian Apis; <hi>Whether he were</hi> Moses?</head>
               <p>WHO the <hi>Grecian Apis</hi> or <hi>Serapis</hi> was, I will no further inquire. But concerning the <hi>Apis</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I will for once personate an Adventurer in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lology, and see if any new discovery may be made, or rather be guessed at. For in these Arguments he that looks for Demonstration is in the ready way of having his hopes deluded. Men here judg by Verisimilitude; and they judg persons in story to be the same by a few likenesses; such as those of name and place: and they seldom consider the many particulars in which they differ, but attend to those few in which they agree. He that hath but one mark is sometimes taken for the person by the Philological Huy and Cry: And 'tis a wonder that some Smatterer or other who has read of the Idol <hi>Semis</hi> in a Promontory nigh <hi>Lapland,</hi> has not thence found out <hi>Sem</hi> and his Off-spring in the North. I shall not argue here from the mere likeness of Names, for I am about to find out <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Apis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Learned and diligent <hi>Gerard Vossius</hi> believed <hi>Joseph</hi> to be <hi>Apis</hi>

                  </q> I know not whence he had this Tale, yet fure I am that it maketh not much for the honour of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51259:72"/>
                  <hi>Joseph</hi>'s modesty. But it is not here my purpose to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the conceits of other men; it will be well if I can any way establish my own, and shew with probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that <hi>Moses</hi> is <hi>Apis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have heard already from <hi>Eusebius,</hi> that <hi>Apis</hi> (miscalled <hi>Epaphus)</hi> was Contemporary with <hi>Chencres,</hi> and that <hi>Chencres</hi> was the <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that pursued <hi>Moses.</hi> And we may further observe, what is affirmed by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemo</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Euseb. de Praep. Ev.</hi> l. 10. c. 10. p. 490.</note> in his first Book of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Story, <q>That in the time of <hi>Apis,</hi> a part of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Forces made defection, and going forth, seated themselves in <hi>Palestine,</hi> called <hi>Syria,</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
                  </q> Now it may seem probable that <hi>Moses</hi> was this <hi>Apis,</hi> and not <hi>Apis</hi> the Son of <hi>Phoroneus,</hi> as <hi>Polemo</hi> believed; if these three things be jointly considered:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Moses</hi> was the ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> or <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Bacchus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Bacchus</hi> was the <hi>Egyptian Osiris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the ancient <hi>Egyptian Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was no other than <hi>Apis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first, it may be argued with shew of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> are the same persons under differing names, from the parallel circumstances of their Story. I speak still of the first <hi>Egyptian Bacchus;</hi> for concerning the <hi>Grecian Dionysius</hi> (or rather <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus),</hi> it is prov'd by <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that he was not put into the Calendar of the gods till six hundred and four years <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Pausanias</hi> mentions an ancient Tradition concerning <hi>Bacchus,</hi> plucked in his Infancy out of the waters. So <hi>Moses</hi> we know escaped miraculously in his Ark of Rushes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bacchus</hi> is by the Poets called [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] the Son of a double Mother. As such a one the holy History re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth <hi>Moses,</hi> to whom the second Mother was the daughter of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth it from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that <hi>Isis</hi> was the Mother of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> (or, as <hi>Lactantius</hi>

               <p>Nothing is more common in the story of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> than his going into <hi>Arabia</hi> with a mixed multitude of Men and Women; his flight to the Red-Sea; his Wars in the <hi>Arabick India,</hi> (for by that name the ancient <hi>Europeans</hi> called those Regions which lay beyond the Midland-Sea); his fetching Water out of a Rock; a Miracle mentioned by <hi>Euripides;</hi> the Image of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent carried in Procession in his Worship, and spoken of by <hi>Nonnius.</hi> All which Particulars seem to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Circumstances of <hi>Moses,</hi> to whom the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Bacchus</hi> would have appeared more like, if he had not been disfigured by the new strokes which the Mythological Painters of the <hi>Grecian Bacchus</hi> have touch'd him with.</p>
               <p>These Particulars, together with many more, are named to my hand, by <hi>Sanford</hi> and <hi>Vossius.</hi> They insist
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51259:73"/>
in especial manner on the Education of <hi>Bacchus</hi> in a Mount of <hi>Arabia</hi> called <hi>Nysa,</hi> and supposed to be but a kind of Anagram of <hi>Sina.</hi> Against this there lies an Argument which I must not conceal, though I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that either Mr. <hi>Sanford</hi> or <hi>Vossius</hi> have taken notice of it. This Argument is grounded on a passage in <hi>Curtius.</hi> That Historian telleth, how <hi>Alexander</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring <hi>India,</hi> came to <hi>Nysa,</hi> situate at the Root of the Mountain <hi>Meron,</hi> and that the Inhabitants of that place did pretend to be a people descended from <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> Their Mountain (as he continueth his story) was all covered with Ivy and Vines <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quint. Curt.</hi> L8. p. 203.</note>. To this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I would answer, that the <hi>India</hi> which <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> entred was not the <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Arabick AEthiopia</hi> of the ancient <hi>Bacchus;</hi> and that his <hi>Nysa</hi> or <hi>Nyssa,</hi> was plainly another Town from that in <hi>Curtius,</hi> being called by <hi>Diodorus</hi> (both in his third and fourth Books of History) the <hi>Nyssa</hi> of <hi>Arabia;</hi> and by <hi>Herodotus</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This being said in answer to the Argument taken from <hi>Curtius,</hi> I will add only two Remarks to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Mr. <hi>Sanford.</hi> The first, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> was nursed by the <hi>Hyades,</hi> the watry Constellation of <hi>Taurus</hi>

               <p>I Have been long already in this disquisition, but I am not yet at the end of it: For the curious may
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51259:75"/>
further offer to me with pertinence, these following Questions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> How <hi>Moses</hi> came to obtain such Divine Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> on whom he drew very grievous plagues, and from whom he removed a great Army of their necessary servants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why <hi>Moses</hi> was honoured by an Ox?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whence that Symbol received the name of <hi>Apis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> At what time this Idolatrous Worship of the Symbol of <hi>Moses</hi> commenced in <hi>Egypt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When, and for what reason, it was divided into the Worship of <hi>Apis</hi> and <hi>Mnevis?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall return something in answer to each Query; but I do not sooth up my self with the vain hope of giving such an answer as shall fully satisfie others, or so much as my self.</p>
               <p>This caution would have been the less necessary if all the other Queries had been as easie to be resolved as the first, concerning the Worship given in <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Symbol of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not my opinion alone that he was there ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured after death, with Religious Veneration. Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> said the same many ages ago. And it was not his bare opinion, but he proved it by the Authority of <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi> The place of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> which I here refer to is this <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Cyr. Alex. contr. Julian.</hi> l. 1. p. 15, 16.</note>: <q>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> was well known to the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians.—For <hi>Polemon</hi> in his first Book of <hi>Grecian</hi> History, maketh mention of him. So do <hi>Ptolemaeus Mendesius, Hellanicus, Pholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorus</hi> and <hi>Castor,</hi> and many others. <hi>Diodorus</hi> who inquired very curiously into the affairs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> says, he heard of him from their Wisemen; and of him he thus writeth: After the ancient way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that (which they talk of) under their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51259:75"/>
Deities and Heroes; the people (as they report) were first brought to live by written Laws, by a man of a very great mind, and of a most memorable new way of life among the <hi>Jews;</hi> one <hi>Moses</hi> who was called a God <note n="a" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note>. For (as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> proceedeth to note on this place of <hi>Diodorus)</hi> when they saw <hi>Moses</hi> most accomplished with every virtue, they called him a God, and, as I think of some of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they gave him divine honour, being ignorant that the supreme God had said thus to him, <hi>Behold I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee as a God to Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we have it asserted that <hi>Moses</hi> was highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And there were reasons enough for the honouring of him, and they might prove the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of making him an Idol. For Idolatry is venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion overmuch strained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> was born and educated in <hi>Egypt;</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Son of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter; he was learned in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> he shined in that Court as the Moon amongst the little and confused Lights of the <hi>Galaxie.</hi> He was the Instrument of God in doing mighty wonders; mighty beyond the power of Natural, Artificial, or Diabolical Magick. And these wonders God wrought by him in the eye of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> World. The holy Scripture reporteth of him <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 78. 12.</note> that <hi>He did marvellous things in the fields of Zoan,</hi> or <hi>Tanis,</hi> the Metropolis of the lower <hi>Egypt.</hi> Also, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 11. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that he was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaohs servants, and in the sight of the people.</hi> The Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ecclus. 45. 1.</note> calleth him, <hi>The beloved of God and man;</hi> and sheweth the favour of God towards him, in <hi>making him glorious in the sight of Kings</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Ver. 2.</note>. And though he fled out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he was even then a benefactor, removing a people whom the <hi>Egyptians</hi> dismissed with gifts; and causing their Plagues when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51259:76"/>
himself disappeared to vanish away. And though he had no way proved a Benefactor, his very power of sending Plagues had been enough to deifie him with that people, who scarce distinguish'd as we do betwixt good and bad Angels; but looked on them that wrought temporal evil, as Ministers of Justice, and not as envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and malicious spirits. Power to do hurt was reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by them, and they worshipped <hi>Typhon</hi> as well as <hi>Osiris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Red-sea he astonished <hi>Egypt</hi> with a Miracle too great and difficult for the united power of all their gods, who could neither oppose it, nor do any thing equal to it. And though hereby he conveighed <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet that deliverance of them could not but represent him, to all that heard the fame of it, as a kind and compassionate man, who saved his own Nation from the tyranny of a Prince, whose rage swelled more than that of the waves in which he perished. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> certainly oppressed his own people as well as the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites.</hi> For a proud and cruel Prince is like a Wolf, who has no kindness for any beast, though he be fiercest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sheep. And the fall of a Tyrant makes an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable sound in the ears of all the slaves which he hath bored, whatsoever the hand be by which he is humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> still grew in Eminence by his conversation with God, by his conduct, by his delivery of the Law, by the success of his arms (which <hi>Philo</hi>

                  <hi>Egypt</hi> then never enjoying so great a person as <hi>Moses,</hi> (if I except the Messiah, carried thither in the days of his Infancy, and there obscured); It is not exceeding strange that a Nation so apt to multiply her gods, should Canonize him. Neither is it on the other hand to be admired that in latter Ages their Reverence should be abated. In the days of <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reviled <hi>Moses,</hi> so far were they from adoring him as a god. The cause is manifest. They were a new and mixed generation who either preferred the new <hi>Serapis</hi> before the ancient <hi>Apis;</hi> or mistook both whilst they were blended in one. And in the time of <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Siculus, Ptolomaeus Auletes</hi> had less regard for <hi>Egypt</hi> than for <hi>Rome,</hi> a place where the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator were then sufficiently despised.</p>

               <p>FOR the second Question, why <hi>Moses</hi> was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Symbol of an Ox; I must not dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the resolution of it.

               <p>TOuching the subject of the fourth inquiry, the Commencement of the Worship of <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Apis,</hi> we must still be contented with conjecture.</p>
               <p>Much of the fame of <hi>Moses</hi> could not well arrive at the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> till after his death, the very manner of which might contribute much to his Deification. Of that it appears they had some kind of notice, by the story of <hi>Osiris</hi>

               <p>This Symbol for many years was but one, the Ox at <hi>Memphis:</hi> but afterwards it was doubled, at <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis</hi> the Ox <hi>Apis</hi> was worshipped, the Ox <hi>Mnevis</hi> at <hi>Heliopolis</hi>

               <p>Now in answer to the last Query, I am to say something about the time of the division of this Symbol of the Ox. <hi>Egypt,</hi> as a learned <note n="a" place="margin">

[Though <hi>Heliopolis</hi> be said by <hi>Pliny</hi>

                     <hi>Plin. Nat.

               <p>Before the Invasion of the <hi>Pastors</hi> there was but one King over all <hi>Egypt,</hi> who would scarce have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so open a faction, and so plain an emulation of the glory of his Imperial City. If now I had a mind to make the multiplication of this Idol almost equal with that of the division of the Kingdom (a thing no way proved) I would refer this to the times of <hi>Amosis,</hi> called <hi>Tethmosis</hi> corruptly by <hi>Josephus,</hi> and supposed to be the Contemporary of <hi>Shamgar. Amosis</hi> was that Prince who first recovered <hi>Heliopolis</hi> from the <hi>Pastors,</hi> imagined to be a sort of <hi>Arab-Egyptians.</hi> He is reputed a <hi>Theban,</hi> and from him <hi>Manetho</hi> begins his order of the <hi>Theban</hi> Kings. He set himself industriously to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> and he might grace it in the quality of a Rival of the ancient <hi>Memphis,</hi> which he had not such personal reason to be fond of. He might on this occasion set up Symbol after Symbol; for one part of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51259:79"/>
his care, and a very great one, is said to be Religion. He it was who purged <hi>Heliopolis</hi> of the barbarous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of sacrificing men; in the room of which he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted three Images of Wax, [the Symbols it may be of <hi>Apis,</hi> in the three places of <hi>Memphis, Hermuntis,</hi> and <hi>Heliopolis;</hi> which rendred him properly a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed <hi>Pluto.]</hi> What I said of his purging <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> is by <hi>Porphyry</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Porphyr. dt Abstin.</hi> l. 2. sect. 55. p. 94.</note> related from <hi>Manetho,</hi> who, where he speaks of it, does mention Calves in the plural; for he says that men were offered to <hi>Juno,</hi> and proved after the manner of the selected, pure, and marked Calves of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, there is little certainty in the story of <hi>Amosis,</hi> and least of all in the time of it. And I might say the like of that of the <hi>Pastors.</hi> And for the Bulls at <hi>Memphis</hi> and <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> I cannot but think them much later than the times of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> If they had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant long after; <hi>Herodotus</hi> who knew <hi>Egypt</hi> so well, and spake so often of <hi>Apis</hi> and of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> whose Traditions he went to compare with those of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> growing weary of this false worship, about the fortieth year of his age, and perhaps of all real Religion, invented a new one of his own, which hath grown exceeding rankly since the first planting of it, as is the manner of many deadly and poysonous weeds. In this new Religion of his he applaudeth himself as the Restorer of the Worship of one God, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vehemently against Idols.

               <hi>First,</hi> They are accused as worshippers of their Prophet in the quality of the highest Lieutenant of God. And <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself gave the occasion of this worship, by teaching them this Creed, <hi>That there is one God, and Mahomet his Prophet:</hi> setting himself as it were at Gods right hand. It is most notorious that they pray frequently to him; and they pray not only to him to intercede for them with God, but to give them present assistance by virtue of the commission which he hath received from God.

And such trust and thanks are highly dishonourable to the true God, who dwells not in any Shrine, and delights not in any false Prophet. Such Idolatrous trust some of them seem to put in the Magical coins or gems which are used by them. Many of them are mentioned by <hi>Hottinger,</hi>

He reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of the nature of the Daemons which had been worshipped in the World, and decried them as wicked and malicious spirits. God in him gave to the World the greatest help against the worship of Daemons and Idols; as shall afterwards be shewed at large, if God permit. His Apostles and followers spake and wrote with zeal against Idols; and God be thanked, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admirable success. Amongst them was St. <hi>John</hi> the Beloved Disciple. And he having shewn the Son (in one <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 20, 21.</note> of his Epistles) to be the true Image of the Father, and very God of very God, does thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to exclude all other Symbols in this dehortation, <hi>Little children, keep your selves from Idols.</hi> And with that as with advice of moment, and fit to be reserved

for a word to take leave with, he closeth his Epistle. Idols also were with zeal declaimed against, after him by divers Christians; of whom some were converted <hi>Jews,</hi> who had lived under an express Law against Images; and others were converted Gentiles, who bent themselves quite another way from their former Rites. And these expressed their detestation of Idols in such severe manner, that they looked upon Statuaries and Painters as men of unlawful Callings.</p>

                  </gap>], the contrary combinations of the principles of unity and division, was the root of the two contrary <hi>Manichaean</hi> Powers. These <hi>Pythagoras</hi> learned from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a good principle own'd <hi>Typhon</hi> (called also <hi>Seth, Bebon,</hi> and <hi>Smy)</hi> a principle of Evil and Tyranny.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Manes,</hi> he strain'd the conceit of the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Soul of the World to such a degree of extravagance, that he plac'd a perceptive spirit, (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) in every Creature. He would not so much as break his Bread, or cut a Pot-herb, though he had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty enough to eat them.

               <p>I do not recall any passage in History which sheweth concerning this monstrous Heretick, that he either prayed or sacrificed to this principle of evil. If he did neither, he yet made an Idol of it by exalting it in his mind, to that undue supremacy. And on the other hand, he turned the Author of all good into another Idol. For as we are instructed by <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his first Book of Heretical Fables, he confined that Principle to three quarters of the World, bestowing the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts upon Matter, the dark Principle, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. He likewise sacrilegiously robbed God of that part of his Providence which dispenseth righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Further, as the same <hi>Theodoret</hi> relateth, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called the Sun and Moon his Deities. Sometimes he called the Sun, Christ; and prov'd it as Enthusiasts prove their Dreams, by the Eclipse it suffered at his Crucifixion.

                  <hi>Arius</hi> heated by the Dispute betwixt Bishop <hi>Alexander</hi> and himself, maintained at length with obstinacy and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, that Christ had a beginning of his existence: That there was a time when he was not, though he was before the world: That he was not (what <hi>Origen</hi> or <hi>Maximus</hi>

                     <hi>Athan. Or.</hi> 4. <hi>cont. Arian.</hi> Tom. 1. p. 468, 469.</note>, and this is the scope of it: <q>If there be not such a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> [or, co-essential Word] as we speak of; if, from not being it came into being, and was made a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is either not true God (seeing 'tis in the number of created Beings); or, if by the power of Truth in Scripture they are forced to confess it to be true God, then they acknowledg two Deities, the one the Creator, the other a Creature: Then serve they two Masters, the one uncreated, the other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Then have they two Creeds, one in which they profess to believe the true God, the other in which they own a Deity made and formed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and called God. It further of necessity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that whilst in this blind manner they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the uncreated God, they contend against him that is created; and that [on the other hand] whilst
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51259:89"/>
they turn to the Creature, they forget the Creator. For it is not possible, by reason of the different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and powers of these two, to discern the one in the other. They therefore who are of this opinion, do plainly join [or confound] many Gods together. For this is the wickedness of them who depart from one God. Why then do not the <hi>Arians</hi> whilst they are of the same mind, number themselves among the <hi>Greeks</hi> [or Gentiles]? for they as well as these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Creature above [or besides] God who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things. But they in order to the circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the simple, avoid the name of Gentile <note n="a" place="margin">

For that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sophism of theirs, <hi>We profess not Two Uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> is plainly a delusion of the vulgar. For whilst they say, they do not maintain two Uncreated, they set up two Deities: Two of a different nature, one Uncreated, and one Created. Now if the Heathens worship one uncreated Deity, and many created ones; and these <hi>[Arians]</hi> one uncreated, and one created; neither is there in that respect any great difference betwixt them and the Heathens; whilst he that is thought by them to be created, is one of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Heathen-gods; and the Heathen-gods are of the same [finite] nature with that one of theirs, and in like manner Creatures.</q> The like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is maintained by this Father in that short Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the <hi>Arians,</hi> which we find about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his second Volume <note n="b" place="margin">

But it was his fixed opinion, that the Essence of God was perfectly invisible; and that the Essence of the Son was visible, being created.

               <p>That this last crime was charged on <hi>Arius,</hi> hath been shewed already. And I will further shew that <hi>Socinus</hi> also hath been accused of it. This being done, I will then consider of the justice of the charge, with respect both to <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Socinus.</hi>

               <p>WE see then that the <hi>Arians</hi> both ancient and modern have been accused as Idolaters. But because every man would be guilty if accusation were a crime; it will in the next place be a piece of justice, to inquire into the grounds upon which the Accusers usually proceed. And here I will first consider apart, the things with which they are severally charged; and then those things together in which they are together blamed; and declare the grounds and reasons on which they are in all these respects condemned.</p>
               <p>That which seemeth to me in this point criminal in the <hi>Arians,</hi> and not in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is the worship of Christ as Creator of the World. They took those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which ascribe to the Son of God the making of the Universe, as they plainly sound; and either wanted such confidence as the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Grammatical subtlety, by which they wrested them to a very different sense. The places of Scripture which I mean, are such as these: <hi>All things were made</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 1. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>by[the Word], and without him was not any thing made that was made. Christ is the Image of the invisible God</hi>

him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and invisible; whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers. All things were created by him, and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</hi> These words, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all other places of a like nature, the <hi>Socinians</hi> do industriously and violently draw to a scope, at which they were never aimed <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note>. It is true that the aim of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place now cited, has not been so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and critically discerned by some of the most Catholick Commentators. But in general all of them well understood that these Expressions, <hi>[The Worlds; Things visible and invisible; all things that were made; things in Heaven, and things on Earth],</hi> were such as no <hi>Jews</hi> or Christians commonly used, in speaking of the founding the Christian Church, and making the new world of the Gospel. And where it is said, <hi>That every house is built by some man, but he that built all things is God</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 3. 4.</note>; there to interpret it after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, of Gods revealing the Christian Oeconomy, as they may if they please; (for the same Key may serve for all such places), is an absurd Comment which hath no need of confutation. But with them, who have denied first the Satisfaction of Christ, and for the sake of that error, his Divinity; and then for the sake of that second error, his Praeexistence and Creative power; The beginning of the <hi>Logos</hi> is at the beginning of the Gospel; and the Creation of all things is the new Creation in Evangelical truth and righteousness; how harshly soever these Interpretations sound to the ears of the Judicious. Why go they not on, and say, that God is called the Creator of <hi>Israel,</hi> and therefore may mean the first words of the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> of that people, and not of the Material World? Why do not they Comment in this manner on the words in the <hi>Acts,

               <p>THe point in which <hi>Socinus</hi> offendeth by himself, is the Worship he giveth Christ whilst he maketh him but a man; and such a man as is but a machine of animated and thinking Matter: for though he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the word, soul or spirit, I cannot find at the bottom of his Hypothesis, any distinct substance of a Soul in Christ. If that Principle had been believed by him, why doth he suppose the Lord Jesus bereaved of all Perception as long as his Body remained lifeless in the Grave <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <hi>Vind. Conses. Eccles. Polon.</hi> p. 150.</note>? for so the Vindicator of the Confession of the Churches of <hi>Poland,</hi> written by <hi>Shlichtingius,</hi> is pleased to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: <q>We believe (said he) not only that the Soul of Christ supervived his Body, but also that the Souls of other men do the like. But if <hi>Cichovius</hi> thinketh
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51259:94"/>
that the dead do otherwise live to God, than as it is always in the hand and power of God to raise them up, and restore them to life; let him go and confute Christ, where he saith, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi>
                  </q> Now Reason (the great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> though he often took a cloud of fancy for his Goddess) can't but judg it a disparagement to the Idea of a God, to suppose such Divinity as can go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World, and hear and act in all places at once, (as Christ is by <hi>Socinus</hi> confessed to do); in a portion of living Matter, not six-foot square, reserved in the Heavens; and perceiving by the help of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on its organs. <hi>Arius</hi> advanced the Idea of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a much higher and more becoming pitch; for he, overcome with the plain evidence of Scripture, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Praeexistence of the <hi>Logos,</hi> and supposed him to be a distinct substance from Matter. And he might consequently affirm with consistence to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that Christ could know without the mere help of motion, and be spread in his substance to an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude equal with that of the Material World. For the Material World is but a Creature, one Body of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creatures; and it implieth no contradiction to say of God, that he can make one Creature as big as the collection of all the rest. But notwithstanding such amplitude, there would still be wanting infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For in the Idea of God we have no other noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it than as of such a Wisdom as sufficeth to frame the World, and to govern it after it hath been framed.</p>
               <p>Now this latter Point is that in which both <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> are together condemned, whilst both wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Christ as one who under God disposeth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth all things. It is true, that he is such: but such
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51259:94"/>
he had not been if he had not been consubstantial with the Father. In that sense he is the Father's Wisdom: and whilst <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> adore him as Gods Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet not as God; they ascribe to the Creature, the Attribute by which the Creator is known. For the Scriptures, they in opposition to all other gods, do as well ascribe the Government, as the Creation of the World, to that one God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Hear them speaking in this matter, with so loud and plain a voice, that he who is dull of hearing cannot mistake them, unless he by obstinacy make himself deafer still, and will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly hear them.

               <p>For the Church of <hi>England,</hi> she designed in her Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles briefness, and avoidance of disputes; and having professed the Faith of one God, and one Lord Jesus Christ, she doth not insist particularly on the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, or the Worship of Images. Yet in her twenty-second Article concerning Purgatory, she saith of that and of the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrine, touching Pardons, Worship and Adoration, as well of Images as of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and also of Invocation of Saints, <q>That it is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.</q> Now what can we judg of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which hath for its object something else besides God, and is contrary to the Scripture? We cannot
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51259:99"/>
but think it not a mere impertinence, but a wicked act; an act which by contradicting his Authority, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisheth his honour: and being an act of Worship, nothing less than one degree of Idolatry. Again, in its twenty-eighth Article it teacheth concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Elements, <q>That they were not by Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution or ordinance, reserved, carried about, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and worshipped.</q> By which words it noteth the Adoration of the Host in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not as an innocent circumstance added by the discretion of that Church, but as an unlawful worship; though it doth not expresly brand it with the name of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>In the Rubrick after the Communion, the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the consecrated Elements is upon this reason for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <q>Because the Sacramental Bread and Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still in their very natural substances.</q> And it is there added, <q>That they so remaining, the Adoration of them would be Idolatry to be abhorred by all faithful Christians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Rubrick doth in effect charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with gross Idolatry; for it supposeth the Object which they materially worship, to be in its natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance still a creature, and a creature disjoined from Personal union with Christ, and not (according to the words of their St. <hi>Thomas</hi>

               <p>It doth not indeed affirm in terms, that the worship of such a substance by a <hi>Romanist</hi> who verily thinks it to be not bread, but a Divine body, is Idolatry; but it saith that, whence such a conclusion may be inferred. It saith that the bread is still bread in its substance, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51259:99"/>
if it be really such whilst it is worshipped, the mistake of the worshipper cannot alter the nature of the thing, though according to the degrees of unavoidableness in the causes of his ignorance, it may extenuate the crime. Upon supposition that still 'tis very bread in its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Costerus,</hi> and it may be <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, would have condemned the <hi>Latria</hi> of it as the Idolatrous worship of a Creature, even in <hi>Paul the simple,</hi> of whom stories say that he was extreamly devout; but withal, that he knew not which were first, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles or the Prophets. And here it ought to be well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that there is a wide distance betwixt this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That Idolatry is a damnable sin;</hi> and this assertion, That Idolatry in any degree of it, and in a person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any kind of circumstances, actually damneth.</p>
               <p>I would here also commend it to the observation of the Reader, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> speaketh this of the worship of the corporal substance of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments present in the Eucharist after consecration; and not of the real and essential presence of Christ.

               <p>And this I purpose to do so far only, as Angels, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> are the Objects of this Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>Of Relicks, and the Sacramental bread, I forbear to say more than that little which follows.</p>
               <p>For the first, that which will be said concerning the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51259:101"/>
worship of Images will help us sufficiently in judging of the worship of Relicks. If they be made Objects of Religious adoration; if they be honoured as pledges of Divine protection; if they be trusted in as Shrines of Divine virtue; at adventure, and in all ages; they become as the Manna which was laid up for any other than the Sabbath-day, useless to the preservers, offensive to God, and unsavory to men of sagacious Noses. Concerning that substance which after Sacramental consecration, appeareth as Bread, that excellent Church, in whose safe communion I have always lived, doth still call it Bread. For the Priest, after having consecrated the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and received the Communion himself in both <q>kinds, is required by the Rubrick of that Office, to administer to others, and when he delivereth the Bread to any one, to use this Form, <hi>The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee, preserve thy Body and Soul to Everlasting life.</hi>
                  </q> Now a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the worship of that Substance which appeareth as Bread, will in effect be a Discourse about the Corporal presence of Christ under the shews of that creature, and run the Disputant into another Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hath been industriously sifted by Thousands. Neither are the printed Volumes touching this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject few or small. There is a great heap of them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the learned <hi>Messieurs, Arnaud</hi> and <hi>Claud;</hi> and <hi>Monsieur Aubertin</hi> hath obliged the World with a very large and laborious work, about Transubstantiation, in which may be seen the sense of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>Forbearing then any further Discourse about the Worship of Relicks, or the Sacramental bread, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Worship of Saints, Angels, and Images; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring how far the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth by her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration render them Idols.</p>
               <p>At the entrance of this Inquiry, the trueness of her
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51259:102"/>
Faith in one God and three Persons, is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and observed. The Creed which is formed by order of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> beginneth with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of that of <hi>Nice;</hi> though it endeth not without Additions. And Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> in his Reflections on those excellent Notes with which the acute <hi>Grotius</hi> adorned the consultation of <hi>Cassander</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>And Riv. in Animad. in Annot. H. Grot.</hi> p. 2.</note>, doth in this point, own the Orthodoxy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith. <q>In the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Divine Trin-unity, there is nothing (saith he) controverted betwixt <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants.</hi>
                  </q> And thus much is true, if spoken of the generality of them; for they herein adhere to Catholick Doctrine. Thus do the Protestants of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but all do not so, either here, or beyond the Seas, who commonly pass under the name of Protestants. <hi>Curcellae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> for instance sake, is called a Protestant, yet may seem no other than a <hi>Tritheite,</hi> as may appear by the first of those four Disputations which he wrote against his sharp Adversary <hi>Maresius.</hi>

The [Prayers of this] third [sort] taking them at the foot of the Letter, and valuing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of those that use them by nothing but the words of them, are meer Idolatries. As desiring of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that which God only gives, which is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the creature for the Creator, God blessed for evermore. And were we bound to make the Acts of them that teach these Prayers the Acts of the Church, because it tolerates them, and maintains <note n="b" place="margin">Consider whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not make such Prayers it self, by making th e foregoing publick Forms.</note> them in it, instead of casting them out, it would be hard to free that Church from Idolatry, which whoso ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth can by no means grant it to be a Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Letter then of <hi>Romish</hi> Forms being very scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, those who justifie the use of them must shew some other words wherein the <hi>Romish</hi> Church hath so explained her self to the World, that men may plainly know she never intended them in their common and native acception, but in a sense agreeable to the tenure of Scripture; and of such a sense Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in the place before cited, hath judged them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
               <p>If such an Interpretation be by her promulgated to the World, the force of the Objection against such Forms will be abated: abated I say, but not quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. For still such Forms are perilous amongst the vulgar, who follow the received sense of words not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51259:105"/>
their contrary Interpretations. There may indeed be a very arbitrarious use of signs; and if an Humorist will give this caution to his neighbour that when he useth the word, <hi>black,</hi> he must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as meaning, <hi>white,</hi> he shall not lye to him when he tells him that the Snow is <hi>black,</hi> and that the Crow is <hi>white;</hi> or when he writes himself <hi>Blacklous</hi> instead of <hi>Thomas Albius.</hi> But amongst others, to whom such caution is not given, and who understand nothing of this absurd humor, his reserved meaning will not salve the veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his word.</p>
               <p>Now let it be examined, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made before the world, a plain interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the abovesaid Forms, in such sort, that men cannot, without breach of charity, put upon them any other than this or the like construction, avowed by many Doctors <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <p>See <hi>S. Cressy</hi>'s <hi>Exomolog.</hi> Sect. 3. c. 3. p. 438. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. This is only that they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In his Answer to Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>'s Serm. <hi>c.</hi> 16. of the Invoc. of Saints, <hi>p.</hi> 196. this only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to Card. <hi>Perron, Prier pour Prier.</hi> i. e. to desire them to pray for us.</p>
                  </note>: <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>pray for us in order to the obtaining these or other blessings from the alsufficient God.</hi> Otherwise that Church is answerable for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and scandalous meaning of the <hi>Latine</hi> words, which are not now proper to <hi>Rome,</hi> but the language of the World.</p>
               <p>If such an Interpretation be divulged we must look for it either in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or in some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Synods, or in the Decrees of the Popes, or in the Catechism, Breviaries, Missals, or some other such Books which are publickly authorized by that Church.</p>
               <p>For the Breviarie and Missal, their Forms have been already produced; neither have I omitted any Antecedents and consequents which may decipher some hidden meaning in them. It is true, some Litanies sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, <hi>Have mercy,</hi> only to the Persons of the Sacred Trinity; using to Saints and Angels, the Form of <hi>Orate pro nobis,</hi> or <hi>pray for us.</hi> But they who
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51259:105"/>
in one Prayer desire the Saints only to pray for them, do not barely by that one Prayer manifest to the World that they still mean no more than the requesting of their Intercessions, when in an hundred other Forms they call upon them to bestow this and that benefit upon them; and sometimes a benefit which is not to be expected but from the Almightiness of God.</p>
               <p>For the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> such Forms, in the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at least of their common use, following by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its Decree, they seem rather to be Explications of the sense of the Council, than to be by it explained. For that were to make the Key first, and the Lock which it should open afterwards. But if the Breviary and Missal be explained by the Council, they receive a very dark Interpretation, and therefore next to insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. For the common sense of its Forms is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or by custom plain; and therefore their Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in a forced sense, though exceeding open, will scarce be admitted by the vulgar, who judg by that which is just before them. They like ordinary Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers plod on in the common road which is before their eyes, and mind not the directions which are engraven or written on Pillars which stand on their right or left hand. That Church should have been careful of the scandalous sound of Idolatrous Forms, considering how tender Religion is of the Honour of God: and it should have taken further care against the peril of that Idolatry which attendeth them; considering the weak capacities of the people, who will construe Idolatrous Forms in an Idolatrous sense. If the Pope shall set forth a thousand Declarations concerning the Worship of one true God, and yet shall pray in this Form, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51259:106"/>

                  </gap>, though it be but the word <hi>DEUS,</hi> or God, with a very little alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>It appeareth then that in some Forms a forced Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation doth not effectually shew the sense which is vail'd under the Letter, or rather where the Letter looks a contrary way. And for the Forms of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> does not give any open Interpretation of them, or so much as sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest that nothing is meant by them but an <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi>

And as it intends not to signifie by that word that Christ doth no otherwise give aid to his Church than by his Intercession; so neither doth it mean the like by the Patrocinie of the Saints.

               <p>If we proceed to other Councils later than that of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> inquiring in them for interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Romish</hi> Offices; they are not in pretence any more than Provincial or National Synods, not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils. Wherefore the Interpretations of such Synods (if any be found in them) are not sufficient for the enlightning and manifesting the sense of the whole Church. But so far as my observation in the perusal of them, may be of validity, I avouch that there is not in them such an interpretation as referreth the sense of the abovesaid Forms, meerly to a praying to the Saints to pray for us. In many of them <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>That which I find most opposite to the thing in hand, amidst so vast an heap of Decrees, is a certain place in the Synod of <hi>Cambray:</hi> a Synod held, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than an hundred years ago <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Camer. Ann.</hi> 1565. p. 176.</note> under <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian a Bergis,</hi> Archbishop and Duke of <hi>Cambray.</hi> The place which I mean is in the third Chapter, under the Title, <hi>de sanctis;</hi> and thus it runs:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let the Prayers of the Faithful follow the analogy and proportion of Faith. Wherefore let the less learned Populace be admonished, that when they visit the Memorials of the Saints, and implore their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51259:107"/>
aid, and according to Christian custom, repeat the Lords-prayer, that they understand that they direct them not to the Saints but unto God; the Saints being joined with them as Comprecators.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This sounds somewhat like a Plea from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church-men to the Populace of <hi>Cambray,</hi> if care be taken that they be instructed according to that Decree of their Synod. But that being a Decree enacted in a corner of the world, and in a private Synod, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suffice in all those places where the <hi>Roman</hi> Offices are enjoined, and where the use of them is continual. Further, two things are here to be observed in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this Decree: First, That the Invocation of Saints as Patrons contradicteth not the analogy of the <hi>Roman-</hi>Faith. Secondly, That the bringing of the Forms of Invocation to the Analogy of Faith in this Decree does not so much respect the Prayers in the Missal and Breviarie, as the Lords-prayer repeated more privately in the Litanies of the Saints <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Proceed we next to the <hi>Roman</hi> Decretals. In the new Decretals, which make the seventh Book in the body of their Canon-law, I can find nothing after the Creed of <hi>Trent</hi> urged upon all their Ecclesiasticks, in the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Corp. Jur. Can.</hi> l. 7. c. 4. p. 3.</note>, besides the pressing of the same Form or Oath anew by <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, upon the Doctors and Professors of all Faculties <note n="c" place="margin">L. 7. <hi>Decret.</hi> c. 3. Tit. 5. p. 126.</note>.</p>
               <p>For the Catechism of <hi>Trent,</hi> I meet indeed with such an Interpretation of the forementioned Offices, as soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to them that do not well attend, as if all were meant of requesting the Prayers of Saints on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.

Sect. 1. num. 3. p. 512.</note> is this which I am going to mention. <q>We do not after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pray to God and to the Saints. For we pray to God, that he would give good things, and deliver us from evil; but we beg of the Saints, because they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51259:108"/>
are gracious with God, that they would take us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Patronage, and procure of God the things we need. Hence we use two different Forms; for we say properly to God, <hi>Have mercy on us, Hear us:</hi> to a Saint, <hi>Pray for us:</hi> though upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we may pray to the Saints themselves to have mercy on us, for they are very merciful.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On this place it may not be amiss if I bestow these Animadversions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When it is said that <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> pray not to the Saints for the bestowing of good, or the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting or removing of evil, this is meant of absolute Prayer, (to use the terms of Cardinal <hi>Perron)</hi> by which we address our selves to the first Cause, who is God; not of Relative supplication, by which they call on the Saints as subordinate conveyers of good, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of evil. So in the Hymn, <hi>Ave Mari's stella,</hi> the Virgin is desired to give light to the blind, and to drive away our evils <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Brev. Rom. in Fest. Pur.</hi> p. 721 <hi>In Offic.</hi> B. <hi>M.</hi> p. 89, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When <hi>Papists</hi> desire the Saints to pray for them, because they are gracious with God, they mean not this only of their desire that the Saints would use their interest as Saints in their present case, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Gods immediate help; but they also intreat them either to procure of God commission to be their Patrons, or to continue his Grace to them in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the commission formerly given them. This, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is meant in those Collects, <q>where they desire God to protect his people who trust in the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Apostles</q>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51259:108"/>
is invoked with the form of, <hi>Have mercy;</hi> the Saints are called on with that of, <hi>Pray for us;</hi> (for the same form so nigh would have sounded ill, as if the Saints were equal with God); yet when the Saints are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to in distinct Collects or Hymns, the form is, <hi>Help us,</hi> as well as, <hi>Pray for us.</hi> Thus in the Hymn, <hi>Alma Redemptoris Mater.</hi> They <hi>(a)</hi> pray to the Virgin in the form of, <hi>Peccatorum miserere.</hi>

               <p>For the Books of publick Offices, their Forms have been already produced; neither can I see where the Comment of any Rubrick removeth the scandal of their Text.</p>
               <p>Concerning Manuals, they are usually composed by private Doctors, or devout Students, who often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix the Glosses of their own Reason. But nothing less than the Church it self can authentickly explain its Universal practice. And for such Manuals as are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Church, to me they seem to transcend, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to come short of, the Forms of the Missal and Breviarie. Such a Manual is that of the <hi>Hours</hi> of of the Blessed Virgin, in which if there had been any such Explication of the Forms used to her, it had been shut up together with other Manuals, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               <p>The <hi>English</hi> Romanists have had often in their hands the Manual of Godly Prayers, published at St. <hi>Omers</hi>

by <hi>John Heigham.</hi> In the sixth Edition of that Book, I find no Explication of the Worship of Saints, but much which seemeth to advance it to a degree too high for it. Under the first (or in our account the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment) the Penitent is there <note n="a" place="margin">Manual of <hi>J.

In the Litany of our Lady he hath these Forms:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Horstius</hi> in his Manual called the <hi>Paradise of the Soul,</hi> reprinted lately at <hi>Colen,</hi> and adorned with Sculptures, seems as devout as <hi>Heigham</hi> now cited; for thus he prays <note n="d" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>For the private Oral Instructions of the <hi>Romish</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks concerning the use and intent of such Forms, I pretend not to be well acquainted with them. But as to their publick Preaching I am not ignorant of one very common and no less scandalous usage. For the Preacher after a short Preface which introduceth his Text or Subject, exhorts the Congregation to say <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> in order to a blessing upon that holy business about which they are assembled. And this the Reader may see not only in the more private Sermons of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

               <p>By this Discourse it plainly appeareth that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Forms in the Invocation of Saints, does to the most vulgar ears, sound as Idolatrous: as also that that Church hath not provided any publick, direct, clear Interpretation of them, in its subsequent Synods, Missals, Breviaries, Catechism, Decretals, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Manuals, or what I likewise may add, in its <hi>Bullarium,</hi> which (as shall anon be shewed) exalteth the Canonized into the condition of Patrons and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of men.</p>
               <p>There then remaineth this only to be said by the learned of that Communion: That they who hear the Church professing plainly its Faith in one supreme God in Trinity, cannot think it meaneth by any words whatsoever to give to the Creature the supreme Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Trinity which it so solemnly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And indeed seeing all the <hi>Romanists</hi> believe the Apostles Creed, seeing many of them appropriate all <hi>Latria</hi> to God; seeing they teach in their Manuals <note n="b" place="margin">Abridg. of Christ. Doctr. in the Expos. of the Mass. p. 294.</note> that therefore all Prayers are ended with <hi>[Through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord]</hi> 
                  <q>to signifie that whatsoever we beg of God the Father, we must beg it in the name of Jesus Christ, by whom he hath given us all things;</q> some allowance is to be made them in the Exposition of those Forms, which sound as if the Saints were invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with <hi>Latria.</hi> But yet it may be demanded, whether the Forms and practice of a corrupt Church may not contradict their general Rule of Faith? Whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Forms be applied to that Rule of Faith by any but prudent Ecclesiasticks and Laicks, who are not the greater number? Whether amongst them they take not away some honour from God, though not that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51259:110"/>
which is absolutely incommunicable? And whether a Church which calleth it self Christian and Catholick, should not be more careful of publick Forms of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Prayer, (such as may render the Supplicants Idolaters, in themselves in the ignorant use of them; and to others by the external scandal) whatsoever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense the world takes in phrases of common speech. And here it were well if those who so often alledg Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> in favour of their cause, would weigh the words of a Letter of his, said to be written about a year before he died <note n="a" place="margin">Dr. <hi>H. M.</hi> of the Idol. of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> p. 321, 322.</note>. <q>To pray to the Saints (saith he) for those things which only God can give, as all <hi>Papists</hi> do, is in the proper sense of the words, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. If they say, their meaning is by a figure only to desire them to procure their requests of God, how dare any Christian trust his soul with that Church which teacheth that which must needs be Idolatry in all that understand not that figure?</q> They who believe not that these are his words, are sure unacquainted with the writings of the Author <note n="b" place="margin">See the like sense in <hi>Mr. Thornd. Epil.</hi> part. 3. p. 356, 357. cited here c. 10. part. 3.</note>, and the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Reporter. It is certain that among our selves in our more ordinary conversation, such forms of speech are used towards men, which in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent are applicable to God. We say that such Students had their <hi>Grace</hi> in the Senate-house; or that there they have been created Doctors, [a phrase it seems too crude for the digestion of some <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ass. Annot. in</hi> Gen. 1. 1. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Bara</hi> is a word in its proper sense, proper and peculiar to God: and therefore should not be attributed to men, how great soever. Yet it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar phrase in the stile of the Court to say, such a one was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Earl or Marquess, or Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> nice stomacks.] When the weak are pursued by a savage Beast, or by a man cruel as such a creature, they run into the arms of kinder persons, and desire them <hi>to save them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them.</hi> And because these Forms are used to men by those who own nothing but what is humane in them, and because the matter of their request is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently such too, and in the power of man; these equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal phrases are by general acknowledgment, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51259:111"/>
to one sense. But were civil Forms more liable to mistake, a Church, sure, should exercise a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care in those of Religion; and chuse such as might be apter to edifie than mislead the meanest in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Now in such Forms of common speech as I have mentioned, though there is not any proper worship of men, yet there is more desired of them, than that they would pray to God for us. When <hi>Esau</hi> beseeched his Father <hi>to bless him,</hi> he did not merely request him to pray for a blessing, but to pronounce over him that sentence of Benediction, which he as the Father of that Family had commission from God to pronounce with authority and to effect. And when an importunate wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow does by her repeated crys for vengeance, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick justice for deliverance and safeguard, render the very ears of an unjust Judg attentive; she intreats more of him than that he would speak for her to the King. She supposeth him in commission, and indued with power to help her, though she knows him in this very point of his assistance to be subordinate to his Prince.</p>
               <p>There is more in the Forms of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church than the bare indiscretion of them. And though the incommunicable honour of God be not by their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the rule of Faith, devolved on the creature (for a Papist so interpreting those Forms, should by that Church be condemned as an Heretick, and a violater of the fundamental Article of one God in Trinity;) yet still to me it seemeth, that the honour which God hath not actually communicated, is by them misplaced on Angels, at least on Saints.</p>
               <p>I do not, in saying this, ground my perswasion bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the common Argument of that Ubiquity which many conclude to be ascribed to Saints and Angels in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51259:111"/>
the Invocation of them <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Confess. Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temb.</hi> p. 122. <hi>Talis—Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio exigit, ut is qui rogatur, sit ubique prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens, &amp; exaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at pelitionem. Haec autem Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestas soli Deo competit; &amp; si tribuitur Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, creatura adoratur.</hi>
                  </note>. The foundation of that Argument is laid on a matter which is disputed. For they who contend that the Angels hear or know what is done on Earth, do expresly deny Ubiquity to them. Though some private <hi>Romanists</hi> have mentioned ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the person of the Virgin in distant places at the same time; and others have represented her or some other Saint as dwelling in a particular statue. And to such it is proper to put the question of <hi>Arnobius:</hi> 
                  <q>Let us suppose (said he) that there are ten thousand Statues of <hi>Vulcan</hi> in all the world, can that one Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">b <hi>Arnob. adv. Gent.</hi> l. 6. p. 204.</note> be in so many thousand habitations at one time?</q> But others infer this knowledg in the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, partly from the perfection of their spiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which (saith <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Holden in Div. Fid. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>i.</hi> l 2. c. 7. p. 294.</note> Dr. <hi>Holden)</hi> they know all the natures, motions, and actions of Corporeal things; partly from their personal presence as Guardians of men, and as Gods Retinue in Religious Assemblies; and partly from the Revelation of God, and from what they call the Glass of the Trinity, [a mirrour of which I profess my self very ignorant, and which my curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty desires not to look into; and which the inventers might in reverence have spared, rather than to have exposed the essence of God as a substance reflecting all visible Ideas]. They gather this also in part from the Intelligence given by some Angels unto the rest, who are of the same community.</p>
               <p>This they say plausibly concerning Angels; for of Saints they have much less ground thus to speak. Only this may be allowed them concerning both; that being spirits, we know not whether such distance as that of this world does hinder communication. For if it be not done by motion, they may (possibly) as well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand at the distance of an hundred miles, as at that of a furlong. This only I observe by the way as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51259:112"/>
That the Ancients, who are said to Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, held neither Angels nor Souls departed to be uncloathed Spirits, but united to Bodies of <hi>AEther</hi> or <hi>AEr.</hi> Wherefore it seemeth that their knowledg of external, material objects, must depend on Physical motion, which by distance is scattered or diverted from the streightness of its lines, and consequently from the exact truth of its intelligence.</p>
               <p>It is most probable that Angels are often absent from grown men, especially whilst they remain in ordinary circumstances. And the Scripture speaks of the Angels as being, on this or the other occasion, sent to men, and then removed from them. This is manifest in the known cases of <hi>Abraham, Daniel,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> and the blessed Virgin her self. More probable still it is, that the same Angel hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, not only of all the affairs of the world, but of all the prayers that are addressed to him. For many such Addresses being very improper, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times immoral, we must not think that God or other good Angels are concerned in telling him the news of them, unless it be in order to punishment.</p>
               <p>And for the Saints whom God hath not (that we know of) made ministring spirits; who are not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Resurrection and final Judgment, in complete glory; of whose appearing after death, the Scripture hath given us, in the Old Testament, but one instance, and that a very doubtful one (it not being certain whether it was the Apparition of <hi>Samuel,</hi> or of the Devil, or the Imposture of the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly:) And, in the New, but that one (as I remember) of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> when Christ was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured. It is not so much as by probable arguments yet evinced, that they know our particular estate, though it is evident that they wish well to the world
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51259:112"/>
of mankind, and especially to the body of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. For sure they lose not their affection in Heaven, where, whilst some other Graces cease, Charity is eternal and in perfection.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, though the praying to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may not necessarily infer their Ubiquity; and for that reason be called Idolatrous; yet if they hear us not, it may be called an unwarranted, impertinent, idle labour. It is, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> speaketh, <hi>an intruding into the things which we have not seen.</hi> And certainly when we pray not only to those that do not hear us, but to such as have no existence but in fiction; it is emphatical impertinence.

               </p>
               <p>Others have gone further in their censure, and they have called the Invocation of Saints more than an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, that is, a sinful, though not an Idolatrous practice. And indeed so plain a misuse of a mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son cannot but be offensive to the Creator, who gave it not to man that he should trifle with it. But this is not their manner of arguing. They tell us such Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not of Faith; and that whatsoever is not of faith is sin. But what Art of thinking teacheth them to draw consequences on this fashion? <q>Whatsoever is done by man against the present perswasion of his Conscience, which admits it with great reluctancy as irreligious, is in him sinful: Therefore the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints or Angels by <hi>Papists,</hi> who desire them to pray for them when they do not hear, though they in their Conscience believe they do; is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice, because it ariseth not from faith or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</q> Had they said every thing in such weak and unconcluding Logick, they had wounded their own cause more than that of their Adversaries.</p>
               <p>If now there were nothing in this <hi>Romish</hi> Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on besides their desire of Angels and Saints to pray for them to God Almighty, I should forbear to call it Idolatry, and give it the softer names of misperswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impertinence, irrational or fruitless beating the air. For they amongst them who are the more prudent, suppose the Saints to hear them by other means than
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51259:113"/>
by Divine Omnipresence, and infiniteness of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and they call upon them for such an Office as a good man on earth would do for them, much more a Saint or Angel in Heaven. For what Christian will deny the Petition of his Neighbour, when he desireth him only to pray to God for him? unless perhaps he neglecteth Prayer himself, and appeareth to have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a sin unto death, of which they are scarce guilty, who beg the Prayers of others; such piety being sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom discerned either in presumptuous Christians, or in Apostates.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Romish</hi> Invocation there is much more than a praying to Saints and Angels to pray for us. It is not indeed intentionally the worship of any of them under the notion of a supreme God, how high a note soever doth sound in their Forms; for that their own Church renounceth as Idolatry. And the Church-men teach the people <note n="a" place="margin">Abridg. of Christ. Doctr. in Expos. of 1. Command. p. 123.</note>, <q>That it is lawful to worship Angels and Saints with <hi>Dulia,</hi> or inferior honour, proportioned to their Excellency, but not as God, or with Gods honour.</q> They give not to them Gods incommunicable honour, if they understand the Rule of their Faith; but to me they seem to give them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour beyond the proportion of their Excellency, even that which God hath to himself reserved. This is plain by the natural construction of their Forms, which they have not otherwise interpreted, but confirmed this meaning of them by their Doctrines, and by their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice. This is that which I here mean, and think I shall evince: That though they make not any Saint or Angel the supreme Governour of the World, yet they constitute the Spirits of either kind, Deputies or Lieutenants under God, and suppose him not only as occasion serveth, to use their Ministry, but to make them Guardians, Patrons, and Patronesses; and to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51259:114"/>
allow them for such upon the choice of Worshippers on Earth. They instruct the people in their Manuals, not only how to address themselves to their Guardian-Angels <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>I have said that it is more tolerable to pray thus to Angels, than it is to Saints; but I can find little ground in Reason or Scripture thus to worship the Angels themselves. Reason teacheth that God who made the World is the Governour of it. The Scripture teacheth that there are distinct Orders of Angels, but it disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of such Lieutenancy under God, as men have ascribed to them. It mentioneth Thrones, and Powers, and Dominions, and Principalities; yet rather in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (as was above conjectured) than by way of assertion of such Orders. Those Hereticks <hi>Irenaeus</hi> provoketh to tell what <note n="b" place="margin">

So ignorant was the Christian World in his time of the Nine Orders of the feigned <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite.</hi> That there are distinct Orders of Spirits; that there are Angels and Archangels, I firmly believe. But it does not thence follow, that the Government of the World is shared amongst them, though they have a Ministerial part in the affairs of it. Archangels seem no other than the seven Spirits typified by the seven

Lamps in the Temple <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 4. 5. &amp; 8. 2.</note>. Their Office was as elect and eminent Spirits, to minister before the Throne of God, and on solemn occasions to be sent in Embassie to the World. Such a one was <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who stood in the Presence of God; and was sent to the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Nothing of this inferreth their distinct Provinces committed to them, but it sheweth only the dignity of their station, and their occasional Ministry. Neither doth it follow from the seven Angels mentioned as Presidents of the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> that they, as some have taught, were under the Charge and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of seven Spirits. For St. <hi>John</hi> is required to write to these Angels <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 1. 19, 20. &amp; 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note>, and to reprove their faults, [as the abatement of Love in the Angel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and his Church.] And he makes distinct mention <note n="c" place="margin">Chap. 3. 1.</note> of the seven Spirits, and the seven Stars, which latter he had shewed to be the Angels of those Churches <note n="d" place="margin">Chap. 1. 20.</note>, and who were therefore no other than the Bishops of them, called by a name which is given the High Priest, in the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi>

It is also to be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51259:116"/>
confessed that <hi>Elisha</hi>'s servant (to reflect a little on his instance) saw fiery Chariots and Horsmen in the Mount: and that this was a representation of Gods Angels in the scene of a Camp. But no other Argument ought to be fetched thence, besides that which concludeth that there is a greater power in God and his Coelestial Ministers than in the Armies of the World. He that will torture this Vision, and make it confess commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Officers amongst them, ought also to make them ride on Horses and Chariots. For evil Angels, their dominion is oftner mentioned than that of the good. But certainly, though they are called in Scripture, <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> no man that carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to his words, will call them also subordinate Governours of the World. For they are professed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against God, who doth not own or treat them as his subjects; but he being provoked by the perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of wicked men, permitteth those rebellious Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to exercise great power amongst the children of disobedience, who are in indirect Covenant with them.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51259:116"/>
as it were, the Saints have been guided to seek for those things at the hands of God and Christ, which he was about to accomplish. Also, that the Saints in Heaven, <hi>before the day of Judgment, have a share and an hand in Christs government of the world:</hi> and that they have a knowledg <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Those of whose Saintship we have better assurance, though in a state of rest and light, are esteemed by the Fathers but a kind of Free Prisoners, not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the publick Sentence of the General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Iren.</hi> l. 5. c. 31. p. 431.<hi>—Animae abibunt in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibilem locum,—&amp; ibi usque ad Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morabuntur,</hi> &amp;c.</note>. And their opinion who give them a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy under God in the Government of the World before that day, does recall to my mind the Argument used by that truly great man Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in his own unhappy Case: He pleaded that the grant of a Commission from the King, did argue him to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; and that he who had power given him over others, was no longer under a sentence against his own life. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> do not now rule us, and it may be, they are ignorantt of us: which whilst I affirm, I do not wholly ground my Assertion on the Text in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Isa. 63. 16.</note>. That soundeth otherwise, whether we take it in its positive or hypothetical sense. Its positive sense
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51259:117"/>
may be this: <q>Doubtless thou art our Father, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we live not under the care of <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Isaac,</hi> but are by many generations removed from them, who therefore knew us not <note n="a" place="margin">LXX. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>, or own'd us not, we being not men of their times; we are their seed however, though at a great distance; and to such also was thy promise made. And for the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical sense it may be this: Be it supposed that <hi>Abraham</hi> knows nothing of us, yet certain we are that thou art the God of <hi>Israel</hi> whose knowledg and care of thy people never faileth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I admit here, that the Saints pray for the Church in general, that Angels are concerned in particular Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations; but that Angels and even Saints have shares of the Government of the World, though in subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God, so as to be Commission-Officers under the King of Heaven, and not only Attendants on his Throne, and as it were Yeomen and Messengers of his Court, (the general condition of the Angels) I cannot admit without peril of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>This in my conceit is the great resemblance betwixt the <hi>Romanists</hi> and the Gentiles: Both of them suppose the World to be ruled under God, by several Orders of Daemons and Heroes; though I have confessed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that they are not so exactly alike but that <hi>Rome-</hi>Christian may be distinguished from <hi>Rome-</hi>Pagan.

fall words not unfit to be here gathered up by us. <q>Christians (saith he, meaning those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion) retain a Religion like to this; for they worship God immortal: and for those that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in Virtue, and shine with Miracles, first with great pomp and inquisition they register them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Deities [or Saints] and then they worship them, and after that they erect Temples to them; as we see in the case of S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> S. <hi>Magdalen,</hi> and other Deities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this point, then, let us join issue, and offer on our side the manifestation of these particulars.</p>
               <p>First, On what occasions this worship of Ruling-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits came into the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How it derogateth from the honour of God as Governour of the World.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How it derogateth from the honour of Jesus as the Mediator and King ordained by God.</p>
               <p>First, For the occasions of this Worship, I conceive them to be especially these two; The Celebration of the Memory of the Martyrs at their Tombs; and the compliance of the Christians with the Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they invaded <hi>Italy</hi> and other places, in hope of appeasing them, and effecting their conversion.</p>
               <p>First, I reckon as an occasion of this Worship, the celebration of the memory of the Martyrs at their Tombs, and Monuments, and Reliques, and in the Churches sacred to God, in thankfulness for their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. The thankful and honourable commemoration of the Martyrs, was very ancient and innocent at the beginning. For, as the Epistle of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> concerning the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> testifies <note n="a" place="margin">Ep. Ec. cles. <hi>Smyrn.</hi> ap. <hi>Eus.</hi> Eccles. Hist. l. 4. c. 15. p. 134, 135.</note>, <q>They esteemed the bones of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs more precious than Jewels; They kept their Birth-days [that is, the days of their Martyrdom on
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51259:118"/>
which they began most eminently to live]; they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd them with a worthy affection, as Disciples and Imitators of Christ, but they worshipped none but Christ, believing him to be the Son of God <note n="a" place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. p. 134. D.</note>.</q> But laudable Customs degenerate through time. And this, in the fourth Century, began to be stretched beyond the reason of its first institution, as appeareth by the Apostrophe's of St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and others of that Age. Afterwards the vanity of men ran this Usage into a dangerous extreme; and those who had been commemorated as excellent and glorified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and whose Prayers were wished, were directly invoked and worshipped as the subordinate Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Gods Church.</p>
               <p>This Veneration of the Martyrs, which superstition thus strained, was occasioned by the Miracles which God wrought where his Martyrs were honoured. Times of Persecution at home, and of Invasion from abroad, required such aids for the Encouragement of Catholick Christians, and the Conversion of Infidels and misbelievers. Thus in the days of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> [in whose Age the <hi>Getae</hi> or <hi>Goths</hi> sacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and many of the barbarous people imputed the present misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>Italy</hi> to the Christian Religion <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Ludov.

               <p>This Instance, no doubt, heightned the veneration of many towards the Martyrs, though God wrought such things, not as testimonies of the power of the Martyrs, but as supports to the Christian Religion. And this being an Instance in the <hi>Gothick</hi> story, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of</p>
               <p>The second occasion of the worship of Spirits as Rulers of the World in certain Precincts, especially in this Western Church; to wit, the Invasion of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations, who sought their preferment by quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their own Country. In <hi>Rome</hi> it self a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Senators worshipped Idols in the very reign of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great. And many worshippers of false gods, upon the Sack of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Goths</hi> under <hi>Alaricus,</hi> did, saith St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the Argument of his Book of <hi>the City of God,</hi> charge the calamity on the Christian Religion, and blaspheme the true God with bitterer words than it was their custome to use. And this (as he declareth) stirred up his zeal, and moved him for the stopping of their ungodly mouths, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing their Errors, to write that Book. For the <hi>Goths</hi> themselves, the general body of them was barbarously Idolatrous, (though some of that people had received betimes the Christian Faith; for <hi>Theophilus</hi> a <hi>Gothick</hi> Bishop was at the Council of <hi>Nice)</hi> and the <hi>Vandals</hi> were wholly Pagans.

               <p>Now the Northern Barbarians being so inclined to the worship of Tutelar Daemons, it is no wonder if many Christian-<hi>Romans,</hi> to mollifie their savageness, and to induce them to Christianity, so far complied as to offer them Tutelar Saints and holy Angels instead of their evil Guardian Spirits. This, I suppose, they did, because I find the Concurrence of their Invasion and stay in <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the rise and growth of Daemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship there, both happening in the fourth and fifth Centuries. And it may not be unworthy the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reader, that in the fifth Century, St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> the Archangel, a most eminent Patron (as we just now heard from <hi>Felix Faber)</hi> among the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Christians, was first Commemorated in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Church, by a solemn Feast <note n="a" place="margin">

I proceed to shew in the second place, That this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship derogateth from the Honour of God as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World by his immediate self, though also by a Substitute; for he is likewise the same Essential God.</p>

A good part is in these cases generally ascribed to Saints;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51259:120"/>
and it is well if some look up any higher at the time of their deliverance. We see, in the administration of political affairs, that Subjects, though owning, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, the supremacy of their Prince, yet go, often, no further, in their trust, or thanks, than to those men, who by their Place, and Office, and deputed Authority, can, very effectually, dispatch their affairs without higher Application. And he that is protected as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to a Senator, pays all his acknowledgment to his Master who received him, kindly, into his service; and not to the King who is but the more remote, though the supreme Author of this priviledg. And it is plain, from <hi>Romish</hi> History it self, that the pay goes to that Saint who is believed in Commission, whilst God is, by supine inadvertence, scarce remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. So the <hi>Liber Festivalis</hi>

                  </q> I will clear my meaning a little further by proposing more instances, of which the first shall be made in the Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list <hi>Baronius,</hi> and applied unto the present occasion. This laborious Writer is looked upon as the very Champion of the Papacy. His Twelve Tomes of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical story are reputed so many Pillars of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause. That Great man in the Papacy, <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> gave great encouragement to the Author and his work. The Archbishop of <hi>Gnesna</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> as likewise other great and zealous men, who were By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots for the Papacy, thought it fit to be translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all languages; and set on foot a <hi>Polonian, Italian,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Version. If he speaks not like a true <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick,</hi> from whom shall we hear the words of a son of that Church? Hear him, then, at the end of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51259:121"/>
his several Tomes, and you will find him, owning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the supremacy of God, for that was an Article of his Faith: But withal you will find him zealously asserting a delegation of considerable power to the Blessed Virgin; as also making very thankful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of her favours, in the guidance and success of his Pen. And these remembrances are in such manner expressed, that if, by them, nothing is meant of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from the Virgin, besides the help of her prayers for him, I must search out some new <hi>Dictionary</hi> for the Interpretation of his <hi>Latin.</hi>

the most holy <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God: That it may offer to her, <hi>from whom it acknowledgeth the whole to be received,</hi> whatsoever it understandeth it hath obtained of God by her Prayers. And let it cast into her as into a most holy and living Treasury, after the manner of the Widow, two mites, collected in poverty, with great labour; the two Tomes, I mean, of the Annals now finished. Let that very Virgin be to us the most safe Ark in which our labours may be kept, and in safe custody protected; lest a thief breaking thorough (to wit, the appetite of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory), steal them away; or the moth and rust adhering to them (to wit, vain and fallacious hopes) corrupt them, or eat through them. For she is the true and divine Ark made of <hi>Shittim-</hi>wood, which preserveth from corruption, those things which are committed to her care.—</q>

To her therefore by whom the whole of this gift comes to us from God; to the most holy Virgin (I say) <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of God, we offer very humbly this third Tome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, as we have already done those other which we have published.</q>

Wherefore, for the rest of the work, perform it your self; and weave those threds, whatsoever they be (and in your hand undoubtedly they will be golden) into those Sacerdotal garments, of which <hi>David</hi> thus speaketh: <hi>Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness.</hi>—<hi>I will deck her Priests with salvation.</hi> I beseech thee make for us those two Garments; for those of thy Family are said to be doubly clothed.</q>

And as Mariners are wont to offer their Oar; so let us offer to her our Pen, that it may obtain that rich benediction from her, by which (after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> which devoured the rods of the Magicians) it may resist all the endeavours of gain-sayers, and like to that, flourish; whilst the other rods, brought by rebellious Controvertists, wither away: Lastly, That like that in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Covenant, it may be perpetually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Church, as a witness of the truth of God.

               <p>The whole of this which I have cited, and cited at such length, by reason of that credit which this Author hath obtained under the Papacy; the whole, I say, of it, both beginning, middle, and end, representeth the Virgin as a Patroness; and as one who had prevailed with God to commit to her care <hi>Baronius</hi> and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as her especial Province. He owneth God and Christ as the Fountains of Grace; but he supposeth her the Conduit, conveying them to himself. On her he trusteth; to her he offereth solemn, and repeated thanks. And though he often mentioneth her Prayers for him; yet it appeareth by the tenor of his other expressions, and of the common <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, that he meaneth not barely them; but the Guardianship which by them she had from the beginning obtained of God in behalf of the Annalist.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> have read such Discourses as these; and they endeavour to abate the force of them by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing evasion: <q>The reasonableness of making ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to one particular Saint <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51259:128"/>
their intercession may be implored by us in all kinds of necessities whatsoever: But it is grounded upon a reflexion which the Suppliant makes either upon some signal Grace which shined in that Saint above others, as Patience, Humility, Chastity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for which reason the Church saith of every one of them, <hi>Non est inventus similis Illi,</hi> there was no other found like to him) or upon the particular manner of his suffering Martyrdom, or some particular Miracle, or such like remarkable passage in his life and actions, which may serve to excite the hope of the Suppliant to obtain redress by means of his interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in a case which he conceives to bear a sutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and conformity to something acted or suffered by him. Now the efficacy of Prayer being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on hope, and it being natural to us to hope for redress where others have found it, or where it may more reasonably be expected, by reason of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular qualification we apprehend in the person to whom we address; it is manifest, that as the abovesaid reflexion serves to erect our hope, so also it conduceth to the end of Prayer, that is, the obtaining of what we pray for. Hence it is, that although all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes are really one and the same indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perfection in God; yet for pardon we flye to his Mercy; for knowledg, to his Wisdom; for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to his Power, &amp;c. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> assigns the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our sins to the Passion of Christ; but our Justification (by which we rise to newness of life) to his Resurrection. <hi>He was</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>delivered to death for our sins, and rose again for our justification.</hi> The reason whereof he gives in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> c. 2. v. 18, where he saith, <hi>That it behoved Christ to be made like his brethren in all things, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-priest in things
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51259:128"/>
pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people: For,</hi> saith he, <hi>in that he suffered himself, being tempted, he is able to succour them that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> That is, by what he suffered himself, he is made prompt and ready to succour those who are in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and temptation. For it was true even of his most Sacred Humanity, what the Poet out of the very nature of humanity made another say, <hi>Hand Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara mali, miseris succurrere disco;</hi> that by his own sufferings he had learnt how to compassionate the sufferings of others. And this was laid down by S. <hi>Paul</hi> as a powerful argument to perswade the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to put their hope in him for their reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, because he was so particularly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and fitted for that work, by what he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Why then may not a like consideration of the fitness or qualification of one Saint above others, as so conceived by us (either for his eminent perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in such a particular virtue, or some other remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able passage in his life), be taken as a motive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to address for the obtaining what we stand in need of, to his intercession before others? The Scripture, we know, to persuade us to patience in adversity, bids us <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>James</hi> 5. 10.</note> reflect upon the sufferings of <hi>Job;</hi> and why may not his eminence in that virtue, as it serves for an example of our imitation, be also taken as a particular motive of our having recourse to his intercession? And when <hi>Jacob</hi> blessed the two sons of <hi>Joseph, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> among so many Angels whose assistance he might have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, he begs for that Angel in particular to be their Guardian, who had delivered him out of all his troubles <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16.</note>. <hi>The Angel</hi> (said he) <hi>who delivered me from all evils, bless these children:</hi> And why, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he thought that he who had been so careful to

deliver him, would be as careful to deliver them? And upon this account, were I in danger of being shipwrackt, I should sooner flye to the Intercession of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had saved by his prayers all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-passengers in the ship from being drowned, than to another who had never been in the like danger. Behold here, then, the crime of Catholicks in calling particularly upon the Angel <hi>Raphael</hi> when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, because he protected young <hi>Tobias</hi> in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; upon S. <hi>Roch</hi> against the Plague, because his charity was signal in assisting those who were infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; upon S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> against Tempests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saved some by his prayers, who in a storm at Sea invoked him, while yet alive; upon S. <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> for the Tooth-ach, because all her teeth were struck out for her free confession of Christ; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Michael</hi> and S. <hi>George</hi> against Enemies, because the latter was by profession a Soldier, and a most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Martyr; and the former is recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 10. 21. and 12. 1.</note> to be the Protector of the people of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This excuse hath much more of ingenuity in it, than that of <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Alex. de Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, summ. part. 4. quaest. 26. memb. 3. Art. 5.</note>. <q>Because (said he) we miserable men, or some of us at least, are more affected sometimes towards some certain Saint, than towards our Lord himself; therefore God, having compassion on our misery, is pleased that we should pray unto his Saints.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As if God would indulge us in so unworthy and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious a passion.</p>
               <p>The former excuse (I say) is much more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it is invalid, and may be shewn to be so, by these following Considerations.</p>
               <p>First, It is acknowledged that Christs sympathy is one motive of our trust when we pray to him; but
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51259:129"/>
it is the Divinity which he possesseth, and not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity which he suffered, which inviteth us at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to call upon him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If there were as much ground to think that the Saints know our particular states, as there is to believe their charity for the Church in general, it might not be improper to apply our selves to such, whose former circumstances do best befit our present ones.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though the sympathy of the Saint be a direction to him or her, how doth this direct Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in a Tempest? She was never, that they are assured of, in peril by Sea; neither know they that she ever crossed a greater Water than that of <hi>Jordan</hi> or <hi>Nilus.</hi> If they take their ground from the derivation of the Name <hi>Mary,</hi> as signifying (saith <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Xaver. Hist. Christi Pers.</hi> p. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Xaverius)</hi> Ruler of the Sea; on what an uncertain foundation do they build? Nothing is more apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, than fanciful Etymology. And for this word, <hi>Xaverius</hi> confesseth it may signifie <hi>High,</hi> or the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of the Sea also. And <hi>L. de Dieu</hi> hath shewed, <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Dieu in Animadvers. in excerpta ex Hist. Christi.</hi> p. 540.</note> that it may as well denote a drop of the Sea.</p>
               <p>If they answer with this Author, That not only the sympathy of the Saint, but some miracle wrought after supplication, exciteth our hope, and encourageth to pray; That subterfuge shall be anon consider'd. In the mean time I only put this short question, What was it that excited the first man that pray'd to such a Saint? Not a miracle in answer of prayer; for the first prayer is sure before its answer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though many Saints have a like sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and may by license of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be prayed to apart or together <note n="*" place="margin">Yet herein <hi>T. G.</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> who saith in this matter, <hi>Nou omnia pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumus omnes;</hi> meaning that every Saint can't give that aid which some other can. <hi>G. Biel in Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to in <hi>England,</hi> and St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> yet this doth not hinder the impiety of praying to any of them as subordinate rulers under God. They are still Patrons, though some of them be a kind of joint-Patentees; and one or other of them has in all cases such power by commission, that little motive is left for immediate application unto God; and much trust and gratitude due to him is paid to these Delegates.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Angel whose protection <hi>Jacob</hi> implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the safeguard of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had himself experience of his aid, was a Diviner Spirit than either <hi>Michael</hi> or <hi>Gabriel,</hi> even the <hi>Logos</hi> of God. This is the opinion of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> declared once and again in his <note n="a" place="margin">Novat. de Trin. c. 27. p. 725. ad Calc. op. Tertull.</note> Book of the Trinity. This is the opinion of many of the Fathers, whose Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies shall be produced in my Fourteenth Chapter. At present it may suffice to bring forth that plain one of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his <hi>Thesaurus</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Cyril. Alex.</hi> Tom. 5. par. 1. p. 116, 117.</note>. <q>An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is said to have striven with the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> and this Divine Writ testifies; but the holy man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him, said, <hi>I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.</hi> Now this Angel was God; which the words of the Patriarch shew, whilst he saith, <hi>I have seen God face to face.</hi> Him (appearing to him as an Angel) he desireth to bless the Children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And a while after he thus discourseth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When <hi>Esau</hi> his Brother designed against him, he did not invoke an Angel, but God, saying, <hi>Take me, O Lord, out of the hands of my brother Esau, for I stand in fear of him.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, The story of <hi>Raphael</hi> protecting <hi>Tobias</hi> is not found in Canonical Scripture. But if it be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, a true report, this being a peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in an extraordinary case, it doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men in all emergencies to pray for the like,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51259:130"/>
without a promise from God. He sendeth not all to be our guides, who may sympathize with our estate. The Angels who never sustain'd infirmity, do not so; neither doth the ministration of an Angel argue that of a Saint. Nor doth it follow that God doth use such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations so frequently and visibly under the Gospel, as under the Law, in which dispensation his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> in which the Angels attended, was shewn often on Earth.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If St. <hi>Roch</hi> once assisted the infected, it is not proved thence that God sends him where-ever he sends that heavy judgment. And how appeareth it that he ever helped at a distance in that dreadful sickness, which requires a <hi>Domine Miserere?</hi> Why, because (say they) the infected prayed to him, and were healed. But the event is not always the effect; and God in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his own greater and mysterious ends, doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten answer the matter of the requests of the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked. And often there are other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary second Causes, which men fancy by the event to have been more extraordinary and divine. They who among the Heathens prayed to <hi>Lavina</hi> for her assistance in a cleanly cheat, might impute the effect unto their Goddess, though she never understood them, and their own cunning brain and slight of hand brought the couzenage to pass with such undiscovered Art. S. <hi>Austin</hi> will furnish us with a better instance, a matter of fact. In his Eleventh Chapter <hi>de Curâ pro mortuis,</hi> he telleth of one <hi>Eulogius</hi> a Master of Rhetorick in <hi>Carthage,</hi> who was perplexed with a knotty place in the Rhetoricks of <hi>Cicero,</hi> which he was next day to interpret to his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: <q>And in that night, saith the Father, I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted unto him in his dream, that which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not. Nay, not I, but my Image, I being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of this affair, and being so far beyond
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51259:131"/>
the Sea, doing or dreaming some other thing, and being wholly careless of his cares.</q> The mans brain was heated, and amongst other Images that of S. <hi>Austin</hi> came in his mind, he being then the fam'd Schollar in <hi>Africa;</hi> and his dreams (as often it happens) were luckier than his waking thoughts; and he imputed to St. <hi>Austin</hi> that which followed his Apparition in the brain, though that was not the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, if St. <hi>Michael</hi> was once sent to succour the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is not to be thence concluded, that Saints do the like, or that he himself hath always the same Office, in reference to the quality or the object of it; or that Angels appear alike under the dispensation of the <hi>Logos</hi> substituted without union to manhood, and that of him incarnate, and installed King of the World; nor do all the Learned think that by <hi>Michael</hi> is always meant an Angel.</p>
               <p>In sum, the <hi>Romanists</hi> are not so much charged with Idolatry, for praying to such Saints as most sympathize (in their conjecture) with their present conditions; as for trusting in them as such whom God hath impower'd to succour all Christians in equal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and like places; and for returning the thanks to them which are oftenest due to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Providence of the Omnipresent God. If they do not apply themselves to them as such, why do they use such Forms in their Prayers? Why do they give them the name of Patron, and Guardian-Saints? Why do they as well call on the Virgin, as on the highest Angel for Guardianship? Why do the Popes in their many Bulls declare them to be Patrons of such places, and helpers in such particular cases? Why are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple directed in the choice of them, and advis'd to an especial affiance in them <note n="a" place="margin">

their Supplicants, with present aid, and further assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance? This is done by <hi>Bernardin de Bustis,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in a Manual Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> with approbation <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>L'office de la vierge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ou sont adjou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees—Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses de la vierge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Paris,</hi> 1659. p. 340, 341, &amp;c.</note>, in a Discourse of the seven Joys of the Virgin; to wit (in their account) her Annunciation by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; her Visitation by <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the glorious Birth of Christ; the Adoration of the <hi>Magi;</hi> the Retrieve of her Son in the Temple; the appearance of Christ after his Resurrection; and her happy departure and Assumption into Heaven. With these Joys, saith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardin,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canierbury,</hi> a devout servant of the Virgins, did every day salute our Lady. To him (as he proceeds) she one day appeared when he was at his Prayers; and she assured him, that his saluting her with her seven Joys on earth [which sometimes were <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In lib. Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viali. in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunc. B. M.</hi> p. 233.</note> said to be but five] was very agreeable to her; but that the saluting of her with her seven Joys in Heaven, [to wit, her Exaltation above the Angels; her illuminating Paradise as the Sun does the World; the reverence paid her by Angels, Archangels, Thrones and Dominions; her being the Conveyer of all the Graces which Christ bestoweth; her sitting at the right hand of her Son; her being the hope of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in such sort, that all who praise and reverence her, are by the Father recompenced with eternal Glory; the augmentation of her graces and favours in Paradice until the Day of Judgment] was acceptable to her in a higher degree. And she promised to him, and to others also who should daily repeat these Salutations, adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each an <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> that she would be present with them at the hour of death; and that for her sake they should be saved. In which instance we have the Patronage of the Virgin asserted, and also a proof of the Imposture of such Appearances, from the Story it self, which representeth not a blessed Saint ascribing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51259:132"/>
all Glory to the great God, but a vain perfon delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the unjust flatteries of her self.</p>
               <p>This, then, is the way in which I conceive the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> giveth away a degree of the Honour of God the Father; to wit, by her disposal of the Government of the World, though in subordination to his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, unto Angels and Saints, without any sufficient declaration from him, that he hath been willing so to prefer them; and by her worshipping of them in that quality which her own imagination hath enstated them in.</p>
               <p>I am next to consider how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth by such estimation and worship, entrench on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour with respect to Christ as Mediator. God hath not owned any Substitute besides his Son, who hath all power given to him, being as God-man most capable of it. And though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth acknowledg Christ to be the Author of Salvation, and the Supreme Patron and Mediator; yet still it doth entrench upon his Honour, in its worship of Saints, three several ways.</p>
               <p>First, More particularly, in that Worship which is given to the Virgin.</p>
               <p>In the second place, More generally, in the worship given to so many Saints and Angels.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the frequency of the worship given, both to the Virgin, and to the other Heavenly spirits.</p>
               <p>First, The Honour of Christ is particularly abated in the customary worship of the blessed Virgin. Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I say, not quite removed. For the Prayers to her are still <hi>per Dominum,</hi> through Christ her Son [though it seemeth sometimes to be intimated (as in the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra Te esse Matrem,</hi> Shew thy Mother-hood, in the Hymn <hi>Ave Maris stella)</hi> that she can command his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers]. And when God is invoked by her Merits, her
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51259:132"/>
Merits are supposed to be derived from his <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex. gr. in Miss. Rom. in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But an abatement there is of Christs Honour, by that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent Advancement which is given to her by the practice of that Church, without any declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. For that Church doth set her, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did his Mother, in the Throne with himself, though on that hand which signifies that he is still the Supreme. Now it is manifest that Honour is diminished, both where it is equally shared, and where a second keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not distance, but doth obtain a point next to the first. For from degrees of Power and Distance, arise degrees of Honour; and a Prince that sitteth alone in the Chair of State, is thereby in possession of higher Honour, than he who hath a Second sitting next him, though on the less honourable hand. And accordingly it was esteemed a defect in Policy, both through the occasion given by it of being supplanted, and through the diminution it made of Supreme Honour (of which each degree is a degree of Power), when any Princes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire [such as <hi>AElius Adrianus,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Philosopher] admitted Seconds to sit with them in the Throne of Government, though themselves reserved still the first Place, and remained, as it were, the Heads of the Empire.</p>
               <p>Now it is the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to celebrate the Virgin as a kind of Co-Ruler with her Son; to salute her (as we heard but now from the Office of her Seven Allegresses) as a Queen on the right hand of Christ in his Throne.</p>
               <p>The Scripture hath in it this Prophecy of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 1.</note>, <hi>There shall come forth a Rod out of the stem of Jess, and a branch, or flower, shall grow or rise out of his roots. Hierom Xaverius</hi> hath wrested this place, even from the sense of the Vulgar Translation; and he thus readeth it in his Persic Gofpel <note n="b" place="margin">

branch shall rise out of the root of Jesse, and out of that branch a flower shall be born:</hi> Misapplying the first to the Virgin, and the second to Christ, whilst both are spoken of him. To this misinterpretation he might be led by the Hymn in the <hi>Breviary</hi>

                     <hi>Brev. Rom. Ave Regina—Salve Radix Sancta. Ad Completor.</hi> p. 107.</note>, which saluteth her by the Title of the Holy Root. And it is evident by the Psalter of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> which is known to turn <hi>Lord</hi> into <hi>Lady,</hi> throughout the <hi>Psalms</hi> (not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to Travest that place of, <hi>The Lord said unto my Lord;</hi> into, <hi>Our Lady said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand);</hi> and by <hi>Salazar,</hi> who in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the <hi>Proverbs</hi> interpreteth <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Virgin;</hi> that the <hi>Marians</hi> would scrue up the sense of the Old Testament into the assertion of a kind of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of the Virgin with Christ.

               <p>That which I have mentioned before this is such <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdulia,</hi> or excess of Veneration, that by ascribing too much to a particular Saint, it diminisheth the Honour of our common Saviour. Thus it was not from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but the superstitious world hath departed from the first measures of the reverence due to the Virgin, and run into this insufferable extreme. And how this has come to pass, one of that Church, and one of the most judicious and disinteressed amongst them, has faithfully told us <note n="*" place="margin">Father <hi>Paul</hi> in his Hist. of the Conc. of <hi>Trent.</hi> l. 2. A. 1546. p. 170.</note>. After that the impiety of <hi>Nestorius</hi> had divided Christ, making two Sons, and denying him to be God, who was born of the Blessed Virgin; the Church, to inculcate the Catholick Truth in the minds of the Faithful, made mention of her in the Churches as well of the East as of the West, with
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51259:135"/>
this short form of words, in <hi>Greek,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in Latin, <hi>Maria Mater Dei;</hi> that is, <hi>Mary the Mother of God.</hi> This being instituted only for the Honour of Christ, was by little and little communicated also to the Mother, and finally applied to her alone. So when Images began to multiply, Christ was painted as a Babe in his Mothers arms, to put us in mind of the worship due unto him even in that Age: But in progress of time, it was turned into the worship of the Mother without the Son, he remaining as an Appendix in the Picture. The Writers and Preachers, especially those that were contemplative, carried with the torrent of the Vulgar, which is able to do much in these matters, leaving to mention Christ, invented with one accord new Praises, Epithetes, and Religious services; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that about the year 1050, a daily Office was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted to the Blessed Virgin, distinguished by seven Canonical hours, in a Form which anciently was ever used to the honour of the Divine Majesty: And in the next hundred years the worship so increased, that it came to the heigth, even to attribute that unto her, which the Scriptures speak of the Divine Wisdom. And amongst these invented Novities this was one, her total exemption from Original sin; yet this remained only in the breasts of some few private men, having no place in Ecclesiastical Ceremonies, or amongst the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. At last about the year 1136, the Canons of <hi>Lions</hi> dared to bring it into the Ecclesiastical Offices.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Honour of Christ is diminished by that Veneration, though of an inferior nature, which is given to so many Angels and Saints, as Presidents and Patrons in the Government of the Church. It is true, that the Honour of a Prince is increased by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Attendants: Our Church therefore reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently declareth of Christ, <hi>That ten thousand times ten
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51259:135"/>
thousand minister unto him.</hi> But delegation of Power to many by commission as Presidents, and not as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Messengers, Ministers and Attendants, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of Honour by cantonizing of Power. And he is most absolute, and reserveth most of dependance, and thanks, and trust, and reverence, to himself, who dispatcheth all things by his immediate Authority. For Commissions cut power into many channels, and import either love of ease, or want of power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in person. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were, in their Dominions, high and mighty Potentates, and their Vassals flattered them as Deities in flesh. But they would have appeared greater still, if they had not cut their Empire into its Eastern and Western parts, and administred affairs by Prefects, Vicars, Counts, Dukes, Consuls, Correctors, Presidents and others, executing power by subordinate Lieutenancy. And doubtless the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> had many thanks paid him for his favours, without any acknowledgment made to the Emperor, though the fountain of his Power. In such cases, men look not beyond the State-officer, who befriends them, by virtue of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and his derived Authority. But they would look to the Prince, if he immediately dispensed all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and favours, though attended with a numerous guard, and employing many messengers and ministring Spirits.</p>
               <p>A Caviller would, here, say, that by this Argument it may be concluded, that all Governours in this world, Ecclesiastical and Civil; all Princes and Magistrates; all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, Superintendents and Presidents, are so many Idols, and Ordinances dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to God and his Son. But judicious men will consider, that the Governments on earth are not the patterns of the invisible world. Here God ruleth,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51259:136"/>
in this manner, not for his own sake, but for ours, we being mortal men, and needing the aids of men like our selves, whilst we sojourn in this body: and for him to administer immediately to our outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in this world, were for him to be always grosly incarnate.</p>
               <p>This conceit of the invisible world as modelled like the visible, hath brought forth that excuse of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary humility in the <hi>Romish</hi> Suppliants, who, as if the Court of Heaven were like that on Earth, dare not presume to come immediately to the King, but apply themselves to him by the mediation of some of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. A King is but a man, and cannot hear all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in person, and redress all grievances. Could he do it with the Power, and Wisdom, and Grace, and easie operation of a Deity, all might then have immediate access to him, or to him by the Prince his Son, supposed to be of a like nature and quality. And who, on earth, when he is invited by the Monarch himself to apply himself to him immediately, or to him by his Son; addresseth himself to neither, but to some meaner Favourite, of whose interest, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch of his Affair, he hath no assurance given him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> should we lay aside this consideration of that Presidentship and Patronage, to which the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> entitle so many Saints; yet the very frequency used in addresses to them, though by mere request of their Praiers for us, would, not a little, tend to the diminution of the honour of God and Christ. It is notorious to those who pass the Seas in the same Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms with <hi>Romish</hi> Mariners, that those Seamen, in a storm, apply not themselves immediately to God, but repeat the Hymn, to the holy Virgin, of, <hi>Hail, Star of the Sea!</hi> To this purpose is that which <hi>Lipsius</hi> telleth <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lips. Virg. Hallens.</hi> p. 1261. <hi>Op.</hi>

But, it seems, one amongst them suggested Vows and Invocations to the Lady of <hi>Halla;</hi> and his counsel is embraced. Straightway (says he) a light shone on the Vessel, and the Tempest ceased, and the Vessel arrived at the Haven, with loss of goods, but not of the Passengers, who repaired to <hi>Halla,</hi> and profesled themselves to owe their life to the Virgin, and paid with faithfulness, the Vows they had made. It had been more pious, surely, to have thanked God and the Virgin, or rather God alone, who, it may be, by other means, or by himself, was their deliverer.

               <p>Two things now may be, perhaps, jointly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the disabling the foregoing Discourse; and I will return a brief answer to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is taken for confessed, That those to whom the <hi>Romanists</hi> pray as unto Patrons and Patronesses, are real Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Romanists</hi> pretend to prove that God hath declared himself to have conferred such honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble office, place, and power upon these Patrons; by the miracles they have wrought for the behoof of their Clients.</p>
               <p>For the first suggestion; It is confessed that they worship none but such as have been thought professors of Christianity, and such who are reputed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above either Hell or Purgatory. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I dare not avouch the eminent Saintship, and glorified estate of all that are canonized. They who read, without partiality, the History of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> will be inclined to think him put into the Kalender by as much mistake, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things are put into our vulgar Almanacks.

the Honour of Saints, who had never obtained that high Title by their meer piety of life. It hapned tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in respect of the person, when <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was registred among the Saints; for he was a man of great Scholastick Learning, and of a mighty zeal in the <hi>Roman</hi> way. But for the true reason of his being Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized, it was secular enough. For Pope <hi>John</hi> the Two and twentieth, to depress the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> who did for the most part adhere to the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Excommunicated by him <note n="d" place="margin">Father <hi>Paul</hi> in Hist. of Counc. of <hi>Tr.</hi> p. 170, 171. l. 2.

               <p>Money also maketh such gods, being first made one it self. And who knows whether it hath not sometimes Canonized evil men? For they whom it thus bribeth, are not usually beyond the outward colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, respecters of Saintship. Canonization (they say) secureth Christians from worshipping the damned instead of the blessed. I wish (saith the Archbishop of <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Spalato)</hi> that it brings not to pass that very thing which they think it preventeth. <q>In this (as he goes on) are the faithful safe, if they reduce their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to the sole worship of God.</q> And here it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our observation, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his death-bed of that vicious easiness of his, whereby he listned to the dreams and visions of such who pretended to great sanctity, and occasioned great schisms and disturbances in the Church <note n="b" place="margin">See <hi>Gerson. de Exam.

He mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this in all likelihood, of <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> by whom he was deluded, and thereby drawn into a desperate schism; yet she is St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and her Clients are many. It is a strange infallibility with which the Pope is invested, if he can judg without error, of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of such whom he has seldom in his eye, and who
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51259:138"/>
want not their flatterers, whatsoever is their party. It is therefore much safer to own the ancient Saints, such as St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> whom the whole Church Canonized by its consent, than such Modern ones as St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whom the Authority of the Pope hath put into the Calendar. Of some then the Saintship is doubtful; and of some the very existence. For are not the three Kings of <hi>Colen</hi> as such, a very fiction? yet are they worshipped in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as Guardian-Saints <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>But secondly, They will prove their Saints to be both Saints and Patrons by the miracles they work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Invocation <note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Syn.

                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>T. W.</hi> (under the borrowed name of <hi>Fran. Covent)</hi> in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> of Faith, at the end of his Catechetical Dialogue.</note> boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the restitution of a leg (cut off and buried four years) to a young man who prayed to our Lady of <hi>Pilar;</hi> affirming the story to be sufficient to convert the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:51259:139"/>
To this second Allegation many things may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When God wrought Miracles at the Tombs of the Martyrs, he wrought them not as answers to them who invoked Martyrs, (for in those times they were honoured as Saints, and as Soldiers dying in Christs cause, and not invoked as Patrons); but he thereby encouraged Christians in times of Persecution, and honoured their Religion in the sight of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no reason to expect such Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the setled Ages of Christian Religion, though there might be at the first planting of it. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have had a long time, a fixed rule from whence we may learn the practical truth and duties of our Religion, the Word of God. Neither hath God left so great a part of his Worship as Prayer, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the dreams of the Melancholy, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions of Satan, or the Tales of men who write Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends for the advantage of their cause, or other tricks of politick persons. He hath required us in Scripture to call upon him through Jesus Christ: and he hath confirmed this and his whole Gospel, by the real Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of his Apostles, after those of his Son; and the Gospel being thus fixed, we are not to expect any new discoveries of Evangelical duty by the voice or mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of an Angel from Heaven, who if he should be in such manner sent to us, with any new Doctrinal or Moral Revelation, ought to be looked on by us as one that trieth our Faith, and not as one from whom a new rule of faith or manners is to be received.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Many <hi>Romish</hi> Miracles are events not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. A Popish woman is extremely sick in body, she causeth an Image of the Virgin, as is the fashion now among some <hi>Romanists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to be hanged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51259:139"/>
her curtains, at the feet of her bed. She invoketh the Virgin, and useth Physick; she recovers by Art, by strength of nature, by any other way of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and the Virgin is entituled to the Cure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the event followed their Invocation of her.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Many of the Miracles, are too light to be ascribed to the Saints of Heaven. The credulous <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> confirms the Invocation of our Lady of <hi>Halla</hi> by stories, some of them very strange, and some very lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous. He tells of a Boy raised by her from the dead after three days <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lips. Virg. Hall.</hi> c. 19. p. 1264.</note>. Of a Taylor whom she helped to his needle and thread <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lips. ibid.</hi> c. 25. p. 1272.</note>, after they had been swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down by him. Of a Soldier who by Miracle lost his nose <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> c. 7. p 1256.</note>, having threatned to cut off that of her Image. So <hi>Cantapratanus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Aug. Wichmans Sab. Mar.</hi> P. 73.</note> tell at large, how the Virgin mended the hairy shirt of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Many of them are mere cheats performed by cunning men under the notion of pious frauds. A Priest skilled as much in Physick as Divinity, knows the sick <hi>Romanist</hi> to whom he is Confessor, to need a vomit. He exhorteth him to invoke the holy Virgin; he biddeth him view well her Image which he hath put into an Antimonial cup; he adviseth him to drink of that liquor into which her Image and her blessing hath infused virtue, and to repeat his devotions to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Patroness. The sick ignorant man obeys, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves him, dischargeth his stomack, and is presently eased. He crys out, a Miracle, a Miracle; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to his <hi>Aves</hi> all his days.</p>
               <p>There are some who know this to be an History, though I have told it in the form of a supposition.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Many Wonders and Apparitions are the delusions of the Devil, and dangerous snares in which he entangleth the commonalty of that Church. By this
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51259:140"/>
means he often reconciles himself to their favour, and they take him in this disguise for a real Angel of Light. What other construction can a wise man make of the story in <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> concerning the Specter said to appear to the Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat. Paris in A. C.</hi> 1100.</note>? <q>The same hour, saith the Reporter, that <hi>William Rufus</hi> fell by the hand of Sir <hi>Walter Tyrrell,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone in the Forrest, met with a great hairy black Goat, carrying the King black and naked, and wounded through the midst of his breast. He adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Goat by the holy Trinity to tell what this meant, the Goat made him this reply: I carry to his doom your King, or rather your Tyrant, <hi>William Rufus.</hi> For I am an evil spirit, and an avenger of that malice of his with which he raged against the Church of Christ; and I procured his murther.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They who believe these Legends, and take such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions as measures of their Faith, will think the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil good-natur'd towards Christianity, and an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of vengeance on the enemies of it; though in truth he himself is its greatest and most inveterate foe, and wounds it deepest when he strikes at it in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise of a friend.</p>
               <p>The stories concerning the appearance of the Virgin to her Clients are very numerous, and of them too many represent her in unbecoming postures. And such appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nces should rather move the dread and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, than encourage the Invocation of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> being either the Images of an unclean brain, or the Specters of impure Devils.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Let not the <hi>Papists</hi> prove their worship of Saints, as the Heathen did their worship of Daemons.</p>
               <p>And here I end my Discourse concerning the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Saints in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as Patrons, and Patronesses, as Presidents and Lieutenants in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51259:140"/>
of the World, with the sense of the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moderate Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>This in my judgment is the great objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Invocation of Angels, the Holy Virgin, or other Saints whose souls are with God in Heaven, that it is in the nighest degree of peril to become Religious Worship; for it is out of doubt that the ruder people do religiously invoke the Saints; and that many are internally more affected with religious passion towards the Virgin, or some Saint, than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christ himself. For they invoke not a Saint as one that prayeth for them, but as the principal Helper. Neither say they, Pray for me; but help me; Come to my Aid; Save me. Nor do they express it in words, or understand it in their minds, that these things be done for them by the Saints praying for them; but that the Saints themselves do immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform these things. And in invocating of them, many wholly devote themselves, all their soul, and and spirit, to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints; and subject themselves wholly to them in Spirituals: which is a kind of formed Idolatry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now though by this Discourse, I may have given offence unto the <hi>Marians;</hi> or rather said that which will be made an offence by their misconstruction; I am not jealous that I have at all offended those blessed spirits, if they have knowledg of that which I write. For they are not covetous of undue honour; but cast those Crowns with high indignation under their feet, which are set on their heads to the dishonour of God, by the Idolatrous flatteries of foolish men.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT still remaineth that I speak of the Worship of Images in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and of that degree of Idolatry with which it seemeth to be stained.</p>
            <p>And for Images I will briefly consider, those of the Trinity, of God, of Christ, of the Saints, and under that of Christs, the statue of the Cross.</p>
            <p>For the Image of the Trinity we must not charge either the making or the worshipping of it upon the very constitution of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though men of that Communion have often done both, and the Missals, Breviaries, and Manuals Printed with license in these times <note n="a" place="margin">See the <hi>Front.</hi> of <hi>de Sales</hi> of the Love of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> abound with such Pictures. Formerly that Church was very severe against such practices. And Pope <hi>John</hi> the <hi>22d</hi>

It seems the modern Popes are not so strict: neither did the late Printers of the Missal at <hi>Paris,</hi> or of the Manual of <hi>Horstius</hi> at <hi>Colen,</hi> dread their Fire; they having adorned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of those Books with such dangerous Sculptures. And it should seem by what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath said <note n="c" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, c. 13. p. 457.</note>, <q>That some among our selves have had a zeal for such Pictures; for he tells of a Tumult raised where he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51259:141"/>
had dwelt, upon a false rumour, that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens were about to obey the Parliaments Order, in taking down the Images of the Trinity about the Church.</q> But most probable it is, that the zeal of the multitude was ready to defend such Images, or paintings in windows, rather as the ornaments of the place, in general; than, distinctly, as Pictures of the mysterious Trin-unity.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Image of God, I find not now, as in former times, in the publick Books of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> any forms of Benediction, by which it should be consecrated; though there be forms enough of the consecration of Crosses, and of the Images of Christ and his Saints. Neither doth the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ordain, either the making, or the veneration of the Image of God, though it supposeth that it is, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, painted in sacred story, for the use of their people. For it giveth order <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note> that the people be instructed so far, as not to take such a Picture for Divinity figured. Nay the Catechism, by Decree of that Council, speaketh thus, in the explication of their first Commandment <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Moses,</hi> when he would turn the people from Idolatry, said to them, <hi>You saw no similitude, on the day in which the Lord spake to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire:</hi> which that most wise Lawgiver, therefore said, lest, being seduced by error or mistake, they should make <hi>an Image of the Divinity,</hi> and so give the honour due to God unto a creature.</q> Yet that such Images are made, and honoured in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is very notorious. And it is not long since, here in <hi>England,</hi> some Protestants saw a silver Image of God the Father, carried in Procession, in the Passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week, and venerated with shews of high devotion. The Learned, who are cautious, forbear the open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

of such Images; yet they call them <hi>Judaizers</hi> who esteem the worship of God, by them, to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the frequency and allowance of such Pictures, which under their strict Discipline is scarce to be imputed to the liberty of Painters and Engravers, she weth many Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks to be well-willers to them; [though not as true representations; the heresie of the gross <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites</hi> being, as such, renounced by them]. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance only in that frontispiece which is put before eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the three parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifical, Printed at <hi>Lyons.</hi> There, on the Top, in a very wooden cut, is pictured an old man with a Globe in his hand, and a glory streaming from all parts of him. On his head there is a Triple Crown, or Miter, and over it this Motto, <hi>Holy-Trinity, one God, have mercy upon us.</hi> At the bottom, the Pope is plac'd, in a like Garb, with Miter, and Key; and a glory about his head.</p>
            <p>I do not say that the worship of such Images is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, by virtue of the first (or, with us) the second command, considered as a Mosaical precept. The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of stone themselves have, long ago, been broken in funder in that sense; even by the very finger of God: For we are not under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but under the Covenant of the Gospel. But if there be any natural reason in that Law, it is eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, like the great Author of it. By virtue of that precept, it was (as many think) unlawful for any Jew to make any protuberant statue, either of God, or Demon; or Man, or Animal; and much more to exhibit signs of reverence before them. For the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51259:142"/>
very making of Images would have induced that ritual people to the worship of them; they wanting little besides an outward object to receive the signs of their inward inclination. And, if they had exhibited such signs before an Image, the Gentiles would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them as a compliance with their worship. Of these things God was jealous, and therefore gave command that the Monster of Idolatry should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He, therefore, sutably to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of that time, urged the second command with a kind of Mosaick strictness; and declamed against all Statuaries and Painte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But, a Reason there is, in that command, which doth always oblige, and the force of it reacheth to mankind. Two things, I suppose, are perpetually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by it.</p>
            <p>The first is, the making of any Image of any false God, and the honouring of it, in that quality, when it is made. I say in that quality, for it is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to carve or paint the Images of false gods, by way of story, or in order to the exposing of them in the particulars in which they are ridiculous; or to value
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51259:143"/>
them, if they be ancient, and done by good hands, as rarities of price; and he hath little of judgment or charity, who condemns every Antiquary as an Idolater. The <hi>Genevians</hi> have, usually, here, in their Houses, the Pictures of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and such others, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with those of the Pope and the Devil, spending vainly, their breath against the Light which they had set up. And we suffer, in <hi>England,</hi> the Pictures of false gods in the <hi>Ovid</hi> of Mr. <hi>Sandys,</hi> as well as they do, in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Images of <hi>Cartari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second thing is, the attempting the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true God, and the worshipping of it as his Image. I say the attempting of it, to avoid the Cavil of the Author of <gap reason="foreign">

And he, profanely, compares it to the reason of the <hi>Monsieur,</hi> who forbad his Bowyer to make him shafts of a Pigs Tail, because no shafts could be made of it. And yet it is a reason insisted on by the very Catechism of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> above-cited <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cat. ex decr. Couc. Trid.</hi> p. 394. cited here p. 265.</note>. But who knows not that such an Image was forbidden not properly to be made or perfected, but to be attempted to be made; because the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would fail in his attempt, not only to his own shame, but the dishonour of the true God?</p>
            <p>The Idols of the Heathen might be represented: For being nothing but creatures of God, or Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms, the creatures of their brains; they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of some resemblance. They appeared to the eye, and in a Picture in the fancy; and, consequently, might be imitated by mans Art. But the essence of God is like nothing that is finite; neither like Man, nor like the Heavens, which latter <hi>Diodorus</hi> most falsly and
<q>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:51259:143"/>

Nor can Gods essence so appear by it self, as to shew its very self. We have a notion of God, but no proper Idea of him, for that importeth in the force of the word, an object with its Imagery perceived in the brain. Hence the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> it self did not favour any Images of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>But ere I proceed further in this Argument, I think it necessary to premise a distinction of Images, and to consider how much or how little of the Idol is in each of them.</p>
            <p>Of Images then I consider four sorts, taking the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to call them Images of Analogy, of Memory, of Representation, of Presence.</p>
            <p>By Images of Analogy, I mean such Objects as bear some Metaphorical proportion to some excellencies of God, though they be not the proper Images, Statues, or Pictures of them. Such an Image was that of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> remembred by <hi>Vignola</hi> in his Discourse of the five Orders in Building. He mentioneth there a Capital, in which were the Images of four Eagles instead of Stalks; and instead of Fruits and Flowers, four <hi>Jupiters</hi> faces with Thunderbolts under them. A Representation this may be judged of the power, piercing eye, quick exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of will, in their own <hi>Jove,</hi> in the four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World. Such an Analogical Image of the true God do some <hi>Papists</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>T. G.</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. c. 4. p. 61.</note> esteem, the Statue or Picture of an aged man, whose years and experience, are apt to signifie the Eternity and Wisdom of God; and that of a Dove, to signifie his purity and simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in a manner suitable to our conception. In both these Instances, I think they are mistaken. <hi>Daniel</hi> (as
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51259:144"/>
shall be shewed in the last Chapter) did not mean the Godhead, or the Father, by the <hi>Ancient of Days.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought his transient Vision which had something humane mixt with it, be made a standing-pattern in Religion. Such Visions being impressed on the fancy, could not be there represented without some earthly Imagery, which the enlightned reason of the Prophet could separate from the Diviner part, which is the thing principally intended. Now to bring the whole scene with its glory and its imperfection, before the eyes of the people, in Gods standing-worship, is to confound in their Imaginations, things sacred and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and to adulterate their Devotion. Then for the Image of a Dove, the Text in the Gospels proveth no more, than that the Spirit imitated the gentle hovering of that Bird: And the learned think it did so in the appearance of a bright cloud, hovering with gentle motion over the waters, and the Person of our Lord baptized in them.</p>
            <p>It is plain by the words of St. <hi>Austine</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Aug. de Fide &amp; Symb.</hi> c. 7.</note>, that he thought it Idolatrous to contemplate God in our mind, according to the extent of those expressions which we use in speaking of him. And the like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he judged of contemplating God according to Dreams and Visions, which are partly humane, and partly divine. Thus then that great Light of <hi>Africa</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth: <q>We believe—that [Christ] sitteth at the right hand of the Father. Yet thence are we not to think that the Father is circumscribed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane form, so as to occur to our mind contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him as one that has a right and a left hand, or as one sitting with bended knees; left we fall into that sacriledg for which the Apostle condemneth those who turned the glory of the Incorruptible God into the similitude of corruptible man. Such a Statue
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51259:144"/>
is not without impiety, erected to God in a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Temple, much more in the heart, where the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God is truly situate, if it be purged from earthly concupiscence and error.</q>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi> then (as <hi>Spalatensis</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Spal. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicâ Eccles.</hi> vol. 3. l. 7. c. 12. p. 293.</note> reflecteth on these words) would have advised that the Visions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and other of that nature, produced by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> should be contemplated with the mind, and not be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, especially in Churches; that they should be resolved into their <q>true signification, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon the brain; lest through the Picture of an Old man, or Dove, the defects of Age, wings and bill, possess the imagination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is danger in using any Images of Animals, as Statues or Pictures of God; for they will be made not Images only of Analogy, but of representation, by the ignorant; whilst shape and life are personally set forth. But there is not so great danger in the Images of things without life, especially if they be flat Pictures, not Protuberant Statues, nor Pictures which the Artist hath expressed with roundness. The worse and the more flat the work is, the less danger there is of its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse. <hi>Titian</hi> hath painted the Virgin and the Child Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus so very roundly, that (as Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> a very good judg both of the pictures and dispositions of men, saith <note n="b" place="margin">Sir <hi>Hen. Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Letters. p. 315.</note> of it) a man knows not whether to call it a piece of Sculpture of Picture.</p>
            <p>In some kinds of Pictures, if there be found analogy, and that analogy be discreetly expressed [as by the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or according to the <hi>Jewish</hi> modesty, <hi>Adonai,</hi> incircled with clouds and rays of glorious Light;] I know no sin in the making of it, or contemplating in it, in a Metaphorical way, some of the Perfections of the infinite God, in such manner expressed. A devout man would not put a Paper with such an impression,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51259:145"/>
to vile uses: He would think it fitter for his Closet than for his Chamber of <hi>Grimaces;</hi> though he would not think it the representation of God, or give it Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour, by inward estimation, or outward signs.</p>
            <p>By Images of memory, I mean such Objects as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them no analogy to the Divine Perfections, nor any pretended representation of them; but yet are apt to put us in mind of God, being erected as Pillars or Monuments in places where he has done some great and excellent work. Such was the Pillar of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and in the making of such there is no unlawfulness; nor in exhibiting before them such signs of honour as are proper to be shewed before a monument of Divine Wisdom, Power, or Goodness; unless in times and places where other such Statues are erected to false gods, and the erection and honour of them, is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon construction, the mark of their Worshippers. Such Images of memory are often exhibited by God himself. Such was the pillar of Salt, into which the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Lots</hi> Wife was converted; a pillar of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Gods justice, and of admonition to them who look back towards the pollutions which they have escaped. Such was the adust earth which <hi>Solinus</hi> speaks of, in those places where the inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> were destroyed by Sulphureous flames from Heaven: though it was no pillar, yet was it a monument of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, and severity towards their unnatural lusts. And he that carves, engraves, or paints these holy Histories, may be an useful Artist.</p>
            <p>By Images of Representation, I mean Statues or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures made by art, with intent to exhibit the likeness of the person. The making and worshipping such Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of him, God himself condemneth; appealing to the world, whether there be any thing in nature to which he can be resembled. Such a Representation is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51259:145"/>
undue, though made according to the best pattern in the visible world; and much more if it be made in viler, and as the Heathen were wont to do, in the Images of <hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Attis</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Pign. de Magn. Deûm. Matr.</hi> &amp;c. p. 1.</note>, in immoral figures. And the Worshipper who gives to it veneration as to an Image of God, does highly dishonour him, by changing his essential glory into such similitudes. And it is not so ignominious for <hi>Caesar</hi> to be painted in the similitude of an Ass, or of the worst Monster in the Sculptures of <hi>Licetus,</hi> as for God to be represented in the pretended likeness of his Deity, by <hi>David</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> Such Images, therefore, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> expresly disowneth, professing the spirituality, invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and infinity of God, which nothing visible can represent. By such Images (as rightly <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Athan. Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>op</hi> p. 15:</note> S. <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius)</hi> the mean Arts of the Painter and Statuary are exalted above the Maker of this beautiful Universe. Remarkable, here, is that of <hi>Pliny,</hi> as the sense of a very Atheist. <q>It is a weakness (said he) to search after the Effigies or Form of God <note n="c" place="margin">

            <p>By Images of Presence, I mean Pictures or Statues fram'd and honour'd as places of the especial residence and nighness of the Divine Power. Such I have shew'd the Statues of the Heathen to be. I know not whether they judg'd them to resemble <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Juno, Mars</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> (for the resemblance has been generally such as pleas'd the Statuary or Painter): but it is certain that they esteem'd them <hi>Shechinah's</hi> of God, or Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

And sometimes in their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious folly, they chain'd down their Statues, that their gods might not remove.</p>
            <p>Now such Images are condemned by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, by telling the Gentiles, that God dwelt not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with hands; did both intimate that they thought them his Mansion-houses, and plainly reprove their erroneous practice.</p>
            <p>The making of such Houses or Statues of Presence to the Infinite Godhead, which filleth all things, and operateth when and where it pleaseth <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Arnob. l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 203, 204.</note>, is an high presumption; a confinement of the Deity, or his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by our will and fancy. Wherefore the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of them, being the worship of an object for Gods <hi>Shechinah,</hi> which is not his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> is idolatrous, or a robbing of the Creator, by paying homage to the Creature.</p>
            <p>Of the like Idolatry are they guilty, who pretend to some kinds of natural Magic. They think God has put certain signatures on his creatures, or suffer'd such to be put on them by Art, as tokens of his miraculous operation by them. Thus did the Author of that Book which the credulous <hi>Camillus</hi>

            <p>And Protestants have a suspition of some such Trust (though not put in an Image of the Godhead, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden at <hi>Trent)</hi> yet put in the creatures consecrated in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; whilst they set them apart in such forms as this: <hi>Bless and sanctifie this creature, that</hi>

               <p>THUS much, then, of the Image of the Godhead, or of God the Father and its worship. I pass to the consideration of an Image, the making and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which, admitteth of more apology, That of the Word Incarnate.</p>
               <p>This Image has been made, sometimes by way of Analogy, and sometimes by way of Representation. An Analogical Picture of Christ was made by <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who caus'd him to be figur'd in the form of a Lamb, as a type of his meek and innocent sufferings. A Picture harmless in it self, as the creature whence 'twas taken; yet apt to beget, in weak and foolish minds, not the meer notion of Christs humility and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, but a phantasm of him in the form of a beast. Wherefore, though this way of painting Christ was most usual before the sixth Synod, or third Council of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> yet the Fathers of that Council saw reason to forbid it <note n="a" place="margin">

Nic.</hi> 2 <hi>p.</hi> 165. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> D.</note>, and to require the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church to take care for the future, that the Image of Christ might be expressed in human por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict.</p>
               <p>And, in such Form, some Pictures of Christ might have place in Churches in the Sixth or Seventh Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But Statues, it may be, were not so soon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Pictures; and it is manifest, that in the earlier
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51259:147"/>
times of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> they were no part of the Invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church. For after this manner it is that he argueth against the Heathens, where he Commenteth on those words of <hi>David, The Idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold the work of mens hands.</hi> 
                  <q>They (saith he) worship that which themselves made of Gold and Silver. For our selves we indeed have many U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils of this matter or metal which we use in the celebration of the holy Sacraments. And being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, they are called holy in honour of him, whom to our souls health we serve by them. And we must confess these instruments or vessels are the work of mens hands; but have they mouths and speak not, eyes and see not? do we pray to them; though in the use of them we supplicate God?</q>
               </p>
               <p>However, seeing Christ was made in the form of a man, I know not why that form which appeared to the eye might not be painted by St. <hi>Luke</hi> himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any immoral stain to his Pencil. He that found no fault with the Image of <hi>Caesar</hi> stamped on his Coin, hath said nothing which forbiddeth his own represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; with respect, I mean, to his state of manhood here on earth. For that is not pretended to be the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or image of God-man, any more than the image of any of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> is pretended to be the picture of their souls; but it is the external resemblance of so much of his person as was visible in flesh.</p>
               <p>The Controversie then is not so much about the making as about the worshipping of the Image of Christ, either as his Image in his state on earth, or which seemeth very absurd, as his portraict now in Glory. For though the signs of his Passion may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for Prayers, yet the addresses themselves are made to him as he is glorious in the Heavens, where his estate is unduly typified by a Crucifix which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:51259:148"/>
him in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and not in triumph at Gods right hand, where his brightness cannot be expressed by a pencil of light it self; though one very lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the error of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> hath made the Sun, his Throne, and the right hand of God <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>The Crucifix was made of old, and admitted into private houses, and at last into Churches. But it was first used as a Picture for the help of memory, not as a statue in formal place, on a Pedestal, at which it might be worshipped. Hear in this matter St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, a man of some insight into the practice of the Church. This is part of his Letter to <hi>Secundinus</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. Mag.</hi> 17. Ep. 53.</note>. <q>We have sent to you Images,—and we do not amiss, if by visible things we represent things not seen.—I am perswaded that you desire not the image of Christ with intent to worship it as a God, but that by remembrance of the Son of God, you may be more warmed in his love whose image you think you look upon. And for our selves, we are not prostrate before it as before a God, but we worship him whom we call to mind by his Image, not as born or crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as sitting on his Throne. And whilst the Picture, like a writing, brings to our memory the Son of God, it either rejoyceth our mind with the Resurrection of Christ, or asswageth it by his Passion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The same St. <hi>Gregory</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Greg. M.</hi> Ep. 109.</note>, when <hi>Serenus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Marseille,</hi> had in an holy zeal broken those Images which he saw adored, <q>does wish he had not broken them, but that preventing the worship of them, he had still retained them as Historical Monuments helpful to the memories of the vulgar.</q> I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any thing which may be serviceable as an help to devotion. Men stand enough in need. But there are better helps by far than these: And in the Church
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51259:148"/>
which is the house of oral and living instruction, they serve not much further than for ornament, unless the Lay-people come and view them attentively before the beginning of publick service. After that, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which cause the eye to gaze, prevent too much the attention of the ear. And yet to say with men who run into extremes, that Devotional Pictures are no helps to excite memory and passion, is to forget that they are called mute Poems; to speak against common sense; and to impute less to a Crucifix than to the Tomb of our friend, or to a thread on our finger. They may be useful as Monitors in a Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth where their worship is plainly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden, and by all understood to be so prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And it was high superstition in those who in our late unhappy Revolutions, defaced such Pictures and brake down such Crosses as Authority had suffered to remain entire, whilst it forbad the worship of them; and was in that particular so well obeyed that none of them (it may be) ever knew one man of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to have been prostrate before a Cross, and in that posture to have spoken to it.</p>
               <p>In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there is greater pretence for that violence which vulgar Reformers presume to be holy. For the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> retaineth Images in Churches, as Objects of Veneration, and the practice both of Priests and people does strangely dilate the words of that Council. The Article of the Creed of <hi>Trent</hi> is this: <q>I most firmly <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc. Trid. Symb.</hi> p 944.</note> profess, that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Christ, and of the Mother of God, always a Virgin, as also those of other Saints are to be had and retained [especially in Churches <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Decret. Conc. Trid. de Invoc.</hi> &amp;c. p. 895.</note>]: and that due honour and veneration is to be given to them.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:51259:149"/>
                  <hi>Due honour and veneration</hi> are in themselves modest words: and where we admit the Pictures and Images of Christ, we refuse not the honour which is due to them. We do not chuse to put them in vile places, we do not use them in vile offices; we esteem them as ornaments; we value them as the Images of persons more honourable than our Prince or our Friend: We use them as Remembrancers of the great mystery of mans Redemption which we cannot too frequently be reminded of. We condemn the indiscreet zeal of our late pretended Reformers, who judged him worthy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration who <q>had kept a Picture of Christ in his Parlour, and confessed it was to put him in mind of his Saviour <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>We honour such Pictures in a negative sense, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to have them contemned. We think them not fit to be placed in the Pavements of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his Apology to <hi>Guiliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Abbas</hi> complaineth) they are trodden under foot. Where people spit into the mouth of the Image of an Angel, and tear the face of the Image of a Saint, with their clouted shoon. We observe and commend the discretion of many <hi>Romish</hi> Synods, since that of <hi>Trent</hi>

               <p>But the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> seemeth to mean some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than all this, by its <hi>due honour and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> It doth not indeed mean absolute <hi>Latria,</hi> or direct Divine honour to be exhibited to the Image it self. It hath otherwise explained it self; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth such worship of them. It would not have the people <q>believe <note n="a" place="margin">

Decret. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voc. &amp;c.</hi> p. 895.</note> that there is any Divinity in them, or virtue for which they should be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; or that any thing is to be asked of them; or that trust is to be put in Images after the manner of the Gentiles.</q> A like caution is given by the Synod of <hi>Cambray</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Camer. de Imag.</hi> c. 3. p. 178.</note>. <q>Let the people be taught, saith a Decree of that Synod, that there is no worship due to the Image, either for the matter, or the beauty, or the price and value of its work, or for any other thing which may be in the Artifice or substance of the Image, but to the thing signified to which this worship and honour is especially referred. In like manner they are to be admonished, that the mind of the person that prayeth, or worshippeth, is to be carried to the thing signified, and not to the sign which neither hears, nor sees, nor perceives.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do pursue this caution in their Manuals of instruction which they give to the people. And it would be very strange if they should herein have been defective; seeing the very Heathens were not. <q>We worship not (said they) the very Images themselves <note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The same Author a while after, propoundeth this Query: <q>Do not Catholicks pray to Images and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks? And then to this he answereth: No, by no means: We pray before them indeed, (to keep us from distraction, and to help our memories in the expression and apprehension of Coelestial things) but not to them; for we know well that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see, nor hear, nor help us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is some measure of sobriety in these words; but some other of their writers ought to have had their Pens removed from them, with as much reason as we take away the swords of madmen. Amongst them I reckon <hi>Cornelius Curtius</hi> the <hi>Augustinian.</hi> This <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> thus spendeth some of the heat of his zeal <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>But we have heard better things from the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and some who follow it.

For the external honour of Christ is his honour, though not the only honour which is due to him: And sometimes Hypocrites promote his Honour in the world by the meer shews of it; and sometimes men blindly devout, betray it by exhibiting the signes of it where they are not due.</p>
               <p>It is true, that salutation is both a Civil and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ceremony. <hi>Coecilius</hi> in <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Image of <hi>Serapis,</hi> Kissed his hand, in token of his devotion to that Idol.

                  </note> that he stretched out his hand and adored the people, and threw his Kisses among them: And of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he worshipped or venerated the Assemblie with his hand. Also Bowing, Kneeling, Prostration are equivocal signes: and as we use them towards God, so we do the like towards Princes, and before their empty Chairs of State. Before them, I say, for to bow to them, though it be not Idolatry, yet it is a debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our reasonable persons. For that external sign is the sign of an homage not due to them, but to the absent Prince of whom they put us in mind: and the Ceremonie interprets and declares that inward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and submission to them whose Chairs they are.</p>
               <p>Now, though such signes are thus equivocal, yet they are so determined, by their Objects, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to their particular sense; that a weak capacity can scarce commit an error in their interpretation. He that sees a Cross made by a Shepherd on one of his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51259:152"/>
Sheep, does not think it signifies alike with the Cross impression which a Priest, or metaphorical Shepheard, makes at the Holy Font on the Forehead of a Child whom he hath just incorporated into his Flock. He that sees another saluting him by pulling off his Hat, and bowing, and crying, <hi>God save you;</hi> cannot think he is, thereby, made a God or an Idol; but he interprets all this as a sign of respect according to the usage of his Country. But if he sees a second <hi>James Naylor</hi> riding on an Ass in triumph into <hi>Bristol,</hi> and hears the women cry <hi>Hosannah,</hi> and sees them bow their knees; he hath cause to believe that they are both mad and idolatrous: so much there is of Idolatry, in that which the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers judged Religion; and so little of it in that civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which they think is irreligion, and the worship of the creature.</p>
               <p>He thas sees an Artist in the Shop of a Statuary, kneeling before the Image of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and finishing his Foot, will look upon him as a man employed in his mechanical Trade. But if he finds him in a Church, at the hours of Prayer, kneeling, or prostrate, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Head, with Beads in his Hands, and Tears in his Eyes, and Kisses from his Mouth, at the Pedestal of a Crucifix, or of an Image of Christ; [an Image set up for that use; an Image consecrated <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Now it may here be properly demanded of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist, whether the sign of bowing, kneeling, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, be exhibited to the Image alone, to God alone, or to both of them? and if to both, whether in equal or unequal degrees?</p>
               <p>It cannot be said that it is done only to the Image,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:51259:153"/>
as a sign of civil respect, and not to God, because the man is exercising himself in such devotions as have God only (the Romanists confessing it) for their ultimate Object. He is at his Prayers to God, or some person in the Trinity; and kneeling, or bowing at such a time is as much the external part of worship, as the submission of the mind is the part internal.</p>
               <p>It cannot be said by a true <hi>Romanist,</hi> to be done to God only, because the Great Synod, and the Rituals of that Church, declare such external Ceremonies to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to the very Images as Images of Christ Such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> seemeth generally to mean, when it presseth the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>They must then say, if they will speak with shew of consistence, that the mind doth apply the act of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Image as a sign of inferior honour, and to Christ as a sign of that honour which is supream. That the Case is like to that of <hi>Naaman</hi> before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version unto <hi>Judaism:</hi> for then he worshipped the Idol of <hi>Rimmon</hi> with religious worship, and yet by the same act of external adoration or bowing, he did testifie his civil respect to his Master that leaned on him. But their worship is not so circumstantiated as that of <hi>Naaman</hi>'s. He doubtless did some other homage sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from his Master, to shew his supposed Religion: and they have none leaning on them, (unless by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;) by complement to whom they may interpret the sign, in part, of a civil respect.</p>
               <p>But how doth one external sign split, in each single exhibition of it, into two significations, appear to signifie doubly, to the common spectators? That no mistake may be committed, the <hi>Roman</hi> Assemblies had need be so many Conventions of great Clerks and wise Schoolmen. But, in all Assemblies, how few are good Judges? And how many Spies are there Jewish, and Mahometan, and Heathen, to whom it is morally impossible to know their distinctions? And how many of the same Communion have gross and stupid minds and devotions begotten of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? And what uncharitableness is it to make a Ditch in the daily walks of the Blind, and the Weak, and the inadvertent? and what a scandal is this in <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> where the Gestures are seen, and the Books that explain them are not understood or handled by one of a thousand? And where their own worship of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:51259:154"/>
Images maketh them think the Christians not far from their Religion?</p>
               <p>They who use Images in their devotions, and are as discreet in their devotions as that usage will give them leave; these profess that they bow not to the Image at all, but only to God before it [for thus S. <hi>Gregory, Durandus, Halcot, Biel</hi> seem to profess]. And it is honour enough to the Image, that our devotion is on choice, done at the foot of it. They ought to profess that when they kiss the Image, though the external sign of worship toucheth it and adheres to it, yet it doth not so adhere to it in the quality of an object which it terminateth on, but as a kind of resting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place in the way, whilst it cannot reach its journeys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end by the body, but by the mind only. That being moved by holy passion towards the blessed Jesus, they salute the Image of Christ, not being able to reach his person: and they may illustrate their meaning by the wish of <hi>Thomasinus,</hi> who passionately breaketh into this language <note n="a" place="margin">

They may add, that when they kiss the Image of the Son, they exhibit this Ceremonie, not only as an effect, but as a sign of their love to him. For so a man that kisseth the Hemm of a Garment, does in truth, but touch the Hemm, and offer it as it is a sign of observance unto the person. The materiality of the Act reacheth the Image, the formality the Prototype.</p>

               <head>PART 2. <hi>Of the Idolatry charged on the</hi> Romanists <hi>in the Worship of the Images of Saints.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Touching the Images of the Saints, and the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, it is fit I say something; but the Premisses being considered, I have the less need of being voluminous.</p>
               <p>It is a question whether any such Images can be made with any suitableness to the Prototypes. Christ indeed hath raised his own body long ago, and it is contained in the Heavens. But of Saints who are yet in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect estate, whose bodies are yet asleep in the dust;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51259:157"/>
what <hi>Praxiteles</hi> or <hi>Titian,</hi> can give us fit Statues, or Pictures of them? What they were we may by Images and Pictures conceive. But what they now are in the present heavenly condition, with relation to which the <hi>Romanists</hi> worship them, who on earth can reveal to us, whilst eye hath not seen it, neither hath ear heard it?</p>
               <p>But for the Images or Pictures of the Saints in their former estate on earth; if they be made with discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if they be the Representations of such whose Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship no wise man calleth into question; if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as their honourable Memorials; they who are wise to sobriety, do make use of them; and they are permitted in <hi>Geneva</hi> it self, where remain in the Quire of the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lassels's</hi> Voyage to <hi>Italy,</hi> p. 46.</note>, the Pictures of the twelve Prophets on one side, and on the other those of the twelve Apostles, all in wood; also the Pictures of the Virgin and St. <hi>Peter</hi> in one of the Windows. And we give to such Pictures that negative honour which they are worthy of. We value them beyond any Images besides that of Christ; we help our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by them; we forbear all signs of contempt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. But worship them we do not, so much as with external positive signs: for if we uncover the head, we do it not to them, but at them, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God who hath made them so great Instruments in the Christian Church; and to the subordinate praise of the Saints themselves.</p>
               <p>They who worship such Images, do either worship them as the Statues of such invisible Powers as do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God govern the world; or of holy Spirits who hear them in all places, and pray to God particularly for them; or who only pray for them in general; or as so many <hi>Shechinahs</hi> of ruling, or interceding Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:51259:158"/>
And, First, If they worship them as Representations of ruling Daemons, they are Idolatrous. For they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give away the honour of Gods reserved power, to a Creature: They honour as Clients the statue of a Saint, whilst God is by right their Patron.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they worship the Images of Saints, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as holy spirits who pray for them, and hear them in any place, by the help of that God whose essence is every-where, and who enabled the Prophet to know the actions of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> when he was out of his sight; they are still thereby in peril of Idolatry: for if God does not enable them to hear, and they pray with confidence in them as hearing, they relye on a power in the Creature, which God hath not communicated to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If they honour the Images of Saints only as holy spirits who in general pray for them, they are not to be thence condemned as Idolaters: for should they so far debase their reason as to give to the Image the same honour which is due to the Saint, they honour but a creature that is inferior, with the honour of a creature, superior to it, who prayeth for them in the mass of mankind. And if they bow to such an Image, that external sign of worship can't reasonably be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the beholders as a sign of Divine honour; because they bow to that which appears no other than the Image of a Saint, and not a Crucifix or Image of Christ (the eye sufficiently distinguishing these); and therefore it hath no higher honour than the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, which is a Creature. I except here such bowing and kneeling to the Image of a Saint as is in use in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and is accompanied with a form of Prayer proper to be addressed to God, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that form which Christ hath taught us. For though the Catechism of <hi>Trent</hi> requireth the Parish Priest to
<q>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:51259:158"/>
let the people understand, that <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, If they worship them as <hi>Shechinahs</hi> of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Daemons, they honour that as the presence of a power which God is pleased every-where to exercise; and which he hath not fixed in such Statues, in order to any eminent operation. Wherefore they give the honour of Gods <hi>Schechinah</hi> to that which is not such, and their trust is in an Idol. And here the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is scandalous, if its constitution be not. There is a common perswasion among that people, that Prayers are more effectually heard, and that Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are sooner done before an Image than in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of it: That one Image is a more excellent <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah</hi> than another; that our Lady will perform things at <hi>Loretto,</hi> which she will not do at <hi>Rome</hi> it self. And they who desire blessing of St. <hi>Winifred,</hi> think they soonest attain it at her well.

               <p>But how if God doth this by Nature, or sometimes by miraculous Power, for the trial of our Faith? Or what if such things should be done by Gods just per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, by the Devil himself, to men that have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Reason? Why then, the Devil has their trust and praise instead of God; an Idolatry not to be mentioned without religious fear and indignation. And doth not the Devil sometimes work such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? How then come the Books of the Heathens to be fill'd with stories of Miracles wrought in or at their Images, as well as those of the <hi>Romanists?</hi> If it be told by the <hi>Romanist Lipsius,</hi> That an Image of the Virgin bled; it is also storied by the Heathen <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>

Moreover, that the Statue did sweat so exceedingly in the heat of the weather, that they were forc'd to refresh it with perpetual fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If the worshippers of the Images of Saints, do honour them only as <hi>Shechinahs,</hi> where the Saints hear better than in other places, and as their Chambers of meer Request that they would pray for them; they commit a mistake, and they think them present when they are not: but they give not away Gods Honour, which is not infringed by this meer thought, that his Saints are in certain places; seeing that belongeth to their finite condition. But if wise men look for them in any certain place, they look for them rather in some space of the clear air, than in an Image, or a Cave, where there may be suspition of Imposture.</p>
               <p>Now, though men by this last way of venerating Images, do not idolize them as Supreme Gods, or as
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:51259:160"/>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Idolatry charged, without any tolerable colour, on the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England.</head>
            <p>IT was the wisdom of our Legal Reformers, to purge the Church of all manifest Corruptions, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of those which had crept in about the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, and the Worship of Images.</p>
            <p>But there arose men of a worse temper, and such who usurped Power. And these thought that nothing of the old Building was again to be used. They were not for sweeping and repairing of Gods House, but for razing the very Foundation, and sowing the Place with Salt. <q>Among our selves (saith the Learned Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi> in his Epil. par. 3. c. 25. p. 282.</note>, meaning not the Sons of the Church, but the giddy people of <hi>England)</hi> it seems yet to be a dispute, Whether any Ceremonies at all are to be used in the publick Service of God. The pretences of this time having extended the imagination of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry so far, as to make the Ceremonies and Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils of Gods Service, Idols; and the Ceremonies which they are used with, Idolatries.</q>

            <p>Nay, it was the way of the Fanatical people in the late Civil Wars, to give the name of Idol to any thing to which their fancy was not reconcil'd. Some call'd the most excellent Father of our Countrey <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>I should run a strange and endless course, if I should pursue all their Extravagancies; but a few of the most colourable amongst them, I will a little consider. Those I mean, are the three following. The first is, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Altar <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>The second is, the kneeling at the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>The third is, the Reverence at the name of Jesus.</p>
            <p>The first of these, the bowing towards the Altar, is no Command of the Church, nor the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it in Parochial Assemblies, nor so much as the Couns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Const. &amp; Can. A.</hi> 1640. <hi>Can.</hi> 7.</note>. And in that Canon the true spirit of Christian meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and charity is thus expressed. <q>The reviving—of this ancient and laudable custom, we heartily commend to the serious consideration of all good people; not with any intention to exhibit any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worship to the Communion-Table—but only for the advancement of Gods Majesty, and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due unto him, and not otherwise. And in the practice or omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Rule, we desire, that the Rule of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, prescribed by the Apostle, be observed, which is, That they which use this Rite, despise not them who use it not; and that they who use it not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not those who use it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And little reason there is, that those who use it not, should condemn those who use it, as Idolaters, when they publickly declare that they bow not, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note n="d" place="margin">

Our sign of Reverence must be some way exhibited; and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51259:161"/>
what Idolatry is there in the exhibition of it this way, when 'tis but the way, not the object of our Religious veneration? It is against the common sense of the sign of Incurvation, to interpret it as the worship of every thing in a Church, before which the sign is made: It must be the circumstance of the object, and the form of address, and the application made to it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth its worship. Few therefore there are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciously uncharitable as to accuse the Minister of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring the Church-bible, or Common-prayer-book; though he often bows, and kneels, and prays before them. Few I say there are that do so: for I think his madness singular, who in the late Revolutions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> maintained in a publick Pamphlet, (well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy sure an <hi>Imprimatur)</hi>

            <p>It is true, concerning the second Ceremony, the kneeling at the holy Communion, that it is enjoined by our Church; but enjoined it is in the quality of a decent circumstance, and not as an essential part of the Lords-Supper. But we are by no Rubrick or Canon enjoined to kneel to the Sacramental bread, which is declared still to be bread (though not the bread of common Tables) and not the natural body of Christ: Also before the Administration of it, which is done in a form of Prayer, which requireth our Reverence, the people are generally on their knees in devotion to God. If any begin then to kneel, their kneeling is by the Church declared to be <hi>at</hi> the Sacrament, not <hi>to</hi> the Elements of it, (as they of <hi>Rome</hi> do <note n="b" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Further, The Church of <hi>England</hi> to avoid all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of cavil and exception, hath besides her Article against the Corporal Presence, given to the world an express declaration of her design in the injunction of Kneeling. She declareth that this is done in reverence and humility to Christ, and not to the shews or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Elements, or to the natural body of Christ under the shews of Bread.</p>
            <p>They who are acquainted with the writings of <hi>Monsieur Daille,</hi> have no more reason to think him a <hi>Romanist,</hi> than they have to take <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot amongst the Reformed. Now this is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that grave and learned person, in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Reformed Churches. <q>Whilst the Church of <hi>England</hi>

                     <hi>Daill.

            </p>
            <p>In this external Adoration of Christ, the Church of <hi>England</hi> followeth the ancient Church, which, though it often adored by bowing, and not kneeling; yet sometimes it used that gesture, and was never wanting in some sign of Reverence. Such Adoration is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by St. <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> and particularly the gesture of kneeling or prostration in some places; though <hi>Monsieur Larrogne</hi> hath not pleased, when he had just occasion so to do <note n="b" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>For the third Ceremony, the bowing at the name of Jesus, it is also enjoined, not as duty in its nature, necessary to salvation, but as a decent sign of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward esteem of that inestimable benefit, which that name brings to our mind <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>By bowing at this Name we advance not the Son a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Father, but adore the whole Trinity, whilst by the cue or sign of this name we are reminded of the greatest mercy that ever God vouchsafed; the Name of Jesus displaying the wisdom and mercy of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond those of <hi>El, Jah, Adonai,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And for us to bow when-ever we hear that Name solemnly pronounced, is no more to commit Idolatry than is our crying out at the reading of the Gospels, <hi>Glory be to thee, O Lord,</hi> or, <hi>O the depth of the riches of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Christ.</hi> For these words, and that gesture, are but external signs of the same inward acknowledgment and adoration.

               <head>PART 1. <hi>Of the Cure of Idolatry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Notion of Idolatry being stated, and also il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by the practice of it amongst Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and Professors of Christianity; I proceed to shew the means which God, in pity of our weakness, hath given us towards the Cure of this Evil.</p>
               <p>Against all manner of false Gods, and ruling-Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he gave to all the world a Principle of Reason, which teacheth that there is one Supreme Being, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in Perfection; and by consequence, that he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every-where, by Almighty Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, is every-where to be adored and trusted in as the only God.</p>
               <p>The same Principle of Reason teacheth them, that God can neither be represented by an Image, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to it; neither knoweth it much more of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Powers of the invisible World, save that they are; and consequently it hath no ground for addresses to them.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Jews,</hi> they had an express command for the worship of one God without Image; and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of God, as governing the world by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:51259:165"/>
Also Christian Religion sheweth plainly, that the gods of the Heathens were Doemons, or evil spirits; and that there is but one God, and one Mediator, to be by Christians adored. It establisheth a Church or Corporation of Christians who agree in the worship of one God in Trinity. In Baptism, or the Sacrament of admittance into that Society, it prescribeth a solemn Renuntiation of the Devil and his works, of which a part were the Pomps, or Processions, in honour of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. In the Sacrament which is a memorial of the Passion of Christ, the Head and Founder of this Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, it offereth to us the Cup of the Lord, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the cup of Devils. On the First-day of the Week set a-part for publick worship, it maketh a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Creation of the world, by the Son, by whom the Father made all things, and not by any Doemons; as also of the Resurection of Christ from the dead, by which he conquered the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. In the Form of Prayer which our Lord taught the Church, it prayeth for deliverance <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But upon most of these Subjects, I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged: It remaineth, therefore, that I speak of the means which God hath specially vouchsafed in the case of Images; a Subject not commonly discoursed of, and hinted only in the former Papers.</p>
               <p>This Disquisition I will begin with the notion of the Invisibility of God; proceeding thence, to the condescension he vouchsafes, towards the very eye
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51259:165"/>
and fancy of man, in the Shechinah of his Son.</p>
               <p>There is, in the very Creation, a great part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible matter and motion. Many things, besides God Almighty, are not immediately subject to mans sense, though his Reason can reach them, after a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal consideration of their palpable effects. God, indeed, could have made that matter, which is now invisible, to have been seen by man, in all the minute and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Textures of it. For what should hinder that om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence which formed the light, and created the soul, from framing the Fibers of the Nerves in such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate manner in this life, [what possibly he may do in the coelestial body] as to give to man a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Microscope. But, for his own Divine substance, which hath neither limits, nor parts, nor Physical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion [which is the division of Parts,] nor figure [which is inconsistent with immensity]; nor colour [which is an effect of figure, and motion upon the brain]; it is certain, that in this body, we cannot see it; and there is great reason to doubt whether we can do so in any other, which, though it be coelestial, is still but body. For this sight, then, we are not to hope, unless we mean it of the fuller knowledg of Gods will; and interpret the antecedent by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent in that place of Scripture <note n="a" place="margin">S. Joh. 1. 18.</note>, which saith, <hi>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath reveal'd him.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> in that place denieth expresly actual sight, as also he doth again in his first Epistle <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 12.</note>: <hi>Tertullian</hi>

sight of God. <hi>No man</hi> (said that Apostle) <hi>hath seen God, nor can see him.</hi> No man whilest alive can see God as he is, as he dwells in Heaven, the Palace and Throne of his most eminent Glory. He cannot behold that now (unless in such a glymps as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> enjoy'd) which he shall see after the Resurrection, when the vail of this gross body shall be removed; for to the meek in heart, it is promised that they shall see God.

And for the Essence of it, it seems indiseernible, even to the very Angels. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Angels be spirits, yet they possessing a space, are of a far differing nature from the divine substance, which filleth and pierceth all things. The Ranters, <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ranters</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, p. 24, 25, 28.</note> indeed, professed to see in this life, the very Essence of God; but the true God was not every thing which they dream'd of.</p>
               <p>Now man, in this earthly state, receiving knowledg chiefly from the senses, he is exceeding covetous of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible helps in his research after the most abstracted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which inclination being vehement in the vulgar, who are generally of very gross apprehension; they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue not the object of their minds [be it the most Divine and Spiritual God himself] with pure and unmixed reason; but they at best, blend it with some bodily phantasm, and often dwell wholly upon such an Image, and the external object of it; insomuch that their imagination worshippeth that which should be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:51259:166"/>
only as the help and instrument of their mind. So that although the natural desire of a visible object be not the necessary cause, yet it is the occasional root of all that proper Idolatry, or Image-worship, which divided it self into more kinds, than there are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world.</p>

               <p>GOD knowing well the frame <note n="a" place="margin">Let this difficult Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about the Shechinah, be read with caution; even where I have not intersper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed words of Caution.</note> and infirmity of man [though himself did not erect it so as now it stands, with much decay, and many breaches], was pleased to condescend to the weak condition of his nature, and to vouchsafe him a kind of visible presence, lest in the entire absence of it, his fancy should have bow'd him down, even to such creatures, to which man himself being compared, is a kind of subcaelestial Deity. It pleased then the wise and merciful God, to shew to the very eyes of man, though not his spiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense substance, or any statue or picture of it, properly so called; yet his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or visible glory, the symbol of his especial Presence.</p>
               <p>This divine appearance, I suppose to have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally exhibited in a mighty lustre of flame or light, set off with thick, and, as I may call them, solemn Clouds. Nothing is in nature so pure and pleasant, and venerable as light, especially in some reflexions, or refractions of it, which are highly agreeable to the temper of the brain. By light God discovereth his other works, and by it he hath pleased to shadow out himself; and both secular and sacred Writers have thence taken plenty of metaphors, dipping as it were their pens in light when they write of him, who made Heaven and Earth. <hi>“Jamblichus</hi> in his book of the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:51259:167"/>
                  <hi>“Egyptian Mysteries,</hi> setteth out by light, the Power, the Simplicity, the Penetration, the Ubiquity of God. <hi>R. Abin Levita</hi> supposeth it to be the garment of God, it having been said by <hi>David,</hi> that he cloatheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with it. <hi>Maimonides</hi> supposeth the matter of the Heavens to have a risen from the extension of this vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divine Light. <hi>Eugubinus</hi> supposeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light to be the <hi>Empyrean</hi> Heaven, or habitation of God. And this he thinketh to be the true <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> of the Poets, so called, <hi>quasi</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it shineth throughout with admirable glory.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Basil</hi> calleth the Light of God not sensible, but intelligible; and conceiteth that, after that first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, the Angels are a second and created light. Such sayings, though they have in them a mixture of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, yet in the main, they teach the same with the Scripture, that God is light; or that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Creation so fit an Emblem of him, and so fit to be used in his appearance to the world. Thus therefore is the Shechinah of God described in the Prophecy of <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Hab. 3. 3, 4.</note>
                  <hi>: God came from Teman, and the holy One from Mount Paran, Selah: His glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his praise: And his brightness was as the light, he had horns</hi> [or beams] <hi>coming</hi> [or streaming] <hi>out of his hand</hi> [or side].</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God ever appeared (out of a vision) in light organiz'd in mans shape, I am not certain; though such a Representation be apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the veneration of mankind. For even when <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> spake from his Throne of Majesty, and the light was with singular advantage, reflected from his Robe of silver, the amused people were the more readily induced to celebrate him as a God on Earth. But of the figure of the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> I profess my self uncertain;

and often ruminate upon the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Oracle, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth us, when we see the most holy Fire shining with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a form or determinate shape, then to hear the voice of it <note n="a" place="margin">

And such a fire <hi>Psellus</hi> the Scholiast on this Oracle, affirmeth to have been seen by many men. And I might shew somewhat like it in the Instances of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> But there has been seen a false Fire also: and the <hi>Massalians,</hi> whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now for the <hi>Shechinah</hi> or visible glory of God in this world [for whether it appeared to any as in the other, till the day-break of the Gospel will bear a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute]; it was in all likelihood effected, not by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom no man hath seen <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Just. Martyr in Dial. cum Tryph.</hi> p. 357.</note>, but by the second Person in the Trinity, the King and Light of the World, who was afterwards Incarnate. Both the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and the Haeretical have maintained the visibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Son, and the invisibility of the Father, though upon different reasons. This did <hi>Origen</hi>

                     <hi>Orig. in St. Hieron. Ep. ad Avitum. Arr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ap. S. Chrys. in</hi> 1 Joh. 18. &amp; <hi>Athanas.</hi> vol. 2. p. 575, 576.

Sect. 2. c. 30. p. 298, &amp;c.</note> in which he defendeth against <hi>Crellius</hi> the natural Divinity of the Son of God) doth maintain that the Father is invisible to the very Angels; and that Christ even in the Ages long before the Gospel was the visible Image of the Father. Now the reason why true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks affirm the Father to be invisible, and the Son to be visible, are exceedingly different from those of the <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:51259:168"/>
For the <hi>Arians</hi> degrading the Son to the condition of a Creature [another, a lesser, a second God, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>

So <hi>Maximinus</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> remembred by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> makes the Son invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible only as the Angels, by non-appearance; and the Father invisible by reason of his superior and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble essence. In the mean time this was the Creed of the Catholicks, that the whole Trinity was invisible in one Divine substance <note n="b" place="margin">

                  </note>. It was also their belief that the Son appeared, and not the Father, not from any difference of nature, but of order only; the Father being as it were the root or head of the Trinity, and therefore not so fitly appearing as his Substitute the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person. And they could perceive no more muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the <hi>Logos</hi> when he appeared, than in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he not in shape, but by voice, did own him as his only begotten Son. And by this reason Saint <hi>Austin</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Aust.</hi> l. 2. <hi>de Trin.</hi> c. 9, 10, 11, 17. See <hi>G. Nyss.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>advers. Eunom. &amp; Cat. conc. Trident.</hi> p. 394.</note> might have answered the <hi>Arians</hi> without asserting as he does, that in the Old Testament the whole Trinity appeared. For the manner in which this Appearance of the Son of God was effected, I conceive it to have been done by the Assumption of some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Angel upon the greatest and most solemn occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons [without any vital or personal union]; and by the ministry of some other holy spirits; together with an extraordinary motion, sometimes in the air, and thence in the brain; and sometimes in the brain only.

If I were now to guess what Angel was assumed, I would fasten my conjecture on <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angel, whom the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> call the Prince of Faces, or the Prince of the Presence.

In the mean time his Word by which he made all things, being the Power and Wisdom of the Father himself, persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Father who is Lord of all, came into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise in his Person, and spake unto <hi>Adam,</hi> who in the Scripture is said to have heard the voice of God.

               <head>PART 4. <hi>Of the</hi> Shechinah <hi>of God from</hi> Noah <hi>to</hi> Moses.</head>
               <p>THis eminent declaration of God as a God of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by sending such a deluge, not having its due effect on <hi>Cham:</hi> God with great justice withdrew (as I conceive) this glorious <hi>Shechinah</hi> from him and his Line, which continued his wickedness as well as his name. From them he withdrew it especially; though to the rest it appeareth not to have been a common favour. <hi>Cham</hi> and his race being thus left to the vanity of their own brutish minds, that race in the first place worshipped the Sun as the Tabernacle of the Deity; that being the object which next to Gods <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah,</hi> did paint in the brain an Image of the most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable luster, and perhaps likest to that glorious flame of Gods <hi>Shechinah</hi> which had formerly appeared; for so glorious was that Planet in the eyes of the very <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> in after-times, that they esteemed it the seat of Christ after his Ascension and Installment in Heaven.</p>
               <p>I have guessed already, that this kind of Idolatry was exercised and with design promoted at the building of the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> Now towards the prevention of that impious design the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God appeared on the place. For so <hi>Novatianus</hi> argueth from those words in the Eleventh of <hi>Genesis</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 11. 7.</note>, <hi>Let us go down.</hi> 
                  <q>It could not (said he <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Novat. de Trin.</hi> cap. 25. p. 723.</note>) be God the Father, for his Essence is not circumscribed; nor yet an Angel,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:51259:171"/>
for it is said in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 32. 8.</note>, <hi>That the most high di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Nations.</hi> It was therefore he that came down, of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He who descended is he who ascended above all Heavens.</hi>
                  </q> So that the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Version [the Angels came down <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 11. 5, &amp;c.</note>] must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of that part of the <hi>Shechinah</hi> which is made up by their attendance on the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Whilst God was thus angry with the race of <hi>Cham,</hi> it pleased him to vouchsafe (though not in the quality of a daily favour) the appearance of his <hi>Shechinah</hi> to that separate or holy seed from whence his Son, not yet incarnate, was to take the substance of his flesh. A great Instance of it we have in the appearance which he vouchsafed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who often saw the <hi>Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> of God, and in that manner communed with him: so great was the ignorance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and causless their malice when they raged against the Son of God, because he professed himself to have existed before that ancient Patriarch. Such fall under the heavy sentence of the Council called at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> a City of the lower <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where the Eastern Bishops concluded on a Creed against <hi>Photinus,</hi> who Haeretically maintained, That Christ appeared not before he was born of the Virgin.

That Place, from this occasion, was for many ages esteemed sacred; so high a respect there is in man for the visible presence of a Divine Power.

For <hi>Jesus,</hi> said he, not <hi>Moses,</hi> was to introduce the people into <hi>Canaan. Theodoret</hi> in his Commentary on the second to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth certain defenders of the Law, who induced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to worship Angels, saying that the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by them. They had been much more in the right if they had urged the worship of Christ the Angel of that Covenant. The Law was given by Angels in the hand of a Mediator <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3. 19.</note>, which whether it be meant of <hi>Moses</hi> or of Christ, is a dispute amongst many; though the margent of some of our <hi>English</hi> Bibles <note n="c" place="margin">In Quarto, <hi>Lond.</hi> 1610.</note> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth it of the former. That Title might have been as well applied to Christ, not yet God-man, yet the Minister of the Father. And so St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> do apply it. And St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> teacheth that therefore Christ gave the Law, that he might have Authority, when it was convenient, to put an end to it. And they who stiffly oppose such Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Logos,</hi> give suspicion to jealous heads, as if they look'd towards <hi>Racovia.</hi> For if there were a second Person, he surely must be fit for that great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But I forbear to urge a place of uncertain sense, and chuse rather to consider what the same Apostle saith in his first Epistle <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cro. 10. 9.</note> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> He there saith, concerning the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that they tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ in the Wilderness. And this Christ whom they tempted, is in the Old Testament called <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Hence therefore it followeth, that he who appear'd to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:51259:175"/>
the people in the Wilderness was the <hi>Logos</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>This opinion which ascribeth to the <hi>Logos</hi> the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Law, is by the learned <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> in his Notes on the Decalogue, branded with the name of a grievous error. And it is not the manner of that great Wit to rail at Opinions without offering reasons for his contrary judgment: and here he offereth two.</p>
               <p>The First he taketh from those first words of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews: God who at divers times, and in divers manners spake to our forefathers by the Prophets, hath in these last times spoken to us by his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second he taketh from the second and third verses of the second Chapter, in which the Holy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor preferreth the Gospel before the Law, because <q>the Law was given by Angels; (that is, saith he, by the Angel sustaining the person of God, and for that reason mentioned by St. <hi>Steven</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 7. 38.</note> in the singular number, and by many more such spirits making up that glorious train:) but the Gospel by the Lord Jesus the Son of God.</q> Upon the seeming force of such Reasons, I find <hi>Curcellaeus</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now for the first Objection, I may remove it out of the way by saying no more than that God spake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by his Son as his <hi>Logos</hi> or Minister, and in the latter times by him, as his Son Incarnate, or as begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Holy Ghost of the substance of the Blessed Virgin.

In those times he spake not himself immediately; for how can a Divine Subsistence be, meerly of it self, corporally vocal? But he spake (I conceive) by some principal Angel, assumed (as hath been said) without personal union, assisted by him in a miraculous motion of the air or brain. Under the Gospel he spake with his own mouth, as having assumed human nature into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Person [This word Person (if I may make a digression of two or three lines) deserveth not the clamour with which <hi>Socinians</hi> hoot at it; especially when we consider it, as now we do, with relation to Christ as the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Face, or personating <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God]. They then that rightly distinguish betwixt Christ as Gods Word and <hi>Shechinah</hi> under the former Covenants, and as Mediator and Gods Son incarnate, under the Gospel, will not much be perplexed with such places of Scripture as speak sometimes of Christs Praeexistence, and oftner of his coming into the world in the fulness of time. And thus much <hi>Monsieur le Blanc</hi> himself taketh notice of <note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Now from that which I have suggested in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the first Objection of <hi>Grotius,</hi> it will be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of small difficulty to infer a Reply unto his second. For an assumed Angel being us'd by the Divine <hi>Logos</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:51259:176"/>
as the immediate Minister of himself to the people, and Christ speaking with his own mouth under the Gospel as God-man; and the great mystery of the Gospel consisting in the manifestation of God in the flesh; the Apostle had sufficient reason to prefer the Gospel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law. We have before us a matter of lesser astonishment, when we think of Divinity speaking by an Angel to which it is not vitally united, than when we contemplate it as manifesting it self in the quality of God-man, in unity of Person with human nature. Such were the thoughts of St. <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I conclude then, notwithstanding these Objections, That there is almost as good warrant for reading the Preface to the Decalogue in this manner <hi>[Christ spake all these words, and said]</hi> as the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer <note n="c" place="margin">Praef. ante Leges Aler. di ad calcem Eccl.

                  <q>In the beginning of that Law (saith St. <hi>Austin</hi>

                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:51259:177"/>
Whether, at the giving of the Law, <hi>Moses</hi> saw the <hi>Shechinah</hi> in human figure, his Text does not inform us; yet it doth not necessarily follow, that <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi> saw no figure, because the people did not. For there was much more danger in them who had had the education of slaves, and who labour'd under gross and sensitive apprehensions, than there was in <hi>Moses</hi> a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Prudent person, of abusing such similitude in the framing of Idols: and one would think that at the receiving of the Tables <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 33. 23.</note> he saw something in human figure; for he is said to have seen the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of God, or his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or the shew of a man inverted, or rather a less degree of luster in the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah;</hi> neither he nor any man living being able to behold the face or full luster of it, which perhaps might then appear to the attending-Angels. So that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of <hi>Moses</hi> was, in effect, like that of <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> who desir'd to see the Sun just by him. If it should have been granted, he must have pay'd down his life as the expence of his curiosity. And indeed the seeing of the Face of God in that sense, was, at that season, the less necessary, because God had, just then, made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or presence, in the Tabernacle <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 33. 14</note> to go along with him, and to support him against the incredulity of the people, to whose eyes, such a <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah</hi> as they could bear, was in wisdom to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Moses</hi> was beholding this Pattern in the Moant, and receiving Laws from the Presence of God, the people seeing neither, as at his departure they had done <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 24. 16, 17.</note>; the Glory of God in Clouds and Flame; nor, as in the Wilderness, the Pillar of Fire and Cloud; nor himself whom they judg'd a cause of the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God with them; and remaining forty days and forty nights in this forsaken estate, as they were apt to think

it, importun'd <hi>Aaron</hi> for some symbol of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, with which he might conduct them, as <hi>Moses</hi> had done in former times. <hi>Aaron</hi> wearied with their Cries, made them a Golden Image after the manner of some part of Gods <hi>Shechinah</hi> which he had seen with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and the Seventy Elders, in a certain ascent of the Mount <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 24. 1, 9, 10, 11. <hi>comp. with</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 19. 21, 23.</note>.

The first Face was the Face of a Cherub; and the second Face was the Face of a man; and the third the Face of a Lyon; and the fourth, the Face of an Eagle. If then the Face of a Cherub was the Face of a man, then each wheel had not four differing Faces, but one had two Faces of human Figure, the second being said to be the Face of a man, as the first was said to be the Face of a Cherub. But if these two had
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:51259:178"/>
been alike, the Prophet would then have alter'd his style, and said, The first two Faces were the Faces of a man. But it is evident, by comparing this place in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> with the tenth verse of the first Chapter, that <note place="margin">

               <p>The Tabernacle which God had now discover'd, and which <hi>Moses</hi> was ready to frame, was but a model of the Temple built many years after by the Magnificent <hi>Solomon.</hi> And in it God gave the people, instead of the more aenigmatical and idle Hieroglyphicks of the World in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a more excellent Scheme of it in this great and typical Fabrick, representing, in the three spaces of it, the three Heavens, which the <hi>Jews</hi> so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten speak of, the Elementary, and Starry, and Supercoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Regions.

For the entire Figure of the Cherubim, I am not desirous to inquire with nice and accurate diligence, whether it were such as the Angels usually appeared in, or whether it were a mere Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of their Properties.

But curiously to interpret each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar spoken of them, and of the Ark in which they were placed, is the ready way to create such significations by our fancy, as the wisdom of God did never intend.

Betwixt the Cherubims, and upon the Cover of the Ark appeared as in a Chariot of Majesty, the Divine <hi>Logos</hi> in admirable lustre, yet tempered with Clouds.

And doubtless that Vision was in part a Vision of the Temple, though not wholly after the pattern of the Tabernacle, but as furnished by the voluntary devotion of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who added Oxen and Lions to the Brazen-Laver. These some think to have been steps to his future Idolatry: as if he began to allude to the Lions under the Chariot of the Sun <note n="d" place="margin">See <hi>Cuperi Harpocr.</hi> p. 15, 16, 17.

               <p>This Ark which I am speaking of as the instrument of the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> but not as an object of worship in it self, was a while placed in <hi>Shiloh;</hi> but it was not till <hi>Davids,</hi> or rather <hi>Solomons</hi> time properly, fixed in one certain place of the Holy Land: God causing his favour to be valued by the suspence of it, and shewing thereby that he was not confined to any particular place.</p>
               <p>Besides the <hi>Shechinah</hi> in the Tabernacle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Temple, God vouchsafed the <hi>Jews</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther especial Presence of his <hi>Logos</hi> by the High Priest, and the Sacerdotal Appendages of the Ephod and Breastplate.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:51259:183"/>
in other Versions, the <hi>Reader</hi> is still left uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their meaning, and sometimes led into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.

The Text, sure, in his time was written otherwise than now it is; for now the Cherubim on the Ark and on the Vail are written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Whether those on the Vail were intire Pictures or Figures of Cherubim, as <hi>Onkelos</hi> calls them, or <hi>[O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Plumarium]</hi> a kind of Feather-work, according to the Vulgar and <hi>Samaritan</hi> Versions, or representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wings of the Cherubs, may deserve the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration of <hi>Philologers.</hi> But whatsoever the opinion was which St. <hi>Hierom</hi> had of <hi>Teraphim,</hi> it is certain that he supposed the Seraphim to be distinct from the Cherubim.

If Cherubim had been the same with Urim and Seraphim, <hi>Moses</hi> would scarce have changed their name in the pursuit of the same discourse; first calling them Cherubim no less than seven times in the space of five verses <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</note>, whilst he speaketh of the Mercy-feat; and then giving them a new title of <hi>Urim,</hi> whilst he describeth the Breast-plate, which was but the lesser and more expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Ark. <hi>Teraphim</hi> he might well lay aside, because of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51259:184"/>
their private use, or rather their abuse; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the name of <hi>Baal</hi> was never appli'd to the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> though in it self proper enough. But let us come nearer to the point, from which we have, as yet, kept at some distance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> whatsoever was their myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious importance, were, in themselves, material things, and things distinct from the Gems; for they were to be put into the Pectoral <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 8.</note>. Who the Maker of them was, it is not distinctly reported. They are not found in the Inventory of <hi>Bezaliel's</hi> Workmanship, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they are included in the general name of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral,</hi> used for it self and its Contents.</p>
               <p>In enquiring into their nature, we must consider them with some relation to Gods <hi>Shechinah</hi> on the Ark. For the High-Priest was, here, a Type of the <hi>Logos;</hi> and the <hi>Pectoral,</hi> a Quadrangular hollow Instrument with Rings, and wrought without like the Veil of the Holiest, was a little model of the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, for Urim, Teraphim, or Seraphim, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they answer, in part, to the Cherubim, which were Images of Angels. In part, I say; for it is my conjecture concerning these Seraphim, that they were Images or Symbols of Ministring-Angels in the form of fiery flying Serpents; as Cherubim were such Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols with the Faces of Oxen. And towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of this new and odd conceit, I offer the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conclusions, which I desire the <hi>Reader</hi> jointly to consider ere he derides it.</p>
               <p>First, The word <hi>Saraph</hi> it self, is used in signifying a fiery flying Serpent. This is its signification in the Book of <hi>Numbers</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> 6, 8.</note>, where it is said, <hi>That the Lord sent</hi> Seraphim, <hi>or fiery serpents among them.</hi> And again, it is there remembred, how God said to <hi>Moses, Make
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51259:185"/>
thee a</hi> Saraph, <hi>and set it upon a Pole.</hi> To which I add that in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 8. 15.</note>, a Burning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is called <hi>Nachash Saraph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There were in <hi>Egypt, Arabia, Lybia</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">

                        </gap>ic. de Nat. Deor.</hi> l. 1.</note>, and other places, flying fiery Serpents. The Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiah</hi> mentioneth such creatures <note n="d" place="margin">Isa. 14. 29.</note>; and <hi>Kimchi,</hi> on the place, saith they are found in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> meaning, it may be, the <hi>Arabian Ethiopia.</hi> They were called Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only because of the heat of their venom, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing extraordinary inflammations and thirsts in the body bitten by them; but also because they appeared such when they flew in the Air, being a kind of animated Meteors. Hence <hi>Abarbanel</hi> saith of such flying Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, that they were reddish, after the colour of brass <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Abarb. Com. in Leg. fol.</hi> 305. <hi>ap. G. Moebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de AEneo Serpente.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the earliest Ages and inhabited Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the world, the creatures on earth principally reverenc'd, were Oxen and Serpents. That Oxen were so, has been already shew'd; as likewise that the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim, Appendages to the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, &amp;c.</note>. Because of their mighty Bulk, by which some of them were able (saith <hi>Diodorus</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Diod. Sic.</hi> l. 3. c. 10. p. 143. See <hi>Max. Tyr. diss.</hi> 38. p. 373.</note>) to conquer Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. Because (saith <hi>Vossius</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Serpents, thus sacred, were not the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate objects of worship, but the symbols or shrines of some Angels or Daemons. Thus the Serpents of <hi>Thebes,</hi> spoken of by <hi>Herodotus</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Herod.</hi> l. 2. p. 132. A.</note>, are said, by him, to be sacred to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And the Symbol of <hi>Cneph,</hi> was the Symbol of an <hi>Agatho-demon</hi>

                     <hi>Euseb. de praep:</hi> l. 1. c. 10. p. 41.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There were, not only such living Symbols and shrines, but also Images made by mens hands. Such we see in the Tables of <hi>Isis,</hi> and in the Images of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari.</hi> Such we read of in the Scripture, under the

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:51259:186"/>
in very splendid and glorious manner. The Text assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us that the form is now changed by Gods curse; and sure the change was more considerable than the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration spoken of by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Works, p. 292.</note>, who thinketh that the Serpent went formerly on the ground, though with his head and breast reared up and advanced. It seemeth a more probable opinion by far, that the change was made from the form of a splendid flying <hi>Saraph,</hi> to that of a mean creeping Serpent, not moving aloft in the air, but licking the dust. And much more probable, doubtless, it is than that dream which <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi>

               <p>Methinks a part of the punishment of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> declares the shape of the Serpent or Daemon, by whom they were tempted. For it is said that God guarded Paradise against them by a Cherub and a Flaming-sword, which (as hath been noted already) was estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Jews</hi> a second Angel; and may be aptly imagined a <hi>Saraph,</hi> or flaming-Angel, in the form of a a flying fiery Serpent, whose body vibrated in the air with luster, and may be fitly described by the Image of such a sword. And whereas <hi>Maimonides</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> par. 1. c. 49. p. 73.</note> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this Sword of the property of an Angel, of which the Scripture speaketh as of a flame of fire; he saith nothing distinctly applicable to the second Angel, but what was common also to the Cherub; whilst some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is pointed at in the Text as peculiar to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Angel called a flaming-sword.</p>
               <p>It may be further noted to our present purpose, that the word <hi>Saraph</hi> or Seraphim is used in Scripture both
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:51259:187"/>
to denote (as was said) a fiery flying Serpent, and also an Angel of a certain order whom <hi>Isaiah</hi> representeth <note n="e" place="margin">Isa, 6. 2, 6.</note> as having wings, and flying to him with a coal from the Altar. Accordingly <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his little <hi>Lexicon</hi> in the word <hi>Saraph,</hi> thus discourseth: <q>
                     <hi>Saraph</hi> signifies a fiery and most venemous Serpent.

It is that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in two places. The first place is in his Book <hi>de Praescriptione Haereticorum;</hi> There he suggesteth from others, <q>That <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Eve gave attention to the Serpent as to the Son of God.</hi>
                  </q> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place is in his Book against the <hi>Valentinians.</hi> There he saith <note n="b" place="margin">

                  </note>, <q>That <hi>the Serpent from the beginning was one that sacrilegiously usurped the Divine Image.</hi>
                  </q> This soundeth as if the Devil in Serpentine form, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented part of the <hi>Shechinab</hi> of the <hi>Logos,</hi> and that <hi>Eve</hi> conceived him to be an Angel appertaining to his glorious presence, and a minister of his pleasure; and now come forth from him.</p>
               <p>Now I here suppose the Seraphim or <hi>Urim</hi> to be two Golden winged Images, not from the number of the word <hi>Urim</hi> (for the <hi>Jews</hi> use that number fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of a single thing or person) but from that of the Images called Cherubim, which were two Symbols placed on the Ark which is typed in the Pectoral. And I do not think so much (as doth <hi>Maimonides</hi>

                     <hi>Maim.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:51259:187"/>
Ministers of the <hi>Logos</hi> under the Law; as the four Creatures in the Vision of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> typed out the four Evangelists as Christs servants under the Gospel. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the number of the Cherubim prevent miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

                     <hi>S. Hier. in</hi> Isa. c. 6. Tom. 4. p. 29.</note>.</p>
               <p>In the Pectoral I suppose Seraphim, and not Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim; this being an Oracle for Civil affairs <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Doctiss. D. Spenceri Diss. de ur. &amp; Thum.</hi> p. 16, 17, 18.</note>, and not properly the Oracle of the Temple; and the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim being according to St. <hi>Hierom</hi> before cited, the seven Spirits about Gods Throne, and according to <hi>David</hi> the Chariots on which he rides; and the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim of inferior attendance (though Appendages of the <hi>Shechinah)</hi> and of more frequent ministration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in Temporal matters; such as that of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the declaration of which to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> a <hi>Saraph</hi> assisted.</p>
               <p>For the Answer of God by <hi>Urim,</hi> I suppose it not to have been conveyed through the mouths of these Images, which were to be put into the Ark <note n="f" place="margin">Levit. 8. 8.</note>, whilst nothing is mentioned of the taking them out. But it seemeth most probable that as the <hi>Logos</hi> spake with a voice out of the Glory above the Cherubim, and not by them, their mouths being turned from the High-Priest; so the High-Priest, who here was the <hi>Logos</hi> of the <hi>Logos,</hi> the Substitute and Type of Christ, spake by Inspiration over the Pectoral and <hi>Saraphs.</hi> Neither is it fully proved from the Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">I Sam. 23. 11, 12. <hi>The Lord said,</hi> [by the Ephod] <hi>he will descend,—they will deliver ye up.</hi>
                  </note>, that God spake <hi>Vivâ voce;</hi> as the Annotations published out of the Library of the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> would have it to be: for it may well be said, that God spake when through miraculous inspiration he spake by the mouth of his Prophets or Priests <note n="*" place="margin">See, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Dr. <hi>Spencer. Dissert. de ur. &amp; Thum.</hi> p. 34, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Urim</hi> or Seraphim were put into the Pectoral,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:51259:188"/>
and not set upon it, as the Cherubim were on the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ark; not so much for the concealment of them from the eyes of the people prone to Idolatry, as; for some other cause; for the Ark was often carried in Procession with the Cherubims on it: unless we shall say that the upper cover of the Ark, or Mercy-seat, which is mentioned in Scripture as a distinct piece of Artifice from it <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 28. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note>, was not taken along with it.</p>
               <p>But to me this seemeth one reason: the High-Priest was here the Type of Christ-Incarnate, who in the days of his flesh, though he had Angels ministring to him, did not often please to occasion their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>It may be here objected, That this Notion of the Seraphim in the Ark, ascribeth to God the setting up as part of his <hi>Shechinah,</hi> the Image proper to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for such is that of the Serpent.</p>
               <p>I answer, that the contrary is here true; for the groveling Serpent doomed by God is such a Symbol; and such a one the Heathens worshipped. Neither was any other distinctly used in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or (so far as I have read) in any other Country of the world. For though the <hi>Egyptian Cneph</hi> had wings, yet he was not a wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Serpent, but a compounded Symbol, of which the tayl of the Serpent was but a small part adjoined to the breast, wings and head of an Hawk or Eagle. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> relateth from <hi>Philo Byblius,</hi> that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hieroglyphick of the World was a Circle, of which the Serpent (the Symbol of a good Daemon as they conceived) was but the Diameter; the whole figure being almost like to the great Θ of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And by that it appears that the sacred <hi>Egyptian</hi> Serpent was the creeping one, and not the winged one of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whose company they so detested, that they deified the Bird <hi>Ibis</hi> for destroying it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:51259:188"/>
But now the glorious winged Serpent was the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of a good ministring Angel. And accordingly God used such a one in the Wilderness; and it is known by the name of the Brazen-serpent, or <hi>Saraph</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Numb 21. 8. <hi>Ar. Mont. vers. Fac Tibi Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Of that inferior kind of <hi>Shechinah</hi> it is proper to speak here; it being to be understood from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the foregoing Discourse.</p>
               <p>This then seemeth no other than a winged <hi>Saraph,</hi> put on a Pole <note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 21. 8. Lxx. <gap reason="foreign">

That this was some sort of the Presence of the <hi>Logos</hi> appeareth from himself in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he opposeth to it as Antitype to Type, the natural body of himself crucified. As <hi>Moses</hi> (said he <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 3. 14.</note>

               <p>If it be here said that to make this Serpent a <hi>Saraph,</hi> and a part of Christs <hi>Shechinah,</hi> is to overthrow that which was suggested before of the concealment of the Seraphim in the Ark, and of the Cherubim behind the Veil, from the eyes of the people prone to Idolatry, this being exposed to their daily sight: I answer in two Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It was agreeable to the Wisdom of God to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:51259:189"/>
give some Type of Christ as crucified, that being one great part of that substance of the Gospel of which the Law was a shadow; though he pleased not to do it too plainly in the shape of an humane body on a Cross. And no other Type (I think) occurreth under Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism, but this of the brazen <hi>Saraph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here was not such occasion of Idolatry, as might have been taken from the Ark; for that was an Oracle, and a Divine Light shone forth, and a Divine Voice was heard, and signs of Adoration to God were there commanded. But this was no Oracle: It doth not appear that at this symbol any extraordinary cloud or glory shone; that hence any Coelestial thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was heard. Only men were helped in thinking on God by the symbol of an Angel, which executeth Gods will on Earth, whilst a secret virtue from the unseen God made them whole. <q>He that turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self towards it (saith <note n="d" place="margin">Wisd. 16. 7. See <hi>Chald. Par.</hi> in Num. 21. 8. <hi>He shall recover if he direct his heart to the Word of the Lord.</hi> Targ. Hieros.—<hi>If he lift his face to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi>
                     </note> the Book of Wisdom) was not saved by any thing that he saw, but by Thee that art the Saviour of all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And if the people had been then prone to Idolize that Symbol, it had not remained undefaced till the days of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is my conjecture (and I offer it no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) about the <hi>Urim;</hi> and likewise about the Brazen Serpent.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Thummim,</hi> I imagin it to be a thing of a very differing nature.</p>
               <p>So do they who take it to be deriv'd from the Jewel in the Brest-plate of the High-Priest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is true, such a Brest-plate there was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and it is mentioned by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>But here two things are to be observed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pectoral (deserving the name of truth, it being put on as an ornament for the Bench in the execution of justice and maintenance of truth, as we learn from <hi>Diodorus</hi> and <hi>AElian;</hi> and not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the delivery of Oracles) may as well have been taken from the Brest-plate of the High-Priest of the <hi>Jews.</hi> There is no mention of it in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Graecian</hi> times. And <hi>Diodorus</hi> when he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of it, he referreth to those days when <hi>Heliopolis, Thebés</hi> and <hi>Memphis</hi> were the three head-Cities in <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of each of which ten Judges were chosen; and for <hi>On,</hi> or <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> it had a publick Temple built in it for the <hi>Jews,</hi> with the consent of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus,</hi> by <hi>Onias</hi> the High-Priest, who was then by the power of <hi>Antiochus</hi> deprived of his Authority and Office in <hi>Judaea.</hi> And concerning the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pectoral, its name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is plainly modern.</p>
               <p>It may in the second place be observed that upon supposition that this Pectoral was originally <hi>Egyptian,</hi> it doth not follow that the Seventy meant the same thing by their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did by theirs. It may be rather guessed, that those Interpreters transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting divers words and phrases, which grated on <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> matters, in such prudential manner that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> might not be offended (as is manifest that they did in several places of their Version); they made use of this name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as of a name which would at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to his favour, and well express the sense of Scripture, or the meaning of <hi>Thummim.</hi>
               </p>

                     <hi>Joseph.</hi> 8. 2.</note> thought nothing else to be there; and he had ground for his opinion from the holy Scriptures. For it is said in the first of the Kings <note n="c" place="margin">King. 8. 9.</note>, <hi>That there was nothing in the Ark save the two Tables of stone which Moses put there at Horeb.</hi> And this is repeated in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note n="d" place="margin">2 Chron. 5. 10.</note> of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> And to say as some adventure to do, that the Manna and the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> were there in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> and taken out in process of time, lest the Manna should putrifie, and the Rod be worm-eaten, (as if they could any-where have been so long preserved without miracle) soundeth very like to a Rabbinical whimsey.</p>
               <p>For the places of Scripture alledged by <hi>Grotius</hi> in favour of his opinion, they answer themselves. For in <hi>Exodus</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 16. 33.</note> it is not said that <hi>Moses</hi> commanded <hi>Aaron</hi> to take a pot of Manna and to put it into the Ark, but that he required him to lay it up before the Lord, or before the Ark where the Lord by his <hi>Shechinah</hi> then dwelt. Also in <hi>Numbers</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Numb. 17. 10.</note>, it is not said that God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to put the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> into the Ark, but that he required him to bring it before the Testimony, that is, the Ark of the Covenant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>

So (saith <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus</hi> upon the place) it is usual for them who live by <hi>Rome,</hi> to say they live in it. So in <hi>Cariathjarim</hi> in the

               <p>
                  <hi>Thummim</hi> was not an Image as the <hi>Urim</hi> were; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Scripture ever say that God answered by <hi>Thummim.</hi> It saith not <note n="i" place="margin"> 1 Sam. 28. 6.</note> that God did forbear to answer <hi>Saul</hi> by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> but only that he did not answer him by <hi>Urim.</hi> For the Moral Law was a standing Rule, and not an Extemporary Oracle.

               <p>This Ark, or rather this entire Temple of God <note n="*" place="margin">S. Joh. 2. 19, 21.</note> like the Tabernacle in <hi>Shiloh</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 10, 11.</note>, seemed for a time forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, possessed by the great <hi>Philistin,</hi> [for what is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than death?] and laid in the dust; but God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it up after three days in greater glory, and so as that it is never to fall again. This Ark was after a few days taken up into the true Sanctuary of God, where it remaineth till the restitution of all things; and whither our eyes and hearts are to direct themselves in all Religious worship.</p>
               <p>From that Sanctuary he appear'd in a glorious light to his first Martyr St. <hi>Steven</hi> when well awake, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:51259:197"/>
whilst he directed his countenance towards Heaven, whither his spirit was ready to take its way. <hi>He being full of the Holy Ghost</hi> (or divine energy <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 7. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>looked up stedfastly into Heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God.</hi> Thence also he appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in a light so vehement, that for a time it took away the use of his eyes.

This hovered as a glorious flame over the heads of the Apostles, declaring them thereby the Representatives of Christ on earth.

To this effect is a saying of <hi>Eusebius</hi> cited by Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command.

The Gentiles who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the Sun differed much from this external dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Faces. For they respected especially the East-point by reason of the Sun-rising thence <note n="a" place="margin">

And <hi>Trismegistus</hi> (in <hi>Asclepio)</hi> relates, that it was a custom of some of the Gentile-Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onists at mid-day to look towards the South, and at Sun-set to look towards the West.

They respected not always the Eastern Angle, though they had especial regard to it, when the Sun appeared in it. They respected also the South and West-points in their worship. Hence <hi>Harpocrates</hi> a child represented amongst them the Sun in its rising <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Cuperi Harpocrat.</hi> p. 101.</note>; <hi>Orus</hi> a young man, the Sun in its Meridian; <hi>Osiris</hi> an old man, the Sun-setting.

               <p>But the Ancients thought the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of Christ more fixed, and therefore did not in such manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Quarter.

parts which lay Easterly from thence they called the East, and amongst them <hi>Eden</hi> about <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> And they had a Tradition that Christ was Crucified with his face towards the West, but that he ascended with his face towards the East, and went up to a place in the Heavenly Paradise, standing as it were over that of the Earthly <note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Damase. de Fide Orth.</hi> l. 3. c. 13. p. 311, 312.</note>. But whatsoever men may conceive of the space possessed by Christs meer body, they ought not to think of his <hi>Shechinah</hi> as of a confined light in some one Quarter of the Heavens; but as a glorious luster filling all Heavens, and shining towards this Earth as a Circumference of Glory on a single point. They ought to lose their imaginations in an Abyss of Light. One saith (and not amiss) upon this subject <note n="*" place="margin">P. <hi>Sterry</hi> in Serm. on Rev. 1. 7. p. 11.</note>, <q>That as Earth heightned unto a flame, changeth not its place only, but form and figure; so the person of our Saviour was raised to a greatness, a glory vastly differing from, and surmounting any Image, all Images of things visible or invisible in in this Creation. So 'tis fitly expressed (saith he) in <hi>Heb. 7. 29.

               </p>
               <p>From this Heavenly Throne Christ will come at the day of Judgment in a <hi>Shechinah</hi> of Clouds and flaming-fire: the mention of which fire sometimes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the Commentaries of the ancient Fathers, without express addition of that great day, has (as I conjecture) accidentally led part of the Christian World into its mistakes about Purgatory; in relation to which place I must yet confess my self to be one of the <hi>Nullibists.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Shechinah</hi> in milder, but most inexpressible lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, I suppose to be that which the Schools call the

                  <hi>Beatifick Vision;</hi> and which the Scripture intendeth in the promise of seeing God face to face.</p>

               <head>PART 7. <hi>Of the Usefulness of this Argument of Gods</hi> Shechinah.</head>
               <p>THis Argument of Gods <hi>Shechinah</hi> may be many ways useful, if Intelligent persons draw such inferences from it as it offereth to their judgment. I will hint at some of them; for to insist on any unless it be those which concern the worship of Angels or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is beyond my scope.</p>
               <p>And first of all by due attention to the premisses, an Anthropomorphite may blush at his rude conceit about the humane figure of the Divine substance, whose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and immense amplitude is incapable of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral figure or colour; though God by his <hi>Logos</hi> using the ministry of inferiour creatures, hath condescended to a visible <hi>Shechinah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, secondly, those people who run into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extream, the <hi>Spiritualists</hi> and <hi>abstractive Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi> may be induced to own the distinct substance of God, and the visible person of Christ; and not to subtilize the Deity and its Persons, and all its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances into a meer notion, or into some quality, act, or habit of mans spirit; or to bow down to God no otherwise then as he is the pretended light or love in their own breasts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If this consideration had entered with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety into the minds of those <hi>German Anabaptists</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ap. Cloppen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. Gangren. Anab.</hi> p. 281, 282.</note>, who with zeal contended that the very essence or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Father was seen in the Son; and the very substance of the Spirit in the Dove; their disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have been brought to a speedy issue, or rather, they would never have been begun. They
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:51259:199"/>
would have known how to have distinguished betwixt the invisible God, and the visible face or <hi>Shechinah,</hi> not as the very shape, but as the emblem and significative Presence of the Divinity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, For want of some such notion as this, many other men of fanatick heads (such as were most of the Hereticks who introduced novelty and tumult into the Church about the Persons of the Trinity and nature of Christ) have plunged themselves into unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible conceits. Of this number were the <hi>Basilidians,</hi> who call'd the body of the Dove the Deacon; and the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> who stil'd it the spirit of cogitation, which descended on the flesh of the <hi>Logos;</hi> thereby darkning the understanding with phrases. If they had apprehended the <hi>Logos</hi> in his Praeexistence or Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God, and would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed that notion without phantastical or amusing terms, they might have instructed others, and seen the truth also better themselves when they had clothed it in fit and becoming words.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This notion may not be unuseful for the unfolding the Scriptures, which speak of the Praeexist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ before he was God-man; and explain them naturally, and not with such force and torture as they are exposed to in the <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>inian</hi> Comments. He that saith <hi>Abraham</hi> saw the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of the Praeexisting <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> and thence inferreth that Christ was before that Patriarck, speaketh plain sense. But he that says Christ was not till more than 2000 years after <hi>Abrahams</hi> death, yet that he was before him, because he was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>Abraham,</hi> or before all Nations were bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in his seed, the Gentiles not being yet called; such a one speaks like a Sophist, not an honest Interpreter; and forgets that Christs answer (before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>I am)</hi> follows upon this Interrogatory of the <hi>Jews,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:51259:199"/>
Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, This notion may further shew the error of those Semi-Socinians, such as <hi>Vorstius</hi> and his Disciples, who confound the Immensity of the God-head, and the visible Glory of the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> which God hath pleased as it were to circumscribe. They will allow this King of the world no further room for his Immense substance than that which his especial Presence irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates in his particular Palace <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Vorst. de De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note>. Which conceit though in part it be accommodable to the <hi>Shechinah;</hi> yet is it a presumptuous limitation of the great God, when it is applied to his substance which Heaven and Earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot contain.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is from hence in part, that we see and pity the blindness of some of the modern <hi>Jews</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Mede's</hi> Works, p. 438.</note>, who notwithstanding they are the professed enemies of Divine Statues and Images, and have reason enough to believe that the Ark of God hath dwelt among us in a body of flesh, and now shineth in the Heavens; do yet hope (some say) for an especial presence of God by furnishing with a Chest and Roll of their Law, the places of their Religious Assemblies.</p>
               <p>Again, by considering with St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Solomon</hi> as a Type, not only of the sensible but also of the invisible world; and by considering further the <hi>Shechinah</hi> and Ark of God more especially in the Holiest of all than in the Sanctuary and more exterior Courts and spaces; we may illustrate that very useful and most probable notion of the degrees of Glory, and of the several Mansions prepared for several Estates in the Kingdom of Glory; where notwithstanding every part will be so far, though inequally, filled with lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that all may be said with open face to behold the Glory of God, and not those only next the Coelestial
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51259:200"/>
Ark or Throne in the most holy place.</p>
               <p>But these things (as I said) are beyond my scope; though appertinencies to my Argument; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will no further pursue them, but proceed to those uses of the notion which lye more directly in the way of my design. The first of them concerneth the worship of Angels, the second of Images.</p>

                     <hi>Catech. ad Parochos, in</hi> 1. <hi>Praec.</hi> p. 390.</note> from the blessing which <hi>Jacob</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Angel with whom he strugled.

Godhead but the <hi>Shechinah:</hi> That is visible, and the expressing of it with the best lights and shadows of Art may therefore be not unlawful, though I know not whether I ought to plead for the expediency of it in common use.

                     <hi>Lond.</hi> 1642.</note> some such Embleme. The word <hi>Jehovah</hi> and a three corner'd radiant light and clouds, and Angels. He that took notice of this in Print, and might have observed the like before some of the great Church-Bibles, and somewhat worse, the picture of a Dove with rays of glory before the <hi>Biblia Polyglotta,</hi> did not well to call it a representing of God <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>T. G.</hi> Cath. no Idol. p. 59.</note>, and to charge that upon the Church which was the fancy of the Engraver and Printer. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted a much worse Frontispiece in each of the three parts of the Pontifical, where God is pictured as man. And in those days in which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> ruled in <hi>England,</hi> there were Emblemes apt to suggest a very dangerous fancy to common brains; Pictures of the Trinity in three conjoined heads of human Figure. And so ordinary they were that they served as Signs to the Shops of <hi>Stationers,</hi> as now do the Heads of a King or a Bishop. And he that printed the <hi>Pupilla Oculi</hi> of <hi>de Burgo,</hi> was pleased to stamp his Sign in that manner on the Title-page of the Book. Nay, in the late Missal reprinted at <hi>Paris</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Miss. Rom. Par.</hi> 1660. p. 222.</note> there is none of the best faces of an Old man pictured amongst Clouds and Angels over the Crucifix before the Canon of the Mass. And though I know not how to commend these things, yet I will not blame them as acts of their whole Church.</p>
               <p>It does not any-where appear to me that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old pictured the Ark or the Temple, though now they make models of the whole. How near they come to the Original I cannot tell; but it is certain, that in picturing the Sanctuary above, we create a Phantasm,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:51259:201"/>
which needs much to be helped by our Reason and Faith; it being in it self not equal in glory to those of the Sun and the Rainbow.</p>
               <p>It is true that Pictures are but signs, and that words are so too; but it is not expedient to describe all things by the pencil which come from the voice. Words are Signs without Imagery in them, and they are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient <note n="a" place="margin">

Words are properly the symbols of the conceptions of the mind, and not of the external object. They are notes of memory, and helps of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. They are in themselves a kind of spiritual and immaterial marks. And though sometimes, especially in Poetick characters, they bring to the fancy some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent representation, yet they thereby fix a notion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a proper constant phantasm (unless where fancy is indulged); and they do not so grosly impress upon the brain the Image they convey, as a material Picture, which having also some tangible substance to sustain it, is apt to be transform'd into an object of worship, distinct from the Prototype, in dull and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive minds. Besides, when by words we convey to the mind a representation of Heaven, or the <hi>Shechinah</hi> of God, we rest not there, but following the pattern of the Holy writers, we offer to the mind what the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot to the eye, this further document, that we have not by far reached the original, and that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beyond all expressions but those of admiration.

Better sure, it were, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Images quite out of the Church, than to leave them as such stumbling-blocks for the commonalty who are Children in understanding. When they see them only at a distance with their eye, they may sometimes instruct them, and afford them hints of very good meditations: but when they are directed to bow down before them, and to them also, though with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions which the vulgar understand not, they, then, are, if Laymens Books, Books of Magick, rather than of Christian Piety.</p>
               <p>God, you see, hath provided a better remedy for mankind. His Son hath taken our nature into unity of person, and he offers himself to us as an object shining with glory and power in the Heavens, though not there, in his Godhead, confined: and therefore to use any Image of him otherwise then to be a hint to us of his more glorious one at Gods right hand, is to direct our devotion to the light of rotten Wood, or
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:51259:202"/>
Gold, or Pearl, when we have the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If we worship Christs Image as apart from him, we do, in effect, divide Christ. If we worship it together with him, we, in effect, multiply Christ, joyning a second lifeless body to his glorious one; and by that means adoring it, as if it were in personal uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. They are safe who say with S. <hi>Jerome,</hi>

That, as join'd in unity of person, and now in glory, is our object; and a Crucifix ought not to be looked upon in prayer, as the present Image of Christ: for he is in Heaven glorious, and not on the Cross.

               </p>
               <p>God assisting us with this Image, why should any religious Acts have any lower object total or partial? Images set up as any sort of objects of our inward or external devotion, are a sort of Anti-Arks. And we ought not to touch them; not because they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:51259:203"/>
but because they are unhallowed objects. And worse still they are rendred, too often, by impious Art, which maketh the lifeless Image (as in the Rood of <hi>Bockley)</hi> by help of Wiers, and other instruments of Puppetry, to bend, to frown, to roll the eyes; to weep, to bleed; to exhibit signs of favour or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. This indeed, is not the constitution, but 'tis the frequent practice of some in that Church: and hereby are framed so many snares for the people who turn such Images into Christs <hi>Shechinah.</hi> For if certain Monks (who were also shepheards, and people of low conception) became, through their rusticity, absurd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites,</hi> by reading the bare words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where it saith, that <hi>God created man in his own Image;</hi> how much more will mean people have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fancies begotten in them by false Images, which their eyes may see, and their hands may handle. Such will turn a common Chest into an Ark; and a wooden Engine into the Divine <hi>Shechinah.</hi> 
                  <q>Of the <hi>Sindon</hi> at <hi>Besanson, Chiffletius</hi> a Papist reporteth, That great numbers met twice a year on a Mountain nigh the City, to adore that cloth with Christs Image on it. Of it, he further saith, that it always shineth with a Divine presence [that is, in effect, that it is a <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah</hi> of God], and that in great emergencies it is carried in procession like the Ark, being yet more holy than that <hi>Mosaic</hi> Vessel.</q> How shall the people not fall into Idolatry, when such false <hi>Shechinahs</hi> or Idols are layd in their way? How much more would it tend to edification to direct them to the Image of God, who sitteth in Glory at Gods right hand, and whom our minds the less behold in our devotions, the more our eye is fixed upon an Image of wood or stone. In the City or Church of God, described in the <hi>21st</hi> chapter of S. <hi>Johns Revelation,</hi> There was no Temple
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:51259:203"/>
no material fixed place of Gods visible <hi>Shechinah</hi> [though there must be Synagogues or Places for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assemblies]; but Christ himself was the Light or <hi>Shechinah:</hi> and therefore to him, as to the only true Image of the invisible God, it is proper to direct our Cogitations and Prayers. And let not any man think that because the <hi>Shechinah</hi> is in Heaven, and not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in a Church, as the <hi>Shechinah</hi> was in the Temple of the <hi>Jews;</hi> that therefore Christians have less assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than Gods ancient People: for they have that which is much more excellent. The Glory on the Ark was only a mixture of shapeless lights and shadows: and in the Temple, the people seldom saw it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assured of it, did view it in their imagination. And few of them had other apprehensions of it, than as of the presence of God the deliverer and Protector of that Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>But Christians (a people under a more spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation than the <hi>Jews)</hi> though they see not the <hi>Shechinah</hi> with their eyes on earth, yet, from the words of Scripture, they can excite their minds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, even in the Sanctuary of Heaven. And they behold it in the figure of God-incarnate; an Image, not confused, but of a distinct person: an Image which brings to their mind the greatest and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable mystery of the means of Salvation; aptest to encourage our Prayers, and to enflame our Zeal, and to raise our Admiration.</p>
               <p>Some objects indeed, are, on earth, exposed to the eyes of Christians, by the Institution of our Lord; the elements of Bread and Wine. And the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I Have read over your <hi>Discourse of Idolatry,</hi> and if you please I will spend a few Animadversions upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> With all my heart. I take such liberty sometimes, and therefore I have reason to give it. The truth is, I am not wondrously pleased, my self, with what I have done. And I believe the performance of few men does answer to the Idea which they had form'd in their heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I neither frame Models, nor work by them; but I make bold to animadvert on those that do. And if they will talk to the world, they must expect that the world will talk again. As to your Performance, my <hi>Remarks</hi> in the general are but <hi>Two;</hi> But the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ones are enough to weary you, though you were a second <hi>Fabius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Pray try what stock of Patience I am Master of: Though that is usually very small when men are to hear of their own faults.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They may be mine; for no body offends oftner than he who censures. At least he runs the hazard of offending; this being as true as most <hi>Proverbs,</hi> That <hi>he who kicks at others is himself half way to a fall.</hi> But let us <hi>come to the Points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I observe, first, That <hi>you have chosen a very beaten Argument,</hi> and never more beaten than at this time. And next, that you will nauseate the nice Readers of this Age with your numerous <hi>Citations,</hi> which are in
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:51259:205"/>
truth so many that they make the Book seem the less your own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> 'Tis true, the Argument is a beaten one; a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject handled by <hi>Maimonides, Viretus, Vossius, Reinolds, Selden,</hi> and many others of great Learning. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say that it was wholly <hi>of my own chusing;</hi> nor can I tell you all the occasions of it, unless I break open the seal of Confession. But be the Argument as beaten as it will; I hope there may be something said in it, not said before; as in a <hi>Mine</hi> which hath been wrought in for many years, some mean Labourer may find <hi>a new vein of Oar.</hi> However, there must be new Books for them whose curiosity will not incline them to look back upon the old ones. And there must be many upon every useful subject, that the differing Genius of each Reader may be gratified by an innocent compliance with it. And the very concurrence of many at this time in this one subject, does shew that they judged it highly useful for this age; though it may be some would have spared their pains had they had a window into the <hi>Studies</hi> of others, and seen what they were a doing. And further, I assure you upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of others as well as upon my own, that the <hi>very newness of the fashion</hi> in any Book upon a weighty subject, is some way instrumental in carrying on the <hi>Trade of Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Citations, an Historical and Philological Argument cannot be managed without them. Ancient customs and matters of Fact are not to be invented but remembred. And though I fetch many Materials from the Ancients, I lose no more my property in this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (were that worth the contending for) than a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> does in any of his Vessels, whose Timber was imported from <hi>Norweigh,</hi> and grew not at home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I agree with you, adding this to what you have
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:51259:205"/>
said, that the Margent is as often left clear out of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and laziness, as it is garnished out of Pedantry.</p>
            <p>I have done with my general Remarks. Now for those which are more particular.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 15. you seem to commit a little mistake about <hi>Zaradsas,</hi> or <hi>Zaratas,</hi> said by <hi>Plutarch</hi> to be the Disciple of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> He was not therefore what you would make him the same with <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> who was at least as much before him as <hi>Socrates</hi> before <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Zenophon.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Chap. 5. pag. 77.</hi> you seem to approve of the opinion of <hi>Petavius,</hi> who <hi>maketh Arius a genuine Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonist:</hi> whereas it is manifest (and the Learned have taken notice of it) that <hi>Plato</hi> made his <hi>second Principle eternal;</hi> whilst <hi>Arius</hi> said, <hi>There was a time when he was not at all.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I only cite his words, I do not justifie them. The <hi>Logos</hi> of <hi>Arius</hi> is not so like to the <hi>Nous,</hi> as to the <hi>Psyche</hi> of <hi>Plato;</hi> to the <hi>Demiourgus</hi> who framed (as he fancieth) the visible World. Yet thus far <hi>Petavius</hi> is in the right. He asserteth upon good grounds that <hi>Arius</hi> was infected with <hi>Platonism,</hi> and that with <hi>Plato</hi> he made the Principle that framed this World to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct substance, which was not <hi>very</hi> God; though he did not affirm with that Philosopher, that it was coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal with the self-originated Deity; and for that it was not a priviledg in <hi>Plato</hi>'s judgment very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, for he alloweth it to <hi>Matter</hi> it self; I mean the <hi>unformed Hyle.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> We'l examine these things anon. In the mean time I would ask you, why, in this <hi>77th</hi> page, you observe it as a thing worthy an Asterisc, that the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi> call the <hi>Nous, unbegotten,</hi> and, <hi>Parent to it self?</hi> For they mean no more than that the <hi>Nous</hi> was from the <hi>T' Agathon</hi> by eternal <hi>emanation,</hi> and not, as this World from <hi>Psyehe,</hi> by temporal <hi>Generation</hi> or formation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> They mean no more. Neither did I think it a deep remark, but I the rather observ'd it, because holy Writers have declined such terms; not adhering to them so very much as some Imagine they do. And when they use them, they do it not so much to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Platonick notions, as to oppose them. So when S. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>In the beginning was the Logos,</hi> &amp;c. he meaneth it not either of the <hi>Logos</hi> or <hi>Demiourgus</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> but, rather, in opposition to them: as if he had said; <hi>Christ, not your fictitious, but the true Logos,</hi> was ever with God, and God also; and the maker of all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I perceive by this, and by that which I find in many other Places, that you have not forgotten the old saying; <hi>Plato is my friend, but Truth is more.</hi> Nay, you seem to have a kind of Pique at <hi>Platonism,</hi> and will, I fear, provoke the <hi>Ficinus's of this age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I do not with design oppose, or challenge any of them: And I think they are men of better temper then to make every light notion so much their Mistress, as to Duel me for it. And I heartily wish that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and irrational way, used by some Writers, of hitting one another, fiercely, in the Teeth, with their <hi>little barren speculations,</hi> were as much laid aside, as is the custom of fighting with <hi>Sandbags.</hi> But, what are the particulars (I beseech you) in which I may seem to offend the Platonists?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:51259:208"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are many. And (not to hover in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals only) I tell you particularly, that you are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend towards their <hi>Triad;</hi> a notion as dear to a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonist, as <hi>Diana</hi> to an <hi>Ephesian.</hi> It is true in Chap. 5. p. 79. You take notice of the three Platonick Principles, as distinct substances; and they themselves do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: but, then, you say not a word of that <hi>Union,</hi> whereby those <hi>Three substances, of the same species, though numerically differing, become but one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Suppose that to have been <hi>Plato</hi>'s mind: How would it have agreed to the one God of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth to <hi>Gods many,</hi> or many superior Spirits, and <hi>Lords many,</hi> or many inferior Spirits, though of the same species in each order? But I see not, any-where in <hi>Plato,</hi> that this was his opinion, though <hi>Plotinus,</hi> who lived where Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was planted, doth, sometimes, express himself in that manner. At other times, the same <hi>Plotin,</hi> (who is a kind of <hi>Platonick</hi> Familist) doth no otherwise u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite his three Principles then by the union of a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="a" place="margin">

When he saith that the <hi>T' Agathon, Nous</hi> and <hi>Psyche,</hi> are joyned, he meaneth rather that there is nothing <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them,</hi> than that, by mutual penetration, and vital union, <hi>they are one.</hi> He interprets himself, in that Chapter, by saying of the three Principles, that there is [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.] <hi>nothing that interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> No more doth any Planet come betwixt <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and yet they are three Planets, not one. And this seems to be the [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or] the <hi>Indistant Distance</hi> of which notion he dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the sense by his obscure Phraseology. If he meant much more; <hi>Plato</hi> did not; nor could he, with consistence.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> This to me is a <hi>Pythagorick</hi> Riddle. How do you expound it?</p>
            <p>

               </gap>, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Not. in Hier. Carm.

            </p>
            <p>Now if I am mistaken in this notion of the <hi>Tetractys,</hi> I err with company. For <hi>Hierocles</hi> in a place little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, does seem to say the same thing. The <hi>Tetrad</hi> (said he <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This Interpretation of the <hi>Tetractys</hi> seems not wide of the scope of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> But for the <hi>Triad,</hi> methinks you are more severe than you need to be in explaining, or (to express your humour more properly) in exposing of it. There must surely be somewhat more Divine in that Notion than you allow, seeing it hath spread it self very widely among the Gentiles, and thereby seems the dictate of that reason which is common to them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> You argue upon an usual mistake. Many such Doctrines are spread very far, but often they come from one only root; and that is not true reason, but the authority of some one fam'd Master in Learning. The Bellweather goes first, and a numerous flock fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him upon no other motive often-times, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see him go before them. <hi>Orpheus</hi> is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and he by <hi>Plato</hi> and thousands of others in successive Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is no effect without its cause. What (I
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:51259:212"/>
pray you) did move <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or him whoever he was that was the Beginner to take up at first this Doctrine of the <hi>Triad?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> How could that be? they were the followers of <hi>Moschus</hi> or <hi>Mochus,</hi> that is <hi>Moses,</hi> whom <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> rather follow than contradict.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> That <hi>Moschus</hi> was <hi>Moses,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden, Arcerius</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> and divers others seem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for no other reason that I know of than because the names are a little like one another.

            </p>
            <p>But it is not of any moment, here to inquire any further about him. I know not whether he were such an Atomist as I am here speaking of; to wit, a <hi>perfect Materialist,</hi> denying the Existence and the very notion of Incorporeal substance. In opposition to such the <hi>Pneumatists</hi> framed the <hi>Platonick Triad</hi> after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The <hi>Swmatists</hi> or <hi>Materialists</hi> supposed nothing to be in the world but Body, and all body to exist eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of it self, in its essence though not in its modes, without all cause. The <hi>Pneumatists</hi> opposed this <hi>Dogma</hi> by asserting one supreme Incorporeal substance, the <hi>Aitia</hi> or cause of all Beings besides its own: the <hi>T' Agathon,</hi> or fountain-good whence all Essence flowed. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialists</hi> supposed that this visible World was the only World, and that all Ideas and all pretences of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:51259:213"/>
Beings, were but so many impressions of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the brain. This <hi>Dogma</hi> the <hi>Pneumatists</hi> opposed by asserting <hi>separate Ideas</hi> and <hi>an Intellectual World;</hi> a <hi>Nous</hi> or <hi>Logos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Materialists</hi> supposed the frame of the visible World to have been made at adventure, and by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous concourse of Atoms. The <hi>Pneumatists</hi> opposed this <hi>Dogma,</hi> by affirming <hi>two things:</hi> First, that there was not only Matter and Motion, but a <hi>Demiourgus,</hi> an Incorporeal workman, governing the disorderly motion of the Chaos, and disposing of the rude Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in it into a Regular System. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Artificer did not work at adventure, but accorrding to an excellent <hi>Exemplar,</hi> laid before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I perceive you still so explain this <hi>Triad,</hi> that you will not allow <hi>Plato to Christianize.</hi> Nay I find elsewhere <note n="c" place="margin">Ch 9. p. 165.</note> that you do not think him so much as to <hi>Mosaize;</hi> which is very hard measure, and such as others have not meted to him.</p>
            <p>B. I do not say that he did not <hi>Mosaize,</hi> but that to me it was not manifest that he did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When he saith in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Plat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeo,</hi> p. 37.</note> That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having made the World was exceedingly transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the work of his hands; doth he not borrow from <hi>Moses,</hi> who said <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note>, <hi>That God saw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>B. It is not manifest that he did. It is natural for any man to say after the description of an excellent and an agreeable performance, that the Artist was pleased with what he had done. Further, it is here to be observed, that <hi>Plato</hi> in that place speaketh not as <hi>Moses</hi> of God, the supreme <hi>self-originated Father,</hi> but of the third Principle, or <hi>Demiourgus,</hi> whom he stileth emphatically the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Genitor</hi> of the visible World. For to the <hi>T' Agathon Plato</hi> ascribes not such
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:51259:213"/>
Fatherhood and Generation; but says, of all things flowing from him, that they were <hi>unbegotten;</hi> that is, not formed, as he says this World was, out of <hi>praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent Matter by Psyche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Though the <hi>Demiourgus</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> may not be the <hi>Mosaic</hi> maker of the World, yet he may seem at least to be the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, which (as <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>) <hi>moved upon the face of the waters.</hi> For <hi>Plato</hi> maketh his <hi>Third principle</hi> to agitate the <hi>Chaos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>B. Neither is that evident; for the Text may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of a <hi>Wind of God,</hi> that is, according to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Idiom, of a <hi>mighty wind</hi> so moving. The <hi>Winds of God</hi> (saith the <hi>Arabick</hi> Version) <hi>blew upon the face of the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Though you evade this, yet I hope you will grant something in favour of <hi>Orpheus, Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> You will grant sure that they received the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> from the <hi>Cabala of Moyses,</hi> and were thereby great Benefactors to the Gentile-world, and predisposed it for the reception of the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>B. That kind of Immortality which they held was not agreeable to Christian Doctrine. They asserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Incorporeal and indissoluble nature of the substance of mans soul; but by the Dogma of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation through several Bodies, they taught a false and uncomfortable Faith which our Lord never justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. He taught not only that the Soul was not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of separable Atoms, and that it was a substance not to be killed, a substance subsisting after death; but that it was, if <hi>righteous, immortal in unchangeable bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.</hi> He did not dishearten the virtuous by saying (as did <hi>Pythagoras)</hi> that the Soul after having attained the height of the Heavenly state, might come down again from the top of the Circle, and be happy and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:51259:214"/>
unhappy in <hi>eternal Rotations</hi> and Vicissitudes. For this reason St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the first Book <note n="c" place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> Pray let us hear them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 52. you make <hi>Pagods</hi> to be the <hi>Statues,</hi> whereas they are only the <hi>Temples</hi> of Idols.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I use not my own words, but <hi>Vincent le Blanc's,</hi> and with him many others agree; though I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that either in Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi>'s Voyage to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Sir <hi>T. Roe</hi>'s Voyage, p. 440.</note>, or in <hi>Monsieur Tavernier</hi>'s Travels <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tavernier</hi>'s Voy. part. 2. p. 166.</note>, <hi>Pagod</hi> is otherwise used than for a Temple. But why may it not signifie both the Statue and the Temple? At <hi>Rome</hi> they do not think it absurd to call, the Saint, the Church, the Image, <hi>Sancta Maria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It may be so. I pass to another Note. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 97, 98. you expound the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> or prohibition of a Vow forbidden to be made to an <hi>Idol or Vanity,</hi> in the name of <hi>El, Elohim, Jehovah,</hi> or (if you will have it so) <hi>Jahveh;</hi> or in any other name of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> So far the Novelty, perhaps, is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable. But then to obviate an Objection which may be made from our Lords Interpretation, <hi>[Thou shalt not forswear thy self,]</hi> you add this, <q>That he who vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by an Idol, seeing he cannot be enabled by it to perform his Vow, is therefore in effect forsworn.</q> And this looks more like an <hi>Evasion</hi> than an Answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> It doth so. Nor will I go about either to defend that, or the Exposition which occasioned it. Thus
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:51259:214"/>
much only I chuse to subjoin: That a <hi>Jew</hi> or a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vowing by an Idol though coloured with some <hi>Name</hi> of the true God, is actually forsworn; because he breaketh either the Mosaical, or Evangelical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, an especial part of which is the renunciation of the worship of all Daemons <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Thorndike's</hi> Weights and Meas. <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. p. 168.</note>.</p>
            <p>In speaking to the first Commandment, in p. 97. I am guilty of a fault of omission which you take no notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> What may that be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> I ought to have observed that the <hi>Jews</hi> did ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally interpret that <hi>Prohibition,</hi> against the worship, not so much of any other <hi>supreme god,</hi> as of the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle powers,</hi> or supposed <hi>Mediators,</hi> betwixt God and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There needs no command against the worship <hi>of many supreme gods;</hi> that being a contradiction to the sense of mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> True; when you use the words, <hi>many supremes.</hi> But the common people think not of the World, as one Body necessarily placed under one Governour; but they may be brought to think of the Kingdom of Heaven, as they do of the kingdoms in this world, where there <hi>is no Universal Monarch.</hi> They may think there are several coequal gods, in their several Precincts. Nay, generally the Barbarous in several Countries, may be apt to think their Topical god su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all others. The ignorant Frier thought the <hi>French</hi> King his Master, the greatest on earth, when he irreverently compared him to God the Father, and called our Holy Lord the <hi>Dauphine</hi> of Heaven. And some poor Peasants believe there is scarce one higher on earth than the Lord of the Mannor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I have met with such in my time. But, I go on. In Chap. 6. p. 122, and in other places, you

                  </gap>.—</note> speaking of the <hi>first Phorone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Deucalion,</hi> and others, suggesteth that their stories are fabulous. And that which he there remembers of the Discourse of the Priests of <hi>Sais</hi> to <hi>Solon,</hi> about the Antiquities of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and of <hi>Athens</hi> as an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Colony, is, at first hearing, so Idle a Tale, that I wonder the Philosopher, or any discreet Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him, hath had any reverence for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I confess, I have not. Give me leave to trouble you with one objection more. In Chap. 7. p. 146. You say <hi>Two things</hi> concerning the Idolatry of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> which will not pass. <hi>First,</hi> You affirm that they pray to <hi>Mahomet:</hi> whereas they are forbidden to do any such thing by their great Article, <hi>of Faith in one God. Secondly,</hi> You say, <hi>it is most notorious</hi> that they do so; whereas some judicious Persons who have lived amongst them, and such who are of better credit than the Author you cite, do profess they could never observe them doing it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> To your <hi>first</hi> exception, I thus answer. Their Article, <hi>of Faith in one God,</hi> was not so much design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the worship of subordinate powers, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the acknowledgment of three coequal Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the God of the Christians. It is one of the Dogmata of the Moslemans (saith <hi>Gabriel Sionita</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gabr. Sion. de Urb. &amp; Mor. Orient.</hi> c. 14. p. 76, 77. <hi>Hanc ult. partic. directè contra Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos protulit,</hi> &amp;c.</note>), <hi>That God is One; and that there is no other equal to Him. And this last Clause Mahomet added with direct design against the Christian Trinity.</hi> And he would not have been so vehement, in his charge of Idolatry against the Christians, if they had worshipped Christ and the Holy Ghost with subordinate honour, and not as very God.</p>
            <p>For your <hi>second</hi> Exception, I must confess that the words <hi>[most notonious]</hi> may seem a little too bold;
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:51259:215"/>
they relating to a matter which is under dispute: as likewise that, on your side, there are Authors <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>T. S.</hi> of the Relig. of the <hi>Turks,</hi> p. 53.</note> of better credit then <hi>Monsieur de la Guilliotiere</hi> whom I have produced.

            <p>But Monsieur <hi>de la Guilliotiere</hi> is not my only Author. I am told by others that the worship of <hi>Heroes,</hi> and trust in their Aids as <hi>Patrons</hi> under God, is to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on <hi>Mahometans,</hi> if not on the constitution of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> who taught expresly <note n="c" place="margin">Gabr.

               <hi>Septem-Castrenses</hi> was detained many years among the <hi>Mahometans.</hi> And he (in the fifteenth Chapter of his Book, <hi>de Turcarum Moribus)</hi> is large in mentioning their Guardian-Heroes, in whom they put subordinate trust.</p>
            <p>One (it seems) is called <hi>Sedichast,</hi> which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51259:216"/>
               <hi>Holy Conquerour,</hi> or <hi>Victorious among the Saints.</hi> And of him (he saith) it is the common opinion, that no man was ever sent away unanswered, who in any necessity prayed to him for succour, especially in any emergency of War. He is (as he proceeds) as famous among the <hi>Turks,</hi> as St. <hi>Anthony</hi> among [some] Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Another is called <hi>Harschi Pettesch,</hi> which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, <hi>The help of Travel.</hi> He is (he saith) much <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and reverenced</hi> by strangers and pilgrims, and (as they report) not in vain. A third is called <hi>Ascick passa,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Patron of love,</hi> and he is invoked in Matrimonial cases. A fourth is called <hi>Gotvel mirtschin,</hi> and is a kind of <hi>Patron of Cattel.</hi> To him (saith <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castrensis)</hi> my <hi>Mistress</hi> prayed, and vowed to make him a yearly present of Butter for the Custody of her Kine, which also she performed. And (as he goes on) she would have perswaded me to have invoked him, that the Sheep I kept might by him have been protected from the Wolves that infested us.</p>
            <p>If all this be true, and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> invoke so many other Heroes; methinks they should not forget for ever to call on <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself, the Prince of their Saints, and their chief Intercessor <note n="a" place="margin">
