            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hand of Arte giues them here a second more perfect beeing, aduaunceth them higher then they were
before, and warrants them that they shall doe honour to this Citie, so long as the Citie shall beare a

the small number of handes, that were busied about them, make the faulte (if it bee a faulte) excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable.

(according to his owne shortnesse and thicknesse) from the <hi>Symetry</hi> of his foote, caused a pillar to be made, whose height with

            <p>Nor shall it be amisse in this place to giue thee intelligence of some matters (by way of notes) which

            <p>His Maiestie departed from the <hi>Tower</hi> betweene the houres of 11. and 12 and before 5. had made his
royall passage through the Citie, hauing a <hi>Canopie</hi> borne ouer him by 8. Knights.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Obiect</hi> that his Maiesties eye encountred (after his entrance into <hi>London</hi>) was part of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Christs Church Hospitall,</hi> to the number of 300. who were placed on a Scaffold, erected for that
purpose in <hi>Barking Church-yard</hi> by the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The way from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Temple-Barre</hi> was not onely sufficiently grauelled, but all the streetes (ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betweene those two places) were on both sides (where the breadth would permit) raild in at the
charges of the Citie, <hi>Paules Church-yard</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Liueries</hi> of the <hi>Companies</hi> (hauing their Streamers, Ensignes, and Banerets spred on the tops of their
railes before them) reached from the middle of <hi>Marke Lane,</hi> to the <hi>Pegme</hi> at <hi>Temple Barre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two <hi>Marshals</hi> were chosen for the day, to cleere the passage both of them being well mounted, and
attended on by sixe men (suteably attirde) to each <hi>Marshall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conduits of <hi>Cornehill,</hi> of <hi>Cheape,</hi> and of <hi>Fleetestreete,</hi> that day ran Claret wine very plenteously:
which (by reason of so much excellent Musicke, that sounded foorth not onely from each seuerall <hi>Pegme,</hi>
but also from diuerse other places) ran the faster and more merrily downe into some bodies bellies.</p>
            <p>As touching the Oration vttered by Sir <hi>Henry Mountague</hi> (Recorder of the City) with the gifts besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
on the King, the Queene, and the Prince (beeing three Cups of gold) as also, all such songs, as were
that day sung in the seuerall <hi>Arch's,</hi> I referre you to the Booke in print, where they are set downe at large.</p>
            <p>And thus much you shall vnderstand, that no manner of person whatsoever, did disburse any part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the charge of these fiue <hi>Triumphes,</hi> but onely the meere Citizens being all free-men; heretofore the
charge being borne by fifteenes and the <hi>Chamber of London</hi> (as may appear by auncient presidents) but
now it was leauied amongst the Companies. The other two <hi>Arch's</hi> erected by Merchant-Strangers (<hi>viz</hi>
the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Dutchmen</hi>) were only their owne particular charge.</p>
            <p>The Citty elected 16. Committies to whom the managing of the whole businesse was absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred:
of which number 4. were Aldermen, the other 12. Commoners, <hi>viz.</hi> one out of each of the 12.
