            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat His most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Majesty has
lately enterprized
upon <hi>Valencien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Cambray,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> the
best Fortified places of the Spanish
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bulwarks of those Poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
toward <hi>France,</hi> together
with the Progress of his Armes
upon the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi>
the Confines of <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Sicilie</hi>
and in <hi>America,</hi> gives all the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51929:3"/>
rest of <hi>Europe</hi> occasion to be solidly
apprehensive of its danger: which if
it were, perhaps it might have been
more advantagious for this great
Monarch not to have done so much.</p>
            <p>In truth, by the rapid Conquests
which this Victorious Prince has
obtain'd in so short a time, of three
such important Places, he has
apparently demonstrated to all
<hi>Europe</hi> the extent of his great
and vast designs; and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and low Condition of <hi>Spain</hi>
as palpably discovers, that there
is all the reason in the World to
believe, that if <hi>England</hi> would
but awake out of that Lethargie
wherein it hath layen for so many
years, and put her helping hand
to the work, she might be a great
means to prevent the misfortunes
and Calamities to which all those
Estates and Countries that border
upon <hi>France</hi> are now exposed.</p>
            <p>I was the more apt to flatter
my self with a hope of this nature,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51929:3"/>
for that although I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ignorant, how much the
French Court has won upon the
Court of <hi>England,</hi> yet I was of
Opinion that the English, being
so invincibly jealous for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their liberty, finding
that his most Christian <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
had made such an important
Conquest, while the Parliament
was sitting, would by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of that Noble Assembly,
have made their humble addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and earnest representations to
their Monarch, and not have left
till they had besought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
what his own honour and the
safety of his people required. But
by fatal Experience we see, that
as to that which all <hi>Europe</hi> calls a
<hi>Parliament,</hi> if the same Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Connivances continue
there with that fatality which we
have hitherto observed, that to
our great sorrow, we shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to believe what the Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51929:4"/>
of <hi>France</hi> publickly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
declare, that two thirds of
that Assembly are Caball'd and
manag'd by the Golden <hi>Lewis's</hi> of
<hi>France;</hi> in such a manner, that
from the same part from whence
all <hi>Europe</hi> hope to behold the Sun
of their restauration rise, if there
be not a sudden change, which all
good men expect for all this from
the English Generosity, there they
see a formidable power advance it
self, in Combination with <hi>France,</hi>
for, the utter destruction of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</p>
            <p>I know there are some that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to great insight, who being
either endu'd or surpriz'd with
the Opinions and Maxims which
the French Emissaries every where
insinuate, are of opinion, that
for the Imperialists there might
be something done so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Course of this Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
which if it should happen
prosperously to succeed, it would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51929:4"/>
follow then that some folid reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
might be apply'd to cure the
mischiefs and apprehensions of all
the rest of <hi>Europe.</hi> This is that
which is discoursed in all the
Courts and Countries of the
<hi>North.</hi> But not to distaste these
men of Contemplation, I must beg
leave to be of a contrary judgment,
and to hold that all their hopes
are ill grounded; and that for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
reasons.</p>
            <p>We must confess, there is no
improbability but that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Army might force a way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> which would certainly
prove a notable home thrust: but
then on the other side we must
consider, that the Army which is
design'd for such an Expedition
must endure all the hardships of
a Twenty Leagues March through
Countries burnt and wasted, so that
such an Army would be very
much incommoded for want of all
sorts of necessary Provisions both
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51929:5"/>
for Horse and man. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Imperialists, being once
pass'd beyond <hi>Mayence, Coblents</hi>
and <hi>Treves,</hi> have no Magazines,
all the Countrey beyond the Line
of <hi>Treves</hi> to the very Confines of
<hi>France,</hi> except some part of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh,</hi>
being under the absolute
Power of the Enemy; this being
so, how is it for us to imagin, that the
Imperialists should do any things
considerable, being to March
either through a Country burnt
and wasted, or through that part
of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> which is at present
a meer Desart, more especially
considering that the <hi>German</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are those of all <hi>Europe</hi> that
carry along with them the most
numerous luggage and pesterment
of women, and unprofitable
mouths.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though it were true
that the Imperialists surmounting
all these difficulties, should break in
as far as <hi>Lorian,</hi> the Territory of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51929:5"/>
               <hi>Metz,</hi> or the County of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
which is all that is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in one Campaigne, what is
it that this Imperial Army can do
considerable, in a Country of
which all the strong holds are in
the possession of the Enemy, and
all the rest of the Country burnt
and laid wast? Now as all these
exploits of the Imperalists can tend
to no other end, but either to give
Battel, or to lay Siege to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Town, it is easie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
that if they aime at the first,
and that the French are intended
to decline it, as they are masters of
all the Country behind, and of
each side, who shall be able to force
them to fight? Or if it comes
to that pass that they are forc'd
to hazard a Battel, it is most
certain that the one or the other
will be Victor. Should then the
Imperialists get the better, let us
examine what they will be in
a condition to do, should they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51929:6"/>
a compleat Victory. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it will be granted me that the
chief Benefit of such a victory will
be only the Siege of some good
Town, by that means to secure
some post for the Conveniency of
the Army against the next Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne.
For to venture far into an
Enemies Country without this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
I do not believe that the
Imperialists either will or ought
to do it. For should they hazard
such an attempt, they would be
constrain'd to leave several strong
Garisons behind 'em, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well stufft with French Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
would never suffer the German
Convoys to pass quietly, and
perhaps cut off the greatest part
of them. But on the other side,
suppose the French will avoid
fighting, keeping themselves in
an-actual posture of defence, or
though they should be constrain'd
to give battel, and lose the day,
yet the scatter'd Troops of that,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51929:6"/>
beaten Army, being spedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforc'd
by the adjoyning Garrisons,
would be still strong enough,
though but in volant parties, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Imperialists from doing
anything considerable. Here you
are to observe that what I have
said already is only in reference
to the first Case of the March of
the Imperialists in an Enemies
Countrey, and the gaining a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
But as it would be an
extraordinary piece of Flattery to
determine, that the Imperialists
should be infallibly Victors; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that before we leave this
first point, it will not be amiss
to examin what would probably
happen, in case the Armies
should joyne, and the French
should get the day. Nor do I think
it will require a long discourse, to
make the reader apprehend the bad
consequences of such a loss to the
Imperialists. It being notorious
that in regard of the strong places
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51929:7"/>
which the French possess in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,
Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Alsatia,</hi> after
the loss of a Battel, <hi>Germany</hi> would
labour under two inevitable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
            <p>First to see that Army beaten,
and consequently utterly ruined
and cut off in the pursuit. The
second to see the French pass the
<hi>Rhine</hi> at <hi>Brisgow,</hi> and there cutting
out such troublesome work for
<hi>Germany,</hi> which yet she never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
nor had ever suffered in those
parts.</p>
            <p>Again if by an attempt no less
prosperous than the former, the
Emperour and the Empire should
make a second tryal, and be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
as to lose a second Battel,
a thing not unlikely, whether this
Campaign or the next, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the Correspondencies of
the French are maintain'd in the
Court of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and other Courts
of the Empire, we must look upon
all that part of <hi>Germany</hi> which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51929:7"/>
upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> for two or
three days journey together total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lost without hopes of recovery,
and the rather for that a great part
of those Countries is all consum'd
and wasted, and can never be able
to afford Conveniencies for winter
Quarters, nor to supply the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Armies in their Marches.
And this is very near as much as
I can think observable in case of the
March of an Imperial Army in the
Enemies Country, and in case of
giving Battel, which is the first
point. Now let us come to that of
laying a Siege.</p>
            <p>As to what has pass'd at the sieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Philipsburgh,</hi> and <hi>Maestricht,</hi>
with different Enemies, two things
are observable. The first, that the
French understand very well how
to fortifie their strong holds accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all the Rules of Art. And also
for the second, they understand as
well how to defend their Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; dispute it Inch by Inch with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51929:8"/>
their Enemies, with an admirable
conduct, and undaunted Courage.
From which reflections it may be
naturally concluded, that in case
the Imperialists, being enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Enemies Country, go about
to lay any formal Siege; as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question it must be before some
considerable Town, 'tis ten to one
but that the season of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne
will be over before they can
bring their design to pass. From
whence I conclude that this March
of the Imperial Army, whatever
way they take, can never produce
any greater benefit, than the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of some place in <hi>Loraine,</hi> the
Territory of <hi>Metz, Luxemburgh,</hi> or
the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and by
the gain of that place to disorder
those Garisons which the French
hold in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> which however is
not sufficient to save the Provinces
of the Spanish <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which
is the precise Platform, by which
his most Christian Majesty might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51929:8"/>
without difficulty mount to the
Universal Monarchy, if those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
were lost; there being no
Power at present in a probable
condition to hinder him.</p>
            <p>Now if it be true what I have
already affirm'd, and what I shall
afterwards maintain, that by the
Conquest of the united Provinces
of the Spanish <hi>Netherlands,</hi> his
most Christian Majesty may jump
into the Universal Monarchy, that
all <hi>Europe</hi> may evidently know the
danger of the present Conjuncture
if there be no remedy from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and other places interested,
and that with all the speed ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
there are these five things
to be attentively considered.</p>
            <p>The first is, that his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Majesty being master of all the
Posts, Passages and strong Places
of the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
us to consider, that though
this Prince should do nothing more
during this whole Campaigne but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51929:9"/>
only dispute the Ground with the
Imperialists, it is not to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that the Campaigne must
break up, and the Imperial Army
retire without doing any thing
considerable for the preservation
of the Provinces of the Spanish
<hi>Netherlands:</hi> For not to flatter our
selves, would we have had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists
have attempted any thing
great for the Safety of those Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
necessity requir'd that while
the Imperialists directed their
March undauntedly into the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of <hi>France,</hi> with an Army of
fifty thousand men, the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
forces, then in the Spanish
<hi>Netherlands</hi> should have broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Picardy,</hi> or the Territory of
<hi>Boloigne,</hi> by such a powerful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to have favour'd the
grand and Capital Enterprize of
the Imperial Army. But by the
fatal loss of <hi>Valenciennes, Cambray</hi>
and St. <hi>Omers, France</hi> is so well
entrench'd on that side against all
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51929:9"/>
the Attempts of the Confederate
Armes in those parts, that it is
absolutely out of their power by
reason of those Conquests to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
on that side into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>France.</hi> Now we may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive, that <hi>France</hi> having
nothing to fear from <hi>Flanders,</hi> will
content it self only to leave a small
Army in those Quarters adjoyning
to the Provinces of the Spanish
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> which by the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of those strong Garrisons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its Dominion in the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
will be a force sufficiently
competent to amuse all the power
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> on that
side during the season of this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
and to prevent their doing
any thing considerable.</p>
            <p>In the second place, This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the condition of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> being out of all apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of danger in reference to its
Conquests in the Provinces of the
Spanish <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51929:10"/>
of <hi>Picardy, Boloigne</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t / ois</hi>
which are guarded and secur'd
by the Conquests of <hi>Valenciennes,
Cambray,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> it plainly
appears that <hi>France</hi> is at her full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to make head with the main
body of its forces in opposition to
the enterprizes of the Imperial
Armies.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that <hi>France</hi> finds her
self in this safe condition, I must
leave it to all men of sence and
judgment, as a solid prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all that can be expected
from the attempts of the Imperial
Armes for the preservation of
the Provinces of the Spanish <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</hi>
For suppose that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists
should advance to the
Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> with an Army
of fifty thousand men, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all that they can do, <hi>France</hi>
will meet them with an equal
force, or perhaps with a greater
number, with this difference, that
whereas the Imperialists, to obtain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51929:10"/>
the advantage of getting to the
Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> shall be forc'd
to undergo a thousand difficulties
and hardships, in crossing a wasted
and desolate Country, the French
have nothing to do but by easie
Marches in their own Countrey to
meet them, Masters of all the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
behind and on each side,
furnish'd and provided with all
things necessary, and where they
had all the advantages imaginable
to attack them as they should see
occasion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that we may not seem
to rely in vain upon the endeavours
of the Confederate Forces in the
said Provinces, we must consider,
that by reason of the lopping off so
many considerable Members from
the body of those Provinces in the
Wars of 1667. and since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this present War, it is
absolutely impossible to be able to
do any thing considerable against
<hi>France</hi> without a force much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51929:11"/>
Fourthly, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
since the beginning of this
War, through the misfortune of
the Minority of their Prince, being
unable to establish Magazines of
Victuals, Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender
for the Horse, for the subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of their own and the Armies
of their Allies, and being under
the same necessities and disabilities,
through the same misfortune du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this Campaigne, it is impossible
for this only defect, that any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Armies should subsist in the
said Provinces for so long a time as
is requisite, or that the March of the
Army should be order'd as the
suddenness of emergent occasions
requires, to oppose the progress of
the Enemy, or to gain any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
advantage upon him. And
this may serve for a real proof of
this Truth, that we need no more
but observe what has pass'd within
these three years in the beginning,
progress and end of all the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51929:11"/>
in the said Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
including the beginning of
this.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, although it be true that
by the advancement of his most
Serene Higness <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>
to the Dignity of Captain
General, and First Minister of the
Spanish Monarchy, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
expect a great change in the
Government of the Monarchy of
<hi>Spain,</hi> however 'tis very true that
if we consider the most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
disorders which have crept
into the Ministry of that Monarchy
during two successive Reigns,
the little time that this Heroick
Prince has enjoy'd his Dignity,
and the necessity that constrains
him in the first place to provide for
the affairs of <hi>Sicily</hi> and the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Spain,</hi> make it out to be
impossible for him to furnish suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
succours for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these Provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51929:12"/>
Now all that has been already
said, being solidly true, which may
be reduc'd to three heads, First,
That the Imperialists during this
Campaign can do nothing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for the safety of the <hi>United
Spanish Netherlands.</hi> Secondly, That
there is no solid Reliance to be
had upon the Enterprizes of those
Forces which have defended those
Provinces for these 3 years. And,
Thirdly, That <hi>Don Iohn</hi> is not in a
capacity to relieve or remedy these
misfortunes; we must of necessity
conclude that his Most <hi>Christian
Majesty,</hi> at the end of this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
or before the beginning of
the next, while the Imperialists
and Hollanders are in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quarters, will be in a condition
to Randesvouze a new body of an
Army out of his Carrisons in the
Frontier Provinces, and with this
new Army to come and sweep all
before him, and make an end of his
work, by taking all principal pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51929:12"/>
that remain unconquered in
the Provinces of the <hi>Spanish Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands;</hi>
by means whereof the
rest will easily submit to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
Yoke; Neither the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
nor the Courage of the poor
Inhabitants being able to protect
them from this misfortune. And
then his Most Christian Majesty
will have no more to do but to
push forward by Sea and Land his
Monarchical Designs, to bring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Yoke the two thirds of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because some Critick may
perhaps imagine that my Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the preceding Paragraph is
not solidly enough maintain'd to
be establish'd and made a positive
maxime, after that manner as I
have done it, I think it but necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
before I go any farther, that no
person may flatter himself to the
contrary, to shew palpably and
plainly the possibilities for his
Most Christian Majesty to execute
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51929:13"/>
Victoriously, by the time by me
supposed, what I have advanced
for truth. To which purpose I
desire the Reader to consider these
four things by way of addition.</p>
            <p>First, That it is naturally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
but that the Dutch Army by
death, sickness, or desertion must
be diminish'd above a third part.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in case his most
Christian Majesty should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any such conquest at the time
afore-mentioned, it is impossible to
determine, but by conjecture,
which may prove deceitful, upon
which place he will first begin to
make his attacques; so that, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that the Hollanders do lend
their Forces to the Spaniards, there
will be a necessity that those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should be divided into all those
places which the Spaniards possess
in the United Provinces; from
whence it consequently follows,
that it will be impossible that by
means of this division and allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51929:13"/>
of those Forces, they should
be capable to defend all the Grand
places which the Spaniards yet
possess, which being once attacqu'd
and taken, all the rest excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> will be constrain'd
to surrender.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it being granted that
the Hollanders do lend their Forces
to the Spaniards, and that they are
divided and separated into several
Garrisons as I have already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we may certainly conclude,
that if his most Christian Majesty
has a design to sit down before the
said places, neither the Hollanders,
nor the Spaniards having a body
of an army in the Field, as being
all distributed into Garrisons, for
the security of particular places,
He is at his full liberty to attacque
which, and as many as he pleases
at a time without controul, and
coming to be master of the Forts,
he is master of the Forces likewise:
and so the question will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51929:14"/>
it were not better for them to
quit their Towns without so much
as a Summons, than to lose their
men. For if we do but make a
serious Reflexion upon the violent
and rapid manner of the French
Attacques, it being the humour of
the present King not to care how
many thousand Mens lives he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to his impetuous desires of
Conquest, it is naturally impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but that they should take all
the places which they attacque, as
being out of all expectance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
So that all the Places which
remain to the Spaniards in the <hi>Low
Countries</hi> shall be swept away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Imperialists can be in a
condition to move; I only except
<hi>Luxemburgh</hi> for this year, which
upon the next Invasion is to run
the same fortune with <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
and it may be the next Campaign,
as being without Garrisons or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for its defence; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more certain than that the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51929:14"/>
Souldiers in the Conquer'd Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
will be prisoners of War to the
Victor.</p>
            <p>We may add for a fourth, not to
flatter our selves that the violence of
Seasons, or the maxim of keeping in
Winter Quarters gives any stop to
the French heat, that it behoves us to
consider what time his Most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Majesty made his first Irruption
into the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and
what his Armies have done since the
beginning of this War, all in the
Winter time, or at the end of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignes,
when the Enemies Army
was never so little retir'd, or before
they could be upon their marchat the
end of Winter. Or if we had forgot
all this, the second invasion of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
the conquests of <hi>Montbellian,
Cambray, Valenciennes</hi> and <hi>St. Omers</hi>
may refresh our memories. Which
in my opinion may suffice to make
us sensible that if <hi>England</hi> do not step
in before the end of this Campaigne,
his most Christian Majesty will be
certainly in a condition, at the time
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51929:15"/>
which I have mention'd, to make a
final conquest of all the Spanish Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</p>
            <p>Now his Most Christian Majesty
being in such a condition, from what
you may believe that he will never
neglect such a favourable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
we are also to take notice,
that the said Monarch out of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and capital Interest, cannot
dispense with the Execution of his
intended enterprizes at the time by
me already expressed. For the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists
at the end of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
taking up their Winter
Quarters in <hi>Loraine</hi> and <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
his Most Christian Majesty has
but one Expedient of Diversion to
constrain the Imperial Army of
course to quit at the beginning of the
next Campaigne, all the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and to retreat on the other side
of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which his most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Majestie will easily compel
them to do, if the Spanish Provinces
or their Principal strong Holds fall
at the said time into his hands. For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51929:15"/>
this Conquest being made, his Most
Christian Majesty shall not only be
in a Condition to keep up an Army
of fifty thousand men, upon the
Consines of <hi>Lorain,</hi> the Territory of
<hi>Metz,</hi> and the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
to oppose the Imperialists, but also
with an Army of the same force to
seize almost without any opposition
upon the Counties of <hi>Iuliers</hi> and
<hi>Cleves,</hi> and so to get footing beyond
the <hi>Rhine</hi> on that side <hi>Westphalia,</hi> to
encourage the Princes of his Cabal
in those parts, and probably to force
the Imperialists, wherever they are
at that time, by reason of the Alarms
of which they are so apprehensive
from the Coast of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expects an opportunity for inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Tirol,</hi> to keep close together in
a body on the other side of the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> on purpose to watch the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Now all that has been said above
being brought to pass in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to the end we may believe that
his Most Christian Majesty will be in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51929:16"/>
a condition to subdue the third part
of <hi>Europe,</hi> we are to take notice once
for all, that this same Prince with
only the Forces of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
has been able not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself from the consederated
Forces of his Enemies, but that to
this very time, all that considerable
strength has not been able to get one
single Farm of the ancient Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Kingdom, while this same
Prince actually takes without any
opposition, from the Principal
Chiefs of the Confederacy, Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Cities, Towns and whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
and as if it were not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to advance the Progress of his
Victories by Land, in the Provinces
of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> upon the
Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of <hi>Catalogne,</hi> and in <hi>Sicily,</hi> to the
end you may not be ignorant how
formidable his power is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
he gives an occasion to all
<hi>Europe</hi> with amazement to behold,
how this same Monarch, within
these two years under the pretence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51929:16"/>
of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War has not obtained
only the absolute Dominion of the
Mediterranean Sea, upon all the
Coasts of <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and his own
Dominions, but that he has had the
courage, and a force equal to his
courage, out of the super abundance
of his Naval Power, to send the
Count <hi>d'Estrees,</hi> with a Royal Fleet
to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which to the shame of
the English and Hollanders, makes
those Conquests, of which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
will not fail to trouble
those two Nations hereafter, and to
be most cruelly tormented and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
in their most Essential
and Capital Interests both of Estate
and Commerce.</p>
            <p>And as if it were not enough in so
many different Countreys to make
all the Progresses above-mentioned,
we are seriously to consider that this
same Monarch by his vast Banks of
ready money is able not only nobly
to support his Armies in all those
parts by Sea and Land in so many
different and distant Countreys; but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51929:17"/>
also in his Cabinet by the same
means of his vast treasures, and the
dexterity and vigilancy of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to direct and uphold in a most
wonderful manner, the power of the
<hi>Swede,</hi> against all the Opposition that
has attacqued him, and in the heart
of the Empire to controule and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
those Princes, who under the
counterfeit and false Title of Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality,
by the assistance of the ready
money of <hi>France,</hi> keep considerable
Armies on Foot, which upon the least
misfortune that should befall the
Empire, would be ready to take hold
of the opportunity to the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Empire. By the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of his readymoney he not only
governs the secret Counsels of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but so orders his affairs that the
publick <hi>Diets</hi> of that Kingdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
the suffrages of the same
Court in those very points, which
according to the Rules of Judicious
<hi>Policie,</hi> will certainly ruine by the
Consequences all the chief Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of that Republick. By the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51929:17"/>
same means he governs the Politick
Dyets of the Cantons of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in such a manner, that though
that Nation, by the Conquest of
<hi>Franche Comte,</hi> do perceive a curb to
be put in their mouths, which may
be a means to bring them into slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nevertheless they still furnish
him, through an insufferable blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with the best of their men, on
purpose to assist him to over-run the
rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> as if after all the rest
come to be subdu'd and vanquish'd,
this Republic alone would be able
to resist the power of <hi>France,</hi> when
her victorious Monarch shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
four several wayes to attack
it with all his Forces.</p>
            <p>But these are not the bounds that
limit the Influence of the French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
it spreads it self yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.
<hi>Italy</hi> is replenish'd with
persons of great wisdom and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight;
and without all contradiction
that Nation of all <hi>Europe</hi> is naturally
the most capable to dive into all the
consequences that may happen upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51929:18"/>
the progress of his Most Christian
Majesties designs; nevertheless by an
Enchantment till now unheard of,
the Potentates and Republicks of
that part of <hi>Europe,</hi> remain unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
buried in an unconceivable
Lethargy, and this at a time, when
they see by the successes of his Most
Christian Majesty in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the flames
of a War ready to be kindl'd in their
own Countrey, and that too in such
a part, as has alwayes prov'd fatal to
it, and that from the same part, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from <hi>Pignerol</hi> &amp; <hi>Monaco</hi> they find
the French Armes assured of three
infallible Ports that give them free
entrance by three different wayes
without any Possibility for any
Power of Christendom, if the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> be once brought to
submit, to prevent their misfortune.</p>
            <p>But if the Mercenary humour of
the <hi>Swisses,</hi> and the softness of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
may seem to furnish those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with any excuse, whether good
or bad, to shake off the blame from
themselves for not having hitherto
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51929:18"/>
done any part of their Duty, what
can <hi>England</hi> say for it self, a Nation
formerly of all <hi>Europe</hi> most fierce
and jealous of their Liberty? In re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard
that at the same time, while his
Most Christian Majesty carries <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenciennes,
Cambray</hi> and <hi>St. Omers</hi> in
the very view of that Nation, she so
warlike and so jealous heretofore of
the Successes of the <hi>French,</hi> stands
pausing and flegmatickly making it
a Question, whether it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for her to Arm, and with
her ancient courage to cause a Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of those places into the hands
of their ancient Masters: or whether
she shall apply her self to the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
wayes of mediation, where
the Frauds and delayes of the French
are to be every day encountred. This
it is that causes us to say, that the
<hi>Seine</hi> now triumphs over the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Grandeur of <hi>England,</hi> and that
<hi>France</hi> by vertue of one of her chief
Master pieces, and some certain gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Sacrifices, has found a means to
lull asleep the English <hi>Sampson,</hi> that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51929:19"/>
having cut off the locks of his hair,
she may be able to make her self ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his Honour and his Puissance.</p>
            <p>Neither is it here that the politick
managements of the Counsels of
<hi>France</hi> make a stop: For the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of <hi>France</hi> has not only acquir'd
almost an universal control in all the
Courts of Christendom, from which
those of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi> have not
been exempted; but it is also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that by his pensions of several
Millions, neither the deceas'd Grand
<hi>Visier,</hi> nor the <hi>Cham</hi> of the <hi>Precopite
Tartars,</hi> even to the last Peace with
<hi>Poland,</hi> did act otherwise than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the directions and desires
of the Most Christian King; of
which the last wars and the Peace
with <hi>Poland</hi> have furnish'd us with
a lamentable but authentic Proof,
and is to us a farther Argument that
he who succeeds in that charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
in the same Politicks with his
Predecessour; and that his Most
Christian Majesty is not unmindful
of his Addresses to him. And it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51929:19"/>
observable, that no sooner has the
Muscovite threatned the <hi>Swede</hi> with
a War upon <hi>Livonia</hi> side, but the
Great Turk has menaced the Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
with an Invasion of his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with all his Forces.</p>
            <p>If then his Most Christian Majesty
by the sole and only Forces of his
own Kingdom, at a time when he is
constrain'd to keep in pay above a
hundred thousand men, without any
Hyperbole, as well in Garrison as in
the Field, in the parts adjoyning to
the Spanish Provinces, and his
neighbouring Conquests, yet for all
this makes such irresistable Progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as well by his Armes as with his
money, I leave it to all rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to judge, what he will be able
to do, after he has finished the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> for
that he will be then not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
of the most considerable part
of his care and Expence, but that he
will be also master of a Countrey,
that by means of its ordinary Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
will be able to furnish with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51929:20"/>
money to pay an Army of fifty
thousand men, with all the charges
thereto belonging. And that in the
same Countreys he shall be supplyed
with men, Souldiers and Officers as
good as any in <hi>Europe.</hi> That the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
Spain, Holland, Switzerland, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> more especially have
reason to tremble at the thoughts
that such a thing should come to
pass, if they do not rather arm their
whole puissance, and undauntedly
both in general and particular make
it their business to prevent the same.
For certainly it is their common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
since that if such a Conquest
should be effected by the French, the
infallible loss of all their Liberties
would follow next.</p>
            <p>And for the more home urging of
this matter, that we may give you to
understand the fatal Posture of the
affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> at this time, &amp; how
advantagious they are to facilitate
the designed Conquests of his Most
Christian Majesty if once he obtain
the entire possession of the Spanish
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51929:20"/>
               <hi>Netherlands,</hi> we are seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that as for <hi>Germany,</hi> after such
a success of the French Force, his
Most Christian Majesty will be in a
condition, not only to support his
Alliances, as he does in <hi>Svedeland</hi>
and <hi>Poland,</hi> so in other parts of the
Empire, but also to enable those Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances
to advance their heads with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any danger. For by that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
which this Monarch
keeps with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to prevent for some years
the <hi>Turk</hi> or the Precopite <hi>Tartar</hi>
from making any irruption into
<hi>Poland,</hi> I leave the world to judge
how impossible a thing it will be for
his Highness the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
to defend <hi>Pomerania</hi> and <hi>Prus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
while his Most Christian Majesty
occasions the attacque of his Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
should his Most Christian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
as we have already said, attacque
his Territories of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi>
with an Army of forty or fifty
thousand men, without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
at all to the same Monarch to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51929:21"/>
maintain and carryon his Conquests
in <hi>Lorain, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
either with as numerous or a
bigger Army in those parts.</p>
            <p>Which happening to be true, it
will be an infallible Consequence,
upon the Conquest of the Spanish-
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> that the Emperor and
the Empire will in all probability be
constrain'd to bid adieu for ever to
whatever depends upon the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Emperor from the <hi>Rhine</hi>
to the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> in the
same manner as the same Empire
has been already fore'd to do to the
three Bishopricks of <hi>Toul, Metz</hi> and
<hi>Verdun.</hi> For the Dutchies of <hi>Cleves</hi>
and <hi>Iuliers</hi> being subdu'd all of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
we may easily foresee that two
things will infallibly come to pass.
First, that the Imperial Army, or at
least so much as relates to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and his friends in the
Empire, will be fore'd to keep on the
other side of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> perhaps in a
posture of single defence, while the
Princes of <hi>Westphalia,</hi> either compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51929:21"/>
by the necessity of the time, or in
pursuance of their own obligations,
shall joyn with <hi>France,</hi> as being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
already well inclin'd and dispos'd.</p>
            <p>The second is, that <hi>Holland</hi> being
humbled and brought down by the
calamities and losses sustain'd in the
present war, or the Conquest alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
made, shall be forc'd to agree to
some dishonourable peace; and that
with so much the more reason, in
regard that by the loss of the Spanish
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the Dutchy of
<hi>Cleves,</hi> it will be out of all hope of
being succour'd from any part, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be from <hi>England,</hi> from whence
we know that that Republick can
promise to themselves but little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
so long as the French shall
have the chiefest Influence in that
Court.</p>
            <p>Now the Empire being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to this Extremity, it is most
certain that nothing can follow but
the total Ruine of the same Empire,
if by any peace at the discretion of
the Ministry of <hi>France,</hi> the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51929:22"/>
are forc'd to satisfie the designs
of the Ambitious Monarch of that
Nation.</p>
            <p>The Empire and <hi>Holland</hi> being
thus humbl'd and brought down, we
must conclude that <hi>France</hi> will be at
liberty to choose for the subject of
its Triumphs <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> or <hi>England,</hi>
at its own pleasure.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Spain,</hi> two things being
viewed and consider'd; the first, its
natural depopulations; the second
the want of fortifi'd places in the
heart and Bowels of the Kingdom,
it is most certain that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but its scarcity of Provisions
and victuals in the very centre of
it, that can save it from an Universal
Invasion from <hi>France.</hi> But let the
scarcity of Victuals be what it will,
that can be no obstruction, but that
his Most Christian Majesty, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
those natural defects,
entring by the passages of <hi>Fontaraby,</hi>
with an Armyonly of thirty or forty
thousand men, and by the passages
of <hi>Catalogne</hi> with the same number,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51929:22"/>
by the means of these two Armies,
would in two Campagnes be able to
make himself master of <hi>Navarr, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,
Catalogne,</hi> and the Kingdom of
<hi>Valencia,</hi> and after that having well
fortisf'd his Frontiers, may be in a
condition to constrain the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> to become his Tributary for
the Kingdom of <hi>Castile,</hi> and after
that to grant him what part he shall
desire of his Territories in <hi>Italy,</hi> and
the <hi>West Indies,</hi> which is an affair
not altogether unworthy the serious
reflection of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Italy</hi> there are four things to
be consider'd. First the importance
of those Posts which his Most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Majesty has already got posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of, in three different parts of
the Country, by means whereof he
has a free entry into <hi>Italy,</hi> which
way soever he pleases.</p>
            <p>The second is the natural division
of <hi>Italy</hi> into several little states, which
are for the most part very inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
&amp; will be ready to joyn with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51929:23"/>
the French Monarch, if they are not
already his creatures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly that <hi>Italy,</hi> formerly the
most generous Nation in the world,
by the fatal vicissititude of things is
now become the most soft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate.
The fourth is, that his
Most Christian Majesty is master of
the <hi>Italian</hi> Sea. Whosoever then
considers all these things, will be
easily convinc'd, that if <hi>Lewis</hi> the
14th. assail <hi>Italy</hi> with all his forces,
that nation will not be in a condition
to make any more resistance against
him, than it did against <hi>Charles</hi> the
Eighth, and that if <hi>Lewis</hi> gets a
footing once within it, it will not be
so easie to drive him out, as it was
<hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth. For both the
Genius's, Politicks and forces you
have to deal withall are far different,
as also the Conjunctures of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
opportunities from those at
present. Moreover we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that upon an irruption of his
Most Christian Majesties forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51929:23"/>
the most delightful part of
Christendom, <hi>Italy</hi> can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to rely upon but the strength
of her own native forces; for any
succour she can expect, I see none
in a case to afford it her but the
<hi>Turk, Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be brought so low as not to
be in a condition for any such effort.
Nor do I think that the <hi>Swisses</hi>
dare undertake any such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
or if they should, that their
strength would prove any thing
considerable. From all which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
I determinately conclude, that
if <hi>France</hi> attaque <hi>Italy,</hi> which 'tis
very probable he will do after he has
attaqu'd and subdu'd the Empire
and <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> will be entirely lost,
and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it self will
be glad to draw her self out of the
broiles, by conferring the same
honours, &amp; granting the same privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th. as she did
formerly to <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> and several
of his successours, that being one of
the principal Articles which she
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51929:24"/>
must make use of to satisfie the vast
ambition and soaring designs of this
Monarch</p>
            <p>These great things being thus
brought to pass, there will nothing
remain to his Most Christian
Majesty, but to subdue all his
neighbours, and to bring the
<hi>Switzers</hi> and the English under his
Yoak.</p>
            <p>For the first I have said it and
will say it again, I cannot tell how
the Cantons and Confederate <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
can be in a condition to defend
themselves, against all the efforts
and assaults of his Most Christian
Majesty, they who have not one forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
place in all their Territories, and
who are also often divided in respect
of their Religion; and when they
shall be assail'd on all sides, from <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
France, Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
Against which attempts should
they prove successful, they would
be more worthy of honour, than
their Ancestors ever were, for all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51929:24"/>
their victories formerly obtain'd,
against the ancient Dukes of <hi>Austria</hi>
and <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Engl.</hi> I know that Nation is
warlike even to the height of valour,
I know that Nation abounds with
persons of great gravity, judgment
and capacity to penetrate into the
deepest mysteries of State Politicks.
I know moreover that the natural
Situation of <hi>Engl.</hi> being a kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and bulwark, that it seems
invincible against all the attempts
and designs of her enemies, and that
joyning all these circumstances to
what she is able further to do, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the natural antipathy which
every true English man naturally
preserves in his breast against the
French Nation, we may from thence
conclude, that his most Christian
Majesty will find it a very difficult
task to bring that famous Island un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his subjection; and that though
he should make a conquest of it, yet
it will be a labour as difficult to keep
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51929:25"/>
it. But on the other side it would be
to make a wrong judgment of the
Politicks of the French Ministry,
to imagine, that if they undertake
either the destruction or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>England,</hi> they would make
use of their won forces, without
some plausible pretence, to deprive
so great a King, their Allie, of his
Dominions. <hi>France</hi> is too cunning
and diligent in her Politick Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not to make use of more
refin'd methods of craft and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue.
And it is a certain and
real argument, that the French Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
are already at work for the
ruin and destruction of <hi>England,</hi> if
by a Heroick and universal arming
of the whole Nation, the English
do not put themselves into a posture
both by Sea and Land to stop the
progress of his Most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and the unwary proceedings of
those among them, who joyn and
close with the French Monarch to the
utter ruin of their Native Country.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51929:25"/>
I say there is a necessity, to take
notice of this piece of Truth, and to
dive into the Bottom of two things,
the natural designs of the Court
of <hi>England;</hi> and secondly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
wherein his Most Christian
Majesty will be, after a compleated
Conquest of the Spanish <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
by means of such formal
Succours as he shall send into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to bring about the designs of
the prevailing party to triumph at
length over the unwary cunning
of the one, and the weakness of the
rest.</p>
            <p>As for the real designs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
Courtriers at this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
we may conclude them to
be such undoubtedly, and the same
with those that engag'd the <hi>English,</hi>
at the beginning of the present
Wars, to confederate with his
Most Christian Majesty, against the
Republick of the United Provinces,
and by consequence against all the
Allies of that Republick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:51929:26"/>
And a most notorious proof of this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
is this, that without doubt <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
it self did not so well ponder and
weight those truths which I am now going
to advance, on purpose to let Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
apparently understand the inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
danger into which all Christendom
must of necessity fall, by being forc'd to
submit to the yoke of <hi>France,</hi> through
the Conquest of the Spanish <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
Now <hi>England</hi> being sensible of this
Truth, and seeing withal that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of these Successes, his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Majesty will be in a condition to
keep up an Army of above 150000 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, for which he will have no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
if he do not send them against
<hi>England;</hi> and yet lying still, and not using
any endeavours to hinder the Progress
of these Successes; we must of necessity
conclude, that <hi>England</hi> acts according to
the same principles which engag'd her to
confederate at the beginning of the war
with <hi>France;</hi> and that her mediation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
does only tend to do the French
some more important kindness, to bring
to pass the designs of that Court, than she
could do by the assistance of her Arms
and a publick Declaration of War,
which might be a means to discover, and
put a stop to the conduct of self-interest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51929:26"/>
And it is an irrefragable proof,
that the Self-interested, and the
<hi>French</hi> Party in <hi>England</hi> are firm
in the said Design, for that when
the <hi>Muscovite</hi> threatned the <hi>Swede</hi>
with an Invasion of <hi>Livonia,</hi> at the
same time that, by the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>France,</hi> the Great <hi>Turk</hi>
also threatned the <hi>Muscovite</hi> with
an Irruption into his Dominions,
in case he invaded the <hi>Swede;</hi> the
<hi>French</hi> Party in <hi>England,</hi> at the
same time threatned the Grand <hi>Czar</hi>
that if he medled with the <hi>Swede,</hi>
they would send a considerable
Fleet of men of War into the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Sea: which proves not only
what I have already declar'd, as to
<hi>England,</hi> but also that <hi>France,</hi> the
<hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
observing the same measures,
without being any longer able to
conceal them, have form'd such a
League, which, together with the
Branches of it, that extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into many Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:51929:27"/>
make it evident, what apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>Christendom</hi> ought to have of
the Enterprizes of his most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Majesty, to which his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
are made instrumental, either
through Unwariness or Self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
            <p>Now it being thus evident that
<hi>England</hi> acts as a Co-partner with
<hi>France,</hi> some may be nice to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the general and particular aim
of such Proceedings.</p>
            <p>I shall say nothing of the publick
treaty between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
at the beginning of this War, only
that therein we may find two
things.</p>
            <p>First, That if the <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Popish</hi> Party in <hi>England</hi> do resolve
to persist in the observation of the
said Treaty, that then, upon the
loss of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> to
the ancient Owners, <hi>England</hi> will
be put to a hard choice, either to
forgoe her ancient Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
to the Will of that same
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51929:27"/>
Self-interested <hi>Popish</hi> Party, or else,
with all their Might, to withstand
the united Force of the <hi>French</hi> King,
and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi> Party,
in <hi>England,</hi> that shall attempt to
constrain them to such a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>The second is this, That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it is impossible that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
should willingly submit to such
a Subjection, so it will be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them to hinder the <hi>French</hi>
from landing, so long as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Power prevails; who, before
they quit their hold, nay, before
they land, will be sure to have some
strong Fort or Post assign'd them
for their Security, as is usual in such
cases.</p>
            <p>Which, if it fall out in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is so blind as not to see,
that <hi>England</hi> being reduc'd to these
Terms, it follows, that <hi>France,</hi> by
the Triumphs of politick manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>imitable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of it's Ministers, will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51929:28"/>
be in certain Condition, by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the Troubles, to bring
about the total Ruine of <hi>England,</hi>
in regard that the Fortune of the
prevailing Party, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Kingdom, will be at his
disposal; but also by the means of
such a favourable Conjuncture, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he has look'd on, while the
<hi>English</hi> cut one another's Throats,
to come in and master both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the same manner as <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest</hi>
and <hi>Horsus,</hi> Generals of the
<hi>Anglo-Saxons,</hi> being call'd in by
<hi>Vortiger</hi> to assist him against the
<hi>Romans, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
not only all the Enemies
of <hi>Vortiger,</hi> but he himself and all
his Forces. Or, as more lately,
the <hi>Turk</hi> o'recome the King of
<hi>Fez</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> who had call'd
him in to his Assistance against <hi>Don
Sebastin</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be thought perhaps, that
I have spok'n too freely; but so it
was, that the Son of <hi>Croesus,</hi> King
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51929:28"/>
of <hi>Lydia,</hi> being born dumb, seeing
a Souldier with his Weapon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
ready to kill his Father, spoke
then, that never spoke before:
Who then cannot but speak, that
sees his Native Country ready to
be set together by the Ears, by a
prevailing <hi>French</hi> and Popish Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
For to declare who I am, I am
an <hi>English</hi> man, born and bred up
in the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Faith; but
by the Grace and Favour of God,
reclaim'd from those Erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and Doctrines, both as to
Faith and Politicks, with which my
Studies at <hi>Leige</hi> had infatuated me.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>English</hi> Man, and a <hi>Roman
Catholick,</hi> gave me that Advantage
to be admitted into several private
Conferences held at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
among those of my own Nation
and Religion; and for that I had
thereby the means to penetrate to
the Bottom, and to discover the
Malignity of the present Designs:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51929:29"/>
It is the particular Knowledge of
the present Misfortunes, which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with my Conscience and my
Honour, have caused me to put
Pen to Paper, as one that would be
accounted faithful to my Country,
and a true Christian, to advertise
my dear Country, that these Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
which I have presupposed,
are so much the more likely to
come to pass, considering that the
<hi>French</hi> Ministry, having prudently
foreseen, that it is impossible for
his most Christian Majesty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Conquest of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Low Countreys, unless he be secure
of <hi>England,</hi> have made it the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Master-piece of their Crast and
Cunning to separate the Interest of
the <hi>English</hi> Ministry from that of the
Kingdom, and make them two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
things: For the one having
made the other believe, that if they
would but sacrifice the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands
to his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
that then he would gratifie
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51929:29"/>
the other with the Conquest of the
<hi>Spanish Indies,</hi> the Wealth of which
places, would put the <hi>French-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Party into such a Condition, as
never to want, or fear a Parliament.
This is the Knot which ties <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> together; but because
the <hi>French</hi> Party in the Court of
<hi>England</hi> as wisely foresaw, that it
was impossible to form a party in
<hi>England</hi> against the Priviledges and
Interest of the Kingdom: For that
very reason it was, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to set on Foot the pretence
of Religion; and because it was
well known, that there was a great
Number of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> and those too, generally
very zealous for their Religion,
though as generally very ignorant;
therefore it was, that his Highness
the D. of <hi>York</hi> embrac'd the <hi>Roman
Catholick</hi> Religion, and afterwards,
to declare himself openly for the
same Party; which he never did
do, till he had a full prospect, after
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51929:30"/>
the Successes of the last Compaign,
of the weakness of the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in opposition to <hi>France,</hi> and that
the Forces of the latter were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to beat all the rest put together,
unless <hi>England</hi> struck in to their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground it was, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Arrival of the Dutchess of
<hi>Orleans</hi> at <hi>Dover,</hi> so many Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
were seen to post between
<hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> neither the
Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
nor any thing else that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
since or before this War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to stop the Career of these
Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Upon this Confidence it was,
that many <hi>French</hi> Priests came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> in such Numbers, that
besides that every Corner of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was full of them; it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that there is not a City or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Town in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
or <hi>Ireland,</hi> where these <hi>Indiscreet
Zealots</hi> have not got Footing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51929:30"/>
From hence it was, that the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of these Proceedings, so much
rejoyc'd at the beginning of this
War which <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
made at the same time against the
Commonwealth of the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
though that Court has had
cause sufficient to understand the
Nature of the <hi>French</hi> Zeal, by what
has happen'd through the Power of
the <hi>French</hi> Armies, to one of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Electors of the Empire,
as in the most part of the Churches
of his Capital City.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground it was, that the
last Parliament was prorogu'd for
eighteen Months, which ended not
till the overture of this present Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and all to gain time to gain
the Members to their Party, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we had like to have felt the fatal
Consequences of their Success.</p>
            <p>Now I say, That this Misfortune
is so much the more likely, by how
much it appears to be certain, that the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51929:31"/>
King of <hi>France</hi> is in a Condition,
before a year come about, to make
a Conquest of the greatest part of
the Places and Provinces of the
<hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> and thereby be
enabl'd to subdue all the rest of his
Enemies; and then by means of
Sorceries in <hi>England,</hi> to maintain
continual Divisions in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and by vertue of those Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to waft over a considerable
part of his Forces for the support of
his Party, and so at length, to make
himself Master of them, and the
whole Nation. In which Attempt,
it will be the more easie for <hi>France</hi>
to succeed, in regard, that <hi>England</hi>
may be certainly assur'd, that there
are, within the very Center of her
Dominions, no less than fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Papists, whose Consciences are
govern'd by <hi>French</hi> Monks and
Priests, and consequently, ready to
take Arms upon first Opportunity,
in pursuance of their Designs, and
to joyn with twelve thousand Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51929:31"/>
more, that now serve in the
Armies of <hi>France,</hi> which would
certainly stick close to the <hi>French</hi>
upon their landing in <hi>England.</hi>
Now I say this, That this 'tis
which <hi>England</hi> may conclude to be
certain, with so much the more
Credit and Reason to be believ'd,
because the Memoirs, Rolls, and
Instructions, have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from me; and all these
things maintain'd and carry'd on
by the Management of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Counsels of <hi>France:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
my dear Country may see what
is preparing against her, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and without, for her total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
for which, there is no
other Remedy, but by a general
Resolution, to lay aside all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of Religion, which the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Zealots of all Sects unwarily
set afoot, and to bestir themselves
for the effecting of five things. The
first, to joyn in a league of Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51929:32"/>
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and not to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
until there shall be a Peace
made to the full Satisfaction of all
in general, and every one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
Secondly, in case the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that is now in Being, do
not act more cordially than they
have done, for the Honour and
Interest of the Nation by their
humble Representations and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
to beseech his Majesty to
call another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to implore the Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all the <hi>French</hi> Emissaries, of
what quality soever, out of all the
three Kingdoms, without Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to recall, by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Decree, under pain of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
all the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi>
who are now in the <hi>French</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
for as for the natural <hi>Irish,</hi> it
will not be amiss, to let them stay
behind, and wast themselves in the
Wars: for though they be <hi>Roman
Catholicks,</hi> yet are they as fanatical
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51929:32"/>
in the Faith of that Church, as the
weak Sectaries of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are in reference to their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
and consequently, dangerous
Thorns in a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To set forth a Navy as
powerful as the Nation is able to
provide, of which, the principal
Officers must be such as are no way
leven'd with the self-interest of the
<hi>French</hi> Popish Faction; and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
this Navy with such a number
of men, as may be able to make an
Invasion into such a part of <hi>France,</hi>
as shall be thought most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
worthy the ancient Honour of
the Nation; to which purpose, the
Heads of the Parties in <hi>France</hi> may
be consulted, and never to part
with such places as shall be taken
by the <hi>English</hi> Arms, till his most
Christian Majesty shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to submit to Equity and
Justice, and to make such a firm
and solid Peace as may establish the
Repose of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51929:33"/>
a Calm to <hi>Europe,</hi> and which
may secure the <hi>English</hi> Nation from
all her present Fears and Alarums.
'Tis by a Conduct of this Nature,
that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> may
be able, generally to prevent the
Tempest with which the insatiable
Ambition of his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
is preparing to overwhelm it,
and which seems to be absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
unless vigorously reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd
by such means as these.</p>
            <p>By a Conduct of this nature,
the whole Body of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> returning to
their Allegiance, and coming to
open their Eyes, might at length be
brought to see, that it is impossible
for a Prince, who has been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the slaughter of so many
millions of Christians within these
few years, for the only Satisfaction
of his Ambition; who, led by the
same ambitious principles, has made
slight of all the Solemn Oaths which
lie took in the Island of <hi>Faisans,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:51929:33"/>
before him whom he adores for
God, before his Altars, that it is
impossible, I say, for them to think
that such a Prince would trouble
his Conscience what Religion were
professed in <hi>England:</hi> only that it
would serve him for a plausible
pretence, after he had overturn'd
all the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> to make an
Inundation upon the Cities and
Habitations of my dear Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to burn and massacre, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
our Wives and Daughters, and
sack and ruine the whole nation, as
he has already done, and still does,
in <hi>Lorrain, Burgundy, Alsatia,</hi> and
the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> though
Peopled by <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> And
indeed these Preventions seem
therefore the more necessary, by
how much the more true it is what
I say. For, that my Brethren may
understand me, the Dispute is not
here about Religion: that's but
the mantle which covers the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Popishly affected Party
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51929:34"/>
and their Leaders, to keep off the
sitting of Parliaments. For if his
most Christian Majesty keep his
word with that Party, the <hi>Spanish
Indies,</hi> with all their Wealth and
Riches, will belong to them, by
means whereof, there will be no
necessity for the calling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but it shall be in the power
of that Party, to keep up an Army
of Foreigners in <hi>England</hi> so long as
they please, and thereby to make
themselves the absolute Masters of
the Laws and Liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
On the other side, if his most
Christian Majesty break his Word
with the <hi>Popish-English</hi> Faction,
and conquer the <hi>Spanish Indies</hi> for
himself, which is most probable,
(it being no part of <hi>Richilen</hi>'s Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks)
which <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th treds
in step by step, to take much heed
to the observation of Treaties, (as
<hi>Spain</hi> too cruelly experiments at
this time) I leave the World to
judge what will become of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51929:34"/>
which lies not above seven
Leagues from the Coast of <hi>France,</hi>
when the Monarch of that Nation
having joyn'd to the rest of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
the <hi>Spanish Indies,</hi> who will
then, by means of his vast Wealth
and Riches which he draws out of
this Island, to famish this Kingdom,
and consequently, when he pleases,
to make himself Master of it, there
being rhen no Power in <hi>Europe</hi> able
to prevent it.</p>
            <p>By this Reflexion it may be seen,
that if <hi>Spain</hi> falls, all <hi>Europe</hi> falls,
not excepting <hi>England;</hi> and it is
yet in the only power of <hi>England</hi> to
prevent this; there is a necessity
to have recourse to this Remedy,
as we should run to quench a Fire
that had seiz'd upon <hi>White-hall;</hi>
that is to say, there is not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be lost, if <hi>England</hi> intends
not to perish in the General Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
Religion, Charity, and the
General Interest of the Kingdom,
demand this Diligence, that my
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51929:35"/>
dear Countrey would unanimously
agree to give that powerful Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to that ancient Allie, and by
saving her self heroical, to acquire
the Honour of having preserv'd
the whole Body of Christendom
from that universal Shipwrack,
with which the <hi>French</hi> Fury threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
it.</p>
            <p>I know that by means of that
cold Poison which the Emissaries
of <hi>France</hi> insinuate, and sow about
in all parts, and which is more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
naturaliz'd and intruded
into <hi>England,</hi> as being most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to calm the tempestuous Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
of that Nation; there are
some that aver with some Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that should <hi>England</hi> be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and not assist the Confederates
with her Arms, yet that there may
be plausible Expedients found out
to make an honourable Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
all the Puis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ances now at
Wars. But my dear Country must
know, that this was only a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51929:35"/>
hatch'd in the Cabinet of
the <hi>French</hi> Ministry, to amuse and
blind <hi>England,</hi> and with her all
<hi>Europe:</hi> and that I may in three
words make out this Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what I have said already, I
beseech the Reader to observe,
that suppose this very day, by the
Mediation of <hi>England,</hi> there should
be a Peace sign'd, which I believe
very uulikely to be done, for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reasons too long to be here
inserted: We must needs say, that
in the natural Condition of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
at present, this Peace cannot
be concluded, but to the great
Advantage of <hi>France,</hi> as also, for
the Interest of her Allies; which
being true, two things will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
happen upon a Conclusion
made in that manner: the first,
that the Empire, <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
will retire to their several
Homes, weary and harass'd by the
Inconveniences of the War; the
second, that his most Christian
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51929:36"/>
Majesty, beside the real Honour
and Advantages which he shall
get by this War, shall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with an Army of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand men, as brisk Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
as any in <hi>Europe;</hi> which for
several Reasons of State and War
that speak of themselves, he will
never disband. Now if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
disaffected Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
persist in their Designs of
bringing all things under an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power, I ask any true
<hi>Englishman,</hi> whether it be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>England</hi> by a Peace of
the Nature above recited, that
<hi>France</hi> should be in a Condition,
by the loan of an Army of fifty
thousand men, which he can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spare to his Party in <hi>England,</hi> by
an Invasion of that Force, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Ruine of our Country in
one year.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it behoves us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that in case such a Peace
should be made, it would be of no
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51929:36"/>
other Service to <hi>France,</hi> than to
enable him, in less than three years,

the Christian Faith. I say, this is
the only means, to the end, that
my dear Country, abus'd and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xicated
with <hi>French</hi> Poyson, may
not be so blinded, as to run blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Snares of those Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:51929:37"/>
I beg the Reader's Pardon if,
transported with that Zeal, with
which my Heart is enflam'd for
the Interest of my Dear Country,
I have enlarged my self upon this
point of the Condition and Interest
of <hi>England:</hi> I could not either in
Honour or Conscience, refrain from
making a Discovery of a mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Combination, that goes about
to tarnish the Honour of <hi>England,</hi>
should this Misfortune proceed any
farther. I declare that my Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
extends it self no farther, than
against those Evil Counsellors, who
being corrupted with the Gold of
<hi>France,</hi> have betrayed that Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which they owed both to their
Country and their Prince. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I am an <hi>English</hi> man, that is to
say, born with my Native Liberty,
to declare my Opinion upon so nice
a point, as the Preservation of Law
and Liberty, ought to be of every
true born <hi>English</hi> Man: For that in
Truth, we have as much Right to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51929:38"/>
maintain that Birth-Right of ours, as
our Kings have to maintain the Rights
and Priviledges of their Thrones and
Scepters.</p>
            <p>But, while I am enlarging upon
this Point, some Person, either out
of Ignorance or Corruption, may
perhaps take upon him to gloss up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this formidable Power, which
I have attributed to <hi>France,</hi> to the
end that my dear Country, and all
other Princes and People, whose
Interest it is to abate the Power of
<hi>France,</hi> may be the better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to make a solid and right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, both in general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
of the formidable Force
of <hi>France,</hi> I desire the Reader to
make a true and sincere Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Reigns of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the First, and the
Reigns of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth,
and <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain;</hi>
for by that only <hi>Examen,</hi> you will
find that I have spoken but very
sparingly and modestly of the vast
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51929:38"/>
Power of <hi>France,</hi> which I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make appear by a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct
Examination of this Parallel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Emperour, King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
King of <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sardigna,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and chief of the
Houses of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
in his own Person, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity
of a vast Puissance, which,
after some Victory obtain'd against
his Enemies, gave him the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to dispose of an absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
all the Forces of <hi>Germany,</hi> the
Seventeen Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countreyes,
Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who by
his Orders alone march'd undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
under his Banners, to execute
the Commands of this Monarch, as,
at present, those of <hi>France</hi> obey the
Orders of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the greatest Captain, and the
greatest Souldier that Christendom
had produced for several Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:51929:39"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had under him
the most Famous Persons, both for
Military and Civil Affairs, which
either the Empire, or the Monarchy
of <hi>Spain</hi> ever had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> the <hi>Provinces</hi> of
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were
full of great Armies, vigorous and
well-disciplin'd, and the <hi>Ocean</hi> and
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas saw nothing
more noble nor magnificent than
the Fleets of that Monarch.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this Prince was one
that weigh'd, digested, and resolv'd
the most difficult and important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
that were handled either in
his Military or Civil Councils, and
like a second <hi>Caesar,</hi> confronting in
Person all sorts of Perils and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
encourag'd by his presence in
all sorts of places, the Valour of his
Captains and Souldiers, in all his
most important Expeditions.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, this great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
with all the Territories, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Advantages that he had,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51929:39"/>
finding himself necessitated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
a War against <hi>Francis</hi> the First
of <hi>France,</hi> who, in all, had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
thirty millions of Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
and although he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from the Service of <hi>France</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who carried
the same sway in that Countrey,
which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> may be
said to do now, had nevertheless,
such an Opinion of the Force of
<hi>France,</hi> that he would not engage
himself in that War, till he had first
made a League with <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi>
the Pope, and other the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, notwithstanding all his
Precaution and Wariness, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells us, that <hi>Francis</hi> the First
was in a Condition, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself against all the Violence
of that League, but that also, had
it not been for that same accident,
and which was but an accident,
of his being taken Pris'ner at the
Battel of <hi>Pavia, Francis</hi> the First
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51929:40"/>
had found the Emperour work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and given him his hands full,
seeing, that after he was set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
he was so powerful as to
constrain the Emperour to grant
him several mitigations in reference
to the Treaty of Peace which he
had sign'd during his Imprisonment,
and that he left his Kingdom in that
condition which it has invincibly
maintain'd and preserv'd, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all its Civil Wars, against
the Puissance both of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Monarchy and the Empire.</p>
            <p>Now to make a just and exact pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
between those, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures
of these Times, we must
observe, that <hi>Francis</hi> the First, as
we have already declar'd, had not
above thirty Millions of Annual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and that <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th, who
now Reigns, at this hour that I
write, has infallibly above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Millions within the
onely circuit of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:51929:40"/>
That <hi>Francis</hi> the First durst not
undertake any thing of high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
but by the Consent of his
Estates General and his Parlaments,
and that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth
reigns despotically, with an absolute
Power over all his Subjects.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Francis</hi> the First had a
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth to grapple with,
comprehends all the rest, and that
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth has onely a
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and a <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
to deal with: the one but six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of Age, the other, a
Prince, without doubt, endued with
all the Heroick Virtues hereditary
to those of his most Illustrious
House, but of a Disposition placid
and pacifick, and who has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end in opposing the Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, by
Force of Arms, but out of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity to prevent the total
Ruine of the Empire and his whole
Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:51929:41"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, as he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
annex'd thereto, kept always
on Foot, upon the Frontiers of
<hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
great Armies of six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand men a piece: Whereas
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, having suffer'd
great Losses of his Dominions in
every Quarter, has not now at this
time above thirty thousand effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in all, altho <hi>Lewis</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
attacques him in all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
with Forces more conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
than ever <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
made use of against <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had always
ready in his Ports, and upon the
Coasts of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of fifty men of War, which,
having a Correspondence with his
<hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet on the main Ocean,
gave Laws to <hi>France</hi> so absolutely
on that side, that we do not find
in any History, that ever <hi>France</hi>
durst make Head by Sea against
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51929:41"/>
that great and famous Emperour
And at this time I do not know
that <hi>Spain</hi> is able to set to Sea six
men of War on that side; where
<hi>France</hi> is now so strong, that some
Months since, out of the abundance
of their number, they had both the
Courage and the Force to send a
Fleet to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> which made
there considerable Conquests.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, by reason of
his Naval Strength in the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi>
Sea, and through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of his Ports upon the Coast
of <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> kept, as
it were block'd up, in the Ports of
<hi>Thoulon</hi> and <hi>Marseilles,</hi> all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Force of <hi>France:</hi> Whereas, the
Naval Force of <hi>France</hi> being so
vastly augmented in those Parts,
has so strangely spread it self, that,
being absolutely Masters of those
Seas, within these two years, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> dare no longer appear,
but with the Convoyes of some one
of their Allies. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51929:42"/>
has been no way able to prevent
his total Ruine, but by Leagues
and Confederacies: <hi>Lewis</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
sustains himself merely by
the force of his Arms. <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second wants both Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth
abounds in both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was sole Master
of the seventeen Provinces, and
<hi>Lewis</hi> the fourteenth has invaded
the chief places of the ten that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the ten that form'd the
Common-wealth of <hi>Holland,</hi> all
which he has taken from <hi>Charles</hi> the
second, together with the County
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> entirely.</p>
            <p>In a word, I cannot speak it too
often, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy is tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
&amp; with that, all the rest of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
if <hi>Europe,</hi> but more chiefly <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
do not counterpoise the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Force of <hi>France,</hi> to prevent
her being invaded, and forc'd to
submit to the same Yoak, which he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51929:42"/>
has impos'd upon his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>This is that which I have to say
upon this Parallel, from which, by
the natural Deductions and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
that may be drawn, it
plainly appears, that I may come to
my Conclusion, that by the Loss of
<hi>Valencienns, Cambray,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi>
in three weeks time, his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Majesty is in a fair way, if
there be no stop put to his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to triumph over the rest of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Argument it is that I
conclude, that all the Princes and
People of <hi>Europe</hi> who love their
own Preservation, their Honour
and their Liberty, ought to take
the Loss of those three places for a
signal and universal Alarum given
to all <hi>Europe,</hi> to run to their Arms,
and marshal themselves with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
under the Banners of Justice
and Equity; to the end, that the
Princes who command this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51929:43"/>
party, may be enabl'd, for the
universal good of <hi>Christendom,</hi> to
vanquish those cruel Legions that
so victoriously march under the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Injustice and Cruelty, and
puft up with their Conquests, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solently
advance to the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this Alarum that gives warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Italy</hi> to put her self into a
posture by vertue of a unanimous
League between all her Potentates
and Republicks, as also by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of her Arms, as well by Sea as
Land, to drive back all the Forces
of <hi>France,</hi> not only from the Coasts
and Island of <hi>Sicily,</hi> but to expel
them, if possible, out of all <hi>Italy;</hi>
and this at a time while the <hi>Roman</hi>
Eagles hold the chief Director of
the <hi>French</hi> Arms in play. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if <hi>Italy</hi> neglect so fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to prevent the Yoak that
threatens them, if the Empire once
fall, she can never be able to repair
so great a Loss, and then she can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51929:43"/>
expect nothing but the Misfortunes
which are inseparable from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
and of which the Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Alsatia</hi> are a dreadful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to lay in tablature before their
Eyes.</p>
            <p>'Tis this Alarum that ought to
excite the <hi>Swisses</hi> with all their
Allies and Confederates, to lay
hold upon this present and only
Conjuncture, and by an authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and general Decree of all the
whole Nation, to recall all their
Forces, out of the Service of the
<hi>French,</hi> and with the same Forces,
and others of their Confederates
and Allies joyn'd with them, tho
it were at their own Expence,
which <hi>Spain</hi> would doubtless n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
allow, to go and wrest from
the <hi>French</hi> the Garrisons of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
and clear that County of
such bad Neighbours, as being the
only <hi>Bulwark</hi> of their Liberty in
the hands of their Majors, if they
do not intend to lose the only
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51929:44"/>
Opportunity of delivering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from that Slavery to which
the Pride and Prosperity of <hi>France</hi>
designs them.</p>
            <p>'Tis this Alarum that puts <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in mind of the near Fall of her
Honour, and the approaching Loss
of her Liberty, if by a noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
worthy of the Valour of the
Nation she do not include her self
in the present League of Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy;
and by Acts worthy the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Generosity, she do not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to assume to her self the
Glory of having sav'd all <hi>Europe</hi> in
saving her self.</p>
            <p>This Alarum tells the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes of one part of the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories</hi>
of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> in the Verge
of the Empire, that those Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are sufficiently considerable to
reward their Heroick Endeavours,
for the Preservation of themselves,
though <hi>Spain</hi> should be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to gratifie them one Farthing,
though he can never without doubt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51929:44"/>
be brought so low, if the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Netherlands be but preserved.</p>
            <p>This Alarum it is that resounds
to all the Princes of the Empire,
both in general and in particular,
as well those who have hitherto
won so much Honour out of Zeal
to their Duty, as those who have
suffer'd themselves hitherto to be
abus'd, either by the Artifices of
<hi>France,</hi> or the Corruption of their
own Servants, that he who directly
attacques the Head, directly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques
the Members, and that he
who preserves no Respect for the
Head, has none for those Princes,
that as Members depend upon the
Head. The Fortune of the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Bar,</hi> with
the Fortress of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> may give
them sensibly to understand, that
neither the respect of Blood, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
or Treaties, are of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint;
but that the Maxims of
the <hi>French</hi> Politicks, will sacrifice
them all to their Ambition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51929:45"/>
The demolishing of the Fortress
of <hi>Orange,</hi> being a sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that there is nothing but the
bare honourary Title of Duke and
Peer, that is to be tolerated in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This same Alarum may also reach
the ears of his Holiness, and let him
know, that if the Emissaries of
<hi>France</hi> do flatter him, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of that Monarch, are only to
extend the Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Faith; they are only
Cheats and Deceivers: For it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that the Ambition of <hi>France</hi>
aspires at nothing more than to pull
down Imperial Crowns and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
purely <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick. The
last peace of <hi>Poland,</hi> with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections
which <hi>France</hi> gives to the
Protestants in <hi>Hungary,</hi> together
with the Breaches of the same Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
with <hi>Spain,</hi> sufficiently testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
do but make a Sport at Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith:
It being certain to them, that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51929:45"/>
into Affairs, that under the
name of the <hi>Iansenists</hi> Party in
<hi>France,</hi> there is with much Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
preserv'd and cherish'd a
sort of Venom more dangerous to
the Pontifical Chair, than whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> instituted in
<hi>Germany:</hi> For they were declared,
and open Enemies; these keep
themselves conceal'd, and close un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Title of Zealous Catholicks,
notwithstanding that their Hearts,
as they sufficiently demonstrate by
their Actions, burn with the same
Fury, and it may be with the same
Religion of those ancient Northern
People that so often took and sack'd
the ancient <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Alarum <hi>Poland</hi> seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
ought to take; for that if she
unwarily undertake to favour the
Designs of his most Christian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
the Enemy of his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and the Empire, it behoves her
to take heed, that she do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
her self to favour the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51929:46"/>
of the only Bulwark of her
Safety, against all the formidable
Attacks of the <hi>Turk;</hi> which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
<hi>Poland</hi> to take the more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into her Consideration, in
regard that it is the Interest of the
Empire to take care of the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Subsistance of <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this Alarum that lastly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertises
all <hi>France,</hi> with a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and mournful sound, I speak of
the Kingdom in her three Estates,
that if fourscore and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Gentlemen which are in
<hi>France</hi> do not under the Favour
of this present Conjuncture draw
their Swords, and joyn with the
honest Commonalty, to shake off
the Yoak which now oppresses
their Necks, the name of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and free people, will be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinguish'd over all that vast
and populous Kingdom; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that nothing but the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Meeting of the three Estates
General of that Kingdom, which is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51929:46"/>
able to re-establish the Priviledges
of those Estates, totally lost: which
re-Establishment being never to
be brought to pass, but by a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
taking up of Arms through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Kingdom, it may
be certainly said, that such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
being taken at this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
by joyning with those
Princes, who are now engag'd in
the same War against the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> and that also vigorously
maintain'd till such a Re-Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were made according to their
desire, firm and lasting; there
would be no Power upon the
Earth which could ward off the
Blow, but that his most Christian
Majesty would be forc'd to vail
Bonnet, and submit to reason and
Equity, as well in respect of his
Subjects, as in respect of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
which is so much the more
necessary; by how much it ought
to be laid down for a fundamental
Maxim, that if by re-establishment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51929:47"/>
of the Liberties of <hi>France,</hi> which
is not to be done but by the sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the general Estates of the
Kingdom. The Monarch of that
Nation cannot be constrain'd to
content himself with the ancient
Revenues of that Crown; it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
impossible, that any one
of his Neighbours can promise to
themselves either Peace or Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which being so considerable and
certain as I lay it down, I leave it
to Judgment, how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
all the oppress'd Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>France,</hi> not to lay down
Arms, till that despotick and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power by some means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be absolutely banish'd the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But if the People of this great
and vast Kingdom, will be so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
as to attempt the shaking
off a Yoak so heavy and oppressive;
the same Alarum admonishes his
Imperial Majesty, and his Catholick
Majesty, together with their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51929:47"/>
that these Worthy and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Undertakers ought to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour'd
and protected after another
manner than those of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Lavedanois</hi> were
in their late Insurrections; a fatal
Experience, giving Light to this
most Renowned House of <hi>Austria,</hi>
and it's Allies, that if those Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
had been foster'd and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour'd,
according to the powerful
Sollicitations of their Deputies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
his most Christian Majesty
had not been in a condition to have
made those notable Conquests which
he has done these last Compaigns
in the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> nor to
furnish the <hi>Swede</hi> and others with
such considerable Sums of Money,
from whence those Consequences
are to be drawn that speak loud
enough of themselves to justifie the
solidity of my Assertion in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:51929:48"/>
But if the Renowned House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> with all their Allies and
Confederates, who are now in Arms
against <hi>France,</hi> have any Interest
so Supreme and importunate as I
suppose they have, not to lay down
Arms, till this Despotick Power be
banished out of <hi>France:</hi> How much
does it concern <hi>England</hi> to suppress
that formidable Power so threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to them? I am satisfied, that
only the Insinuations and Profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Court of <hi>France</hi> for these
many years, have began a Self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
and Popishly affected Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in that Nation, which laid the
Foundations of all the Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees
that have appear'd upon the
<hi>English</hi> Theatre, and which no
doubt, the same Parties are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
with the same Vigour to
renew, if not prevented by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Confederacy of the <hi>English</hi>
Nation against the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
there being no other way to
stop the Current of his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51929:48"/>
Majesties Profusions abroad,
by that means, according to the
natural Description which he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the World of his Absolute
Power over his Subjects, to inflame
the Minds of other Princes with the
same Ambition. And there are
two Points so essential to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>England,</hi> besides those that
I have already related, that though
the Renowued House of <hi>Austria,</hi>
with their Allies, were utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
either to foment or to protect
an Enterprize of this Importance,
<hi>England</hi> alone however ought to
undertake such an Heroick Work,
the Success whereof is so link'd to
its Interest, that, if I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
here to conclude, I could
make it out by many more unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Reasons, that <hi>England</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
support it self but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of the <hi>French</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Upon this Pole moves the
whole Being of the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51929:49"/>
Universal Calm and Tranquility of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and the Repose of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
And because, perhaps, I may
be thought by some to have spoken
too much in the display of so much
Truth, I shall say no more, leaving
to every one his full Liberty to
think and act according as his parts,
his Honour, and his Conscience shall
suggest; and so I conclude.</p>
