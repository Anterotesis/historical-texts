            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and lawfully impowered to coerce, prevent, and punish disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

               <p>Of Magistrates some are Supream, others subordinat; some
are greater, as having a greater charge, others lesser, according
to the limits of their Government, some such by Birth and
Succession; <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was the son of <hi>Zerxes,</hi> others by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Suffrage, or by Vote, as <hi>Ezrah</hi> here, and now with us.

remarkably, 1. In <hi>protecting</hi> all the people. 2. In <hi>praying</hi>

people. The <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrates were at first called <hi>Pretors,</hi>
as going before the people to espy and foresee perils; then
<hi>Judges,</hi> from discerning the sense, and expressing the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law; then <hi>Consuls,</hi> from consulting the peoples
welfare; which again giveth a threefold use of Magistracy.</p>

others, governing by gray-hair'd experience, by prudential
advertance, their Subjects who are supposed to be more young,
that is, rash, tender and head-strong. 3. <hi>Elders,</hi> as having
both Antiquity writ on their Persons, and Gravity on their

they are to banish by more severe behaviour; from this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

extended to an hundreth miles about it, exercising his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory
Prepositorship, or <hi>Provostry,</hi> for so I may call it,
according to the Idiome of the word, as doing, as going, as

for giving Judgement in any case.</p>
               <p>For 1. <hi>Memory</hi> is a repository for storing up Registers of

may cause a Justitiary to have both his eyes open, in
deciding Causes: It was this, beholding the King drowsie,
and more then half asleep, while the Pleaders pleaded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him in a certain sum, upon which <hi>Machetas</hi> with a
loud voice appealed from him; this enraged and throughly
awaked the King, demanding to whom? <hi>To your self, Sir,</hi>
said he, <hi>when you are perfectly awake:</hi> This made the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince blush, who hearing the Cause attentively again,
gave true judgement, himself paying to the other Party the
debt he had unjustly ordered the Appealer to discharge. The
same Prince in a hurry being complained unto by a poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
Woman, told her, <hi>He was not at leasure;</hi> she boldly
enough replyed, <hi>Then be not at leasure to be King:</hi> The shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
Worthy, first gave her justice, and frequently after that
heard all complaints himself. The remembrance of which
and such other passages, how competently, as to the memory,
would they qualifie a Judge?</p>
               <p>The 2. <hi>Intelligence</hi> is a pondering upon, and searching as far
as possible, into the nature and circumstance of things present
and before them, the Complainers Grievance, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
Replyes, being not alwayes writ in Text Hand, craft,

in small Characters: To this how excellent is a quick and
piercing eye, to know each Comma, for keeping sense and
right reading, from the breath, eye, countenance of the most
audacious, arrive at the full Point or period of exact sentence,
and may triumph in the conquest over falshood, yea perhaps
preventing perjury? <hi>Besides this,</hi> darkness, the unusualness of
the case, may jumble a Judge, if not more then ordinary
ready to apprehend what to do. I have oft wondered at that
Sentence of the <hi>Areopagi,</hi> before whom a Lady was accused
for killing her Husband and Son, who had dispatched a Son
of hers by a former Husband: here there was cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
and some cause to have compassion, in securing life;


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44006:8"/>
in deep meditation, they ordered the Woman and her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
to appear before them, some hundreds of years after
that, declaring thereby, they would not absolve, nor could
not condemn, leaving the case to the determination of the <hi>gods,</hi>
the Law of the true <hi>God</hi> not being known, and the poor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

Battels with one eye, and some with never a one, yet still
conquered the Papal Armies: But also observe, his victories
proceeded from the bright Lamp of his beaming understanding,
or rather Sun of clear Judgement, upon the information of the

               <p>A Magistrate may, and ought to teach all these first ways,
A Levit, or a Priest, is to teach all the last ways. And he who
hath seen a Quarter Sessions, a publick Assize, a Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

to be in a crowd, let us eye Magistratical Teaching, and that
is done.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Regally,</hi> or <hi>Authoritatively.</hi> Kings have taught, and
yet may, and ought to teach, by their Orders, by their Laws,
allotting such and such a Circuite to the Cure of such, or such
a Levite, and how <hi>David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah,</hi>
taught the people in statuting the courses of the Levites, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Prayers and Psalms for the people, instituting days of
Humiliation, and in benign providences, appointing times
for Gratulation, and how they saw their Subjects, whether
Clergy, or Laity, perform these things, is so conspicuous, that
it were impertinent to prove it by particulars.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Privatly,</hi> and <hi>Conscionably;</hi> there is indeed a time for
all things, and the Season doth Season, that is, giveth a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Savoury Relish to things at one time, which at another

<hi>(shall I call them?)</hi> two Sermons, one in hopes of a Victory
over the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, in 88. then invading <hi>England,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in thanksgiving for its overthrow. But in ordinary, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

the Name of the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> he returned to bless his own
house also, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. It is becoming a holy Magistrate, as
opportunity offers, to teach Humility, Modesty, Charity,
Piety, casting out Vice, and sweetly alluring inclinations for
vertuous Education.</p>
               <p>In a City there is some <hi>Rich,</hi> they may be proud, some
<hi>Poor,</hi> they may be unjust, some <hi>Covetous,</hi> they may oppress,

for Clemency, for Industry, may be exceeding taking.
One says, that there comes to a City, I. <hi>Luxury</hi> and Excels.

the <hi>Adversary</hi> and Ruine. Another being questioned what
City was strongest? Replyed, that <hi>where were maniest good
men,</hi> this is added to make firm, not to weaken, to enlarge,
not to diminish the Judges Authority; for if man would stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be quiet, do his own business, Teach all within his own
Circle, Family, School, Chamber, Lodging, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
shall have less to do, in <hi>Genoa Superba</hi> it self, and shall
be paralell to that City esteemed by <hi>Zeno</hi> the best governed,

among some Ancient People, who sung their Laws, to keep

            <p>It may be fancied, that when <hi>Gambrivius,</hi> (a King over

of the Crown, first, for forming and creating a more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend

Subjects; his first appearance in that Diadem was no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
beautiful, yet short no doubt of this High Priests Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Glory of his appointed Robes by GOD. This
is not spoake to ecclipse the Grandeur of that King, but to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

            <p>1. <hi>His Name offers Instruction.</hi> It was said, <hi>Nabal</hi> is his

and Learning is with him: Some will have it from the

to cast or throw Darts, which Morally a Preacher doth,

Some from <hi>Har,</hi> a Mountain; it is all one. This we

that his peoples Hearts may be touched, as pricked, while he

            <p>This may minde us of their <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Girdles,</hi> wherewith
they were girded, which the Lord commanded in his service,
they were to use; the one being Decency in Cloathing and
Unity, the other signified Readiness and Promptnesse for
Action. Do not imagine it to be curious, if I speak of
Clerical habits, fit to indicat a Church-man, and such may
teach us, who of late years, denyed in this sense their Coat,
and could hardly be known for Church-men; even when
preaching, from somewhat that was seen, heard and done;
Providence or Guilt not giving them the heart to wear that
upon their back, which they denyed in their Sermons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Sons of Thunder and Lightning:</hi> And as touching, the
Girdle, it was discernable, the signification of it being fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; promptness, worn by <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons for Truth, and about
their Loins for chastity; and as Knowledge grew by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of <hi>Christ,</hi> it came up higher towards the Heart for
Love, where <hi>Christ</hi> wore it himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. I say, for the
Girdle, the laying of it aside, was but a presage of thrusting
from them the vertue it signified, running hither and thither,
never fixing upon one thing, save in pulling down, at which
work in place of a Girdle, they moraly wore somewhat that

policy, to get the Government, &amp; <hi>Corah's</hi> Ambition,
to get the Priesthood, freed themselves afterward by leaving
the Rebels, before they were swallowed, or as soon as they

Changelings in their Age, with this difference perhaps, that

            <p>1. <hi>By Men.</hi> This was occasioned by <hi>Moses</hi> absence, and it
was a beastly mistake for fearing the people; he melted Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and framed a Golden Calf, and gave to <hi>Moses</hi> a leaden
excuse for so doing; And I said (said he) <hi>Whosoever hath any
Gold, let them break it off, and they gave it me; then I cast it
into the Fire, and there came out this calf,</hi> as if there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

had come by Chance, by Miracle, by he knew not which
way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 24.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Churches weakness in <hi>Moses's</hi> absence, when
the Magistrat is not present, hath many dangerous Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of a Decay, which should make both <hi>Moses</hi> diligent

<hi>Whom should the Priest of the moct High GOD please?
GOD or the People?</hi> If GOD, why then will he make a
Golden Calf to please them? if the People, why do ye call
your selves Gods Priests? In short, not desiring to rub old
fores, and being obliged to protest against future evils, we
have too many Calfs of the people made among us, and
therefore there is cause to fear the Wolves of the Evening
for a punishment be commissioned to devour, and destroy.</p>
            <p>I have long ago half adored that Expression of a most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend

<hi>Moses's</hi> Wife, her Sister in Law, and what in <hi>Gods</hi> Name
had <hi>Aaron</hi> to do, to interest himself in either, except to
agree them? Yet this is somewhat Honourable, that he is
not the beginner of the plea; For it is said <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron

was an old fault, if any, and newly riped up by <hi>Miriam,</hi>
who being first named, seemeth to have led on <hi>Aaron</hi> in a
surprize, she being punished with Leprosie for persevering:
<hi>Aaron</hi> quickly repents, or was at first Cool in the business,
and therefore is not plagued.</p>
            <p>Every man is free to conjecture the cause of the complaint,
since it is mantled about and covered, I am prone to think
the two Ladys strove for place, <hi>Miriam</hi> it may be was elder,
and so would not lose her place though <hi>Aaron</hi> the Elder
Brother quite his; It may be she was <hi>Fairer</hi> and more <hi>State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
but indeed me thinks says <hi>Miriam,</hi> I being a prophetesse,
born within the Covenant of God, should have place of a
<hi>Midianitish</hi> Proselyte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet whatever was the cause, it was
unluky, and neither by <hi>Moses</hi> nor <hi>Aaron,</hi> was the Campled for

            <p>How closely could this to the shame of many of the Holy

stir up Active, Furious, Superstitious, Ignorant Woman to
speak against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and that in things relating to
the Tabernacle, <hi>Pudet hac Opprobria nobis,</hi> &amp;c. And what
a miserable hinderance this hath been to the Camp? How
Scandalous to our Religion? I leave to my Elders: Adding,
that our preaching work is a work, Angels would account
themselves honoured, if authoriz'd unto; But man, who is more
Masculine; shall I say, more Divine, then a Daughter of
<hi>Evah</hi> must stay his hand; until he fight both against <hi>Moses</hi>

much the more bitter, that this Example with her punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>Do not smile, if I once more suggest, what may be the
ground of this Quarrel <hi>(to pass other causes given as more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)</hi>
It might be <hi>Mose's</hi> wife went too too fine, and <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>

but also with his Wifs Petti-coat: And may be <hi>Aaron</hi>
concluds and assents, She goeth too too light, for one of her
Age and Place, Though I will not make Oath upon this, sure
we are to invert the story; that the fine Cloaths of the High-Priests
Relations, I mean, the Decency of any Habit in a
Church Mans Familie is an Eye-sore to many Prophetesses in
the Land: And some Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> closeth to the Motion,
and with mock-finger, proves that a piece of good Cloath
(to pass Silk) is too rich for a Church-man, when the same
Reformer will allow it upon a Trades-mans back. But mark
the progress of Sacriledge; This Age hath found a way to
cure the prodigality of the Church, there being little left
her but Cloaths, and that to some few; and these also many
would have made Courser. But, let me assure all <hi>Aarons</hi>
Sons, that when the Coat is taken away, <hi>Miriam</hi> and that
other Saint will weare it on their own Backs. And for all
the <hi>Youngsters</hi> ranting, <hi>(for confirmation of his own Doctrine,
of Church-mens grave Cloathing)</hi> he shall walk the streets in
<hi>Querpo:</hi> and court them in a Bare-coat, or pray without a
Cushon.</p>
            <p>Experience of these things ought to make the Priest-hood
wise, and not to disturb the Flock, or complain against
<hi>Moses</hi> for such trifling. And the shame and Horror commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in such Rapes upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> ought to make us more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in our Carriage; Friendly in our Places, Charitable to our
Brethren, more Gratefully towards GOD; and more Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
towards <hi>Moses;</hi> by whose Authority, the Priest is yet

<hi>Aaron.</hi> The <hi>Corah</hi> like resisting of whom, I mean

Church Officers, hinders the Camp more then all the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekits</hi>
or <hi>Papists</hi> that are about us; according to that Proverb
of our Neighbour Nation: <hi>Tell not me of the Turk &amp; Pope, it is

the <hi>New Testament;</hi> that is, the Word of <hi>Accomplishment.</hi>
These two agrees in one, and holds forth <hi>Christ; Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> here leads the People. These two agrees in one, in
<hi>God,</hi> who led them by their hands. And in the Unity of these,
the Felicity of the Flock consists<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> being without these, like
Sheep without one shepherd, scattered by some Faction, or
a dicontented <hi>Corah,</hi> or a <hi>Miriam.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>ninth</hi>

of the Tables, this day hung forth, ought to be that of the

are not to tempt your Shepherds, your Wardens, your Guids,
your <hi>Mose's,</hi> your <hi>Aaron's,</hi> your Magistrats and Ministers,
