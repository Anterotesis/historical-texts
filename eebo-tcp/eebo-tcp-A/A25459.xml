         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and lawfully impowered to coerce, prevent, and punish disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

               <p>The word <hi>Shaphetin,</hi> radically signifies Judging; but that

Judgment as judiciously giveth the sense or being of the Law,
called also <hi>Causidicos,</hi> such as determineth or pleadeth Causes

               <p>Of Magistrates some are Supream, others subordinat; some
are greater, as having a greater charge, others lesser, according
to the limits of their Government, some such by Birth and
Succession; <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was the son of <hi>Zerxes,</hi> others by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Suffrage, or by Vote, as <hi>Ezrah</hi> here, and now with us.

remarkably, 1. In <hi>protecting</hi> all the people. 2. In <hi>praying</hi>
for the whole people. 3. In <hi>punishing</hi> disorders among the
people. The <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrates were at first called <hi>Pretors,</hi>
as going before the people to espy and foresee perils; then
<hi>Judges,</hi> from discerning the sense, and expressing the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law; then <hi>Consuls,</hi> from consulting the peoples
welfare; which again giveth a threefold use of Magistracy.</p>

others, governing by gray-hair'd experience, by prudential
advertance, their Subjects who are supposed to be more young,
that is, rash, tender and head-strong. 3. <hi>Elders,</hi> as having
both Antiquity writ on their Persons, and Gravity on their
Faces, in opposition to those youthful and frisking glances,
they are to banish by more severe behaviour; from this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the charge of the City only, yet afterwards his Dominion
extended to an hundreth miles about it, exercising his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory
Prepositorship, or <hi>Provostry,</hi> for so I may call it,
according to the Idiome of the word, as doing, as going, as

remember the import of these, it will much irradiat our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
for giving Judgement in any case.</p>
               <p>For 1. <hi>Memory</hi> is a repository for storing up Registers of

may cause a Justitiary to have both his eyes open, in
deciding Causes: It was this, beholding the King drowsie,
and more then half asleep, while the Pleaders pleaded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him in a certain sum, upon which <hi>Machetas</hi> with a
loud voice appealed from him; this enraged and throughly
awaked the King, demanding to whom? <hi>To your self, Sir,</hi>
said he, <hi>when you are perfectly awake:</hi> This made the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince blush, who hearing the Cause attentively again,
gave true judgement, himself paying to the other Party the
debt he had unjustly ordered the Appealer to discharge. The
same Prince in a hurry being complained unto by a poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
Woman, told her, <hi>He was not at leasure;</hi> she boldly
enough replyed, <hi>Then be not at leasure to be King:</hi> The shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
Worthy, first gave her justice, and frequently after that
heard all complaints himself. The remembrance of which
and such other passages, how competently, as to the memory,
would they qualifie a Judge?</p>
               <p>The 2. <hi>Intelligence</hi> is a pondering upon, and searching as far
as possible, into the nature and circumstance of things present
and before them, the Complainers Grievance, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
Replyes, being not alwayes writ in Text Hand, craft,
and cousenage will dim the Letters; and to make them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

in small Characters: To this how excellent is a quick and
piercing eye, to know each Comma, for keeping sense and
right reading, from the breath, eye, countenance of the most
audacious, arrive at the full Point or period of exact sentence,
and may triumph in the conquest over falshood, yea perhaps
preventing perjury? <hi>Besides this,</hi> darkness, the unusualness of
the case, may jumble a Judge, if not more then ordinary
ready to apprehend what to do. I have oft wondered at that
Sentence of the <hi>Areopagi,</hi> before whom a Lady was accused
for killing her Husband and Son, who had dispatched a Son
of hers by a former Husband: here there was cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
and some cause to have compassion, in securing life;


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44006:8"/>
in deep meditation, they ordered the Woman and her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
to appear before them, some hundreds of years after
that, declaring thereby, they would not absolve, nor could
not condemn, leaving the case to the determination of the <hi>gods,</hi>
the Law of the true <hi>God</hi> not being known, and the poor <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

               <p>Magistrates are Heads, and excessively fatal will it prove

Battels with one eye, and some with never a one, yet still
conquered the Papal Armies: But also observe, his victories
proceeded from the bright Lamp of his beaming understanding,
or rather Sun of clear Judgement, upon the information of the
Enemies Array, the Eye of the Body being but the Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
through which the vivacious Soul emits her light: And

               <p>A Magistrate may, and ought to teach all these first ways,
A Levit, or a Priest, is to teach all the last ways. And he who
hath seen a Quarter Sessions, a publick Assize, a Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning

to be in a crowd, let us eye Magistratical Teaching, and that
is done.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Regally,</hi> or <hi>Authoritatively.</hi> Kings have taught, and
yet may, and ought to teach, by their Orders, by their Laws,
allotting such and such a Circuite to the Cure of such, or such
a Levite, and how <hi>David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah,</hi>
taught the people in statuting the courses of the Levites, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Prayers and Psalms for the people, instituting days of
Humiliation, and in benign providences, appointing times
for Gratulation, and how they saw their Subjects, whether
Clergy, or Laity, perform these things, is so conspicuous, that
it were impertinent to prove it by particulars.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Privatly,</hi> and <hi>Conscionably;</hi> there is indeed a time for

in thanksgiving for its overthrow. But in ordinary, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

opportunity offers, to teach Humility, Modesty, Charity,
Piety, casting out Vice, and sweetly alluring inclinations for
vertuous Education.</p>
               <p>In a City there is some <hi>Rich,</hi> they may be proud, some

the <hi>Adversary</hi> and Ruine. Another being questioned what
City was strongest? Replyed, that <hi>where were maniest good
men,</hi> this is added to make firm, not to weaken, to enlarge,
not to diminish the Judges Authority; for if man would stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be quiet, do his own business, Teach all within his own
Circle, Family, School, Chamber, Lodging, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
shall have less to do, in <hi>Genoa Superba</hi> it self, and shall
be paralell to that City esteemed by <hi>Zeno</hi> the best governed,

that ever defaced the Church, by pulling out but one stone,

Arm crushed with the violence of the pluck? Where liveth he,
and where was he born, that ever weighed the Sacred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
of the Churches Authority, and at the same time kept
the Ship of the State, from being driven by contrary Tydes,

to his own Amazement, Disgrace or Ruine? And again,
where is that Priest, or how came he to prosper, that joyned
in a Conspiracy against his <hi>David,</hi> and the High-way to the

Reverence be forced from the Hearts of Subjects, from their

            <p>This, <hi>R. H.</hi> is not to compel you to respect your own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
your care for us, and love to us, being highly Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

our Father <hi>Aaron,</hi> and in him we have every thing adviseable.
1. <hi>His Name,</hi> giving Instruction. 2. <hi>His Office,</hi> Direction.
3. <hi>His failings,</hi> Caution.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>His Name offers Instruction.</hi> It was said, <hi>Nabal</hi> is his
Name, and Folly is with him, we say, <hi>Aaron</hi> is his Name,
and Learning is with him: Some will have it from the
Hebrew, <hi>Aron,</hi> to signifie an Ark or Chest; such an
one as he himself kept the Law in, and brought it out
thence to teach it to the people: Some from <hi>Haron,</hi> signifie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to cast or throw Darts, which Morally a Preacher doth,
pierceing both the Ears and Hearts of the Teached, his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:
Some from <hi>Har,</hi> a Mountain; it is all one. This we
learn, that a Son of <hi>Aaron,</hi> should Immoveably be fixed
upon his Calling, having his Breast full of the Law,
that his peoples Hearts may be touched, as pricked, while he
openeth to them the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Indeed the faithful Shepherd will in choice consider, what
pastorage to lead his Flock unto, to call up dead heresies, to
improve not understood Texts, or dark, and seemingly to
us disjoynted Scriptures; as the manner was in our late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,

are said to be Heads, and the Ministry, to be the Eyes of
the Church: And if her Eyes choose not the good old, and
true way of obedience to Higher Powers, <hi>(without which no
Subjection unto GOD)</hi> of love to all men, they may in time
be blood-shot. And I could wish, that our Clergy study
and pray to be free of that infirmity, it being the <hi>Nefarium

these are wearisome, unlesse modestly and without heat
they be handled, they are profitlesse too; There are some
things like Law, or given out as Law, such as old wives
fables, minched Scriptures, such things as are in no Sacred

such passages as are neither commended nor disaproved in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in it there is an order, a comely <hi>Quadrat,</hi> teaching us ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously
to keep our ranks; The four-squardness thereof,
signifying the Satability and Firmnesse we should observe in
that Higher, in that Lower place we are set; Pride was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

Device, the first <hi>Transcendo,</hi> I am most excellent, the next

            <p>This may minde us of their <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Girdles,</hi> wherewith
they were girded, which the Lord commanded in his service,
they were to use; the one being Decency in Cloathing and
Unity, the other signified Readiness and Promptnesse for
Action. Do not imagine it to be curious, if I speak of
Clerical habits, fit to indicat a Church-man, and such may
teach us, who of late years, denyed in this sense their Coat,
and could hardly be known for Church-men; even when
preaching, from somewhat that was seen, heard and done;
Providence or Guilt not giving them the heart to wear that
upon their back, which they denyed in their Sermons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Sons of Thunder and Lightning:</hi> And as touching, the
Girdle, it was discernable, the signification of it being fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; promptness, worn by <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons for Truth, and about
their Loins for chastity; and as Knowledge grew by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of <hi>Christ,</hi> it came up higher towards the Heart for
Love, where <hi>Christ</hi> wore it himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 13. I say, for the
Girdle, the laying of it aside, was but a presage of thrusting
from them the vertue it signified, running hither and thither,
never fixing upon one thing, save in pulling down, at which
work in place of a Girdle, they moraly wore somewhat that

caused Sweat, <hi>(I might say, a Bloody Sweat)</hi> contrary to
Law, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 18.</p>
            <p>I know, Inconstancy is laid to the charge of some of the
Sons of <hi>Corah,</hi> because forsooth, being once insnared by <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben's</hi>
policy, to get the Government, &amp; <hi>Corah's</hi> Ambition,
to get the Priesthood, freed themselves afterward by leaving
the Rebels, before they were swallowed, or as soon as they
could, and therefore admitted again to serve in the Temple,
with their Coats and Girdles. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as to accuse a <hi>Jew Paul,</hi> for becoming a <hi>Jew</hi>
Christian, or a beguiled Man, accepting a Counter for a
piece of true Gold, afterward returneth it for a Trick, or
those simple hearted <hi>Israelites,</hi> who for a time followed <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi>
and then returned to their Allegiance again. In the mean
time these Complainers were the greatest Changers, and
Changelings in their Age, with this difference perhaps, that
whereas, some changed from good to ill, and some from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
to naught: Their change was from good to ill,
from ill to worse, and so held on untill Providence made
their Folly to appear to such who went on in changing with
them, who confessing their Errour, are now by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

            </p>
            <p>Let this mind you of that Proverb of the three great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,
and Labours in the world. 1. <hi>Of a Woman in a Child-birth,</hi>
which is great. 2. <hi>of a Magistrate for a Cities good,</hi>
which is greater. 3. <hi>Of a Minister for his peoples Benefit,</hi>
this is the greatest, in regard it may be most opposed by hands
and tongues. Yet go on, <hi>R. R.</hi> and prosper, many have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
in Sword and Fire, and would have others do so, to
eschew the Method such walked in, and let me advise you, and

            </p>
            <p>Now how unsuteable is such cloathing for the assisting at
the making of a golden Calf. How unfit is it in our Saviors
eye to wash his Apostles feet <hi>(a servile office)</hi> with his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

Savior, whose name is writ upon his <hi>Thigh,</hi> declaring he
hath a posterity by lawful ordination, begotten by himself,
whose <hi>White garments</hi> are not to be stained with the ink, or
soil of beastly conversation, and whose Girdle is not to be
loosed by following each fond principle or nice opinion, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting
the greater matters of the Law.</hi> Let therefore your
Priestly Office, your Ministerial Habits, mind you of your

<hi>Whom should the Priest of the moct High GOD please?
GOD or the People?</hi> If GOD, why then will he make a

your selves Gods Priests? In short, not desiring to rub old
fores, and being obliged to protest against future evils, we
have too many Calfs of the people made among us, and

<hi>Moses's</hi> Wife, her Sister in Law, and what in <hi>Gods</hi> Name
had <hi>Aaron</hi> to do, to interest himself in either, except to
agree them? Yet this is somewhat Honourable, that he is
not the beginner of the plea; For it is said <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron
spake against Moses, because of the Ethiopian woman he had

was an old fault, if any, and newly riped up by <hi>Miriam,</hi>
who being first named, seemeth to have led on <hi>Aaron</hi> in a
surprize, she being punished with Leprosie for persevering:
<hi>Aaron</hi> quickly repents, or was at first Cool in the business,
and therefore is not plagued.</p>
            <p>Every man is free to conjecture the cause of the complaint,
since it is mantled about and covered, I am prone to think
the two Ladys strove for place, <hi>Miriam</hi> it may be was elder,
and so would not lose her place though <hi>Aaron</hi> the Elder
Brother quite his; It may be she was <hi>Fairer</hi> and more <hi>State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
but indeed me thinks says <hi>Miriam,</hi> I being a prophetesse,
born within the Covenant of God, should have place of a
<hi>Midianitish</hi> Proselyte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet whatever was the cause, it was
unluky, and neither by <hi>Moses</hi> nor <hi>Aaron,</hi> was the Campled for
seven dayes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
            <p>How closely could this to the shame of many of the Holy

the Tabernacle, <hi>Pudet hac Opprobria nobis,</hi> &amp;c. And what
a miserable hinderance this hath been to the Camp? How
Scandalous to our Religion? I leave to my Elders: Adding,
that our preaching work is a work, Angels would account
themselves honoured, if authoriz'd unto; But man, who is more
Masculine; shall I say, more Divine, then a Daughter of
<hi>Evah</hi> must stay his hand; until he fight both against <hi>Moses</hi>

much the more bitter, that this Example with her punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>Do not smile, if I once more suggest, what may be the
ground of this Quarrel <hi>(to pass other causes given as more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)</hi>
It might be <hi>Mose's</hi> wife went too too fine, and <hi>Miri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
thinks <hi>Moses</hi> should not lead the people with his hands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but also with his Wifs Petti-coat: And may be <hi>Aaron</hi>
concluds and assents, She goeth too too light, for one of her
Age and Place, Though I will not make Oath upon this, sure
we are to invert the story; that the fine Cloaths of the High-Priests
Relations, I mean, the Decency of any Habit in a
Church Mans Familie is an Eye-sore to many Prophetesses in
the Land: And some Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> closeth to the Motion,
and with mock-finger, proves that a piece of good Cloath
(to pass Silk) is too rich for a Church-man, when the same
Reformer will allow it upon a Trades-mans back. But mark
the progress of Sacriledge; This Age hath found a way to
cure the prodigality of the Church, there being little left
her but Cloaths, and that to some few; and these also many
would have made Courser. But, let me assure all <hi>Aarons</hi>
Sons, that when the Coat is taken away, <hi>Miriam</hi> and that
other Saint will weare it on their own Backs. And for all
the <hi>Youngsters</hi> ranting, <hi>(for confirmation of his own Doctrine,
of Church-mens grave Cloathing)</hi> he shall walk the streets in
<hi>Querpo:</hi> and court them in a Bare-coat, or pray without a
Cushon.</p>
            <p>Experience of these things ought to make the Priest-hood
wise, and not to disturb the Flock, or complain against
<hi>Moses</hi> for such trifling. And the shame and Horror commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in such Rapes upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> ought to make us more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in our Carriage; Friendly in our Places, Charitable to our
Brethren, more Gratefully towards GOD; and more Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
towards <hi>Moses;</hi> by whose Authority, the Priest is yet

Church Officers, hinders the Camp more then all the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekits</hi>
or <hi>Papists</hi> that are about us; according to that Proverb
of our Neighbour Nation: <hi>Tell not me of the Turk &amp; Pope, it is

the <hi>New Testament;</hi> that is, the Word of <hi>Accomplishment.</hi>
These two agrees in one, and holds forth <hi>Christ; Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> here leads the People. These two agrees in one, in
<hi>God,</hi> who led them by their hands. And in the Unity of these,
the Felicity of the Flock consists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being without these, like
Sheep without one shepherd, scattered by some Faction, or
a dicontented <hi>Corah,</hi> or a <hi>Miriam.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>ninth</hi>

of the Tables, this day hung forth, ought to be that of the

            <p>I say one another, for you the people, being the Flock,
are not to tempt your Shepherds, your Wardens, your Guids,
your <hi>Mose's,</hi> your <hi>Aaron's,</hi> your Magistrats and Ministers,
