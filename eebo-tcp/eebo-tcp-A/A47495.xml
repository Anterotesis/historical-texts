            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen a Man Dates his Letter ſo near <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> you ought to expect a long Relation how we came thither, which I'll tell you as ſhort as I can, and that we muſt have Succeſs when ſo brave a Man Leads us as our Maſter, who was the firſt Man hurt in his Army, with a Cannon Bullet, which frighted every body but himſelf; who after he was Dreſs'd, Rid round the Army, viewed all the Paſſes, in order to our Attacquing them the next day: I'll alſo tell you how we came to be ſo far advanced as <hi>Drogheda</hi>; His Majeſty Landing at <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> went to <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> from whence he ſent his Orders for all the Troops to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to our Frontiers, the Enemy being poſſeſſed of all the Paſſes, and ſo ſtrongly Encamped near <hi>Dundalk,</hi> which they had very well Fortified, that if they had not been the leaſt of Men, would have put us to a great deal of trouble to have paſs'd the Mountains; but they Retir'd to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> where they ſtayed Encamp'd, with the River <hi>Boyne</hi> before them, that is but Fordable in three places, and two of them but at low Water: We put our ſelves in Battle, which ſight frighted them, tho' they had the Impudence to come to the Water-ſide and call us all the Rogues, Rebels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> Tongue affords. That Evening was ſpent in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonading, and the next morning his Majeſty was reſolved to Attacque them, and force their Camp, which certainly was as bold a thing as ever was done; in order to which, he ſent the Right Wing of Horſe, and three Brigades of Foot, with ſome ſmall Field-pieces, to a Paſs ſome 4 Miles from our Camp, which Paſs they were Maſters of: They ſeeing us March, went with the beſt part of the Army towards the Paſs, and left in the Camp Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and ſeveral Battalians, and a good number of Horſe, before their Camp, to keep that Paſs. As ſoon as his Majeſty had No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that our Horſe had taken the Paſs upon the Right, the Enemy making but a ſlender reſiſtance, for King <hi>James</hi> had already made his way towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> Commanded the reſt of the Army to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque the Camp; his <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, with Count <hi>Solmes,</hi> March'd firſt, who were to paſs the Ford by a Retrenchment and Old Houſes, that were lin'd with 400 of the Enemy, notwithſtanding they paſſed over the three Battalians of Guards, who were Saluted with a great deal of Fire from the 400 Men Intrenched, ſo left the Intrenchment; and then the Enemy Marched down with 7 great and good Battalians; the Guards received all their fire, and immediately the Enemys Horſe Charged them both Front and Rear; Collonel <hi>Collimot's</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cambones</hi> Regiments in the Rear of the Guard, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Pikes, were a little ill uſed by the Enemys Horſe; Collonel <hi>Collimot</hi> Shot through the Thigh and Arm, but I hope he will live; the poor Old Duke was Killed by an unfortunate Shot through the Neck from one of the <hi>French</hi> Regiments, being mingled with the Enemy, and had received two Cuts by their Horſe in the Head. I March over with Sir <hi>John Hanmores</hi> Regiment, <hi>Tiffin St. Johns,</hi> and two <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were no ſooner over, but the Horſe Guards of King <hi>James</hi> Charged, and ſo well, that ſeveral of our Officers were Cut with their Swords, and theirs Kill'd with our Officers Pikes. By this time the Prince of <hi>Wertenburg</hi> paſs'd the other Ford up to the Neck in Water, with the <hi>Danes</hi>; the 7 Battalians Retir'd in very good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being ſuſtained by their Horſe, who did not fail to Charge our Foot as they drew up. Our Horſe paſt next, and you may believe the Enemy Run, when I tell you our brave King (for ſo muſt all the world call him) Charged at the Head of the <hi>Inis-killing</hi> Horſe, his Lame Hand holding the Bridle, and his Sword in the left Hand; no Armour but his Blue Ribbon above his Coat: In the Purſuit we took Lieutenant-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and ſeveral Officers; a great many of their beſt Officers were Killed, and above 1000 Men; and, to give then their due, they made ſo good a Retreat, and ſo faſt, that we could do them no hurt, but frightning them, which is to that degree, that they have lef<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">
