            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
OF THE
Nature, Use and Advantages
OF
TRADE.</head>
            <p>WHEN fallen Man was driven out of
Paradice, the heavy Charge impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on him was, that in the Sweat
of his Face he should eat his Bread: And he
who first was made of Clay, must receive his
Nourishment and Sustenance from the Earth.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30799:4"/>
His Body must be daily coveting the Necessaries
of Life; and his Mind as earnestly pursuing the
Vanities and Superfluities thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus thro' the whole Course of Humane Life
is mankind destined to Labour and Trouble, as
the sparks fly upward; And all his Industrious
efforts after the good things of this World,
determined in Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, in the Infancy of the World, Men
contented themselves with the Natural produce
of the Earth; and it sufficed them to injoy such
Fruits and Benefits thereof, as that Portion of
Land where their Lot fell did properly afford
them. But when the Inhabitants of the Earth
began to Increase and Multiply; those who had
first gained the Possession thereof, and assumed
to themselves a distinct Propriety and Right
therein, had excluded the succeeding Race of
Men, from all other Livelihood and Subsistance,
but what was subordinate to, and dependant on
such Proprietors, who having Power and means
to support them, did thereby claim a Right of
Dominion over them.</p>
            <p>Then Men began to build Cities, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Societies, and propose to themselves esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Laws, and Rules of Government and
Commerce. And as Men were more and more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30799:4"/>
dispersed over the Face of the Earth, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
That the Productions thereof were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in some Places and Countries, from those
of others. That some Countries abounded in
Corn, Cattel and Woods: Some in Drugs, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Balsoms: Some in Minerals, Gems and
Precious Stones; and severally produced things
of different kinds and Natures.</p>
            <p>And hence Man's restless mind became Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
with a fond desire of possessing and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things. And tho' an easie Portion of
Natures Bounties did suffice to Answer the ends
of Life; yet the Treasures of the Universe were
not sufficient to satisfie the Pride of Life, or give
content to the unaccountable desires of bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
imagination.</p>
            <p>What Men could readily possess and injoy,
were of little Esteem, and soon became indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
but things Novel and of difficulty to be
acquired, were accounted valuable; even Apes
and Peacocks, if but far fetch'd and dear bought,
were thought Creatures of Ornament and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
And those Commodities which one
Country did most readily part with, were as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
coveted and sought for by another.</p>
            <p>Mens Curiosities increased with their discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and their Inventions were wrackt, to find
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30799:5"/>
out Arts and ways of Building Ships, wherewith
to Plow the Ocean, and descry the remotest
parts of the Earth, and searching after the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Treasures thereof. The Use and Nature of
all those Secrets, were industriously inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and Mens contrivances were set on Work,
to make those things desirable for Ornament or
Luxury, which were no way needful for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Use.</p>
            <p>Kings and Princes had their Crowns and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
beset with Gold and Precious Stones; their
Palaces and Thrones supported and Adorned
with Marble, Ivory and Cedar; their Chambers
Beautified with the Choicest Paintings and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings;
their Beds and Furnitures inriched with
the costliest Tapestries and Imbroideries, and
their Cloaths and Linnen sweetned with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Perfumes; their Tables Replenished with
all those Delicacies, that Art and Nature could
contribute, to indulge and gratifie the Nicest
Appetites.</p>
            <p>Every subordinate degree of Men in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Abilities studied to imitate, if not
outvie each other in profuseness: And those of
the meanest condition, were only deficient in
Power, not in good Will, to be as vain Glorious
and Extravagant as the greatest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30799:5"/>
Nevertheless, There are excellent ends in all
the instances of Natures Varieties and Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof, differing in so many several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
from each other; and the indefatigable
Labour of Men, in their Anxious Endeavours,
to possess and injoy them. And all those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Arts and Inventions that have been studied,
to improve and apply them, to the several pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of Curiosity and Delight; have Created
most infinite and profitable occasions of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Commerce: And the various measures
and methods of making all things subservient to
Man's Use or Pleasure, are so many Providential
circumstances of susteining those Millions of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that might Starve for want, had they not
opportunities of Ministring to those that abound
in Plenty.</p>
            <p>There is much of Innocency and Ingenuity in
many Arts and Sciences; in the various Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
and painful Imployments, whereby the
greatest part of mankind support themselves, in
the Exercise of their several faculties; their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
keeps them free from Passions; they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
sedate and composed in their minds; and
in their Recesses from their Labour, they eat
their Bread with chearfulness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:30799:6"/>
Since therefore Man is placed in a Sphere of
Activity, and either of Choice or Necessity, will
always be contriving and acting something,
more or less significant, to busie or profit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
withal. I hope it may not be improper, to
offer some short Reflections upon a Subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein the greatest part of mankind are so
industriously concerned and imployed.</p>
            <p>Now the great Ends and Use of Trade and
Commerce, are for our mutual accommodation,
whereby such occasional interchanges of one
thing for another, become a just measure of
property, betwixt Man and Man; the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
and motives thereto, being created
from a desire of Pleasure or Profit.</p>
            <p>Thus, when Men are possessed of some things,
wherewith they are satiated; they either sell
them for Money, or exchange them for some
other thing, without regard to any gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
or any other end, but that of pleasing their
own fancy. Sometimes Men part with such things
as they can well spare, for what they have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
need of, for their present accommodation;
but without any design of enriching themselves
thereby; but the principal part of Trade, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in such sort of Commerce, in the disposal
whereof, men propose to themselves some gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30799:6"/>
advantage. And from the various opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of Men's ministring to each others pleasures
or necessities, is the great Concern of Trade, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and maintained.</p>
            <p>And the Principal Advantage and Foundation
of Trade in <hi>England,</hi> is raised from that Wealth
which is gained out of the produce of the Earth.
The Proprietors whereof having a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Lands, then they alone can manage
to advantage, are thereby induced to let out
the same to Tenants, who by Contracts and Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
with their Landlord, do render some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rent for what they Hold and Injoy.</p>
            <p>Hence the painful Husbandman becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested
and concerned to imploy his utmost la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the Cultivation of the Earth, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
every species that may be gained thereout,
and turning the same to profit. The Surplus
and Benefit whereof beyond the Rent reserved
to be paid, being properly his own, and becomes
a competent Livelyhood to Himself and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>And from this Labour of the Husbandman,
are derived many other Improvements of Trade,
in the disposal of those Treasures which he hath
raised out of the Earth by his Industry and
Pains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:30799:7"/>
His Corn gives Trade and Imployment to the
Miller, the Baker, the Maulster and the Brewer;
besides his several other Grains, and Seeds, and
Fruits, and Herbs, which imploy and support
as many several Callings: By his Grass he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
and nourishes all sorts of Cattle, and they
support the Butcher, the Tanner, and many
other Trades; His Wooll gives Trade to the
Clothiers; His Milk, and Cheese, and Butter
supply the Markets with necessary Food; His
Timber is imployed in Building; His Clay in
making Brick and Tile; His Mines of Iron, Lead,
Tin and Coals, besides many other particulars,
too tedious to be enumerated, give maintenance
to an infinite variety of Trades and Manufactures,
that in a wonderful manner depend upon, and
are subordinate to each other; All which are to
be accounted as so many flourishing Branches,
derived out of this Principal Stock of good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how great a part of the People
of this Nation, who have no Propriety in the
Soil thereof, yet by Cultivating and Improving
the same to the best advantage, and applying
the produce thereof, to be imployed in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
and transferring the same from one to
another in a way of Traffick and Commerce,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30799:7"/>
obtain a distinct and peculiar Interest in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Wealth of the Nation, by the several Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
accruing to themselves, and greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the Weale-Publick.</p>
            <p>As Land therefore is so principal a Fund of
Trade, it may not be improper to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> That the
Lands of <hi>Ireland</hi> should be improved as much as
may be, that out of the produce thereof, the
great advantages of Trade and Commerce may
be equally incouraged, and promoted there <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
here. And that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> should have
one joynt Interest, and by uniting the strength
of both, they should become thereby considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
more powerful. For this is certain, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has sustained no prejudice by uniting the
Dominions of <hi>Wales</hi> to it; Nor is <hi>London</hi> the
poorer, because several Towns in <hi>England</hi> have
fall'n into a great way of Trade, and thereby
grown Rich; For in the one case, the Wealth
and Trade of <hi>England</hi> is greatly increased and
advanced, by the addition of so much more
Land to it, and of so much more Traffick and
Commerce that is gained out of the produce of
it; and so many more Hands and Purses are
thereby rendred contributary on all emergent
occasions, to the assistance and support of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30799:8"/>
Publick Government. And in the other Case, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
as it is the Metropolis, and the Principal Seat
of Majesty and Government, of the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Justice, and directing the Laws and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Trade, it is sure to partake in a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
measure of all the Benefits and Advantages
that may arise from the increase of Trade in any
other places under the same Dominion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
But Time and Experience only can
be able to remove and over-rule the mistaken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and private interests, that too unhappily
obstruct at present so just an undertaking.</p>
            <p>Another Foundation of Trade is created from
the Fishery of the Seas, the particular advantages
whereof, having been truly represented in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Discourses set forth on that Subject; I shall
only make mention of it in this place, and could
wish that so certain and continual imployment
for Seamen, and so great an occasion of Trade
and Commerce, may receive a publick and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Establishment.</p>
            <p>And from these Two Fundamentals of Trade,
is derived the great opportunity of Traffick from
mutual Commerce, where Merchants buy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
purely to sell again, or exchange the
Commodities of one Nation, for those of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30799:8"/>
for no other end, but that of their own
private Benefit and Profit.</p>
            <p>By which medium of mutual Commerce, the
Riches of our own Country are not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to infinite numbers of Families at
home, through whose hands our Native Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Manufactures do pass, before they are
finally disposed of, but the Surplus, which is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to the remotest parts of the habitable
known World, does not only maintain a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with Mankind, and tends to the
civilizing the unsociable Tempers of many bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
People, but accommodates our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with much of their Treasures, and very
much helps to support our Navigation, wherein
consists our greatest Safety, Strength and Honor.</p>
            <p>From hence it is observable, how unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the institution heretofore was of lazy Monks
and Fryars in this Nation; How little of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and less of Charity there was in such Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where the fat of the Land was devoured
by a Generation of People, that were no way
serviceable, or instrumental towards the Publick
Good, whereof every Man's Experience cannot
but be a Self-conviction And whoever compares
the State and Condition of <hi>England, Holland</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> since they have applyed themselves to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30799:9"/>
Trade and Navigation with that of <hi>Spain,</hi> or
any other Nation that is less conversant in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
cannot but acquiesce in this Truth,
that nothing can so effectually maintain and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Power and Glory of a Nation, as Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Commerce.</p>
            <p>The intent therefore of this Discourse is not
to instruct Men in their particular way of Trade,
how to manage the same to the best advantage;
for every Man's own Experience, is the best di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
for such purposes; and every Man's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interest is the strongest persuasive to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of his own Concerns.</p>
            <p>I shall only propose Three General Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
wherein Foreign Trade may be benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or injurious to the Nation. The Chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of this Treatise being to represent several
Instances, whereby the great advantages of Trade
in this Nation are obstructed and prevented,
for want of such provisions in the Law, as may be
reasonably wished for, and endeavoured towards
the promotion of so great a Concern.</p>
            <p>And First, it must be allowed, that all sorts
of Commerce that incourages the Manufacture,
or at least, the disposal abroad of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as are of our Native Growth, and are
not necessary to be consumed at home, are of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30799:9"/>
General Benefit, and ought to be promoted</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> All such Commerce as brings in no
more than is carried out, tho' it do not enrich
the Nation, yet it is beneficial, in respect to those
Families that gain a profitable Livelihood by
transferring so many Commodities from one hand
to another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such Commerce as in it self is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to the Nation, yet if it procure to us col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
advantages that are profitable, it may be
allowed; but such Commerce as serves purely
to the support of Luxury, and tends in all other
Respects to the impoverishment of the Nation, is
as much as may be to be restrained by Law.</p>
            <p>Trade, therefore having such peculiar Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
That it is a just and certain measure of
acquiring a Property in any thing, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
to all, in proportion to their Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Industry and Ingenuity. That it is a
an Universal Method of transferring Wealth from
Hand to Hand, whereby Millions of People are
imployed and susteined; and Men's necessary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
are thereby mutually supplyed, without
the violent and inhumane contrivances of Rapine
and Force; And that it is the greatest Security
and Preservation of our Publick Honour and
Welfare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:30799:10"/>
It may not be improper to reflect on such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
as have obstructed Trade, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some Considerations, whereby the same
may more effectually be advanced. Now as the
produce of Land is a principal Foundation of
Trade; And the good management of Land
gives the greater Life and Vigor to Trade: So
it must be consider'd, that Money is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Standard and valuation of most Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in Traffick and Commerce; And if such
Money be wanting when Commodities are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to Sale, a great part of Trade is prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby; the Command of ready Money gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more easie and quick Dispatches and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
in Trade, then can possibly be effected
without it, wherefore it is our Publick Interest,
that Coin should be continually passing from one
to another; in the disposal whereof, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
something of Gain to both Parties, having
their ends in Traffick, tho' in different Respects.</p>
            <p>And since all Men cannot imploy their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in Trade, but that the impediments of Birth
in some that are above it; Of Age in some that
are past it; Of Sex in others; And in some that
of Sloth and Idleness render them uncapable of
disposing their Money in a way of Commerce;
it follows of consequence, That unless some
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30799:10"/>
proper incouragement be contrived for such to
lend their money to others, that can and will
Trade therewith; so much Trade will be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Nation, by how much money lies
hoarded up in Chests from those impediments.</p>
            <p>So that, notwithstanding the great advantages
of Trade, whereby all Persons are under a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of improving their Fortunes, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Parts and Industry; yet there will
be a great deficiency in Trade, where Land can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be safely transferred from one to another;
and Money cannot as freely be laid out, or lent,
without Mens apprehensions of being Cheated
and defrauded.</p>
            <p>Thus, a Person being indebted, but not being
able to Sell or Mortgage his Land for payment
of such Debt, may under such circumstances, be
compared to one of the Wheels of a Clock that
is Rusty, and thereby impedes the whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As where a Gentleman may owe 1000 l. to
several Tradesmen? to pay which, he would
gladly Sell, or Mortgage his Estate; and a third
Person, who has a 1000 l. lying by him Dead,
would readily lay it out in a Purchase or Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
could he do it safely. In this Case here
are three Evils: The Person indebted would
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30799:11"/>
gladly pay, could he be able to Raise the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
but by reason of the disparagement and
distrust that is upon him and his Estate, he is
forced to fence with his Creditors for two or
three years; in the mean while, his Creditors
Prosecute him with chargeable Suits; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
extended the Gentleman's Estate, he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to break up his House and abscond, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Ruined, his Estate Wasted and Untenanted
by mismanagement; and so much Trade as
would have arisen from the Produce thereof,
wholly lost, and that Estate which was worth
2000 l. at first, will not perhaps suffice at last,
to pay the Creditors their Debts and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>The Creditors are likewise injured, for want
of their present Money; which in two or three
years time, in a course and circulation of Trade,
might have passed to some advantage, more or
less, through the hands of a thousand Persons.</p>
            <p>The Monied Man is no less injured, having
so much Money lie Dead so long, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any Benefit thereby.</p>
            <p>So that, unless some Provision in the Law may
be found out, to make men safe and easie in
their Purchases; so much Trade will be lost in
the Nation, as shall from time to time be obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30799:11"/>
where Men cannot readily dispose of their
Estates to Answer their conveniences; since all
Sales and Mortgages imply a necessary occasion
of laying out so much Money; no Man ever
parting with Land for Money, on purpose to
hoard it up; tho' many hoard up money, for
want of an opportunity to dispose of it.</p>
            <p>And here it may be considered, for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Credit, and securing those Priviledges
which Land is justly Intitled to; whether Publick
Taxes that are laid on Land, might not much
better be laid on the produce thereof, by way
of Excise, and by easing those few that are the
Proprietors of Land, to lay it on those many
that raise their Estates out of the produce of
Land, since every Burthen that is supported by
few hands, feels much heavier than what is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined
by a Land Tax; being like the digging
and cutting up the Roots of Trees for Fuel,
which might more safely and conveniently be
gained from the Branches.</p>
            <p>For, suppose a Tax were laid on Iron, Lead,
Tin, Salt, Wool, Leather, Tallow, Corn, Hay,
and on Plate, Glass, Brick, Earthen Ware, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
and many Manufactures in this Nation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30799:12"/>
which pay no Customs or Taxes. [The Burthen
of such an Excise would be susteined by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Persons, that it would be insensible; and the
Price and Credit of Land being hereby support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Men would more readily bestow their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the Purchase, as well as their Labour and
Pains in the improvement of it.</p>
            <p>Another Consideration may be concerning
money, which is not only the just valuation of
all Commodities, but it is also valuable in it self,
upon its certain and constant intrinsick Worth;
and is to be accounted a part of the Wealth of
the Nation.</p>
            <p>Every occasion therefore, of exporting it <hi>in
Specie,</hi> without bringing in as profitable a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of money in a circulation of Trade, tends
to the impoverishment of the Nation, and brings
a manifest decay on Trade; Money being as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the carrying on of Trade, as Nerves
and Sinews are for the motion of the Natural
Body. For, if there be a scarcity of Money,
there will be a deadness of Trade; even amidst
the greatest plenty of Commodities; as may be
seen in those Countries, that have no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
for disposing their Commodities,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30799:12"/>
but by Exchanging and Bartering one Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
for another; wherein there is much of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
and trouble, with little Profit; and is
mostly undertaken for necessity sake.</p>
            <p>And it is an unhappy mischief, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
value of our money, by exceeding of
other Countries, gives an incouragement to such
Exportations; as if our money being three pence
in the Crown better than in other Countries. A
Foreign Merchant should export a thousand
pounds of our Coyn into <hi>France,</hi> and by New
coyning it there, get five <hi>per Cent.</hi> and then
bring over a thousand pounds worth of Wine,
and having sold it here, he then exports another
thousand pounds, and by new coyning it there,
should get five <hi>per Cent.</hi> more; hereby two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds are exported, never to be retrieved;
and one hundred pounds are gained thereby,
besides the Profits in the Commodity sold here;
so that, unless some Provision may be made to
prevent such advantages in exporting our Coyn,
a great part thereof, will inevitably be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Foreign parts.</p>
            <p>From whence it may be questioned, whether
it be not of publick concern; when a proper
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30799:13"/>
opportunity presents to new Coyn all our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
with such regard had to the Allay of other
Countries, that it shall not be the Interest of any
to export it, for the sake of new Coyning it
elsewhere.</p>
            <p>It may likewise be considered, whether the
Advancement of Trade is not greatly prevented,
by the unaccountable humour of having so
much Plate in every Family; which if turned
into Coyn, would infinitely promote the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Trade; but while it remains in Plate, is of
no more publick Benefit, then if it were Buried
in the Bowels of the Earth; while so many other
Manufactures are neglected, that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be imployed to supply the Use and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Plate.</p>
            <p>Another consideration may be concerning the
interest of Money; which with great Reason and
justice, ought to be limited to such a Rate, as
may be consistent with the circumstances of Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers;
whereby they may be inabled to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
their own ends in borrowing, as well as the
others gain in Lending.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:30799:13"/>
As if it be, a Country Gentleman that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
on a Mortgage; his end is, chiefly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the present Sale of his Land, in hopes of
some favourable opportunity, to pay the Debt
some other way; and having occasion to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
one thousand pounds, sets out threescore
pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> which he could have sold for
so much Money, and lays by the Profits every
year, to pay the Interest. Now, if he pays but four
<hi>per Cent.</hi> for Interest; perhaps, he may raise for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> clear of all charges, out of
the sixty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> wherewith to pay
the Interest; but more than that, he cannot
hope to clear out of threescore pounds <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi>
Nor if the Lender had purchased the same
Estate, could he have made clear of all charges,
more than forty pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> so that, it is
plain, that four <hi>per Cent.</hi> is the full value of the
increase of money, with respect to Purchases and
<hi>Mortgages;</hi> and consequently, if he pays two
<hi>per Cent.</hi> more than he can raise by the benefit
of the money borrowed, he must run insensibly
in Debt; and the Cankered excess of Usury shall
devour the Gentleman's Estate in a competent
time, at two thirds of the real value, be the
Gentleman never so Painful and Industrious to
prevent it. It is therefore most clear, that no
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30799:14"/>
Man can with a good Conscience take more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
on any Security by Mortgage, then the
Profits of Land will answer on a Purchase.</p>
            <p>Or if One thousand Pounds were lent to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
unless he can have it at 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> as it is
Lent in other Countries, he can neither afford to
buy so dear by 1 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> nor Sell so Cheap
as forreign Merchants if he pays 2 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi>
more for his Money, and consequently, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be beat out of his Trade, or forgoe so much
of his reasonable Profits, as upon any contingent
Losses, may hazard his Undoing, while the Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
secures a certain exorbitant Gain out of the
unprofitable Returns of the unsuccessful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant:
Or if the Trader by purchasing his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
at too high an Interest, do therefore inhance
the price of his Commodity, the Generality of
the People become the Sufferers thereby.</p>
            <p>Such a dead weight, and of so pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
is the payment of 2 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> more
than the common Interest in Foreign Countries;
that in bearing too hard upon the Merchant, it
overwhelms his Trade, and destroys all that Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
in his Ruine, which might have been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on by him, and by his means, derived with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30799:14"/>
good advantage to many others, or else infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
him to inhance the price of his Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to the oppression of the Subject, which is a
publick Grievance, and ought in no sort to be
indulged for the particular Benefit of the Selfish
Lender.</p>
            <p>Nor will there be any Severity or Injustice in
restraining the Interest of Money to 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi>
since Foreign Nations that cannot pretend to have
more plenty of Money than <hi>England,</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
Lend at 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> or under, as being
convinced, that it is an adaequate Interest for the
Use of Money, where a proportionable share of
the Profit of such Money, is as justly due to
the Borrower, imploying the same in Trade, as
to the Lender for the <hi>usu</hi>-Fruit thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Live and let Live,</hi> is an honest and usual Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Trade; And if the unconscionable Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
insatiable Thirst after ungodly Gain, will
not permit him to say so. The Law may with
great Justice compel him to do so; For wherever
common Convenience or Necessity requires any
thing to be done for the Publick Welfare, every
Man owes a conformity thereto, and many be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by Law from doing otherwise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:30799:15"/>
Upon this Reason is grounded, the Statute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the price of Bread and Beer, to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from time to time according to the price of
Corn. And all Ingrossers, Regraters and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallers
are prohibited to Trade in a way so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the Publick; and one Weight and one
Measure is required to be observed in Buying
and Selling, to prevent the crying Evils of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
and Oppression, whereby Men are inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
from making any private Gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that is inconsistent with the common
Convenience of the Publick.</p>
            <p>There are many Arguments that may be
brought against the cursed Vice of Extortion,
whereof excessive Usury may be accounted a
principal Species; but such as will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by these two plain Instances of Lending
upon Mortgages, or in Trade, will be very deaf to
any other perswasions with, but the compulso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obligation of Law, which is well known to
have had a good effect in reducing Interest from
Eight to Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> For which benefit the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might have waited long enough, if the
Usurer's Conscience had still remained a Law to
himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:30799:15"/>
And since the General Use of Trade was never
intended to be an occasion of inriching one Man
by the impoverishment of another, but to be a
universal support to Mankind, by a medium of
Traffick and Commerce, to communicate and
impart to each other, the conveniences of Life,
the Law has frequently interposed to oblige per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and refractory Men to comply with such
Rules and Measures in Trade, as have been
thought most conducing to the General Good
of a Nation.</p>
            <p>Nor will it excuse to say, Men are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to take up Money at Interest, and if they
find they cannot afford to give 6 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi>
for Money, they may forbear to carry on a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Trade then their own Money will enable
them to undertake; for the Government having
an Interest in the promotion of Trade, is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
interested in the welfare of every Person
that may be instrumental thereto; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to see them, not only accommodated,
but as much as may be, incouraged in all things
tending to the advancement of Traffick and
Commerce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:30799:16"/>
Thus the Law requires Inn-keepers to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
Travellers at a reasonable price; and the
like constraint is by Law on Butchers, Brewers,
Bakers, and others, to Sell their Victuals at a
reasonable Price; and yet these Persons have as
much, and as good a Propriety in their respective
Commodities, as any Man has in his Money;
And it might as well be said, that Men are not
under a necessity to buy of the Butcher, for that
they may kill their own Victuals, if they please:
But Money being as Essential to Trade as Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
are, to the support of Life; and the Publick
Interest, being alike concerned in the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of both Cases; they both fall under the
same Reason in the Law, and are equally subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the same Considerations and measures of
Justice.</p>
            <p>A further Consideration for the improvement
of Trade, may be by a reasonable endeavour,
to multiply our People; For as Land cannot
yield its utmost increase, but through Men's
Labour and Pains; Nor can such increase be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to the best advantage, but by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of many hands: And since there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
parts of <hi>England</hi> uncultivated, that would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30799:16"/>
maintain Thousands of Families in way of Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
And Ten times as many Thousand Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
would be maintained in Subserviency, out of
the Trade and Manufacture that would necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
arise from the produce of such Farms. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
then of Consequence, that the Nation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in the want of so much Wealth and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as might be gained by the increase and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of so many Thousand People.</p>
            <p>To effect which great advantages, the Gentry
of <hi>England</hi> may please to bethink themselves,
how much it is there Interest to reside in those
Countries where their Estates lye; and may, if
they please, consider how much it is their Duty by
a tacite condition annexed to that Estate, that is
descended on them from their Ancestors, by
their Example: Authority, Incouragement and
assistance, to preserve good Government and good
Husbandry among the many inferior People in
their Neighbourhood, by which means, and by
repealing such rigorous Laws, as drive our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beyond the Seas; and by putting the Laws
in execution against those many that live idly
in and about <hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
mostly by Stealing, or Cheating, or such like
indirect Courses, many such persons would be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30799:17"/>
glad to forsake their present Habitations, and
wicked course of life, and returning to their own
Countries, betake themselves to a way of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry.</p>
            <p>Another defect, is the Imprisonment of Men's
Persons for Debt, which seldom or never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
the payment of what is owing, and yet
many an unfortunate Man, who by reason of his
Poverty, could no longer continue a Master,
might, if he had his liberty, become a useful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and thereby contribute something to the
Publick; But while he continues in Prison, he
is not only unserviceable to himself and his
Creditors, but unprofitable and buthensome to
his Country, in respect of that Charity that is
thereby diverted from the Sick and Infirm, in
relieving these Walking Ghosts, or Men halfe
buried alive, while the Nation is deprived of
the Service and Benefit of those Thousands of
People that Labour under such hard circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
to which they are subjected by a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Inhumanity, indulging Revenge, purely for
Revenge sake. But I rely not on either of these
Expedients, for I fear there is too much infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in the World, to expect any such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
in the one Case, and too little Charity to
expect so much good Nature in the other.</p>

The most effectual Remedy therefore may
probably be this. To Grant one General Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Priviledge for all Persons and their
Families, to come into this Kingdom, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the benefit of our Laws, equally with all
other our Native Subjects, upon some solemn
Declaration to be by them subscribed, and to be
inrolled, whereby they shall promise an entire
submission and subjection to this Government,
and take the Oath of Allegiance, which would
be a sufficient Caution and Ceremony to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them amongst us, without imposing any
other Test upon them; That being principally
intended and provided to secure us against those
that were to be admitted to Offices of Trust,
wherein they might have some Influence on the
Government: But as to the Trading part of
the Nation, it was never apprehended necessary
to apply a Caution so extraordinary towards
such; Nor can it be prudential to create Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
that may obstruct the Trade and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Nation, where there is more of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
than Necessity requiring it; And perhaps
it is not without great Offence, that so myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Religious a Duty should be made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to Secular Ends and Purposes.</p>

From what has been thus represented, in as
short a Discourse as the Subject matter could be
well comprehended; may be drawn these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>
            <p>That Trade does contribute in a very great
measure, to the Honour, Strength, Wealth and
Preservation of our Government.</p>
            <p>That the principal Foundation of our Trade,
is derived out of the Land and the Sea.</p>
            <p>That the produce of the Land and of the Sea is
improved by Manufacture and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</p>
            <p>That the Multiplicity of People increase Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
and Merchandize.</p>
            <p>That Money is the principal medium, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
People promote Trade.</p>
            <p>That Land which is a Substantial valuable
and lasting Fund; being made a safe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
security, whereon Money may be borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30799:18"/>
at a reasonable Interest: A great part of
the Coyn that lies Dead, would more freely be
dispersed, in a Circulation of Traffick and
Commerce.</p>
