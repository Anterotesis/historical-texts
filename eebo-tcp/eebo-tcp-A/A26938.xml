            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THe Sum of your Letter is,
<q>[That Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> and many others of late, by crying up Holineſs as the <hi>Only Deſign of Chriſtianity,</hi> do 1. give us a deſcription of ſuch a Holineſs as is but the meer morality of a Heathen, [A ſound complexion of ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] 2. And that they greatly obſcure or drown the whole Doctrine of our Juſtification, and Adoption, and of Chriſts Satisfaction and imputed Righteouſneſs; and make the Glory of this to be none of the Deſign of Chriſtianity. 3. That, by this they tempt men, that can but imagine that <hi>Seneca, Antonine, Epictetus, Plutarck</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> do give as wiſe and wholſome Precepts of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good living as Chriſt, to think as highly of them as of Chriſt. 4. That hence they ſecretly reproach both the Impoſers of Conformity, and the Non-conformiſts, and magnifie the ſtretching conſcience of the Paſſive La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinarian Conformiſt as the only wiſe man that careth for none of theſe little things: And that they ſecretly undermine all Inſtituted Ordinances. 5. That becauſe my Aphoriſms and other Writings have had ſome hand in breeding ſuch opinions, I am doubly guilty in being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent now they ſpread and proſper.]</q>
This being the ſum
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50545:3"/>
of your Complaint, I ſhall anſwer to all this in that manner as the nature of the thing requireth.</p>
                  <p>In General, I muſt tell you, that I am reſponſible for no mans Writings but my own; Neither ſhall you hereby tempt me to become an <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> and arrogant Cenſurer of other mens. This is all that I need to ſay of the Book you mention, that it is of very much worth and uſe, to call men more ſeriouſly to conſider of the Deſign of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and of the nature of true Religion and Felicity: And though I will not defend every word in my own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, much leſs in other mens, when I am not concerned, yet I may ſay that I had rather perſwade the Licencious of this age to the careful reading of that Book, than turn it into matter of ſtrife.</p>
                  <p>But it is only my own judgment about the things in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which you can reaſonably expect; which I think the brevity requiſite in a Letter directeth me to give you in certain ſelf-evidencing coherent Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. GOD is the Beginning, the Ruler and the End of all: <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The word [<hi>Deſign</hi>] doth ſignifie, ſometime the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Intention</hi>; ſometime the <hi>End intended.</hi> In the Queſtion it muſt needs ſignifie the later,: Therefore inſtead of it I ſhall henceforth uſe that common word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> I doubt not is meant, 1. The End of God and our Redeemer in the framing and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtianity on mankind. 2. The end which man is bound to intend in receiving and uſing Chriſtianity. (Theſe two are called <hi>Finis operantis.</hi>) 3. And the end to which the frame of the Chriſtian Religion is adapted (which is called <hi>Finis operis.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Holineſs in Creatures, is their <hi>ſeparation</hi> from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſes unto God: <hi>Omne ſanctum Deo ſanctum est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50545:3"/>5. Holineſs in <hi>Rational free-agents,</hi> is ſuch a ſeparation to God, as is agreeable to their Natures.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Holineſs is to be deſcribed with diſtinct reſpects. 1. To the ſubject, 2. To the object. And 1. s to the whole ſubject, 2. as to the diſtinct faculties.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Holineſs in the whole ſubject is 1. Active, 2. Diſpoſitive or Habitual. 3. Relative: or is In our Acts, Habits &amp; Relations.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Active Holineſs is our Active Dedication, devotion or adherence unto God, begun in our Converſion to him, and Chriſtian <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, and exerciſed after in the practice of our lives.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Habitual Holineſs, is that fixed Inclination or Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſoul, by which it is fitted to perform the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Active</hi> adherence and devotion with ſtrength, facility, and conſtancy.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Relative Holineſs is the Relation of Man (or Angel) thus <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitively</hi> devoted to God: which is particularly to be conſidered with the <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Beſides the commoner Holineſs of all Saints, there is alſo an <hi>Office-Holineſs</hi> of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> (though ſome deny it) and of Chriſts Miniſters: which containeth their <hi>Active</hi> Dedication to their proper work, their <hi>Diſpoſitive Aptitude</hi> for it, and their <hi>Relation</hi> to God in it. And accordingly the <hi>anointing</hi> to ſuch <hi>office,</hi> and the giving of the Holy Ghoſt for its performance, ſignifie ſomewhat elſe than the common ſanctification of all Saints. As the work to which they are anointed is more.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Holineſs</hi> in reſpect of the diſtinct faculties is, 1. In the <hi>vital and executive Power</hi> (for ſuch a diſtinct faculty there is) and then it is called <hi>Spiritual Quickning, Life,</hi> and <hi>Strength.</hi> 2. In the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> where it is called <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Illumination</hi> or <hi>Light, (Knowledge</hi> and <hi>faith.</hi>) 3. In the <hi>will,</hi> where it is called, <hi>Spiritual Love,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> in an eminent narrower ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50545:4"/>13. Holineſs is not to be deſcribed or underſtood without its proper Object, which doth eſſentially Conſtitute it. Its no true deſcription which omitteth it.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Object of Holineſs, Primary, Immediate and proper is GOD himſelf. The ſecondary and remoter Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is the Impreſſions, Image or Glory of God in his works.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. GOD is the object and <hi>terminus</hi> of our Holineſs, as in his Divine Per<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ections, ſo in his three grand Relations, as he is our <hi>Efficient, Dirigen<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and <hi>Finial Cauſe</hi>; And in his three great Relations to his Intellectual Creatures, as he is our <hi>Owner</hi> our <hi>Ruler,</hi> and our <hi>Lover</hi> or Benefactor, All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in the word [<hi>Father:</hi>] And this on the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Relation and work, of his being our <hi>Creator, Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Our <hi>Holineſs</hi> therefore is our anſwerable threefold Relation to God, that we be, <hi>ſui, ſubditi, amatores,</hi> his <hi>Own,</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi> and his <hi>Lovers</hi>; All comprehended in the word [<hi>Children</hi>] that we be <hi>peculiarly the children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. From all this the true deſcription of Holineſs is obvious and ſure, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the Active Habitual and conſequently relative, Separation, Dedication, &amp; Devotion, of Intellectual free-agents, by Life, Light and Love, to God our Father as his Children; or to God our Abſolute <hi>Owner, Ruler</hi> and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, our Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, as his own peculiars, his Subjects and his Lovers.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Though every one that is Holy hath not this diſtinct and orderly conception of the nature of Holineſs, yet every one that is Holy, hath really all this in himſelf. And its pity that ſo uſeful a part of knowledge as is that of the pourtraicture of the new Creature, or the Image of God on man, ſhould not be found in all that have the thing. Though it is to be no more wondred at, than that Men who have Intellects, and Wills, and Vital Power, are ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50545:4"/>
with difficulties and diſputes about the nature of them, as the greateſt Philoſophers are.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The ſecondary Objects of our Holineſs (<hi>Active</hi> and <hi>diſpoſitive,</hi>) being Gods Image and Appearance in all his works, it is this that is often called [<hi>His Glory,</hi>] that is, as his <hi>Glory</hi> is made mans object and his end; even the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous communication, and reflections, and appearance of God in his perfections, on our ſelves and on all his works (and not only the praiſe that we give him for them, by our thoughts or words..)</p>
                  <p n="20">20. As more or leſs of God is found in any thing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo we are more or leſs to Love and Honour them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do it for God appearing in them.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. There are not only different degrees therefore, but alſo different <hi>ſorts</hi> of Love and Honour due to different Things and Perſons, as God hath communicated different gifts to them. (As Virtue, Office, Magiſtracy, Miniſtry, Parentage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="22">22. When any of theſe is Loved and Honoured truly for Gods Image or Glory appearing in them, it is ultimately GOD himſelf that is Loved and Honoured in and through them: And ſo even this Love of God appearing in his Creatures (animate or inanimate, intellectual, or his Word and Ordinances) is a <hi>Holy Love</hi>; when as the Love of all the ſame things, on <hi>another account,</hi> and not as God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and beloved in them, is but a <hi>common</hi> and <hi>unholy</hi> Love.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Accordingly it is a real ſecondary part of our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to Love our neighbour as our ſelves, for that of God which equally appeareth in him; and to do juſtly unto all, and to Love our <hi>ſelves</hi> on the ſame account, and to keep our ſelves in temperance, chaſtity, ſobriety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the duties of the ſecond Table, are a <hi>ſecondary Holineſs,</hi> as they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50545:5"/>
are chained to the firſt, by the relation that the Creature hath to God, and as God is the Beginning and End in all; that is, 1. As all things are <hi>of Him</hi>; And as he is the Maker and Owner of us and them. 2. As all things are <hi>Through Him,</hi> and as he is the <hi>Ruler</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and commandeth him this duty. 3. As <hi>all things</hi> are <hi>To Him</hi>; and as he is the <hi>End</hi> of us and all things; and thus all things are ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified</hi> to Believers.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. So alſo when Parents, Magiſtrates and Paſtors, are Loved, Honoured and <hi>Obeyed</hi> in their pure ſubordination to God, (<hi>viz.</hi> 1. As they have their Power and Office from God. 2. And as this is commanded us by God. 3. And as they Honour God, and as our duty honoureth or glorifieth Him, and as he is pleaſed in it) this alſo is a ſecondary Part of our Holineſs: But when they are honoured and obeyed, meerly for <hi>fear,</hi> or for our <hi>own ends,</hi> or on any humane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, not ſubordinate and referred as a means to the glory and pleaſing of God, it is a common and unholy Honour and Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. As all mankind are falln by him, from God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and other Creatures, ſo Holineſs is their contrary adherence to God upon their return. And ſo when we ſay all the world is diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts, the <hi>Unholy</hi> and the <hi>Holy,</hi> or the <hi>Ungodly</hi> and the <hi>Godly,</hi> we mean that one part adhere to carnal ſelf and creatures as ſerviceable to carnal ſelf, and the other part are converted from <hi>ſelf</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and uſe the Creatures as a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> as he is their End.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The word <hi>Morality</hi> is made ambiguous by the looſe and various uſe of men, not uſed to any accurateneſs of ſpeech: But the firſt, famous and moſt notable acception of the word, is to ſignifie all <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> or conformity and diſconformity to the ruling Will or Law of God;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50545:5"/>
as Ethicks or Morals as diſtinct from Phyſicks, and other Sciences. And in this uſual ſenſe, All things commanded by God are directly, and all things <hi>forbidden,</hi> reductively, the parts of Morality: That is all Moral Good and Evil: and ſo faith in Chriſt is a great part of our true Morality. And they that will needs take the word in any narrower private ſenſe, prepare for quarrels; and are obliged to explain themſelves, before they cenſure others or diſpute about an ambiguous word.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. The ſum of Holineſs and Morality (which is all one) is, the Love of God as God (including abſolute Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Subjection,) and the <hi>Love</hi> of man and all things for God appearing in them, and ſerved by them.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. If either Heathens or wicked nominal Chriſtians do take <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>Morality</hi> to be only the Love of our ſelves, and our neighbours, and a diſpoſition of mind, and courſe of life, in which we live orderly, juſtly and charitably to all, and ſoberly to our own minds and bodies, and all this only for the maintaining of the temporal proſperity of our ſelves and others, or for the meriting of a proſperity in the life to come; not at all referring all this to GOD, as the Beginning, the Guide and the ultimate <hi>End</hi> of all; It is but Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally called either <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>Morality,</hi> and not in a proper or univocal ſenſe; becauſe the <hi>End</hi> is left out which muſt give being to all true Holineſs and Morality. (Of which ſee my Agreement with Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> in my ſmall Tractate of <hi>ſaving Faith.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="29">29. The meaning of thoſe Divines of my acquaintance, that ſpeak againſt preaching meer <hi>morality,</hi> is indeed againſt theſe that preach <hi>no morality,</hi> but the Ethicks or analogical Morality of Atheiſts, who leave out the <hi>End</hi>; or elſe a <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Morality,</hi> which we call the <hi>Natural part,</hi> leaving out <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as if that were no part of <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>Morality</hi>:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50545:6"/>
or treat lightly and looſly of it, as if it were a ceremony or <hi>thing indifferent,</hi> as needleſs if not troubleſome to the world, as their things called <hi>Indifferent</hi> are. And what Chriſtian can excuſe that ſort of preaching.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. As elſewhere I have often ſaid, we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between the Primitive or Primary and Natural part of Holineſs; which is GODLINESSE or our LOVE to God as ſuch; and the <hi>mediate</hi> remedying, ſubſervient Part, which is <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Christianity</hi> as ſuch. The firſt is as <hi>our Health,</hi> the ſecond as our <hi>Medicine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. This diſtinction is it which is intended by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they ſo often tell us, that we are <hi>ſanctified</hi> or receive the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of holineſs, by believing in Chriſt; <hi>Faith</hi> kindling <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> kindled by <hi>Faith,</hi> being the two parts, and whole of our Religion.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Gods only End in this and all his works, (ſo far as he may be ſaid to intend an end) is <hi>ultimately Himſelf</hi> (for he can have no other <hi>ultimate end.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="33">33. When we ſay GOD is his own <hi>End,</hi> we mean not that his <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> is his <hi>End</hi> (for of that there cannot be a <hi>means</hi>:) But formally it is the fulfilling and <hi>complacency</hi> of his <hi>Will.</hi> For his <hi>Will</hi> is the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of all things cauſed by him.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Materially Gods higheſt end (or the ſummary of all means) in order to this complacency of his will, which is the formal ultimate End, is his <hi>Glory</hi>; that is, The foreſaid <hi>glorious impreſs</hi> or <hi>appearance</hi> of himſelf communicated to his Creatures, and found in his works. And this is not only the Image or Glory of his Holineſs, (though that be the moſt eminent part) but alſo of his Omnipotence and Omniſcience: (unleſs any will take the the word [Holineſs] in God ſo largely as to comprehend all his perfections.)</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And here his <hi>Glory</hi> reſplendent in the univerſe (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50545:6"/>
Chriſt and the whole Creation) being the Total, comprehending all the parts, muſt needs have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence before each part.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. And among the Parts the Glory of God ſhining forth in the whole heavenly Society (Chriſt, Angels and Men) muſt needs have the preheminence.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. And if you come down to Individuals, his Glory ſhining in the Perſon of Chriſt is greater (and ſo neareſt to the ultimate end) than his Glory in Angels or Men: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt in his created nature is the Beſt and Higheſt of Gods works; And therefore as God is more glorified in the Sun, than in a Star, ſo is he more glorified in Chriſt, than in any Man or Angel.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Gods Wiſdom, Love and Power, were wonderfully glorious in the perſon of Chriſt, and in all his works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for our Redemption, when he was on Earth; much more in his Perſon and Interceſſion in the Heavens.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. And as to the <hi>Effects</hi> of Redemption upon Man, the <hi>Glory</hi> of Gods Wiſdom, Love, and Holineſs, Juſtice and Mercy, do ſhine forth wonderfully in our Union with Chriſt, and Memberſhip of his Political Body, in our free Pardon and Juſtification, Reconciliation and Adoption, through the <hi>Sacrifice, Merit,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Chriſt, and not in our Sanctification only.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. The ſame I may ſay of all Gods mercies, which as immediate demonſtrations of his Goodneſs do glorifie him; and alſo of his judgments now, and of the great and glorious final judgment, in which Gods Wiſdom and Goodneſs, Truth, Juſtice and Mercy will be immediately glorified, and not only as the judgment maketh man Holy, nor only as it declareth us to be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. The Holineſs of God is wonderfully glorified in that he will have no <hi>immediate Communion</hi> with any ſoul that is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50545:7"/>
defiled with the ſmalleſt ſin; But after they have once ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and till they are perfected, be they never ſo ſincerely Holy, their whole Communion with him (as to <hi>receiving</hi> from him, and Returning to him) muſt be only by a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that hath no ſin. All mercy muſt be given by him, (ev<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the <hi>ſpirit</hi> it ſelf) and all our ſacrifices and duty offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God by him. Only the <hi>ſinleſs</hi> can have <hi>immediate Communion</hi> with God, at leaſt as to <hi>moral</hi> Communication (For of Phyſical I will not here diſpute.)</p>
                  <p n="42">42. The Wiſdome, and Goodneſs of God are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully glorified, in providing this incomprehenſible way of our Redemption, that by it Juſtice and Holineſs may be as fully glorified, the Truth of God vindicated, the Honour and Authority of the Law and Lawgiver preſerved, and ſin diſgraced and confounded, by the <hi>Sacrifice, Merit</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion</hi> of Chriſt, as if all ſinners themſelves had been condemned. (All which and much more Mr. <hi>Truman</hi> in his <hi>Great Propitiation</hi> hath fullier opened, than I can now ſtay to do, and therefore to him I muſt refer you.)</p>
                  <p n="43">43. In this <hi>Aptitude</hi> of it to attain theſe <hi>ends</hi> of God our Ruler and Benefactor, better than mans damnation could have done, conſiſteth the <hi>ſatisfactorineſs</hi> and <hi>meritoriouſneſs</hi> of the Death or <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſt, and not in the <hi>Identity in kind,</hi> or in the <hi>equal proportion</hi> of <hi>the Degree</hi> of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as compared with that which man deſerved.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. By all this it is evident, that our <hi>Perſonal Holineſs</hi> is not the <hi>only end</hi> (or deſign) of God in mans Redemption, nor in inſtituting the Chriſtian Religion. But if God muſt be ſaid to have <hi>no End,</hi> which is alſo a <hi>means,</hi> (but only the <hi>ultimate End,</hi> the <hi>complacency</hi> of his bleſſed <hi>will,</hi> which is no <hi>means,</hi> but all are <hi>means to it</hi>) then our <hi>Holineſs</hi> is none of Gods end, but one means to it. But if the <hi>means them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> as the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>lower means,</hi> may be called <hi>Gods End,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50545:7"/>
after the manner of imperfect man, than our Holineſs is one of his inferior ends, among many others; It being one <hi>Part</hi> of that <hi>univerſal frame,</hi> in which <hi>conjoyned</hi> his <hi>Glory moſt</hi> appeareth, in which his bleſſed will taketh complacency.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. And all this being ſo evident to all that receive the Chriſtian faith, when this <hi>Learned worthy Man,</hi> and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do ſay that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the only <hi>Deſign of the Promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. you mud not interpret them too ſeverely, nor ſuppoſe them to ſpeak properly or accurately; but [<hi>only</hi>] is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical expreſſion, (as many uſe the word <hi>Infinite</hi> as an attribute of created things, inſtead of <hi>Great,</hi>) Doubtleſs he intended it not as <hi>excluſive</hi> of all other ends (either of God or Man,) And the mode of the age having turned accurate School-language, into figurative and ſuch as Rhetoricians uſe, may teach you to expect ſome ſuch, even in the ſevereſt ſort of Writers.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. But though it be not true that our <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the <hi>only End</hi> or deſign of the Promiſes, or of Chriſtianity, it is true that it is <hi>the end of all our Chriſtianity,</hi> that is one of its very great and noble ends.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. The ſame Graces or Gifts of God to man do uſually circularly promote each other, and ſo each is as to other, both an <hi>end</hi> and <hi>means</hi> in ſeveral inſtances and reſpects. See what I have ſaid in my Treatiſe of the Life of Faith, to the queſtion, Whether the Precept be for the Promiſe, or the Promiſe for the Precept? Whether the Reward be the end of Obedience, or Obedience the end of the Reward? <hi>pag.</hi> 237.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. When we ſay that <hi>Holineſs</hi> is the end of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> or faith in Chriſt, we take <hi>Holineſs</hi> narrowly for that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> and moſt immediate part of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which is our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, Subjection and Love to God as God</hi>; And not ſo largely as to include our <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> it ſelf. And we take
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50545:8"/>
not <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> for the whole Chriſtian Religion, but for the <hi>remedying part,</hi> or <hi>faith in Chriſt</hi> as <hi>ſuch.</hi> Otherwiſe we could but ſay that the <hi>remedying part</hi> of our Religion or Holineſs, is the <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>Primary part</hi> which is its <hi>end.</hi> When we underſtand each other, let us not needleſly quarrel about words.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. If any ſay too much in making our Holineſs Gods <hi>only End,</hi> it ill beſeemeth thoſe to be their cenſurers, who haue tempted them to it, by erring more on the contrary extream. And it is not to be denyed or hid, that more than downright <hi>Antinomians,</hi> have ſo ill expounded the points of Chriſts ſuretiſhip, and of the Imputation of our ſin to him, and of the Imputation of his Righteouſneſs to us, as hath proved the great occaſion of ſome mens running into the contrary errour; yea, and as would exclude all pardon of ſin, and all true Religion, had their notions been <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> and <hi>prevalently</hi> held. But their opinions are confuted by ſo many (<hi>Olevian, Urſine, Piſcator, Paraeus, Wendeline, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> and many other Forreigners; and by <hi>Wotton, Gataker,</hi> and others at home; and plainlieſt in Mr. <hi>Trumans</hi> foreſaid Treatiſe, Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> of Juſtif. and Mr. <hi>Hotchkis</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and <hi>Le Blank</hi> in his <hi>Theſes</hi>) that I will not here ſtay to deal with thoſe Points. And it is not an eaſie or a common thing, for men that write againſt any dangerous errour and extream, to keep up large impartial thoughts, and ſee the danger on the contrary ſide; For mans mind is limitted and narrow, and cannot think with equal ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and clearneſs of many things at once. And the wiſeſt man alive, when he is earneſtly pleading againſt any errour, is in great danger of forgetting what is on the other ſide the way, and of thinking ſo eagerly what to ſay againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he oppoſeth, as to forget both what may be ſaid for it, and what worſe his own arguings may infer.</p>
                  <p n="50">
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50545:8"/>50. Nothing is more ſure in Chriſtianity, than that Chriſt came into the world to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; and to bring home ſtraying prodigals to God, and to deſtroy the works of the Fleſh and Devil; and to bring man back to the love and obedience of his Maker, and to cure him of his worldly love. And ſo that Holineſs or the love of God, is the end of our Redemption, and our Faith.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. It is moſt certainly that he is the beſt man that hath the leaſt need of pardon of ſin, that is, that is moſt Holy and leaſt ſinful; And that all men muſt rather deſire to be kept from ſin, (and pardoned when they do ſin) then to ſin and then be pardoned: nor may we deſire <hi>Pardon</hi> alone, if we could have it. So that we are <hi>pardoned</hi> what is paſt, that Love may make us ſin ſo no more; and Juſtification is an antecedent means to our fuller Holineſs and obedience to God (which I have largely opened in my <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi>)</p>
                  <p n="52">52. It is certain that Juſtification and Sanctification go on hand in hand together (of which ſee Mr. <hi>George Hopkins, Salvation from ſin</hi>;) And that it is a notorious errour of ſuch as ſay that Juſtification is perfect as ſoon as it begins (though it be true that all ſin is then forgiven.)</p>
                  <p n="53">53. And it is certain that Sanctification as it is the work of God, is an executive part, or one part of the executive pardon of our ſins; Becauſe it is the taking off of a very great penalty, which is the privation of the ſpirit of grace.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Nothing is more injurious to Chriſt than to feign that he is a patron of ſin, or came to excuſe men by free juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from obedience to their Creators law of nature, or to make ſin leſs odious to mankind: ſeeing he dyed to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. And it is an intollerable blaſphemy againſt God, to imagine that Chriſt came to make the Divine nature more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50545:9"/>
friendly or reconcileable to ſin, or to love complacencially an ungodly perſon as if he were godly, as being ſuch by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſs to him, and to repute any man to be what he is not; to take a wicked man for a Saint, becauſe that Chriſt was holy for him: what ever malicious Papiſts ſay, the Proteſtants abhor ſuch doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. And as far are we from believing that Chriſt was a ſinner, or that God ever ſuppoſed him to be a ſinner, or hated or puniſhed him as a ſinner: or that ever our ſin did really become his ſin, or that God reputed it ſo to have been. For no falſe judgment can belong to God.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. But we believe that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, as a ſacrifice, ranſome, propitiation, attonement. And that his <hi>own voluntary ſponſion</hi> and his <hi>Fathers will</hi> were his <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and that our <hi>ſins</hi> were the <hi>occaſion,</hi> and the evil to be done away; And that (for the holy ends forementioned) he ſuffered for our ſakes and in our ſtead, ſuch a kind and meaſure of ſuffering, as was fit to attain the ends of our Creator, better than our damnation could have done. And thus far our ſins may be ſaid to be imputed to him, in that he dyed for them; Though properly he undertook the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment only; but never the ſin it ſelf: His nature and holy will abhorring ſuch an undertaking. The <hi>Reatus facti,</hi> or <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> were never upon Chriſt; nor the <hi>primary proper Reatus ad poenam</hi>; but only an <hi>improper aſſumed Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad poenam,</hi> or <hi>obligation</hi> to puniſhment for our ſins. Nor can an Accident remove from one ſubject to another, but its removing is its periſhing.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. And though we believe not that God doth <hi>judge us</hi> to <hi>have done all the righteouſneſs</hi> that <hi>Chriſt did,</hi> nor to have <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> the ſame <hi>individual Righteouſneſs as Chriſt had</hi> (for God never erreth) nor accounteth us <hi>as Righteous as Chriſt himſelf</hi>; nor yet <hi>uſeth us</hi> in <hi>all reſpects</hi> as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50545:9"/>
he would have done, if we had been <hi>as righteous</hi> as Chriſt himſelf; nor do we think it a thing <hi>poſſible</hi> that the ſame individual righteouſneſs that was in Chriſt (being an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) can be in it ſelf and really given to us, and made ours; Yet do we believe that his <hi>Habitual perfection,</hi> with his <hi>Active Righteouſneſs</hi> and his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> or <hi>Sufferings, all ſet together,</hi> and <hi>advanced in value,</hi> by their conjunction with his <hi>Divine Righteouſneſs,</hi> were the <hi>true meritorious procuring cauſe of our pardon,</hi> Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification and Salvation. Not <hi>one part</hi> imputed to this effect, and <hi>another</hi> to that; but <hi>all</hi> thus making up <hi>one meritorious cauſe</hi> of all theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; even of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>all its benefits.</hi> And thus Chriſts Righteouſneſs is imputed and given to us; not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> but <hi>in the effects and fruits</hi>: As a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is ſaid to be given <hi>to a Captive,</hi> becauſe it is given <hi>for him</hi>; though ſtrictly the <hi>Ranſome</hi> is given to <hi>another,</hi> and only the <hi>fruits</hi> of it <hi>to him.</hi>

Thoſe ignorant, ſelf conceited contentious teachers, that ſeek the reputation of Orthodox zeal in the things which they never underſtood, and inſtead of clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending ſound Scripture-doctrine, and plain expounding it to the Church, do take on truſt and for company, falſe or inſignificant confounding notions, and proudly make them the inſtruments of their furious cenſures and revilings, and of dividing the Church by raiſing ſlanders againſt thoſe that preſume to be wiſer than they; and ſo by backbiting tell their hearers, how erroneous and dangerous this and that mans doctrine is, becauſe they never had the wiſdom, ſtudy and patience to underſtand it; ſuch I ſay are the men that in all ages have been the firebrands in the Church, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly promoted Chriſts Kingdom by dividing it, and will hardly ever have peace here themſelves, nor endure their brethrens or the Churches peace.</p>

                  <p n="61">61. Yet is his Holineſs no ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice, for the ſins of his unholy ſtate, or for his imperfections.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. If you ask, what then would God have done with one thus converted, if he had no Saviour, to ranſom him from Juſtice for his ſin? I anſwer; it is a ſuppoſition that is not to be put; Becauſe no man is <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>ſanctified</hi> that hath not a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the Pardon of his ſins, For none but Chriſt could firſt <hi>Merit,</hi> and then <hi>Give,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> which we had loſt; and ſo without Chriſt and his Spirit we ſhould have been equally <hi>unſanctified</hi> and <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</hi>

It is not <hi>they</hi> but <hi>He,</hi> that merited all grace, and that preſerved the ſinning world from being uſed as it deſerved, and that aſcending up on high gave gifts (both common and ſpecial) unto men.

                  <p n="64">64. While all ſober Divines thus plead for Holineſs, and cenſure one anothers doctrines as unholy and countenancing ſin, it plainly ſheweth that they are very much at unity in the main; but that they have not the skil to word and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize

And when we hear men accuſe each other of unholy, and ſinful opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices, though we muſt hate the <hi>ignorance, pride</hi> and <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> which is in it, yet it is a comfort to us, to hear and read that they all agree to cry down ſin in the general and to diſgrace it; and that they all bear ſo conjunct a teſtimony for the excellency and neceſſity of Holineſs; what hope is there then that if we could ſet all our tacklings together, and ſee truths fall right in their ſeveral places, we might unite our force againſt the Kingdom of the Devil, and ungodlineſs; and might give over deſtroying Holineſs by crying down the things we underſtand not as unholy; and might be healed of that antique phrenſie, which maketh ſo many Divines and other Chriſtians, by ill managing their zeal for holineſs, to divide the Churches, and hinder the Goſpel, and be the inſtruments of Satan, to keep and caſt down Holineſs in the world.</p>

There is ſo clear a tendency in all Gods inſtituted Ordinances to further Holineſs, that he knoweth not what he talketh of, who ſlighteth them, on pretence of <hi>natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and Helps</hi> to the ſame end: ſeeing <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi> evidences and helps, are ſo far from being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that they are both neceſſary, and do in admirable ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and harmony concur.</p>

And theſe few pages tell you my ſenſe; the ſame which I have formerly publiſhed: If wrong, confute it: If right, my former writings, fullier opening the ſame things are ſo far right. 3.
