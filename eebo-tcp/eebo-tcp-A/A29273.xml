            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After the fall of Antichriſt, and in the true Church ſtill God immediatly Rules the Powers by Jeſus Chriſt; and in the thouſand yeares Satan is to be bound, he ſhall not act by the Starry Powers to deceive the Nations more, when the Demon Doctrine, by which the world three thouſand yeares hath been deceived, ſhall ceaſe, with the Doctrine of Antichriſt, the Learning profeſt in Academies of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> &amp;c By which untill the Devill is bound he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Nations.</p>

               <hi>Areopagit</hi> to have been a Prieſt of <hi>Mars,</hi> there were the Prieſts of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Acts 14.13. who ſacrificed Oxen to them, but to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> were men ſacrificed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Prieſts were thoſe men called <hi>Flammins,</hi> and the old <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> call Philoſophers, who to keepe the people in a way of worſhipping of them, did teach that for doctrine to men that this day by tradition hath been continued and received for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie,</hi> which is no other then the Doctrine of Demons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will appeare, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.18. in that the <hi>Athenians</hi> called <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching Chriſt a ſetting forth ſtrange Demons, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt a man dyed and roſe againe, was in heaven and did miniſter ſalvation to men; which proves a cuſtome among them of ſetting forth their Demons, called by the Apoſtle <hi>the Doctrines of Demons,</hi> that is, of men-gods, ♄ ♃ ♂ ☉ ♀ ☿ <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> for which they were <hi>Magi,</hi> wiſe men, Seers, that did thus ſet out the Demons doctrine to the people, and as there Prophets or Diviners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict things thereby.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe Demons had their Starres in which they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed after death to be in, and thereby to act on men as when they were alive. Thus the <hi>Magi,</hi> Matth. 2.2. <hi>Where is the King of the Jewes, we have ſeene his Starre and are come to worſhip him</hi>; the King is diſtinct from the ſtarre, ſo that there is the Demon or Heroe his Starre. The Doctrine of the Demon, and the <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms,</hi> doe ſo prove one the other, that one being granted, the other cannot be denied; as if the higheſt of the Planets be <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns,</hi> then <hi>Saturn</hi> is ſuppoſed to be in it, and the doctrine of that Starre holds forth the Demon <hi>Saturn,</hi> not the ſtarre; and ſo of <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> &amp;c. For the nature of the ſtarre is not knowne but by the nature of the Demon, who is onely deſcribed in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Emblem.</p>
            <p>To which Demons after the way of Heathens the houres of the day, the dayes of the weeke, and yeares of the world, and Climates of the Earth, and Cities of the Nations, are ſaid to be ruled and ſubjected in the Demon doctrine.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to which Lords, for ſo the Aſtrologers ſay of ♄ ♃ ♂ ♀ ☉ <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> that they are Lords in Genitures of Houſes, of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes, and have dominion in ſuch Quarters of the world, and over ſuch part of mans life, &amp;c. in directions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6. <hi>There are many are called Lords, but to us is but one Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48563:3"/>
oppoſing Chriſt worſhipped to theſe Demons the Heathens then worſhipped, and eate and dranke the bloud and fleſh ſacrificed to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.10. Which was done in the Temple built to ♃ &amp;c. In which was an Idol where he was ſuppoſed to be in on earth as in heaven in his ſtarre, which meat ſo ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced &amp; ſold by their Prieſts to ſuch as ſold meat in the ſhambles, was an offence to the Saints.</p>
            <p>It is ſuperſtition and condemned of God to name the names of theſe, how then to name the day from them, and to give the Rule of its houres to them? Why <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> on the firſt day muſt have the firſt houre at ☉ riſing and begin the government of the day when ſhe is in oppoſition to us, and not ſeen by us, appeares not to me, but to confirme a Heatheniſh obſervation of the day to the Moone, and the Doctrine of <hi>Diana,</hi> and the preſerving of her Magnificence; for as God had a day of reſt to his ſervice, ſo the Demons had theirs, on which, men, devoted to them, did viſit their Temples, and did ſacrifice to them on their Altars. Some Aſtrologers have ſaid the ſeventh day was obſerved by the <hi>Jewes</hi> in honour of ♄, and that we ſin not keeping it.</p>
            <p>To bring the people thereunto they did no other but hold out to them, how they were preſerved by them, and how their puniſhments came from them, and good was conveyed by their Starres to them, hourly, daily, yearly, as in the Doctrine of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie</hi> is ſet forth. Which was the tye they had to binde them to their worſhip and ſervice. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.27. <hi>Aſia and all the world worſhipped Diana</hi> the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>; ſure the Nations that call the ſecond day <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> day, did worſhip the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> on that day in time of theſe names.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To hold out this diſtinction of the god <hi>Demon</hi> and his Starre as diſtinct by the Scripture, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 7.43. <hi>And ye retooke up the Tabernacle of Moloch, and the ſtarre of your god Remphan. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch</hi> was the Demon, <hi>Saturn</hi> whoſe ſtarre was <hi>Remphan,</hi> that is, the higheſt of the Planets, according to the <hi>Arabian Dialect</hi>; ſo that there was the god, the Tabernacle, and the Starre, as diſtinct things, the worſhip was ſet up, the Tabernacle, the influence aſcribed to the Starre as the meanes thereof, and the worſhip gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Demon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whereas the Scripture ſays, <hi>I would not ye ſhould have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Demons,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. Now where one acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Demons in their Doctrine, in their dayes, in their rule,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48563:4"/>
in their Characters, in their names, in the ſtarres as theirs, be not a having communion with them or no; Its good to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.3. and to ſpeake and foretell by their rules, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.4.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the Conjunctions, Retrogradations, and ſeveral aſpects of the Planets in the doctrine of Demons, is held out what men (acted, as they ſay, by them) would produce among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if old men, melancholy, envious, &amp;c. having the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ♄ ſtirred up in them according to the emergencies of the times; ſo men borne under <hi>Mars,</hi> having a ſpirit of warre and bloud in them, are by the influence of <hi>Mars</hi> ſtirred up to warre and revenge. So thoſe borne under <hi>Venus,</hi> are as by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of venery lead to dalliance, delights, neatneſſe; and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to the god <hi>Demons,</hi> a man-ſervant, to the goddeſſes a female, who as their ſervant is nimble witted to councel the worſt and pleaſe the beſt, being of a falſe and treacherous ſpirit: ſo of the Men of the Moone, the Sunne, &amp;c. Now the difference if it be about Dominion with the ☉, about women with <hi>Venus,</hi> or Prieſthood with ♃ and <hi>Saturne,</hi> be of the one ſide, and thoſe acted by him, and ♂ on the other ſide with thoſe acted by him, the Judgement will be what the event thereof is, ſay they, if ☿ have a hand in the buſineſs, unleſſe ♃ by a <g ref="char:trine">△</g> prove a Moderator, if it be but in a ſquare, its but as it were, ſay they, a falling out, and not as in an ☍, or an open defiance; to which in agreements they compare the ⚹ and <g ref="char:trine">△</g> the ſignes, where fixed or moveable, helping in the Judgement, in the undertaking whereof,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is not onely <hi>ſcientia,</hi> the art and rules therein:</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there is required in the man a ſpirit inclined to, and acquainted with, or acted by the Influence of <hi>Mercury</hi> and ♃ in a prophetick way, which differs from the ſpirit of divination, the one immediatly, the other mediately, by rules predicting things, as in that <hi>axiom; a te &amp; a ſcientia,</hi> the knowledge without this ſpirit is nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſpirit is as much to inquire into the ſtate of affayres in the world below, as well as in the configurations of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodyes above; for it is confeſt that grounds of this art doe depend upon experiences; theſe things would require a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, but my intent is onely in a generall way how they are oppoſed, and what oppoſed, and what God allowes of in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48563:4"/>
Starres, ſayes <hi>Mirandula; Ptolemeum plus conceptui quam geniturae tribuiſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſeven Planets are Gods creatures, called by <hi>Jude,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, erring Starres, becauſe of the irregularity of their motion, ſometimes direct, then ſtationary, then retrograde, oppoſing, conjoyning one with another, as friends and foes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By theſe Planets power and operations, the change of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ayres, and weathers, are produced, uſually called by the Aſtrologers, in receptions, oppoſitions, and other configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>apertio portarum</hi>; but in the word they are indeed ſaid to be <hi>the powers of the ayre,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. Signifying that the heat, the cold, the moyſt, the wet, the dry, the winde, the ſnow, the hayle, and exhalations are produced or wrought by theſe in the ayre, as heat in the riſing of the great Dog-ſtarre.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the ayre theſe powers worke on the earth, and on man compoſed of the Elements themſelves were firſt made of, as by a tacture the Starres applying themſelves by the ayre to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodyes of men as they agree with, or are contrary to them, to ſickneſſe or health.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence ſome are ſayd to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Moone ſtruck.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others are ſayd, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſoules being <hi>ex traduce,</hi> their Influence extends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſome joy, hate, feare, wrath, as the temper of the body is firſt wrought on.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And becauſe man conſiſts of a ſpirit immediately given of God, and not made of the matter other Elementary bodyes were of, remaines unwrought upon by them, as being above them, and not to be corrupted by them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To all theſe Satan he adds his operation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. who is the Prince or chiefe of the powers of the ayre, who workes with them, or by them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. On the children of diſobedience he thereby works accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. and therefore as a ſpirit he is ſaid to worke it on the ſpirit, the body, the ſoule, he directing their influences according to his ſeveral purpoſes; hence in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.29. the world is called the houſe of Satan, the ſeverall Orbs or Sphears as the upper Roomes, the earth, the Sea, &amp;c. the under Roomes thereof, in which he governs and rules the men of the world, and being called powers in heavenly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48563:5"/>
places, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. Shews that not as by a Law but by power he rules the powers of the ayre, aſſiſting him thereto, on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection whereof at beſt doth depend the Judgement of the Starres, as it relates to Satan, and wicked men. Not that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie but the influence of the Starres may alter the ſtate of Gods Elect in their bodyes to health or ſickneſſe; but free from that power of Satans acting them on him, they being redeemed from the world, and power of Satan, unleſſe God permit him for ſome particular ends. Hence the ſcars in the bodyes of men under the ſeverall Conſtellations are from them as naturall without the coactings of Satan, it being common to Elect and Reprobate.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In theſe very operations of Satan, the divine providence no leſſe appeares then in the powers of the ayre, they not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power to act in the leaſt, or over the leaſt, beyond the limits of Gods permiſſion; ſays the Aſtrologer, <hi>Deus regit aſtra,</hi> yea <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem cum aſtris,</hi> Chriſt when he ſtayd the winds and ſeas, he ſhewed his power over the powers of the ayre.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It ſeems to me God ſends out the Elect Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to direct the powers of the ayre to the good of the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. and to keep them that they daſh not their feet againſt a ſtone in all their wayes; as the evill Angels on the Reprobates, by whom God as veſſels of wrath fits them for deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Jude</hi> 9. the good and evill Angels contend about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God not ſuffering the bodyes of Saints to be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, as <hi>Saturne, Mars, Venus, Diana, Mercury,</hi> theeves, whores, murtherers, &amp;c. Spirits onely fit to ſet out wicked men by, and not good men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I have read with admiration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. <hi>He hath not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the future government to Angels.</hi> (Vide <hi>Hieronym. in Gal.</hi> 4.3.) <hi>Neceſſe eſſe priuſquam quis credat in Chriſto, illis arbitris, viz. Angelus gubernetur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Implying that the government of the natural ſtate of men in the world is ſubjected to Angels, as the Aſtronomers ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In what Saints are naturall if ſubjected to good Angels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the government to come, that is, in Chriſt, hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. called <hi>the power of the world to come,</hi> and not that of the ayre, which is miniſtred by another Spirit, even that of God, as they are of another houſe, &amp; another houſhold, even
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48563:5"/>
the houſe and houſhold of God, redeemed from the world, and the power of Satan to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. That he is denied to act in them as before, whiles they lived according to the Prince of the power of the ayre.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Satan is called <hi>the God of this world,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.8. ſhewing Chriſt all the Kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them, ſaying, <hi>He would give it him if he would worſhip him.</hi> How farre God may make uſe of Satan in the preferment and fall of ſome by the powers of the ayre, inciting men thereto, or how farre he may permit him to doe it on others is not cleare, but we may ſee it in the Contracts of mean men with him to be advanced to the Papacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other dignities in the world.</p>
            <p>And indeed in this ſence by this Doctrine I ſuppoſe <hi>Balam</hi> is called a Prophet, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. who went to the high places of <hi>Baal,</hi> and in Anſwer to the ſeven Demons built ſeven Altars, and offered ſeven oxen and ſeven Rams, when the Angel of the Lord, yea the Lord himſelfe oppoſed him and his Demons with the ſpirits, ſo that he cannot divine againſt him, his eyes in former divinations were ſhut, but now opened. Its notably ſayd in <hi>Jude</hi> of the Antichriſts Miniſtry, that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they had as men the influence in their way on the world as all the Planets in Heaven had, acting one whiles as ♄, anon as ♃, then as ♂, anon as the ☉, and then as ☿, Retrograding, oppoſing and joyning one with the other, and ingaging the world with them; of which ſee my expoſ. on <hi>Jude.</hi> Now as for the true Miniſtry, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. They are ſayd to be held in the right hand of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Againe, whereas by ♃ is underſtood the Demon of Prieſts and Lawyers, and the Aſtrologers have predicted their fall, which will be moſt certainly accompliſhed; it proves that that Romiſh Miniſtry, as the <hi>Flammins,</hi> who were firſt underſtood hereby, are of the houſe and government of the world, as they were, or the divination were nothing, and under the powers of the world.</p>
            <p>That which is eminently conſiderable to prove what I have ſaid to be truth, is this, the time is come in which Satan is bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he cannot deceive the Nations any more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2. In which he is not permitted to direct the Planetary influences as before; for whereas before in the ſame Conjunctions and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes he ſo ordered the ſame, that he advanced error, and the Rule of his Kingdome by it, yet now he being bound the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48563:6"/>
of the powers of the ayre are ſuch on the inferior bodyes as utterly diſſolve the frame of the government of the old world, Monarchy, Peers, Prieſts, People and ſervants, ſo oppoſe one another, that the Rule is diſſolved, for the Ruler thereof being captivated, he cannot deceive the Nations with the Name of Liberty, or ſhew of Religion, or the pretext of ſucceſſion, nor will any wayes of reconciliation ſerve the turne, a ſigne of which binding appeares in the liberty granted Religion, which Satan in Kings, Prieſts, People, have alwayes untill now oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, perſecuted, &amp;c. which binding continues a thouſand yeares, and being looſe by the powers of heaven he deceives the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againe. Now the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. with the ſignes in Heaven, ſhall be a ſhaking of its powers, which produceth a change in the powers below, ſignified in the warre between Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Nation, which will be done in ſuch a way then as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, when mens hearts will fayle them for feare, looking for thoſe things were to come on the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes on the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the order and rule thereof, out of which confuſion ariſeth the redemption of Gods people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> among theſe Demons ſome are fortunous, others Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunous, others between both. By which meanes the perſons, ſtates, natures and conditions come largely to be treated of in this Doctrine of Demons. And to hold up the honour of the fortunes, ſay they, they would doe good oft-times did not the Cacodemons hinder, and oppoſe, and deſtroy the good they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; by which one was beloved, the other feared.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God in Scripture gives the ends of the Starres creation to be three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For ſeaſons, as ſummer and winter, autumne and ſpring, to ſow, to plant, to reape. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſummer is from day, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the night.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For ſignes of drought and raine, heat and cold, winde and ſnow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence the Scripture ſpeaks of the Starres <hi>Ciſli,</hi> which wee prophane the Scripture by calling them <hi>Hyades,</hi> from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine, which are in the <hi>Aſteriſme</hi> of the <hi>Bull,</hi> and are to be read the unconſtant ones, becauſe they riſing ſignified the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the weather.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48563:6"/>2. By the other <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which was as prophanely read <hi>Orion</hi> which is an <hi>Aſteriſm</hi> of a Heroe, and pertaines to the Demon Doctrine, is a great prophanation of the word, the Originall underſtood would ſet out to us in the Starres the ſignes of the weather they brought with them, which were better Aſtrology then the other, and as much as need be knowne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe <hi>Aſteriſms</hi> continued in our tranſlated <hi>Bible,</hi> corrupt the Text, and the underſtandings of men, and ſeems to owne the Doctrine of the <hi>Demons,</hi> then which God hates nothing more, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4. God would cut off the Remnant of <hi>Baal,</hi> the name of the <hi>Chemarims,</hi> the Prieſts, and the worſhippers of the hoſt of Heaven, with ſuch as ſwear by the Lord and <hi>Malcham,</hi> in which <hi>Baal</hi> hath his <hi>Chemarims,</hi> his Prieſts, his hoſt, his worſhippers, and thoſe ſwear by him, &amp; all diſtinct, yet relating one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in that ſence depend one upon another, among whom ſome ſwear by the Lord and <hi>Malcham.</hi> As among the <hi>Corinths,</hi> ſome drinke of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils; ſo now may it not be as dangerous to profeſſe the Goſpel, and heed the Doctrine of <hi>Demons,</hi> much more to profeſſe the one, and practiſe the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We not calling them by their proper names given them of God, agreeing with their nature <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but by the names of <hi>Demon</hi> gods, given them by their worſhippers, yea more uſing the Characters to diſtinguiſh them by that did ſet out the vertue of theſe Demons to the world, as ♄ repreſented in a ſithe which <hi>Saturn</hi> carried in the hand of his Emblem; thus ♂ <hi>Mars</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented carrying in his hand a whip, and <hi>Mercury</hi> with ☿, with his ſtaffe of Serpents, &amp;c. Now ſo farre is this Demon way ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is induced to leave and deliver men up to Satan to deceive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Satan is ingaged and at liberty in reſpect of us yeelding to the temptation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the reſt of the Demon Doctrine, to lead us where or unto what he pleaſe thereof.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The Angel or Spirit of <hi>Saturn</hi> is <hi>Oriful.</hi>

The Saints coming to God, come to an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of Angels. It ſeems in like manner the Aſtrologer coming in every figure to the ſeven Demons, and in them come to an innumerable company of <hi>Chemarims,</hi> which are above his Starres, and Prieſts, when he need take heed of the great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants about him.</p>
            <p>In going from the firſt Generall of Aſtrology the ſeven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary Starres, we come to the ſecond, by the Demon Doctrine divided into two general parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Zodiac</hi> or Circle of Living Creatures, called <hi>Signifer,</hi> which containes the path of the Sunne his courſe, compleating the yeare by his aſcending its ſouthern latitude, and deſcending to its North latitude from the Equinox.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Aſteriſms</hi> contained in the Heavens between the <hi>Zodiac</hi> and the <hi>Poles,</hi> North and South.</p>
            <div type="subsection">
               <head>For the Zodiac.</head>
               <p n="1">1. By the doctrine of <hi>Demons</hi> thoſe twelve <hi>Aſteriſms,</hi> the <hi>Ram</hi> ♈, the <hi>bull</hi> ♉, <hi>Gemini</hi> ♊, &amp;c. which are all ſaid in Heaven to be alive and acted by the ſpirits of the gods, placed them there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Characters, Starres, Influence, &amp;c. as the Heroes, but Inferior to the Demons, who gave them their being there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the ſoule of the Rams and leſſer Sheepe is in the Ram above, &amp; all ſmall Cattle, and the ſoules of Oxen, Horſe, Cows, were in the Bull; above of maidens and women in <hi>Virgo</hi> above, and of men in <hi>Gemini,</hi> and <hi>Sagittary, Aquary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48563:7"/>3. Hence in the <hi>Zodiac</hi> the twelve ſignes divided into twelve equall parts, containing thirty degrees, make the foure quarters of the yeare by its triplicity, of which ſome are beaſtial, human, double bodyed, &amp;c. Of the nature of fire, fiery, of the nature of water, watery, airy, earthly. Some are moveable, others fixt, then common, &amp;c. but to come to the doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Aries</hi> the <hi>Ram</hi> by <hi>Demon</hi> doctrine came thus to Heaven; an <hi>Indian</hi> wanting water, a Ram roſe out of the Sand &amp; brought him where water was; for which the man askt of <hi>Jove</hi> he might be placed among the Starres, which to this day is called <hi>Aries aequinoctialis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Demon doctrine men borne under the ſigne of this Ram, are of the nature of a Ram, beaſtly, raſh, laſcivious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, of a hot and dry conſtitution, it being the Demons <hi>Mars</hi> houſe, and he there, it makes him worſe.</p>

               <p n="3">3. It beſt agrees with the doctrine that it ſhould be a Ram in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by which the good or evill ſhould fall on Creatures of the ſame kinde, and not the forme of a Ram ſhadowed in the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Starres.</p>

                  <hi>Sagittarius</hi> by the Doctrine of <hi>Demons</hi> is a double bodyed ſigne, partly humane, partly beaſtiall.</p>
               <p>The divine Doctrine ſays thus; one <hi>Croton</hi> nurſt by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Muſes, was through their prayer placed among the Starres, who becauſe he was much addicted to hunting of beaſts, had this various forme aſſigned him, with a bow in his hand ſhooting at the beaſts he hunted; he is ſaid to be famous for the honour he gat at the <hi>Olympicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence as it is the houſe of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> its a Regal ſigne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe bicorporeal, in Ecclipſes, men ſuffer, and becauſe he rode on horſeback, braying beaſts ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It being the aſcendant in a Nativity, it inclines a man to hunting, and makes him a good horſeman, and gives valour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now why men and beaſts muſt ſuffer more under this ſigne then another, is no reaſon but from this Demon doctrine.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the firſt 10 degrees men, in the ſecond beaſts, becauſe man part was firſt in the <hi>Aſteriſme,</hi> the beaſt laſt.</p>

The Aſtrologer puts a man on deferring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes to doe his buſineſſe, as pretending a knowledge, what dayes, times and years will bring out, and ſay it is not in the power of their hand to doe it as yet, ſuch and ſuch will oppoſe and hinder, but at ſuch a time it will be good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Things are appointed to time, in which they are to be ſo, that time is not a thing to be diſpoſed of by Election; for that a man may thinke he hath time, indeed he hath none. Time in a ſpeciall manner being reſerved in Gods own hand, as a peculiar means to diſpence his providence: and therefore <hi>James</hi> hints at ſuch like preſumptions in men, <hi>ſaying to morrow we will goe</hi> (as if one time were better then another) <hi>to ſuch a Citie as our direction guids us to, and continue there a yeare,</hi> the time of a promiſing revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>and get gaine.</hi> After all which he ſays, <hi>James</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>Whereas ye know not what ſhall be to morrow. What is your life? it is but a vapour,</hi> on which depends all the purpoſes and actions of man, if he fayle his very thoughts ceaſe and dye with him. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auſtin, Tertullian, Bazill, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it.</p>
               <p>According to the Doctrine of Demons in the 9 ſpheare are 48 <hi>Aſteriſms</hi> or bodyes placed in heaven by the gods ſonne <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Heraes,</hi> and other creatures and Inſtrumente, who for ſome eſpeciall good done or found in them, were as by a reward pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, who have their Starres placed in them, by which they act as ſoules by their bodyes on things below.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who are ſayd to participate of the nature of two Demons oft-times are ſaid to be of the nature of ♂ and ☿, ♂ and ♄, ♀ and ☿ ☿ and ♃.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Planets are in Conjunction with any of their own nature, they are as men of one minde agreed on the worke intended good or evill, and ſo act the more vigorouſly, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> helped by the <hi>Heroes.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Regulus</hi> ſayd to be of the nature of ♃ and ♂, ſignifies indeed the true nature of a Lions heart, which they ſay is the Lion <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> ſhewed in the <hi>Nemean</hi> forreſt.</p>

If the head of <hi>Meduſa</hi> aſcend, the Native is addicted to evill, and ſubject to violent death, which is but <hi>Meduſa's</hi> ſtory revived againe in the Native.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Orion</hi> in the 17. ♊ is ſayd to ſharpen the wit, if according to the fable <hi>Orion</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Jupiter, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> three of the Gods, and pertakes of all their natures, and makes the Native pertaker of his, who withall was a cunning huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and placed in the heaven by <hi>Diana,</hi> who yet was ſayd to have his being from urine.</p>
               <p>Let me deale plainly, and freely deliver my ſoule before God in this thing, Satan by theſe fables could not delude men if he did not know that the Influences of the heavenly powers of the ayre then inclined not men to ſubtilty more then other times, and thereby ſeduced men to believe theſe lyes, and worſhip the Demons, as if it were from them and their adjutors the <hi>Heroes,</hi> which things were firſt under theſe fancies delivered by Satan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan deceives by the very word of God, much more by the Planets, Starres, and powers of the ayre, which he could not doe, but by the Doctrine of the Demons, and lyes of Poets in this way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One cauſe that induceth me to thinke the ſame, is, becauſe that that part of knowledge remained in man that was of God, is loſt or adulterate, for what the Starres, <hi>Job, Micha,</hi> and others mention, are, &amp; in what part of heaven, none of the Aſtrologers, <hi>Jews,</hi> or other know not nor agree upon, but altogether <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are now lead by this Demon diſcovery of heaven, and its powers and order, which are lyes and fables, and means of Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>

When the Dolphins came and ſported about the Ship, he caſt himſelfe on the back of a Dolphin, who carried him to the King of <hi>Corinth:</hi> The Dolphin dying, the King erected a Statue to the Dolphin.

               <head>I come now to ſpeake of the ſtate of Saints as in communion with Chriſt in the true ſtate of the Church, how farre they are above the powers of the ayre, and how ſubject to them.</head>
               <p n="1">1. They are ſaid not to be of the world, as Chriſt is not of the world, <hi>John</hi> 17.16. That they cannot be looked on as in that capacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are delivered from Satan, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. ſo that though the ſtarres have an Influence on their earthy part, yet it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the direction of Satan, his power acts not with the powers of the ayre.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are of another world, called <hi>the new Heaven &amp; Earth, Rev.</hi> 21. they themſelves are new creatures, ſo that the heavenly bodyes doe in another then ordinary way act on them as harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as holy, and ſanctified to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. This new heaven is that that is called <hi>the world to come,</hi> in which are powers proper and diſtinct from the former,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Satan hath no power there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7. The good Angels of God direct for them the ſtarry powers for good to them, as the evill to evill in the old world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas in the firſt world out of the Church-eſtate the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world was committed to Angels, the ſtate of the Church is not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As under the Law, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. In the 9 of <hi>Jude,</hi> as in the Church Wilderneſſe eſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As in the world eſtate, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now in the Church eſtate, when Satan is caſt downe, comes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48563:13"/>
the power of God, authority of Chriſt, and Kingdome of God, as ruled in another &amp; more immediate way then before of God, he living in, walking and dwelling in them, ſo that as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, <hi>old things are paſt away, all things are become new,</hi> Rev. 21.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider whether it be not a juſt judgement of God that ſuch as obſerve the Names of the Demons dayes, and their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſhould be acted by Satan at his will for giving heed to them, when <hi>Cyrus, Julius Caeſar,</hi> and others, that heeded them not, though Heathens, were made ſucceſfull againſt the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Aſtrologie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is emphatically ſpoke, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.17. Thou haſt taken to thy ſelfe thy great power, and haſt reigned when the Kingdoms of the world are the Kingdomes of the Lord, &amp; his Chriſt; God then takes the government from Angels to himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thus it is clearly predicted, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>The government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders,</hi> untill the Church eſtate it is committed to Angels after the Lord Jeſus is received he governes thoſe that receive him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is eaſily apparent, for after the ſanctification of the heart by the powers of heaven, a proud heart by nature is the moſt humble when changed, the moſt uncleane naturall heart made holy, is moſt chaſt, ſo, &amp;c. the world is overcome in him, and to him, Chriſt hath redeemed him from his vaine converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ayrie power, nor Satans cannot act in him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Starres and the powers of the ayre are in themſelves good, and doe not ſtirre up to warre, luſt, or other evill, but as they meet with corruptions in mixt bodyes, and as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Satan, &amp; managed to further his deſigns in the world on all occaſions, which is unpoſſible for man to know but by Satan.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And the reaſon is becauſe Satan as he is a power himſelfe, and the chiefe of the powers of the ayre, by his power he doth direct &amp; over-rule the other naturall powers to ſerve his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as every occaſion requires, and as every individual natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſon is to be wrought upon.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Chriſt prayed the Father to keepe thoſe are his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.15. <hi>I pray not that thou wouldeſt take them out of the world, but keepe them from the evill.</hi>

                  </gap>, may be underſtood from the evill one.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48563:14"/>2. By Evill of the world, if it be underſtood in a larger ſence, it then comprehends finne, and the meanes of it, whether it be by Starres or elſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that he ſayd, <hi>I pray not that thou take them out of the world,</hi> it ſhews that they are under the Influence of the heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as well as others, they only are kept from the evill of them, others are not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That theſe powers may occaſion corruption in the bodyes of Saints, and ordinarily by their influence, as the meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bring forth death, in or on them, I ſee no reaſon to denie, they having mortall and corruptible bodyes. Yet ſo as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not mixt with any power of Satan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This acting of theſe powers is free from evill, it is not the evill of the world to Saints, but it is gaine to them, as all other things in the world are theirs, ſo death in this kinde is theirs alſo.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God himſelfe undertakes in the new world to give every good thing to the Inhabitants thereof, and againſt and above the ayery powers, to make a mans enemies to be at peace with him; as in the caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban.</hi> Yea God himſelfe, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.20. God will make a Covenant with beaſts, fowles, creepings things for them, and warre ſhall ceaſe: let the ſtarry powers meet and oppoſe, and ſquare againe, it will be nothing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then the heavens will ſpeake for the Saints, not againſt them, the earth, the corne, the wine and oyle, will heare <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as if <hi>Jezrael</hi> ſhould then be beloved of them, and as if in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſince the fall men were beloved of them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.23, 24.</p>
               <p>This is excellently ſet out in that the Starres are ſaid in their order to fight againſt <hi>Sicera,</hi> as it were God directing thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly powers to worke feare in the one, and at that time God wrought valour in his peoples hearts, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.20. Which I would rather read, the <hi>Starres in their way fought, &amp;c.</hi> That is, in the way they fight, and ſignifies, that they have a way of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt ſuch as God imploys them, or from their influence or powers. And that they fought for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God by his Angel directing them, as <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Curſe ye bitterly, ſayth the Angel of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> The Angel helped them by the Starry powers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares a curſe on the Inhabitants for not helping them.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48563:14"/>7. The ground of this appeares, becauſe Satan being bound a thouſand yeares, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2, 3. the world will be free from his power and malicious actuating the ayery powers, they then act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their owne way and nature, as in the Creation, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Gods immediate providence to his, and the Miniſtry of his Angels to others, who will no more be eſteemed as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and infortunes to men.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In this binding the doctrine of Demons ſhall ceaſe, and Aſtrologie ſhall be laid aſide, for Satan hath not deceived the Nations more then by the Demon doctrine, and the doctrine of Antichriſt by Aſtrologers and Antichriſt Miniſters, both which in the binding of Satan ceaſe, together with the Human teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the Academies, by which the world hath been much ſeduced.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whereas before the binding, Gods Elect were delivered from him, but after that the very world in generall ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from theſe wayes of deceit, a thouſand yeares after which he is to be looſed a little, all which proves the binding hath not been as yet, for Satan did never deceive the world more then ſince the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when they ſay he was bound, theſe being the dayes of the Reigne of Antichriſt, after whom the whole world followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi>; As the Kingdome of Satan and Chriſt differ, and Chriſt and Satan, ſo the powers differ, one is a power acts by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the other is a power acts by light, one to deceive, the other to direct.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Between theſe powers is an enmity; as it is ſayd, <hi>The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world is Enmity with God,</hi> James 3.15. Says, <hi>it is earthly, ſenſuall, Deviliſh, but that from above,</hi> verſ. 16. <hi>is pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intreated, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe powers ſhew themſelves in the men acted by them, ſo that God ſays, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put enmity between her ſeed and thy ſeed,</hi> Gal. 4.29. <hi>He that was borne after the fleſh perſecuted him that was borne after the ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The greateſt power is in the world to come, that deſtroys the worke of the Devill; <hi>Greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world,</hi> 1 <hi>John. Rom.</hi> 16.20. <hi>God ſhall tread downe Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feete.</hi> Satans power is a created power, and ſo limited,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48563:15"/>
the power of a ſervant onely to doe what he is appointed, and no more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All theſe are ſet out excellently in him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.2. <hi>What is there to me and thee thou Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I am not of this world under thy power, I am Satans, thou haſt nothing to doe with me, nor I with thee, ſo that though he worſhipt Chriſt, whiles he was under Satans power he had no deſire to be under Chriſts, that ſeemed a torment to him, but when he was under Chriſts, he would not againe be under Satans.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence though the number of Satans ſubjects are more, and the nature of his power more agreeable to the world, yet the vertue of his power being weake it cannot prevaile, no not ſo much as againſt the weakneſſe of God, or the weake ones of the Lord Jeſus, who are mighty through Chriſt, the poore fiſhers caſt downe Devils out of their holds, take away their captives, diſcover his deceipts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The conceipt was too high that <hi>Euſebius</hi> cites of the Starres, that they are for ſignes, and ſo are as a booke in which are ſet forth the natures and ſtate of things below, with the revolution of the times thereof, which is expreſly againſt the Scripture, who ſays, <hi>That the times and ſeaſons are in the Fathers hands,</hi> that is, knowne onely by him, ſo as that Chriſt himſelfe as man had many things hid from him of that nature, and therefore not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the booke of the Starres, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.36.</p>
