         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>A PRAYER According to the EXPOSITION.</head>
               <p>O Eternal and ever merciful God, thou art <hi>our Father</hi> by Creation, and to all that withſtand not thy great Love, byeffectual Redemption and Regeneration. Thy Son taſted Death, and merited Grace for every man, and thou cryeſt to the poor Sinner to come and take part in him, that thou mayeſt thus rejoyce over him; This my Son was dead, but he is now alive again; he was loſt, but now found. Where ſhould poor Children go, but unto their Fathers houſe? If the men of this World know how to give good gifts unto their Children; how much more will <hi>our Father which is in Heaven, give good things unto us that ask him</hi>! He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things? Thou <hi>art in Heaven,</hi> God over all, glorious in holineſs, looking down upon all our ways, pouring out there abundantly thy Goodneſs and Mercies; but lo, the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee. How poor and beggerly are thoſe glorified <hi>Cherubims,</hi> to thy ſelf, to whom the World is nothing, yea, leſs then nothing? We deſire therefore to draw nigh with Fear, Humility, and Reverence; and yet with a Holy Boldneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thy Mercy. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name.</hi> Make us to know thee as thou art reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy Attributes, Word and Works; to Believe, Admire, Joy, Truſt, and be raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thee; and for the ſake of thy glorious Beauty, Sweetneſs and Excellency; let us praiſe and declare thee openly, both in Word and Works, that others may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thee. <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven. Thy Kingdom come.</hi> Give us a ſaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in thy Son, ſend forth faithful Labourers into thy Harveſt; carry ſuch Stars in thy right band, bring in loſt Sinners, kill Sin daily, and incrcaſe the Graces of thy People, make Kings Nurſing Fathers to thy Church, Queens Nurſirg Mothers, and all great ones ſeekers of the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs; rule us by thy Word and Spirit, Defend and Preſerve us from all our Enemies, cut off all that are Implacably Obſtinate; take theſe Souls when our Bodies fall; raiſe us from Death; Sentence the Sheep on thy right hand, the Goats on thy left, and at laſt glorifie Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul in thy heavenly Kingdom. <hi>Thy will be done in Earth, as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Inable us to do our Duty toward God, and our Duty towards Man; to have no other Gods but thee, to Worſhip thee in holy Manner, Reverence thee in thy Name, Word, and Works; remember to keep holy the Sabbath-day, to obey our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the King as Supreme and all that are in Authority under him; to preſerve the Life, Chaſtity, Goods and good Name of our Selves and Neighboured not ſo much as covet that which is his; and tho we cannot perfect thy Will as the Angels; yet let us do it like them, Sincerely, Readily, Cheerfully, and Speedily; more and more perfect us, till we keep pace with Angels. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> All things needful for this natural Life, Health, Strength, Peace, Proſperity, a happy Government, Food and Raiment, and thy bleſſing with all theſe, that we may uſe them for the good of us and others; our heavenly Father knoweth that we have need of theſe things. <hi>Forgive us our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, as we forgive them that trepaſs againſt us.</hi> Our Sins fearfully cry in thine Ears; but hearken to thy Sons precious Blood, which was offered up without ſpot to thy ſelf; purge us with his Merits and Satisfaction, that our black Souls may be whiter than Snow. Pour out thy Mercies on our Enemies, forgive their Sins, ſeaſon them with thy Grace, provide for their Bodies, wipe all Revenge and Hatred out of our hearts towards them, that we may be forgiven of thee, who haſt ſaid by thine own Son, That if we forgive not men their Treſpaſſes, thou our heavenly Father wilt not forgive us. <hi>Lead us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Temptation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> Give us ſtrength according to the trials which we are exerciſed with, or elſe eminently appear in our weakneſs, that we fall not into ſin, and darken thy Glory. Let neither pleaſure, our evil Hearts, Trouble, Pains, Hunger and Nakedneſs, neither Life, nor Death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, things preſent, nor things to come, nor any other Creature, draw us from thy ſelf, who art the very Life of all, and the true reſt of our Souls. Raiſe us up in our falls, never leave us until we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us. <hi>For thine is the Kindgom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever.</hi> Thou art our King, therefore Defend, Preſerve, and do richly for thy Subjects. Thine is the Power, nothing is too hard for thee; thou art mightier than our Enemies, able to deliver us out of the depth of Miſery, and bring us unto the top of Happineſs, and in the end to Rivers of Joy, and never-cloying Pleaſures. Thine is <hi>the Glory.</hi> This thou art tender of, what wilt thou do for thy great Name? Fill us with the Knowledg of thy ſelf, work mightily upon our Wills, give us abundance of Grace, that we may ſhew forth much of thy Glory, who hath called us out of Darkneſs into the marvellous Light. Hear us, for thou art our Kimg for ever; thine is for ever the Power, whoſe hand cannot be ſhortned; and thine is for ever the Glory: Thou art worthy of all Praiſe and Admiration from everlaſting to everlaſting. <hi>Amen.</hi> We deſire, we believe, help our unbelief; which we beg, and all other things, in that Prayer which Chriſt hath taught us.</p>
