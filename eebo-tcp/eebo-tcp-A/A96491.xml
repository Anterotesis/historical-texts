            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WILD-FIRE PLOT found out in Ireland.</head>
            <p>IF there were ever found deadly enemies to true Chriſtian Religion, they are now found out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Mother of all treachery, and Nurſe of treaſon. For their inveterate malice is now grown to the full perfection of diſloyalty: and what they could not perfect in one nefarious plot, they did now intend to performe in another. Their late pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Gun-powper plot is not unknowne to all men, which they being fruſtrated of (having much powder by that meanes ready by them) did make therewith many balls of wild-fire, with which they intended to burne the whole city of <hi>Dublin</hi> with a vaſt inflation. The number of all the <hi>Rebels</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be for certainty about 30000. and their multitude increaſeth daily: many of them lye in Caves of the earth, ſome others are in Dandalke, which they tooke the 30 day of <hi>October,</hi> others are in the counties of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſter, Canney and Cavin,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the county of <hi>Manahom</hi> in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: But not to wander thus from my intent, I will

ſpeake more largely of the wild-fire, which they plotted very lately for the tuine of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. About the dead time of Thurſday night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing th 11. of Nov<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 500 of them or thereabout, came out of the Caves in the earth with balls of wild-fire in their hands, caſting and toſſing them over the city walls of <hi>Dublin.</hi> There were five houſes burnt downe thereby equall to the ground, &amp; the fi<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e took hold of many other houſes, but (as it was Gods great mercy) they were ſuddainly quenched by the great labour of the people, and thankes be to Almighty God, no more hurt was done by them.</p>
            <p>There was an Engliſh Merchant lived in one of thoſe houſes, that were burnt, whoſe eſtate, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be no leſſe then 35000l &amp; he loſt moſt part of his eſtate there. The reſt were all Proteſtants, men of very good faſhion, and reputation: but by the reaſon of that calamity, now ſcarſe worth any thing: all whoſe eſtates we do much deplore, and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate. But there are a 1000, men doe guarde the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty day and night: who hearing of this combuſtion, did immediately march out of the Gates, and tooke three Lords, <hi>Lord Caſmahawne, L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mackamaveire, L. Bohoune,</hi> with about the number of fifty other <hi>Rebels,</hi> whom they committed all to the Caſtle, the other fled, and ran about the fields and woods, &amp; rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great number of the <hi>Rebels</hi> preſently; whowere about nine thouſand the next day, and marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the city: but the Lords and Iuſtices having ſome ſuſpition before thereof, did that very night ſend a Poſt into <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; ſome Engliſh colonels, who very lovingly did aſſiſt them. There came from <hi>Scotland, &amp; the Northern parts of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>The rogues are very reſolute, for they put both man, women, and children to the ſword, whereſoe're they meet them, without any diſtinction of ſex with cruell tyranny. But they very ſildome appeare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ſo that ſometime they are not knowne, and ſo under pretence of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they cut their throats; for they bury all their armor in Caves in the <hi>woods,</hi> Wherfore all things are moſt exceſſive deare in the city, neither can they ſcarce buy any thing for their money, for the Country dare not venture to bring in any <hi>Commodities to the City,</hi> for feare the <hi>Rebels</hi> ſhould aſſault them, wholy in ambuſh almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where thereabout.

            <p>O egregious treachery! or rather treaſon to the King, and Kingdome! Theſe things would make a very <hi>Democritus</hi> to cry out in dolefull exclamations. But let thoſe that delight thus in ſuch fire, feare leſt they fall into an everlaſting fire: and let them take heed leſt a ſudden fire deſcend from heaven, &amp; conſume them <hi>Praecipitiouſly,</hi> like as the fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents did the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>

            <p>After our loves remembred unto you, hoping of your good health which the Lord in his mercy long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: this is to certifie you concerning our condition. I doubt not, but you have heard of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> which are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Rebellion, but God did deliver our City from their bloudy device: elſe we had not a man of us beene alive this day. For they had intended to take the Caſtle, where all the ſtrength of the Kingdome was, and then they would have ruinated us, and all the Engliſh in the Kingdome; had not God miraculouſly delivered us. The diſcovery was but at tenne of the Clocke on Friday night: and the next morning they might have tooke the Caſtle, had not one in company revealed it to the Lords: and though we ſeeme to have beene delivered, yet we are ſtill in great feare; for we know not who are our enemies, and friends. Many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we have amongſt us in the City, that ſhould have bin the fi ſt, that ſhould have cut our throats, as it hath been in the Country in one of the beſt plantations of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that is now in the County of <hi>Manahom,</hi> and <hi>Cavin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Scots</hi> in the North parts are riſen to meet them. But it is thought the Scots have met with them ere this, and have driven them from one place, but there are a great number of them, but not a quarter of them armed men, but they have good ſtore of Armes: Wee hope the Lord will ſtay them. Many of them are taken, and more every day, but it will be a great while before they be ſuppreſſed: and our Souldiers prove many falſe, and ſtill we every day &amp; night watch them. There is above 500 men in Armes watch our City every night, Houſholders and other men, are I may ſay a 1000. We have in our out Stee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

By this meanes we have no trade in our City more then needs require, that is for victuals, and candles, &amp; ſuch like things, which men cannot be without, &amp; wee can get in no debts, for men will pay no moneyes. For my part I ſhall be a great loſer by theſe times, for wee are at a great charge, it is one mans worke to watch, and there is great diſtraction.</p>
