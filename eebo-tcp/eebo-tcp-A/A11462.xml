         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my sonne, take thou heede: for
there is none end of making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
bookes, and much reading is
a wearinesse of the flesh. Let vs
heare the ende of all, feare God,
and keepe his commandements,
for this is the whole dutie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man. By which wordes of weight, proceeding from
the Oracle, not of Apollo, but of God himselfe, what
effect hath beene wrought, both in the heartes, and in
the handes of many great learned Clerkes, both heere
and elsewhere; both heeretofore, and at this day, to
make them withdraw their mindes from writing, and to
withholde their pens from paper: some witnesses wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
credite could testifie, but that dayly experience
needeth no farther proofe. Howbeit, when it is well
knowen, and ought accordingly to be considered, that
the place alledged shold rather correct the bookish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon writers, &amp; idle discoursers, then control
the writing of necessarie and needefull workes, which
to the singular aduancement of kingdomes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales,
to the most excellent seruice of almighty God,
to the inestimable benefit and blessing of his Church,
many hundred yeeres, sithens that saying of Salomon,
haue beene printed and published notwithstanding:
(as by large volumes innumerable, of Scriptures and
fathers, of histories and artes in all kinds of knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:17219:3"/>
may euidently appeare): Euery man of abilitie, should
rather by those examples encourage himself, the suffer
himselfe by these wordes to be disswaded, to imploye
the talent, as wel of his hand, as of his tongue, to meete
with, and ouertake all practises, &amp; inconueniences, and
as it were, to applie a salue to euerie sore; to minister a
medicine to euerie maladie, that may occurre. Againe
when we perceiue Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, Noadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
the Prophetesse, and their accomplices, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hinder and impeach, as much as in them lyeth, the
worke of Gods Temple; that is Papistes, Iesuites, and
Malecontentes, with their adherents, all aduersaries
&amp; enimies to the euerlasting truth of the Gospell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermission to abuse their great leasure, and small
learning, to plant error and heresie in the heartes of
our brethren, thereby to supplant all religious woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
of almightie God, all audience of his woorde
and reuerence to his Sacramentes, all humble obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to lawefull Magistrates, all dutifull regarde of
wholesome lawes, all carefull obseruation of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
discipline, all sincere and seemely conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christian life and honest manners: howe can
the holie Ghost (who reprooueth the woorlde of
sinne) but require vs to bestowe all the forces and
habilimentes wee haue, not onely as good Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias
and Aggeus to prophecie, but as godly Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babell
and Salathiell, to reedifie, that is, aswell by
writing, as by preaching; aswell by our bookes, as
by our sermons, and as it were with a trowell in the
one hande, and a sworde in the other, to rayse and
erect the newe Ierusalem, supplying the decayes,
<pb facs="tcp:17219:3"/>
repairing the ruines, filling vp the breaches, building
vp the wals and towers of Sion in perfect beauty? The
consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof together with some other earnest
and vehement perswasions to the like effect vsed: did at
the last though long first, induce the most reuerend au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of this booke, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another Esdras or Nehemias
to suffer these his labours to come to light: aswell for
that he mought leaue behinde him a witnesse and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his godly &amp; zealous affection, that the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his faith mought become the sweete sauour of life to
life in all rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sauour of death, to death in any:
as also for that words spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are soone come soone gon
but written withall, may make a deeper impression,
&amp; so by striking aswell the eye of the reader, as the eare
of the hearer, may perse his heart the better: &amp; saue his
soule the sooner. Of the booke it selfe I will saie but
this: that for myne owne parte, I am verilie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
there is no worke, written in this kinde, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men of principall estate, or particular callings, may
be either more sufficiently enformed to know, or more
plainely directed to performe their seueral duties: The
superiour how to gouerne, the inferiour how to obey:
the Minister what to teach, the people what to learne:
the Parliament what to establish, the Realme what to
embrace: her Maiestie and counsaill what to heare,
Courte, Citie, and Countrie what to amend: why Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones
especially professing godlines should be vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt:
why Pastours vndergoing such a charge shoulde
keepe the flocke from the foxe and wolfe; why Bishops
should be more vigilant &amp; precise not to admit Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
hand ouer head: why the rich should be open han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:17219:4"/>
and poore Christ in his needie members compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenlie
relieued: how the Church to be disciphered by
hir proper marks of the word to be heard with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and the sacramentes with reuerence to be frequented:
how the Temple to be purged of idolatrie, superstition
and superfluitie, the Church men of ignoraunce, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and simonie, the commonweale of vnmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
couetousnesse, and vsurie, the iudgement seates
both ciuill and Ecclesiasticall of briberie, extortion &amp;
partiality: why the Gospell to be preached with fauour,
the Law with terrour, yet both with a caueat: how God
to be worshipped, our neighbours intreated, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
&amp; families catechised, our selues conformed to
Christ his image, the simple aduised, the subtill preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the weake supported, the obstinate corrected, what
patience to be vsed vnder the crosse, what thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to be shewed for Gods great mercies, what pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in our extremest necessities to be powred out: what
sorrow must throw downe the sinfull man, what faith
raise him vp, what hope sustaine him, what charitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
him, what worthy fruites commend him to the
world: finally, how the truth may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, falshood
refelled, vice reproued, vertue aduaunced, and so the
child of God made a man wise vnto saluation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
enabled vnto euery good worke: Besides many
other most profitable obseruations, sooner taught
then learned, yet sooner learned then followed, such &amp;
so many, as in so few sermons you shal hardly finde
I beleeue, but in the same. Nor is this my single opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
only, but many mens censure of greater learning
&amp; better iudgment: who know what belonges to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:17219:4"/>
and method, to times and persons, to place and
occasions, with other due circumstances of well and
wise meaning, speaking and writing. But as those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
be best praysed euer, that be euer best practised:
so if these shall be receiued into the good grounde of
your heartes, with the same affection and spirite they
were preached first, and nowe be published, no doubt
but the sower, the seede, the soile, the increase and all,
will be founde to the glorie of his grace, that worketh
all in all. Wherfore as not onely Paul, Apollos, &amp; Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,
but all are ours, and we are Christs, and Christ is
Gods: so let vs comfort and strengthen one another,
in our holy faith, holding nothing more deere vnto vs,
then the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ech of others: and in Gods holy feare
commend we one another to that faithful creator, who
is father of all, aboue vs all, and through vs all,
and in vs all. To him be rendred all thanks,
and all honour geuen for euer
and for euer.</p>

good. Vnder these names of water, wine, and milke, all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to a spiritual life are comprehended. For as with these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
meates and drinkes the bodie is nourished: so in Christ, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the beleeuing of the Gospel, our soule is refreshed, &amp; perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fed vnto euerlasting life. Christ is the fresh fountaine, whereof
who so drinketh shall neuer thirst. Christ is that bread, which des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from heauen. He that eateth that bread, which is his flesh,
shal liue foreuer. Christ is that wine, which maketh merie the heart
of man, and quieteth the troubled conscience. Christ is that milke,
which nourisheth, and feedeth vs, that we may growe to a perfect
man. Milke is fit for infants; water is conuenient for young men;
wine agreeth with olde age. So in the Scriptures there is foode, both
for such as are simple, and weake; and also for such as are learned and
strong.</p>
            <p>7 This grace of God which saueth hath appeared to all men;<note place="margin">Water, wine, milke freely offered by Christ.</note>
this heauenly foode Christ Iesus, by preaching the Gospel, is offered
to all, as Manna the heauenly bread, by faith to feede vpon; and as a
liuely fountaine to drinke of, to euerlasting life. All are of mercie,
grace, and fauour freely called; al may come, and freely feede, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
penie or penieworth. The grace of God is free, remission of sins
is free:<note place="margin">Contra Pelag. de origin pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. cap. 24.</note> freely graunted, freely giuen, without monie. <hi>The price of our
redemption is neither golde nor siluer: Through grace ye are freely saued.</hi> For
<hi>it cannot be grace any way which is not euerie way free,</hi> saith S. Augustine.</p>

               <hi>and your
labour on that which is not to satisfie?</hi> As before he exhorted vs to come
and buie freely, without monie; because God is no monie man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any man deserue fauour at his hands, but whatsoeuer wee
haue of him, we haue it of mercie: so nowe he sharpely reprooueth
all such, as by monie or merchaundise; by desert, or merite seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
saluation. He dehorteth vs from false teachers, craftie seducers,
which offer to sel the grace and mercie of GOD for monie. Christ
proposeth his heauenly treasures, remission of sinnes, iustification,
sanctification, mercie, grace and saluation freely. He that sitteth
in the Temple of God, and termeth himselfe Christs Vicar, doeth in
like sort offer vnto the people bread, water, wine, milke, pardon of
sinnes, grace, mercie and eternall life: but not freely, he is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt,
he giueth nothing, and that is nothing which he selleth. For
although he make large promises to the buyer, he selleth that which
he hath not to deliuer. <hi>Eternall life is the gift of God.</hi> The Pope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
selleth but wind and smoke for fire, shadowes for truthes: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
the buyers with false <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lights, false measures, false weightes.
Beware of this merchaunt; loose not your labour; cast not away your
monie: it is not meate but poison which he offereth you. His phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
cannot heale your diseases; His holy water cannot wash away
the spottes of a sullied and defiled soule, as he vntruely would beare
you in hand; His blasphemous Masses doe not appease, but prouoke
Gods wrath; they cannot benefite the quicke, much lesse the dead,
which either neede no helpe, or are past al helpe; His rotten relikes
cannot comfort you; His blinde, dumbe, and wormeaten Idols can
doe you no good; It is cast awaie which is spent vpon his shamelesse
pardons, they wil not preuaile, God wil not admit them; By his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
seruice ye cannot be edified, or made wiser. Yet this trumperie
they sel for monie, and vpon this trash they cause sillie men to wast
their substance, and to these to commit their soules. Thus you see a
manifest difference betweene Christ and Antichrist, the doctrine of
God and the learning of man, true teachers and false, sounde and
counterfaited religion. The one offereth true bread, freely; the other
that which is no bread for bread, and that not freely neither, but for
monie. The diuersitie of religion professed in these our times is here
most plainely and liuely depainted. For the better clearing whereof,
I wil in three notes lay before your eies the whole difference which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17219:8"/>

groweth into an holie temple in the Lord; a temple, which no
winde, no waues, no storme, no tempest is able to ouerthrowe. The
foundation of our religion is the written worde, the Scriptures of
God, the vndoubted records of the holie Ghost. We require no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to be giuen to any part or parcel of our doctrine, further than
the same may be clearely and manifestly proued by the plaine words
of the lawe of God,<note place="margin">The first dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in the ground and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doctrine Reasons why religion shold be grounded onely vpon scripture.</note> which remaineth in writing to be seene, read &amp;

God hath caused his whole Lawe to be written; Secondly, because
we see that it hath beene the practise of all the defenders of the truth
since the beginning to relie their faith onely vpon the Scripture and

for perpetuitie, and not to register them in bookes, or engraue
them in tables. When Memucan was desirous to haue a Law made
for the bringing of women in subiection vnder their husbands, his
perswasion was this, <hi>If it may please the King, let a royall decree proceede

               <note place="margin">Hester. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and let it be written.</hi> The Lawes of the Medes and Persians
that might neuer be altered, were for euer recorded. When God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
his first Lawe vnto his people, the Lawe which commonly
we call morall, he gaue it them written in tables of stone. Againe
when he deliuered them ciuil ordinaunces for the administration of
iustice betweene man and man, Moses first proclaimed all those
Lawes and ordinances amongst the people, afterward he tooke and
wrote in a booke all the words of the Lord. As for the Lawes of rites
and ceremonies, they are likewise written in this booke. To these we

become doubtful, and vncertaine, like a tale that passeth from man

word of God take place in matters of faith, and who seeth not that
the very mainesea of heresies must needs breake in vpon the Church
of Christ? These are, as we suppose, causes iust &amp; allowable and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

which is in Scripture; why we should admonish you to beware of

know came down from heauen, to shun broken cisternes, &amp; to come
to the wel of liuing waters, as here ye are exhorted by the Prophet.</p>

            <p>19 The last ground which they haue,<note place="margin">Traditions.</note> and the fairest to the eye
is their traditions. Vnder the name of doctrine receiued from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by word of mouth, without writing, that is to say tradition, the
Scribes and Pharisies were able smoothlie to carie away anything,
til Christ recalled all things to the Lawe, the Psalmes, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
til he opened the scriptures. And as in other grounds, so in
this, the Pope hath found by good experience, that they cannot
stand longer than the scriptures lie secret and vnknowen.</p>
            <p>20 He therefore that buildeth vpon these grounds, hath cause,<note place="margin">Doctrines builded vpon the foresaide grounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> I
thinke, to besturre hand and foote, that men may be alwaies kept off
from the scriptures. For whatsoeuer is builded vpon these grounds,
by the scripture it is ouerthrowen. The scriptures haue prescribed an
holie communion; they vpon their foundation haue reared a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Masse. The scripture maketh baptisme the consecrated
seale of mans saluation; They vpon their foundation haue builded
the baptisme of belles and shippes. The scripture saith, Christ was
offered vp but once; they vpon their foundation haue erected an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
whereupon he is daily offered vp. The scripture wil haue the
scriptures to be read of all men, prayer to be made with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
Christ to be a full satisfaction for sinne, worship to be doone
vnto God alone; They vpon their foundations haue builded a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that forbiddeth Gods people to reade his word, that teacheth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17219:11"/>
them to powre out their prayer in a tongue which they cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that hath found out a way to satisfie the wrath of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
God in this life by penaunce, and after this life by indurance in
Purgatorie, a doctrine that commaundeth them to call vpon Saints
and soules departed, to worship the worke of their owne handes, to
say to a peece of bread,<note place="margin">Religion buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon such groundes, though it were not iniurious, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> 
               <hi>My Lord &amp; my God.</hi> If these doctrines of theirs
did not containe, as they doe, most manifest impietie, yet all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
builded vpon such grounds must needes be vaine and friuolous.
For although we offer vp neuer so many sacrifices; though we keepe
all the daies in the yere holie; though we pray, and giue thankes, and
doe almes; yet except we knowe that herein we shewe obedience to
the lawes and statutes of our God, we doe but tire out our selues in
vaine. Wil God reward those things wherein he taketh no delight?
Or taketh he delight in any thing and hath not shewed it? Or hath
he shewed it, and not in scripture? Doubtlesse they worship him but
in vaine, which either teache or practise the precepts of men for the
Lawes of God. That they teache or practise the precepts of men
they wil not graunt, yet the most that possibly they can alledge to
prooue any one of these things to be of God is this, <hi>Such or such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith that this or this being not written, is neuerthelesse Apostolicall.</hi> And
they knowe that the witnesses whom they cite in matters of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
doe sometimes checke and contrarie one another. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
that was betweene the East and West Churches concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the feast of Easter, the one part alledged tradition to prooue
their custome, and the other part tradition to prooue the contrarie.
It might be that neither was Apostolicall, both could not be, when
eche gainesaide other. Yet both must be, if al be Apostolicall which
the Fathers haue saide is Apostolicall. If al be not, where is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of these grounds? Why doe they murther, burne, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
from place to place as many as make any doubt of these things,
which are grounded vpon so fickle and weake foundation?</p>
            <p>21 But to leaue the foundation whereupon they builde their
doctrine,<note place="margin">The second difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene true Christianitie and Poperie is in the ende.</note> if in the rest we finde them as corrupt, as in this they haue
beene declared weake; surely then we may boldly affirme, that the
Church of Rome is rather a sinke of all abhomination, than a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
from whence those liuing waters, or a storehouse wherein that
heauenly foode, whereof the Prophet Esay speaketh, may be had.
Let vs therefore nowe consider the end, as wel of our religion as of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17219:11"/>
theirs. Let vs viewe the marke whereat eche part doeth shoote.
Whatsoeuer men doe; they doe it to some end. And the qualitie of
things which are doone to any ende is iudged to be good or bad by
the ende whereunto they are doone. Hereof it is, that in scripture,
things otherwise highly commended, as prayer, fasting, and almes
deedes are most bitterly reprooued when they tend to bad ends. As
there is but one author from whom all things are, so there is but one
end, vnto whom al things should encline and bend themselues. God
is <hi>Alpha,</hi> the first, from whom all other things haue their being and
beginning; wherefore in reason he is <hi>Omega,</hi> the end and finall cause
of all things: vpon him they must attend, and seeing they are not of
themselues, therefore they may not serue themselues, but for the
glorie of him by whom they are. From hence a rule may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to iudge betweene pure religion in deede, and that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely
so called. For that religion no doubt is best, which most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth
the glorie of God; and that which taketh most from him,
the worst.<note place="margin">Ephe. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ipsi gloria in Ecclesia:</hi> In the Church of God all glorie is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

               <hi>Righteousnesse O Lord belongeth vnto thee, but vnto vs open shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22 Wherefore touching our selues,<note place="margin">Man is humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching original sinne.</note> we teache with the blessed
Apostles and Prophets, <hi>that by nature we are the children of wrath;</hi> that
corruption is bredde and setled within our bones; that we are both
borne and begotten in it; that with it all the powers and faculties of
our nature are infected;<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> that still it cleaueth fast vnto our soules, and,
although the deadly sting be taken from it, yet there it sticketh as
long as life doth endure, so irkesome and so grieuous, that it forceth
the most vpright and perfect to crie,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Miserable man, who shall deliuer
me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23 By this inbred corruption our vnderstanding is so darkened,<note place="margin">Thraldome of will.</note>
that naturally we cannot perceiue the things which are of God; no
we count them foolishnesse; our will is in such thraldome and slaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnto sinne, that it cannot like of any thing spirituall and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but is wholly caried vnto fleshly desires.</p>
            <p>24 If therefore we perceiue the things that are of God,<note place="margin">Grace.</note> and doe
like of them; if our hearts be enclined to doe his will, because this
cannot come of our selues (our nature bending a cleane contrarie
way) we acknowledge most willingly, and vnfeinedly, The good we
doe is his, it is not ours; our beginning to doe, and our continuance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17219:12"/>
in dooing well proceedeth onely, and wholly from him. If any man
receiue the grace of God offered, it is because God hath framed his
heart thereto. If any man come when God calleth, it is because his
grace which calleth, draweth. If being brought vnto Christ, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in him, we haue no other reason to yeeld of our dooing, but
onely this, he hath linked vs and fastened vs vnto himselfe. We nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rise, when we are fallen; nor stand, when we are risen, by our
owne strength. When we are in distresse, we are of our selues so far
from abilitie to helpe our selues, that we are not able to craue helpe
of him, vnlesse his spirite wrest out <hi>Abba Father</hi> from vs. We cannot
mone our owne case, vnlesse he doe grone and sigh for vs; we are not
able to name Iesus, vnlesse by the speciall grace of his spirite our
mouthes be opened; no, we cannot, of our selues, so much as think
of naming him, if to thinke of naming him be a good thought.</p>
            <p>25 When against our naturall inclination to euill,<note place="margin">Workes.</note> his spirite,
which worketh all in all, hath so preuailed, that wee now beginne to
hate the workes of the flesh, hauing an earnest desire to abounde in
loue,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> ioie, peace, long suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
temperaunce, and all other fruites of the spirite; yet, by reason
of the strength of that bodie of sinne which euer fighteth against the
spirite, our inward man is so weakened, that we cannot do the things
which we would, and the things which we do, euen the best of them,
are so farre beneath that perfection which the Lawe of God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that, if he should rigorously examine them in iustice, no fleshe
could euer be accounted righteous in his sight. The loathsomest
things that can be imagined, the cloathes that be most vncleane are
not so foule as our very righteousnes is vnrighteous: Wherupon we
conclude, that whatsoeuer wee receiue by way of reward at Gods
hand either in this life or in the life to come, wee receiue it as a thing
freely giuen by him, without any merite or desert of ours; we doe not
say in our hearts, <hi>The Lord hath giuen vs these good things to possesse for our
righteousnesse.</hi> For seeing it is he which giueth both to will and to doe,
he crowneth in deede his owne worke, when he rewardeth ours; and
he neuer rewardeth any worke of his owne, wherein there is not som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of ours which he pardoneth.</p>
            <p>26 Thus being naked and vtterly destitute in our selues we seeke
all things in Christ Iesus.<note place="margin">The truth see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to throw downe men, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance Christ.</note> Him onely we acknowledge to be our wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
our iustification, our sanctification, our redemption, our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17219:12"/>
priest, our sacrifice, our king, our head, our mediator, our phisition,
our waie, our trueth, our life. In our selues we finde nothing but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
and weakenesse; praise, and honour, and glorie wee giue to
him. The onely marke we ayme at is to set vp his throne, to aduaunce
his kingdome, to make it knowne that in him the Father hath layde
vp all the treasures of heauen, to the ende that vnto him the thirstie
may repaire for water, the hungrie for bread, the naked for cloathes,
and wee all for all things needeful to the safetie of our soules and
bodies.</p>
            <p>27 This is not the scope which the Church of Rome proposeth;<note place="margin">The Church of Rome see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her own glorie and gaine.</note>
They direct all things to an other end. <hi>How can ye beleeue,</hi> saith Christ

which commeth of God alone?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> And howe can the faith of the Church of
Rome be sound, sith they hold such doctrines, as tend wholly to their

God?</p>
            <p>28 That they seeke not his glorie,<note place="margin">She paireth &amp; diminisheth mans original corruption.</note> but their owne, it may appeare
vnto any man which throughly considereth of their doctrine. First
they will not acknowledge that pouertie and nakednesse, those filthie
garments of corruption and sinne wherein Adam hath wrapped his
posteritie; But in the pride of their hearts, they dissemble it, diminish
it, and make light of it. For although they denie not but that mans
nature is corrupted, yet marke how they paire and lessen this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Prophet Dauid doeth terme it <hi>wickednesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> and <hi>sinne:</hi> but
they make it onely an inclination vnto sinning. The Lorde himselfe
doeth witnesse that by it <hi>all the imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart
are only euill:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> they restraine it to the inferior part of the soule, and make
it onely a mother of some grosser desires. The blessed Apostle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
groned, and wept against it, as a thing which made him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
wearie of his life: But after Baptisme, they make no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those inward rebellious motions against the spirite, than
they doe of the beating of a mans pulse.</p>
            <p>29 And as they hide that weakenesse which indeede they haue,<note place="margin">Shee boasteth of freewill.</note>
so they boast of that strength which is not in them. For being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto miserable bondage vnder sinne, by reason of that corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which hath spred it selfe ouer all flesh, they bragge notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the freedome of their wil: as if sinne had not vtterly berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs thereof, but stil it were in vs to frame and fashion our owne
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17219:13"/>
hearts vnto good things. For proofe whereof their maner is to make
long discourses teaching, that Gods foreknowledge doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
free will, that men are not violently drawen to good or euill.
Which things we easily and willingly graunt; neither doe we teache,
or euer did, that the freedome of our wil is taken away by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
decree of his vnsearchable purpose: but this we say, and all that
haue the trueth doe say the same, that the will of man being free vnto
naturall and ciuill actions, hath of it selfe no freedome to desire
things heauenly and spirituall; not because the eternall purpose of
God, but because the corruption of our nature hath addicted vs only
vnto euill. We doe not teache or euer did, that any man is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt
either of sinne or of righteousnesie by constraint. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we obey the one vnto death and condemnation, or vnto life and
saluation the other, our obedience is alwayes voluntarie, it is not
wrested from vs against our wils. But the question being how we are
made willing vnto that which is good, this is the difference betweene
our aunswere and theirs: We say onely by the grace of God; they say
partly by grace, but principally by the power and strength of their
owne nature. For being ashamed to affirme with Pelagius that a
man may doe the workes of righteousnesse by nature without the
grace of God, they hold his grace to be a thing indeede necessarie:
But howe? As a birde that is tyed or a man that is in fetters needeth
onely to haue those incumberances remooued, hauing then a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
abilitie to flie and walke without any further helpe; so man, as
they say, hath in himselfe abilitie to doe good, if the grace of God
doe but remooue lets. Is not this to make nature the principal cause
of our well dooing, whereas in trueth, without the speciall motion
of Gods spirite, and that in euerie particular action, wee are no
more able to walke in the waies which GOD hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
than a drunken man to goe without leading, who stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
euen in the plainest ground, though all stumbling blockes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued,
though his waie lie neuer so smooth before him, such is our
weakenesse. In consideration whereof the blessed Apostle sayth
plainely,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
               <hi>It is not in him that willeth, or in him that runneth, but in God that
sheweth mercie.</hi> We dragge, and are not able of our selues to set one
foote before an other.<note place="margin">Cantic 1.</note> 
               <hi>Drawe me,</hi> saith the spouse in the Canticles, <hi>and
then we will runne after thee.</hi> But these men litle considering of what
fraile metall they are made, perceiuing not how sinne hath weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17219:13"/>
the faculties of the soule, vaunt of freedome, of strength, of
inward power, and make their owne will the chiefest cause of
their wel dooing.</p>
            <p>30 And when they haue doone any thing which to their see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
is wel doone,<note place="margin">Iustification by workes.</note> they prise it so high and esteeme so much of
it, that God, as they thinke, should doe them iniurie if in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he did not pronounce them iust and righteous for their
workes sake. If it were possible that God entering into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should finde any so vpright and perfect that by their workes
they might be iustified in his sight, doubtlesse he should finde his
owne seruaunts to be such; or else none: if any of his seruaunts,
surely his Prophets; if any Prophet, rather Dauid than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But Dauid crieth out,<note place="margin">Psal. 143.</note> 
               <hi>Enter not into iudgement</hi> no not <hi>with
thy Seruaunt O Lord. For in thy sight shall none that liueth be iustified.</hi> For
whether we consider workes forbidden, or commaunded by the
Lawe; what man is there liuing which can say in the one, <hi>My
heart is pure,</hi> in the other, <hi>I haue doone all that is enioyned me?</hi> For
if it were so that we knewe nothing wherein we had transgressed
the lawes and statutes of the almightie, yet herein could we in no
wise be iustified, because of secret sinnes hidden euen from our
owne selues. For which if God shal call vs to our reckoning, and
marke straitely what is doone amisse,<note place="margin">Psal. 130.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord,</hi> saith the Prophet,
<hi>who shall stand?</hi> Againe, if we had doone whatsoeuer wee could;
yet, because we cannot doe so much as we should, we ought to
acknowledge our selues vnprofitable: whereas we, euen the best
of vs, are farre from dooing that which, if we would, we might
doe.</p>
            <p>31 Nowe if God notwithstanding,<note place="margin">Of merites and workes of superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> for his sonnes sake, doe
so allowe and accept the worke of our hands, that he bountifully
rewardeth our weake seruice with an excellent and an eternall
waight of glorie, how much are wee bound both to praise his
mercie, and to hate the insolencie of those men, who, besides al
this, swelling in the proude conceit of their workes, will haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life which is his gift to be their merite? nor onely that,
but the worthinesse of their deserts to be so great, that many of
them dooing God more seruice than can bee sufficiently rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their owne persons, deserue heauen not onely for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but for others too. These shipwracks of faith they haue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17219:14"/>
made by reason of their inward pride.</p>
            <p>32 The excessiue desire of outward pompe hath further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
caused them to disdaine the basenesse of Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">She desireth excessiuely outwarde pompe.</note> and
of his Apostles; to bee ashamed of the meane and lowe estate,
wherein they liued; to make of their Deacons and Priests Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
exceeding the kings of the earth in glorie; of their Bishop a
Monarke, vnder whose foote the Emperour himselfe hath beene
a footestoole, whose stirrop the greatest Soueraignes haue scarse
beene deemed worthie to holde, at whose bridle kings haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as seruaunts, that the wordes of the Preacher might bee
iustified,<note place="margin">Eccles 10.</note> 
               <hi>Follie is set in great excellencie, and the riche set in the lowe

            <p>33 This pompe cannot bee maintained with nothing,<note place="margin">She maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it by vile merchandise.</note> it
must haue strong sinnewes. And therefore whatsoeuer mans wit
might possibly deuise for gaine, they haue both founde it out,
and put it in vre: setting Offices, Masses, Prayers, Pardons,
Sacramentes, Heauen and Earth, all the treasures of the
house of GOD to sale, if wee may terme it the house of
God, which they haue made a shoppe of so vile merchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.
It were infinite to recite what huge summes of money
they haue heretofore, by religious pretenses, euerie yeere ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
within the compasse of this one Ilande: What heapes
then haue they raked out of other partes of Christendome?
Which offals and profites if once men beginne, as here, so in
other kingdomes also, to withholde from them; if men leaue
off buying their wares any more, if things which are fatte, and
excellent depart, doubtlesse that citie, which nowe is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in fine linnen, and purple, and skarlet, which nowe is
guilded with golde, and decked with pretious stones, and
pearles, shall in one houre be made desolate. This they know,
and it maketh them carefull to maintaine whatsoeuer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
and gainefull to them. As for the glorie of GOD,
it is the least part of their care; nay, they care not howe hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
sacrilege they commit in spoyling and robbing him of his
honour.</p>
            <p>34 It is an honour vnto God,<note place="margin">She robbeth God of the honour which he shold haue by Faith, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, and Obedience.</note> when all men by faith point
their fingers, as it were, at Christ Iesus, naming him the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17219:14"/>
onelie Lambe which taketh away the sinnes of the worlde;
when he is acknowledged the onely mediatour betweene God
and vs; when wee confesse, that hee is that Priest according
to the order of Melchisedech,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> which, hauing offered one sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for sinnes, hath therewith, because it was a perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
consecrated for euer them that are sanctified; when
our faith is so ascertained and grounded vppon his promises,
that we can bee <hi>bolde as Lyons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 28.</note> assuring our selues that <hi>the eye of
the Lorde is on them which trust in his mercie to deliuer their soules
from death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33.</note> as the Prophet witnesseth. But how doe they giue
vnto him this honour, who haue deuised so many waies to
take away sinne besides the bloud of the Lambe of GOD;
who, as though wee might not be bolde <hi>to enter into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
place by the newe and liuely way which hee hath prepared for vs
through the vaile which is his fleshe,</hi> or as though there were
some others without whom the father in him is not pleased,
some others more willing to heare our requestes than hee
who gaue himselfe to death for our sakes, haue made their
intercessors infinite in number; and, as though his sacrifice
were so vnperfect, that by beeing once offered it could not
perfectly consecrate those which are sanctified, renue their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
day by day; finally, as though the Prophet were ouer
presumptuous which saieth,<note place="margin">Psal. 46.</note> 
               <hi>God is our hope, and strength, and
helpe, therefore will not we feare,</hi> goe about by all meanes to strike
a seruile terror into the heartes of the faithfull, to keepe them
alwaies wauering and doubting, to take away all assurance of
the mercie and fauour of God towards them: which when we
haue lost, what courage can we haue to withstand the fierie
assaults of Satan? what comfort or consolation in the middest of
those sharp and bitter conflicts, which we must endure, if we will
liue godly in Christ Iesus?</p>
            <p>35 It is an honour vnto God, when his name onely is called
vpon; when we worship and fal downe before none but him. This
honour he getteth not at their hands, which haue gotten to them
selues legions of Angels, to whom they pray, and millions of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
which they daily adore. Their differences betweene an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll
and an Image are but shifts. Call them what yee will; They
are similitudes of things in heauen or things in earth, which is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17219:15"/>
sufficient to condemne them of Idolatrie that worshippe such
things. Their distinctions betweene the honour which they giue
to Images, and the worship which they doe to God alone, may
serue to bleare the eyes of mortall men: But the eternall God
doth knowe, that they honour creatures with that honour which
is forbidden them in the Lawe: that they <hi>bowe downe to them,</hi> and
that <hi>they serue them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>36 It is an honour vnto God when reuerence and obedience
is shewed vnto his Lawe. But is this performed in that syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
where he sitteth which is an aduersarie, and exalteth him
selfe against all that is called God, or that is woorshipped; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himselfe supreme Iudge of all nations, requiring his owne
words to be heard of all men as the words of God; bereauing
magistrates of their lawfull power; exempting his Clergie from
the ciuill sword, what villanie soeuer they commit; chaunging
at pleasure the gouernment of Christ established in his Church;
dispensing with sinne be it neuer so directly against the expresse
commaundement of God; forbidding his Clergie mariage, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of seuering them from the worlde, but in deede to
ease them of such cares and troubles as are necessarilie ioyned
with that honourable estate which God commendeth, and
both secretly with concubines and openly in stewes permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them fornication which God doeth hate? Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this their synagogue is nothing but a sinke of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse,
seeing that all their indeuours tend to no other end
but onely to the aduauncement of themselues, the dishonour
of God, and the disgrace of Christ, doubtlesse they are not, they
cannot be the men which minister the waters of eternall life vnto
thirstie soules.</p>
            <p>37 Now that we haue seene both the ground,<note place="margin">The third difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene true Christianitie and Poperie is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes and maner of proceeding.</note> and the end,
as wel of that faith which we professe, as of the doctrine which
is helde by them who are deadly enemies to vs and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
it remaineth that a worde bee spoken of the meanes
which are vsed on both parts, to set forward that for which we
striue. Touching our selues, as the marke which wee shoote
at is to set vp the kingdome of Christ Iesus, a kingdome
which is not of the worlde, so the meanes which herein wee
vse, are not worldlie, but altogether heauenly and spirituall.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17219:15"/>
What the proceedings of the Gospell haue beene, yee are not
ignoraunt; ye knowe verie wel, how without force, without cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
without trecherie and deceit, without all wisedome of flesh
and bloud, in naked simplicitie, in trueth vncoloured, and, as the
Apostle speaketh, in foolishnesse of preaching we haue laboured
to prepare you for one husband, to present you as a pure virgin
to Christ, not outwardly arrayed in purple and skarlet, guilded
with gold, pretious stones, and pearle, like the strumpet that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vpon many waters, but, like the spouse of Solomon, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
within, ful of Christ, riche in faith, and in good workes, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
with knowledge of his wil in all wisedome and spiritual vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
strengthened mightily in the inward man, rooted
and grounded in syncere loue, inabled to comprehende with all
Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height of
the loue of Christ, strengthened with all patience and long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
blessed with all spirituall blessings in heauenly things.</p>
            <p>38 Contrariwise they desiring no such thing, but seeking to
build an earthly kingdome for themselues, vse the meanes which
are fittest for that purpose. They feede mens eies with all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and glittering shewes, they inuent to themselues instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of Musicke to delight the eare; but of the worke of
the Lord, of preaching the Gospel, of instructing the heart, of
building the faith, of exhorting and comforting Gods people,
who seeth not how litle regard they haue? They keepe men oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
alwaies in corporal and bodily exercise,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> which profiteth
litle: But are they careful to traine men vp in the knowledge of
Christ, which is eternal life? in true godlinesse, which is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto all things, which hath the promise of the life present,
and of that which is to come? No, their practise from time to
time doth shewe that most prophane and godlesse men onely si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselues with the Church of Rome, and defending by all
meanes the Popes honour, may both be counted as Catholikes,
and euen canonised as Saints among them. If they passe the
daies of their life lewdely, after death at a reasonable prise they
may purchase rest for their soules. If their hearts be set vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie,
incest, theft, murther, consider the holie father for his
parchement and lead, and what more easily graunted in the
Court of Rome, than full and free libertie to commit sinne?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17219:16"/>
Hence it commeth to passe that as euerie man is most licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent, so he ioyneth himselfe most willingly to the Church of
Rome, and warreth most earnestly for that faith, which faith if
the riche men of this worlde be for the most part readie to
embrace, what maruel is it? For whereas Christ hath saide, <hi>It is
hard for a riche man to enter into heauen,</hi> their doctrine and practise
maketh the way expedite onely for the riche; but by the way
which they teache for a poore man to enter into the kingdome of
heauen, it is a hard matter. It were too much to recite all the
meanes whereby that kingdome of darkenesse hath growen; it
were a thing too full of horror to discourse of all the trecheries,
poysonings, murtherings, massacres which they haue vsed to
maintaine their power, neuer any tyrant in the world more. Did
Christ, did Peter, did the blessed Apostles, thus subdue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
nations? Did they thus inlarge the kingdome of God? As
verily as he doth liue, it is not the goodnesse of their religion but
the strength of their faction, and the wilinesse of flesh by which
they stand.</p>
            <p>39 Wherefore briefly to conclude this matter, and in fewe
words to knit vp that which remaineth; I haue, as you see, set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you life and death, truth and error, wholesome foode and
noysome poison. If ye tender the safetie of your owne soules, be
not as children readie to take whatsoeuer is offered you; learne
to iudge betweene good and euill; lay not out monie for that
which is no bread; spend not your labour in that which cannot
satisfie; come to the waters whereunto God calleth you.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 40 The maner of comming is set downe by the Prophet in
many words: the summe of all is this:<note place="margin">After what sort men must come to the waters of life.</note> Wee must not giue eare
vnto lying spirits; <hi>Heare not the wordes of the Prophets that prophecie
vnto you, and teache you vanitie: they speake the vision of their owne heart;
and not out of the mouth of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 23.</note> turne away your eares from such,
and <hi>hearken vnto me,</hi> saith the Lorde. <hi>Hearken diligently,</hi> carefully,
attentiuely. The word of life is of power and strength to saue
your soules: But if ye be as vessels that leake, and runne out, how
should the doctrine of saluation profite you? This food, refusing
all other, we are exhorted both to take, and to <hi>eate.</hi> If sinners, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
enemies of the truth say, Come with vs; shunne them,
turne away your feete from their pathes, offer not you their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17219:16"/>
of bloud, present not your selues in their temples, tast not
things sacrificed vnto their Idols, <hi>Eate that which is good.</hi> Labour
not for the meate which perisheth, much lesse for that whereby
men perish; but labour for the meate that endureth to euerlasting
life, which meate the sonne of man shall giue you. For him <hi>hath
God the father sealed.</hi> He is the bread of life, his flesh is meate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
and his bloud is drinke in deede, his word is the power of
God vnto saluation, his sacraments are seales of righteousnesse
by faith, in him are all the treasures of peace, ioie, rest, comfort;
no eye hath seene, no eare hath heard, no heart hath conceiued
the things which are hidden and laide vp in him. Whereupon if
we feede in such sort that <hi>our soules</hi> take ioie, pleasure, and <hi>delight in
fatnesse,</hi> then the fruite which hereby we shall reape is this.</p>
            <p>41 <hi>Your soule,</hi> saith God, <hi>shall liue, and I wil make an euerlasting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

<hi>The wicked is kept to the day of destruction, and shall bee brought

               <hi>I wil set vp thy seede after thee

in the booke of Psalmes, <hi>Mine hande shall be established with him and

them that hate him, my mercie will I keepe for him for euermore, and my

is made with vs, his mercies are our mercies, if so be we performe
that which here is required at our hands. If we hearken diligently
vnto him that cryeth, <hi>Come to the waters,</hi> if we cleaue fast vnto his
trueth, if we embrace his promises with ioie, eating that which is
good, shunning and loathing that which is euil, surely his hande
shall be established with vs as with Dauid, his arme shall bee our
strength, the enemie shal not oppresse vs, neither shal the wicked
doe vs harme: but God shall destroy all our enemies before vs,
and plague them that hate vs, his mercies he shal keepe towards

consultation to be had, as well for

three especiall things are commonly offered to consider of: The

prouided for. If religion be not sound, mens soules cannot be safe;

selfesame things, as by the words which I haue chosen to treate of
it wil appeare. Our Samuel, our good and gratious gouernour,
moued with like affection, hath called this honourable and high
Court of Parliament for like end. Wherein, that things wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
may the better proceede and take best effect, let vs in our
prayers craue helpe and assistance from aboue. Wherein let vs
not forget Christs vniuersall Church, this particular Church of
England and Ireland, the Queenes excellent Maiestie, our most
Soueraigne Ladie and chiefe gouernour, that God remembring
vs in his mercie may graunt her Maiestie a long happie life, with
the encrease of all godlie honour and felicitie, to the great praise
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17219:18"/>
of his name and great good of his Church. Let vs also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in our prayers the honourable priuie Counsel, the Clergie,
the Nobilitie, with the whole people of this Realme: that God
may graunt euerie one grace in his calling syncerely to serue him.
And especially at this time, let vs call vpon God for wisedome
and grace from aboue, that in this consultation of Parliament all
priuate affections and respects to our owne commodities laide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
Gods glorie and the good of his Church and this common
wealth, onely and syncerely may be sought. For these, and grace
let vs pray vnto God, as our Sauiour Christ hath taught vs, <hi>Our
Father, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>2 The better to conueigh my selfe to the matter which I
haue in hand I shall craue leaue that I may speake somewhat of
this princely Prophet Samuel:<note place="margin">Things to bee considered in the person of Samuel. He was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</note> who descending of noble paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
was by his mother consecrated to the ministerie. Of which
calling though Christ himselfe thought so highly, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note>
that refusing to bee a King, he chose the office of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
yet, so peruerse is the iudgement of the worlde, that they
thinke no condition more base or vile. The minister with his
master Christ is contemned: this holy office is become odious:
<hi>All men seeke their owne</hi> and serue themselues:<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> it is accounted sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
to serue the Lorde.</p>
            <p>3 Samuel was called of God to be a magistrate:<note place="margin">He was a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie magistrate; yet misliked by them ouer whom he was placed.</note> wherein he
was so faithful and vpright, that his aduersaries were forced to
iustifie his dooings, and to beare him record, that he neither was
a bribetaker, nor an extortioner, nor one that had iniuried any
man. It were wel with our common wealth, if all officers could
carie away the like testimonie. But euill subiects cannot away with
good magistrates. The prodigall, which haue consumed their
substance in lewdenesse and vanitie, long for a chaunge: suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that their state wil be bettered thereby, and perswading them
selues that it cannot be made worse. <hi>All change is perilous,</hi> and an
olde saying is it, <hi>Seldome comes the better.</hi> A better this people
could hardly haue had: yet so vnquiet and discontented they
were, that (the good and peaceable gouernement of Samuel
notwithstanding) they misliked their present state, and desired
an other gouernour to be giuen them.<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> The worthie magistrate
Moses was muttered against:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 17.</note> The noble king Dauid for a time
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17219:18"/>
deposed: our faithful Samuel reiected. Behold the harde state of
good Princes, who are for the most part rewarded with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.<note place="margin">Psal. 70.</note>
Moses deare cousins became his deadly enemies: Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids
familiar friends became his most fierce and violent foes: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
was reiected of such as he most fauoured.<note place="margin">Crysippus.</note> Crysippus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
the course of these things, saith that, which experience
prooueth true: <hi>Thou shalt bee sure if thou gouerne amisse, to purchase
Gods; if well, the peoples anger and displeasure.</hi> The daunger of this
office, by reason of the great ingratitude of the people, made
Moses say to God,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Send whom thou wilt send:</hi> it caused Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
rather to wish banishment,<note place="margin">Demosthenes Themistocles Valer. Max. lib. 7. cap. 2.</note> than place of gouernement; and
Themistocles to prefer hel it selfe to the iudgement seate. When
Antigonus should put on a royall diademe, he brake foorth into
this speeche, <hi>O cloth of more honourable, than happie estate: wherewith
if a man were so throughly acquainted that he could tell the number of cares
and miseries wherewith thou art fraught, hee would not stoupe for thee,
though he might haue thee for the taking vp.</hi> Wherefore it grieued
not Samuel to be eased of so heauie a burthen: but God was
much grieued, to see so great disgrace offered to his annointed.
<hi>They haue not reiected thee but me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 7.</note> saith the Lorde. To dislike and
cast off a good magistrate is to dislike and cast off God: because
<hi>all power is of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> God in his wrath for godly Samuel gaue them
wicked Saul. I pray God in his iustice serue all such alike, as seeke
after such change, as cannot submit themselues with louing and
obedient hearts to the good gouernement of woorthie Samuel
their natural Prince, their good and faithful Magistrate: whom
for conscience sake, they ought to honour, and obey.</p>
            <p>4 Samuel was both a Prophet,<note place="margin">He was both a Prophet and a Prince.</note> and a Prince: a Minister, and
a Magistrate: So was Melchisedech, Moses, Dauid, Christ. Hee
had neede to be a rare man that should wel aunswere sundrie offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note>
When <hi>Redde rationem,</hi> giue account commeth, then one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
such as the least of these, will be thought a burthen heauie
ynough for any one, besides these, to haue borne. But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of these two offices doth teache, what agreement, loue,
and liking should be betweene these two officers. They are Gods
two hands, to build vp withall the decayed wals of Ierusalem. If
the one hand set forward, and the other put backeward, Gods
worke will be ill wrought.<note place="margin">Exod. 4</note> The wisedome of God matched Moses
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17219:19"/>
and Aaron, two brethren; the one the minister, the other the
magistrate: that knit together in brotherly loue, they might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
together with both handes, for the furtherance of Gods
building. When the word and the sword doe ioine, then is the
people wel ruled, and then is God well serued. So long as king
Ioas and the good priest Iehoida liued together,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> God was serued
according to his word; the priest rightly counselled, the king
gladly followed.</p>
            <p>5 Samuel zealous for the glorie of God,<note place="margin">Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the wordes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</note> and carefull for the
commonwealth, preacheth to the Parliament assembled after this
sort: <hi>Be this sinne against the Lord farre from me, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein first,
he putteth the ministers in minde of their dutie;<note place="margin">1. The duetie of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> secondly, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the prince and people of their office; lastly, hee sheweth if
they doe it not,<note place="margin">2. The duetie of the Prince.</note> what punishment wil followe.</p>
            <p>6 Samuel reiected &amp; put from the office of a magistrate by this
froward &amp; rebellious people,<note place="margin">3. The dutie of the people.</note> yet was not so froward himselfe, as to
forsake the office of a minister.<note place="margin">4. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t if this dutie be not performed.</note> Neither minded he to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge this
wrong offered him; but, with a milde minde, he was content not
onely to pray for them, but to teache them faithfully, and louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to admonish them.<note place="margin">Samuell zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in Gods cause, but milde in his owne.</note> A patterne for all princes, to bee milde in
their owne matters, yet earnest and zealous in the quarel of God.
He prayed for the people his enemies; the cause was his owne: he
tooke the sword in his hand,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.</note> and cut King Agag in peeces; the
cause was Gods. Moses in his owne cause was a man most milde,
he quietly suffered wonderful wrongs: but when he perceiued I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie
committed, Gods glorie comming into question, hee
with his partakers for worshipping of that calfe put to the sword
three thousand men.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> Christ our Sauiour and Master suffered,<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note>
though vndeseruedly, yet meekely all reproofe, yea reproch, yea
death it selfe: but when his fathers cause came in hande that the
house of God was made a denne of theeues; hee bestirred him
with his whip, coursed those symoniacall choppers and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
buyers and sellers out of the Temple, and made hauocke of
whatsoeuer they had.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 7 This milde and zealous Samuel; zealous in Gods cause,
and milde in his owne,<note place="margin">By his owne example hee giueth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that it is their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to Pray &amp; to Teache.</note> first by his owne example putteth the
ministers in minde of their duetie: in whom hee requireth two
things, as principall points concerning them, To pray; and, To

teache. <hi>God forbid that I should sinne against the Lorde and cease praying
for you: I will shewe you the good and right waie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 Christ,<note place="margin">His praier was earnest: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by his words, Be this sinne farre from me that I should cease to pray.</note> that good pastor, was earnest in praier for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Holie father keepe them:</hi> yea for his enemies, <hi>Father forgiue them.</hi>
Paul the good Apostle <hi>prayed without intermission.</hi> Iames the good
Bishop of Hierusalem, made his knees as hard as the hoose of a
camell, with continuall praying. Our good Prophet Samuell
thinketh it a great sinne not to pray for the people. <hi>Absit a me hoc
peccatum,</hi> Be this sinne farre from mee. Christ, Peter, Paul, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,
praied with many teares. God is delighted with an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
prayer both in the minister, in the Prince, and in the people.

Happie is that Prince, that hath wise and godly counsellers: and
thrise happie that wil followe them. Then may the people liue a

Such troublers of the quiet of the Church, such deceiuers of the
people are at leastwise, according to the auncient commendable
custome of the church, to be remooued from the ministerie. It
is no reason that the church enemies should bee fostered in the

neede not trouble you with recitall of them.<note place="margin">Trip hist. lib. 9. cap. 25.</note> Amphilochius the

The ministers, what roume soeuer they haue in the church of
God, ought to pray, and teache the good and right way, or else

which feare is euer ioyned with loue, and for that cause called a

whereof is desperation, as the fruite of the former is loue, which
maketh not ashamed. Feare God: for they which feare him shal
not feele his power. All things bee naked and open before him.

It appertaineth to Princes, to Magistrates, to them which are

ours. We doe it, when we suffer it to be done. Princes, to please

This disease spreadeth farre. Patrones gape for gaines, and

He is easily dealt withal if he be disbishopped. If the lot fal on the

            <p>19 The next point of princely seruice doone to God,<note place="margin">The next point of princely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, is to prouide that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be taught the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> is to
nurse the church with wholesome foode till we all growe vp to a
perfect man in Christ Iesus. That this foode may bee ministred,
that this word may be preached, euerie where, to Gods people;
good princes, and such as are in authoritie must take special care.
For this is truely to serue and feare God. It is not enough that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17219:22"/>
princes and magistrates embrace the Gospel, that they feed vpon
the foode of saluation themselues; but they, as heads and pastors,
must see this bread broken &amp; deliuered to the people. Christ had
care of al the people, &amp; sent his disciples abroad with this charge,
<hi>Go your waies into the whole world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 28.</note> The wil of Christ is, <hi>that all be saued
and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> The preaching of the gospel is
called the kingdome of Christ. For by that meanes Christ is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
groweth, &amp; raigneth in the hearts and soules of the people. If
the flocke want their pastor, &amp;, by reason therof, through famine
perish; doubtlesse that bloud of soules wil be required. Lawes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for many matters of small importance. This waightie matter
of mans saluation is not lightly to be passed ouer. The haruest no
doubt is great,<note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> many willing to heare the word: fewe there be that
labour, but many idle lookers on, who take the wages, but either
wil not or cannot worke. They haue learned of the euill steward
to play the theefe:<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> both to robbe their master Christ of his glorie,
and the church of Christ of their saluation. But woe be to those
sheepeheardes which feede themselues, and suffer the flocke of
Christ to want their meate.</p>
            <p>20 The want of reward hindereth this worke.<note place="margin">Prouision to be made for teachers to that purpose.</note> But this wil be
answered. Some haue ynough and some haue too much. I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with these speeches: but let me say againe: A great sort
haue too litle, and some that are worthie to haue, haue starke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
No man hath too much that wel doeth his dutie: for he is
worthie of double that honour which he hath.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> And he that can
iustly be charged with want of duetie,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> let his candlestick in Gods
name, and for Gods sake be remooued. Nowe if it be alleaged,
that if equall diuision were made, all might be sufficiently proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for: But who shal make the diuision? There is cause, why
men may thinke it skant safe for the Church of Christ to put her
patrimonie to arbitrement: least, while diuision bee pretended,
some Quintus Fabius adiudge a good part thereof to the Senate
of Rome.<note place="margin">Cic. de Off. lib. 1.</note> Rome hath robbed Christ of his honour; and, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations,
giuen his patrimonie to idle fat Monkes to feede v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.
We haue restored Christ to his honour and dignitie: but
we stil holde from him his lands and liuing like a ward. The Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke
and Idolatrous priests of Egypt, of Iupiter, of Baal, of Bel
were liberally prouided for. The priests of Aaron, the Scribes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17219:23"/>
and Pharisies, the Monkes, Friers, and sacrificing popish priests
were in high authoritie, and had the wealth of the worlde. Shall
Idol seruice be preferred to the true seruice of God? Shall false
prophets be better regarded and rewarded than true Preachers?
Then iust is our condemnation.<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> For we shewe, that <hi>light being come
into the worlde,</hi> wee loue it not so much as they loued darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The Gospel hath euil lucke: it is neuer preached, but the
patrimonie thereof is pinched. Such as wil pretend the Gospell,
and labour to pull away the patrimonie of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> may well
professe Christ in words but they denie him in their deedes.</p>
            <p>21 As the ministers are to bee prouided for,<note place="margin">The people to be constrained to heare; what soeuer they pretend to the contrarie.</note> that the worde
may be preached: so the people must bee brought to conforme
themselues to the thankefull receiuing thereof: that from thence
they may learne truely to serue and feare God. And this care al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
pertaineth to godlie princes, and good magistrates, to prouide
good Lawes for the same, and to see those Lawes put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Although conscience cannot be forced; yet vnto externall
obedience, in lawful things, men may lawfully be compelled. God
the great king who worketh al things wel, sent foorth his officers
to compel men to come in,<note place="margin">Luke 14.</note> and eate of his great supper. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
S. Augustine saith,<note place="margin">Aug. epist. 204.</note> 
               <hi>Qui compellitur, quò non vult, cogitur; sed,
cùm intrarit, iam volens pascitur.</hi> Hee that is constrained, is driuen
whither he would not goe willingly: but when hee is entred by
constraint, then he feedeth with a good will. Paul neuer embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the gospel vntil he was cast off his horse flat vpon the earth:
and then he cried,<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lord what wilt thou haue me to doe?</hi> It is profitable
for men to be constrained vnto those things which are good. And
as it is profitable for them to be constrained, so is it a thing verie
reasonable to constraine them. For why should not the Church
enforce her lost children to returne to saluation: if lost children
enforce others to turne to destruction? Seeing that the whole
seruice in our Church is no other than Gods written worde: as
there can be alleaged no iust cause, why any man should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
himselfe from this word; so appertaineth it vnto princes
that feare God, within their dominions, to compel euery subiect
to come and heare this worde: least the church by this euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
should be greatly offended. Gods causes are zealously to
be seene vnto: and the winning of mens soules is religiously to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17219:23"/>
be sought. And thus much briefly touching the seruice of God:
To see the Gospel eueriewhere preached, the ministers prouided
for, and the people compelled to come heare the worde. This is
the feare of God which Samuel requireth.</p>
            <p>22 Whereunto must bee added a speciall regard to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth.<note place="margin">The duetie of the prince to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the common wealth.</note> It is commonly saide that the common wealth is
sore diseased, and that euerie member of that bodie seemeth to be
grieued. Remedie would bee sought in time, least remedie come
too late. But I am no Phisition for that bodie, and therefore is it
not fit for me to minister any medicine to it. But I shall pray for
the health thereof, and set it ouer to such as haue skill and can
helpe. The care of the common wealth chiefly appertaineth to
the head of the common wealth, who is <hi>Parens Patriae,</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of this sicke childe. It is required at our handes to feare and
serue the Lorde in trueth. That prince doth serue God in trueth,
and in deede, which is careful that the euill may be punished and
repressed; and that the good may bee defended, and aduaunced.
When generally all men are seene vnto, that euerie man doe his
duetie, then God is in trueth and synceritie serued.</p>
            <p>23 The prince is set as the head ouer the bodie;<note place="margin">With the prince other officers must be ioyned of whose choise howe great care should be had.</note> as the chiefe
shepeheard ouer the flocke. These titles are giuen to Princes, and
gouernours, to put them in minde not onely of their honour and
preeminence, but of their charge and office also. But the prince
cannot doe this alone, it is a burthen too heauie for one to weeld.
And therefore hee must, according to the counsel which Iethro
gaue vnto Moses, <hi>choose out of all the people men wise and fearing God, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the trueth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note> 
               <hi>such as hate couetousnesse, and out of them make rulers
ouer thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tennes, that they may sit and iudge the
people at all seasons.</hi> Magistrates should bee chosen out of all the
people for their woorthinesse. It is vnmeete that such things as
should followe deserts, bee procured by other sinister meanes.
Magistrates should be wise men, furnished with learning, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
good skil, and long experience; men that feare God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
louers of his trueth, fauourers of the Gospell, and of all
such as liue in the feare of God; True and vpright dealers, such as
will stedfastly fasten their eies vpon the causes brought before
them, and not regard the face of any man; lastly haters of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse,
bribes, and rewardes. Good officers should
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17219:24"/>
thus be qualified. And to the end that magistrates may be such,
it must be prouided that there may be choise of officers without
sale of offices. It is not probable that he which obtaineth such a
roume for a price, wil leaue it freely, or deale iustly in it. A grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
corruption than this cannot enter into a common wealth. For
by this meane both the prince and people are deceiued. To pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the euil; to maintaine the good; to ouerlooke the whole,
and to choose &amp; appoint forth worthie officers for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the common wealth, this is the duetie of a prince that
feareth God. That prince which doth this serueth God in trueth.</p>
            <p>24 Homer bringeth in Iupiter sitting in the middest of the
assemblie of gods,<note place="margin">The power of princes if they list to vse it vnto good purposes.</note> whom he menaceth and threateneth on this
wise: <hi>Let not any god or goddesse attempt the breache of my mandate. If I
vnderstand that any doe, I wil giue him small ioie of this place, or prouide
him another farre ynough hence, a dwelling place the gates whereof are yron,
and the ground brasse. I will plunge him as deepe vnder hel, as heauen is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
earth. He shall well knowe his might to be somewhat beneath mine. For
if ye thinke your selues to be stronger than I am, make triall of your strength,
fasten a chaine in heauen and ioyne all your force at the end thereof. But yee
shall neuer be able to pull Iupiter out of heauen, no though ye sweate much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it: whereas if I list to put but my finger to the haling of you, I wil pluck
vp sea and lande with you: So much am I superior vnto gods and men.</hi>
Kings and princes in their seuerall dominions haue such power,
through the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of almightie God, by whose appointment
they weare their crownes, that their ordinaunces bee not lightly
broken, vnlesse themselues be carelesse to haue them kept. For
by reason of the Maiestie that God hath giuen them, they are
feared of all estates and conditions of men. They can throwe
downe whom they wil; and whom they wil they can aduaunce.
They haue the chaine and the reine in their hands: they can draw
others whither they wil, but others are not able to drawe them
vnlesse they list. This power and strength and glorie which
GOD hath giuen vnto kings, and whereby they are able to
leade the worlde as it were in a string, leaueth them vtterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuse if they vse it not to the benefite of the common
wealth. They cannot serue God in trueth, and giue the bridle to
their subiects, to sinne without restraint. These times of greatest
and grauest consultation are fit occasions wherein Princes may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17219:24"/>
most effectually shewe howe heartily and truely they feare the
Lord.<note place="margin">Making of Lawes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

statutes and lawes to holde all men within compasse, and to binde
together the skattered parts of the common wealth. When the
great counsel of Rome entered into the Senate, to consult for the
good gouernment and defence of the Empire; first they went &amp;
sacrificed to Iupiter, and there euerie man offered vp and left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him his priuate affections: promising that their consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should onely tend to the common benefite. Leaue you all
priuate affections likewise; cast them behinde you, seeke not your

God, the Prince, and the common wealth require a faithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this seruice at your hands. Seeke by Lawe the syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
setting foorth, the maintenance and continuance of Gods
true religion. Let this be your first and principal care: and so shal

which neede redresse. For as diseases and sores in the basest and

vnlesse they bee cured betimes: so the least abuses, by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
may worke the greatest harme. Gorgeous apparel, and
sumptuous dyet, with such like matters, may seeme small things:
but they are the causes of no small euils. They eate vp England,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17219:25"/>
and are therefore to bee repressed by straite Lawes. It is a

But he himselfe is become very poore: in so much that, for want
of reliefe, he is forced to begge; and, for want of lodging and
meate, hee lieth and dieth in our streetes. This great ingratitude
God cannot but reuenge. Oh what shame is this to a Christian

our liues also: it requireth this at our handes, for our owne safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The prince will be but a steward hereof, seasonably to lay it

to giue their very liues for their countrie:<note place="margin">Val. lib. 5. cap. 6.</note> as Themistocles,

common wealth, as by pinching at a peece of monie, to pinche
it? He that seeth his house ruinous, and for sparing will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 4 The Church of God by a metaphor is many times in the
scriptures termed a vineyard: neither can there bee a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
in any thing,<note place="margin">Our vineyard hath florished The Church of God like a vineyarde, which must first be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; then plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fensed, to the ende it may flourish,</note> and that in diuerse respects. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it were more curious than profitable particularly to follow
the comparison, I wil onely remember vnto you the chiefe parts.
The vineyard that shall fructifie must fall into the hands of a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and laboursome husbandman, who first must weede it, stone
it and prepare it, then he must in season, and with cunning, plant
a good vine that will beare a pleasaunt grape in it, water, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop
and prune it, and lastly compasse it about with a ditche, a
strong wall, or a sure hedge for defence. Such a vineyard must
needes bring foorth good fruite. God of his goodnesse hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for this vineyard his church of England all these helpes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly,
he hath beautified it and furnished it most plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with rare and woonderfull blessings.</p>
            <p>5 He hath giuen it a skilfull ouerseer,<note place="margin">The Church of England blest with an ouerseer wise; and learned; religious; iust; peaceful; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the aforesaid due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein.</note> one indued with al gifts
and qualities fit for gouernement. <hi>An vnwise King destroyeth his
people:</hi> but where they that be in authoritie are men of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
there the Citie prospereth. <hi>Be wise therefore O ye Kings, be
learned ye Iudges of the earth,</hi> saith the Prophet. It pleased the Lord
greatlie that Solomon asked rather wisedome than riches, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
than honour: <hi>Giue vnto thy seruaunt, O Lord, an vnderstanding
heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 10.</note>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:17219:28"/>
how great is the goodnesse of almightie God to vs ward, which
hath so plentifully bestowed this gift of knowledge and wisdome
vpon our Soueraigne, not farre inferior to Mithridates for diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of languages, but farre surmounting al former English prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in learning, knowledge and vnderstanding? which rare and
excellent gift dwelleth not in her royall brest alone, but is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and accompanyed with sundrie other most singuler graces.
She is the verie patronesse of true religion, rightly termed <hi>The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the Faith:</hi> one that before all other things seeketh the
kingdome of God. If the threatenings of men could haue terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her, or their allurements entised her, or any craftie perswasions
haue preuailed, she had reuolted long ere this: so fiercely by great
Potentates her constancie hath beene assaulted. But God hath
strengthened his royall handmaide; the feare of God hath put to
flight the feare of men; her religious heart is accepted of the
Lord, and glorious it is also in the eyes of the worlde. A Prince
so zealous for Gods house, so firmely setled in his trueth; that she
hath constantly determined, and oftentimes vowed rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all torments, than one iot to relent in matter of religion. She
is not fraudulent and treacherous; but dealeth iustly and truely
in woord and deede with all men, promiseth and performeth.
Herein her Maiestie passeth all princes; and therefore in credite
she is farre before others. And her great desire is, that all men
placed in authoritie vnder her should deale truely, iudge rightly,
and giue to euery man his owne, according to iustice, matching
alwaies with iustice mercie: which two are so linked and coupled
together that they may not be seuered. Iustice without mercie is
too sharpe and rigorous: and mercie without iustice, is not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
but follie. That no Prince of this Realme, inclining so much
to mercie, did euer lesse hinder the course of Iustice than her
Highnesse hath doone, such as are placed in Iudiciall roumes
must needes confesse. So truely it may be saide,<note place="margin">Psal. 44.</note> 
               <hi>The scepter of thy
kingdome is a righteous scepter, thou louest iustice and hatest sinne.</hi> Of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a prince most mercifull, in iudgement vpright and iust. A
prince voide of all corruption, an hater of bribes, free in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in taking close handed, one that hath learned and doeth pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
our Sauiours lesson,<note place="margin">Acts 20.</note> 
               <hi>It is a more blessed thing to giue than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</hi>
A right Samuel, that cannot bee charged with indirect
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17219:29"/>
dealing. A prince milde as Moses, iust as Samuel, peacefull as
Solomon, zealous as Dauid. Neither speake I this in flatterie,
which thing be farre from me, but in an vpright conscience; not
of gesse, but of knowledge; not seeking my selfe, but the glorie
of God, that being put in minde of your happinesse, yee may
praise God for his mercie, and glorifie him in his gratious gifts.
Thus hath God blessed this vineyard his Church with a learned,
wise, religious, iust, vncorrupt, milde, mercifull, peacefull, and
zealous Prince to gouerne it. A great blessing, the Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
it, and make vs thankefull for it.</p>
            <p>6 This skilfull manurer of the vineyard must first ridde the
ground,<note place="margin">The vineyard of England purged of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</note> purge the Church. The barnefloore must be cleansed,
before the haruest be brought in. Ieremie commaundeth the
thornes first to be rooted out, and then the seede to bee cast into
the ground. Moses gaue charge to cast out all leauen, before the
people might celebrate the passeouer. Iosua willed the Cananites
to be expelled, ere he would establish his common wealth of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.
Iacob would not sacrifice vnto God, till he had purged his
house of Idols. The like might bee shewed in Dauid, Ezechias,
Nehemias, Mattathias. But one example may serue for all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Sauiour, who is aboue all, and Lord of all. Christ at
his first entrie into the temple, purged it by casting out buyers
and sellers. Our gratious Gouernor following Christs example
hath laboured most earnestly first to cleanse this ground and to
purge this church of England, hath caused the stones to bee pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out; brambles and breers to be pulled vp; all rubbidge, and
whatsoeuer was hurtfull to be remooued; the denne of theeues to
be dispersed, buyers and sellers of popish trash, Monkes, Fryers,
Massemongers with like miscreants to bee hurled and whipped
out; the stumbling stones of superstition, the baggage of mans
traditions, with all monuments of Idolatrie, vanitie, and poperie
to be cast out of the house of God and vineyard of the Lord: So
that the field of God is cleared, the vineyard cleansed, the church
purged, readie for the seede to be sowen, and the vine to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And all this without resistance or tumult. It was the worke
of God, it is maruellous to as many as duely consider it.</p>
            <p>7 Nowe it behooueth the vinitor to take great heede what
vine he planteth in this vineyard.<note place="margin">Christ planted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vineyard of England.</note> Thornes will not bring foorth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17219:29"/>
grapes, nor thistles figges. If thou sowe the giddie darnell of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
traditions, looke for like fruite: for he that conceiueth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
shall bring foorth winde. But our skilfull housholder, our
wise gouernor hath planted in this our vineyard neither thornes,
nor thistles; but the true vine Christ, growing in the heartes of
his elect. This vine hath beene diligently watered with the dewe
of Gods trueth syncerely preached; it hath beene cherished with
his sacraments, reuerently administred, according to his will; it
hath beene vnderpropped with the continuaunce of authoritie,
and defence of zealous Christian magistrates; pruned with the
two edged sword of Gods spirit, working by the ministerie of his
seruaunts, who with the sweete promises of the gospel haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp the drooping braunches ouerburthened with sinne, and
with the sharpe threatenings of the Lawe haue cut off the lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious
wilde boughes of wickednesse. No flocke better fed, no
people more instructed, no vineyard in the world more beautiful
or goodly to behold.</p>
            <p>8 This vineyard so prepared,<note place="margin">The vineyard fensed with Lawes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> this vine so planted, watered,
and vnderset, hath also beene strongly hedged, and fensed with
godlie Lawes of good discipline, to put backe all enemies, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all transgresiors, to bridle the vnrulie, and to keepe men in
order, that the church of God may liue in all peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
with all pietie and honestie. This is the flourishing vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
of the Lord; the beautifull arke of couenaunt, wherein are
reposed the treasures of God, the golden pot with Manna, the
rod of Aaron, and the tables of Moses. No church vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
more inriched with treasures and gifts of God; so that wee
may truely say,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> 
               <hi>We are inriched by him in all knowledge and in all speeche,
in so much that we are not destitute of any gift.</hi> The Lorde may iustly
say to vs, as to his people of olde,<note place="margin">Esay 5.</note> 
               <hi>What might I doe for my vine which
I haue not doone?</hi> and wee may well sing the song which the spirite
hath indited, euen of purpose as it seemeth for vs, <hi>Vinea nostra flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit,</hi>
Our vine hath flourished.</p>
            <p>9 And although the ground where this vine is planted,<note place="margin">The fruits of this vineyard many; one speciall, which is peace both spirituall and ciuill.</note> hath
beene very barren: yet hath it brought foorth many goodly and
pleasaunt grapes. The gospel hath chased away walking spirites,
it hath cast out diuels, banished much ignorance and blindnesse,
put horrible blasphemie in maner to flight, vtterly cleansed that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17219:30"/>
sinke the stewes, made vaine and filthie songs lesse currant than
they haue beene in former times, and caused sinne to bee more
shunned, although it be, God knoweth, too much stil frequented.
But one pleasaunt grape, especially the gospel, the worde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
hath brought foorth, and that is the sweete fruite of
peace; peace towards God, and peace amongest our selues. The
gospel preacheth Christ. Christ is our peace, and peacemaker.
He that hath Christ, hath peace with God: and hee that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in him hath him. By this meanes we haue peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
peace with God. The other peace is ciuill peace among
men. This is a pleasaunt fruite and a great blessing. Hee that

The God of peace hath doone this for vs, to our singular
commoditie and comfort he hath giuen peace in our daies, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
neuer so long tasted the like. Warre heretofore hath torne
this Realme in peeces: all Nations round about vs starue in the
field, tumble in warre, wallow in bloud expecting no end of their
troubles but vtter ruine and desolation. In the meane while we sit
safe vnder our vine, euerie man in peace may quietly followe his
vocation. God hath not dealt thus with all nations as hee hath
dealt with vs the least nation of all. It must be graunted, some
stormes haue beene stirred vp to disturbe this our happie rest. But
the prince of peace, and Lorde of our tranquillitie hath cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the waues of the sea, stilled the rage of the people, maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
preuented their wicked deuises, and confounded the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of them. There is neither power nor counsell against the
Lord. God taketh away the hearts of the enemies, and then as
fearefull Hares they flee at the wagging of euerie leafe: yea they
feare where there is nothing to be feared. For this great calme,
for this miraculous peace we haue to praise our God.</p>
            <p>10 This peace hath fructified and brought foorth his natural
fruite which is plentie.<note place="margin">The fruite of ciuil peace, plentie.</note> Warre is a locust deuouring all fruites;
peace as a sweete and pleasaunt dewe maketh all things fruitfull.
Peace hath made this Land flow like Canaan, with milke and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

Israel when he gaue them Canaan; but they were forgetfull of the

peace was turned into warre; their plentie into distresse; their

the seede of God doe not fructifie in our hearts; if the peace wee

if, with Israel, we lust after flesh, and despise Angels foode; if we
hunger after poperie, and thirst not after the water of life; if wee
fall away from God, and fall downe to creatures; if wee runne a

made a byword, and a woonder to the world; and, for a iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

this part, when we shall behold the great mercies of God
so plentifully powred vpon vs; howe hee hath regarded his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
blessed and inriched this his Church with so great gifts, and
so maruellous treasures, you see how truely we may say, <hi>Vinea no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra
floruit,</hi> Our vine hath flourished. This is the goodnes of God
towards vs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 13 Let vs nowe cast our eyes another way and see how men
haue dealt with the Lords vineyard. Great hath beene the fauor
of God towards it:<note place="margin">The vineyard deuoured by litle foxes. Why the Church ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med foxes, &amp; why litle.</note> and great also hath beene the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and the ingratitude of man, in labouring by all meanes to lay
it wast. These enemies of the vineyard are termed <hi>foxes;</hi> vnder
which name be comprised all heretikes, all Schismatikes, all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
Atheists, Epicures, Conspirators, Persecutors with all
the rable of the wicked. They are termed <hi>litle foxes,</hi> either for
that they are more rash, more wilfull, and more hurtfull to the
vineyard than the olde foxes because they shunne no peril; or else
they are so called, in contempt. For although they seeme migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
strong, and fierce; yet, when God shal arme himselfe against
them, then they wil appeare sillie weake cubbes, not able to kicke
against the pricke. There is no wilinesse, no force, no power, no
counsell against our God.<note place="margin">Iohn 18.</note> If Christ say <hi>It is I,</hi> all his enemies doe
stagger and fall flat to the ground. The litle cubbes perhaps are
animated by reason of their wilinesse, and because they know they
are many in number. It is true, <hi>The children of this worlde are wise in
their generation,</hi> subtile they are as serpents. But God confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the counsels of all craftie Achitophels, and taketh foxes in
the snares they set for others. The number is great, and as the
maner is of euil weedes, it groweth apace; they are tenne for one.
But one Dauid is worth not onely tenne but tenne thousand Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,
because he commeth in the name of the Lord. He that
fighteth vnder Christs banner, and is protected vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of the wings of the almightie, he is safe, be he in neuer so
great perils. Gedeon with three hundred crying, <hi>The sworde of the
Lorde and Gedeon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 7.</note> slewe and put to flight an infinite number, the
huge armie of the Madianites. It is all one with God to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with fewe, or many. So the enemies then of God, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church, they are but sillie weake cubbes; be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so wilie, neuer so many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:17219:31"/>
14 But the enemies of Gods vineyard are therefore chiefly
called foxes,<note place="margin">The Church enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble foxes in foure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. In rauening.</note> because they are of like condition vnto foxes, whom
they singularly resemble in foure peculiar properties. The foxe
is rauenous, greedie on his pray. And these cubbes, enemies to
the crosse of Christ, haue vnder pretense of long praier deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
widowes houses; spared no estate or conditon of men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled
Princes of their possessions; gotten to themselues the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and wealth of the whole worlde, with false merchaundise,
selling that for bread which is no bread, making their gaine of
masses, merites, pardons, and such like stuffe. Vnsatiable dogges
they are, euer barking and neuer satisfied. The olde gray foxe is
become the Lord of the whole earth, the king of kings; his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
Abbots and Bishops great Princes, and Lordes of whole
Countries; the litle foxes, as Monkes, Fryers, &amp; Massing priests,
what with singing, and what with begging haue raked no small
heapes together.</p>
            <p>15 Foxes doe feede on bloud,<note place="margin">In crueltie.</note> in desire whereof they kil more
than they can deuoure. Christ calleth Herod <hi>Foxe,</hi> partly for his
sauage and cruel murthering of Infants. What thousands of the
children and lambes of God these Herodians, these Romanists,
these rauening wolues, and bloudie foxes haue deuoured, looke
into the histories of all times, you shall woonder at it and abhorre
them. Doubtlesse the righteous bloud which they haue shed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth shall come vpon them, the bloud of the Saintes
whom they haue cruelly butchered crieth vnto the Lord against
them for reuenge, and the Lord wil heare it. <hi>Whomsoeuer thou shalt
see take delight in the bloud of persecution he is a Foxe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16 As they liuely resemble foxes in greedinesse and crueltie;<note place="margin">In wilinesse.</note>
so in wilinesse also they are like vnto them, craftie they are &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
as false as a foxe. The foxe will not woorry neere his bele, but
raungeth farre abroade, least he be espied. So these subtile decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
goe farre off; they compasse sea and land to make a proselite
of their owne profession; they shut themselues vp in their beles
in the day time; they dare not abide the light, but seeke lurking
holes and corners, disguising themselues in strange apparell, least
their woonted attire should bewray them; wilie foxes, deepe
dissemblers, double hearted, double tongued, double faced; spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them full faire whom they hate full deadly; promising, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17219:32"/>
not performing; shifting off, and seeking time; nowe humble as
sheepe, but when time serueth as fierce as Lyons. By subtile
slightes, and breache of faith, they brought Iohn Hus to the
Councel at Constance, and there cruelly murthered him; they
promised him a Safe-conduct to come and to goe, but those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Fathers agreed vpon a newe point of religion, that <hi>Promise is
not to be kept with heretikes,</hi> and so cruelly and treacherously consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with fire the Saint of God. These faithbreakers be no more
to be trusted than foxes.</p>
            <p>17 The last propertie that I note in the foxe is,<note place="margin">In casting an euil sauour.</note> that hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
an euil sauour. I will not remember vnto you, for offending
your chast eares, the horrible filthinesse wherewith those learned
Scribes, those holie fathers, those maiden priests, those foxes
were infected: the smell whereof ascended vp into heauen, and
cryed out for vengeaunce against them. Spirituall and corporall
whoredome for the most part go together. Who was more hoat
in the seruice of Baal than Iesabel that deuoute hypocrite? and
yet she was but a painted harlot. When Israel gaue themselues
to Idolatrie, they foorthwith fel vnto whoredome. Mens life and
religion are for the most part like; a sound faith, a sweete behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
men gather not figges of thornes; neither can their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conuersation be pure, whose inward perswasion is not good.
These are they that destroy the vines. Whereunto euen nowe
they haue prepared themselues; For this ende and purpose they
gather themselues together, they boldly haue their conuenticles,
they contriue treacherie, and deuise how to destroy the vineyard
and church of God. In the late euill times the professors of the
Gospel found no such libertie. But the saying of Christ is verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note>
               <hi>Foxes haue holes, but the sonne of man hath not where to hide his
head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18 Two especiall meanes they vse in seeking to destroie the
vineyard:<note place="margin">The meanes which they vse to destroy the Church, force &amp; fraud; force open, &amp; secret; open, by fier and sword.</note> force, and perswasion. Force of two sorts; open and
secret. Open force of persecution that cruell beast hath alwaies
practised from time to time. What prince hath hee not stirred
vp? what nation hath he not armed to persecute the professors of
true religion with fire and sword? The red bloudie dragon doeth
still vexe the woman with her childe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> Christ with his church.
The practise hereof all Nations haue felt, and Englande cannot
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17219:32"/>
forget. The late rebellion in this Realme raised for no other cause
but by force to subuert religion, by no other man than the father
of these foxes, is fresh in memorie.</p>
            <p>19 When by open force this beast cannot quench his thirst
with the bloud of his Saints,<note place="margin">Secret force; by trecheries, sorceries, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings.</note> then he practiseth by secret deuises.
Sometimes vnder pretense of mariage and faithfull affinitie, he
leadeth Princes blindefold to the house of slaughter; sometimes,
vnder colour of giuing aide to possesse kingdomes, he disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them both of their state and of their life; sometimes he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
league and confederacie with such as in heart he deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
thereby to stay their force, till he may fitly practise his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
mischiefe. When these practises will not serue, then they
sell themselues to satan as did Pope Syluester; they enter into an
execrable league with the diuell, and labour by incantation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration,
magicke, sorcerie, and witchcraft to consume kill and
destroie the Lords annointed by picturing, &amp;c. When inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
wil not serue, that no poysoned deuise be left vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they flie to poysonings, which practise of theirs hath taken
effect in diuers. Henrie the Emperour receiued poyson in sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
bread, Victor the Pope in sacramentall wine. Wherein
it is to bee noted by the way, that if they did offer the bodie and
bloud of Christ indeede, as they pretend to doe, they could not
mingle that sacred and glorified substance with poison. Of late
noble Dandelot with others, haue drunke of the like cuppe. So
these foxes conceiue mischiefe and bring foorth most monstrous
and cruel wickednesse; both by open violence and by secret trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.</p>
            <p>20 The other meane,<note place="margin">Their fraud, in perswading by arguments drawne from antiquitie.</note> whereby they labour to hinder the
course of the Gospel and to subuert religion is fraude, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
propertie of a foxe. This fraude is practised after sundrie
sorts. First they labour to seduce the simple by perswasion. Of
persuasion they haue sundrie kindes. As first the <hi>Antiquitie</hi> of
their religion, their fathers olde faith. But they should remember
that their religion is as newe as false; sixe hundred yeeres after
Christ vnknowne. The substance of our religion is most ancient,
&amp; shalbe most permanent, it was from the beginning, it shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
to the end, no iot nor title therof shal perish. In matter of
religion we may not followe our fathers, further than they haue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17219:33"/>
followed our Master Christ. We must thinke, not what others
haue said or doone before; but what he which is before all others
hath saide and doone. <hi>Heare him.</hi> The scripture hath giuen vs
warning to be warie in this point. God fed Israel with worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
and gaue them waters of gall to drinke,<note place="margin">Ier. 9.</note> because they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
after Baalims <hi>which their fathers taught them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>21 Another ground whereupon they builde their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">From the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of their Church and Pope.</note>
is the <hi>Authoritie of the Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which cannot
erre. There is a church of God, and a synagogue of Satan. The
Church of God is builded vpon the doctrine of the Apostles
and Prophets. The true church hath her markes whereby she is
knowne: The Gospel truely preached, The sacraments syncerely
ministred, discipline duely executed. The popish church hath
neither the true foundation nor yet the right marks of the church
of God;<note place="margin">Col. 1.</note> her foundation is <hi>Man,</hi> her markes are blasphemie, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
superstition. Christ is <hi>the head of his bodie the Church.</hi> This
head cannot erre: the head of the church Antichristian, is the
Pope that man of sinne, a lier, yea a verie father of lies.</p>
            <p>22 From these general perswasions they traine the people to
particulars,<note place="margin">Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of their sacrifice.</note> teaching many other shamefull things; but this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other, as most needefull to be held of all, that the masse
is a sacrifice auaileable for quicke and dead, strong and effectuall
to take away sinne, forcible in ridding soules out of Purgatorie
paines. But S. Paul teacheth that Christ was offered vp once to
take away all sinne; and by that one oblation, because it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
obteined the full deliuerie and redemption of his Church.
<hi>The bloud of Christ doeth cleanse vs from all sinne.</hi> Therefore we neede
not their aftercleansings, which in trueth are defilings. With
these and other like false and subtile perswasions they leade the
simple people to the pit of destruction.</p>
            <p>23 Or if they cannot preuaile by such perswasions,<note place="margin">From fained Prophecies.</note> they finde
out Prophecies and therewith fil the peoples eares: they haue the
bookes of Merlin and other phantasticall spirits, full of doubtfull
sayings, and deceitful dreames: of these they make such constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and expositions, as may serue their purpose, all tending to
this ende that alteration is neere, that the state will not continue,
that religion cannot endure long: such and such times when this
chaunge should be they haue presumed more than once to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17219:33"/>
But their times-master hath deceiued them, they
haue found him a lying spirite in the mouth of his Prophets.
This practise of Satan and of his impes hath brought sundrie
great persons and noble houses to confusion. Let their posteritie
take example and warning by them.</p>
            <p>24 They haue left no meanes vnattempted whereby the hearts
of the people might any way be seduced.<note place="margin">Their fraude in perswading by promises of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> Wherefore vnto other
their deceitfull practises they haue ioyned the offer of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
The Pope hath sent his proctors abroad to pardon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is alreadie past; so that men will nowe forsake the church
of Christ, and ioyne themselues vnto that harlot inseparablie
henceforward; which to doe they must take a solemne oath, and
in token thereof weare some marke of the beast, as a Crosse, an
<hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> a medall, or some such badge of recognisance. These
popish proctors haue poisoned many, and the obseruing of this
most wicked oth hath made many sillie soules, especially women
breake their faith to Christ, their loyaltie to their Prince, and
their promised obedience to their husbands. A wicked promise
is best vnmade, but being made is better broken than performed.
It had beene a lesse offence for Herod to breake his oath, than to
behead an Innocent. Wee may neither make, nor keepe any
promise,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> oath, or vowe against the Lorde. As for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Be reconciled vnto God.</hi> He it is which alone remitteth sinne:
and they onely which are reconciled to him, shalbe saued.</p>
            <p>25 But these destroiers and subuerters of the Lords vineyard
cease not thus.<note place="margin">Their strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reports.</note> Some credite they thinke to winne to their owne
cause if they can worke the discredit of such as are maintainers of
the contrarie. To this end they raise vp slanderous reports against
our magistrates &amp; ministers, that the people first misliking them
may afterwards be brought with more ease to mislike of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
wherof they are. This is an old practise of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enemie.
Daniel was charged to contemne the decree of Nabuchadnetzar;
Micheas to be a lier; Ieremie to be an enemie to the common
wealth; Elias to be a disturber of the state; Christ to be an enemie
vnto Cesar; Paul to be factious, &amp; seditious; the Christians in the
daies of Traian the Emperor to haue their women co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in their
night assemblies, to worship an Asses head in stead of God, with
many such like shamelesse reports. How these foxes haue falsely
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17219:34"/>
slaundered both magistrates and ministers of God in these our
daies, it shalbe needelesse here to recite. Their bookes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
as full of lies as lines. Thus you see howe they labour by all
meanes to hinder the passage of the Gospel, and vtterly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
true religion. We see also how the Lorde of hostes fighteth
for vs; how the almightie is our defence; how he that keepeth vs
slumbereth not; how strangely and miraculously hee preserueth
his annointed Dauid, both from the bloudy hands of Saul abroad
and Absolon at home, in the midst of so many conspiracies, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
snares and traps which these foxes haue deuised and laid.
We see how God preserueth his vineyard, how hee maintaineth
his church so many waies assaulted, maugre all his and all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
It is his onely worke maruellous in our eyes; it is the
Lord, let vs praise his name.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 26 But although God hitherto hath preserued his vineyard
from the spoile of these foxes;<note place="margin">The foxes must be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, To whom; by whom; Howe.</note> yet his wil, and commaundement
is, that we should not liue in securitie, but beware of them; watch
them, and catch them, if we can: <hi>Take vs the litle foxes.</hi> This last
and most necessarie part for order sake may be thus diuided. First
we learne, that foxes are to be taken; secondly, to whom; thirdly,

            <p>27 These foxes are to be taken.<note place="margin">Why foxes must be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> For so the spouse of Christ,
or rather Christ himselfe commandeth. And why? Because they
are hurtfull to his vineyard. God commaundeth false prophets
not onely to be taken, but also to die the death: <hi>Let the false Prophet
die.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 13.</note> Paul wisheth that the disturbers of the peace of the church

The scabbed sheepe must be remooued out of the flock,
the leper should be seuered, the adulterer cast out, the leauen put
away, foxes taken and tyed short. This is the wil of God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest

willeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert

his wil is that stonie hearts be turned into fleshie; that foxes be

friends; that strangers be made citizens with his Saints, that all
come vnto him, that all may find rest for their soules. He created
man for himselfe, for himselfe he redeemed him, his will is that
foxes be taken and brought to him, that he himselfe may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in them.</p>
            <p>29 But who should take them?<note place="margin">They must be taken by the friends of the bridegroome, ministers and magistrates.</note> The friendes of the spouse,
the seruaunts and officers of the bridegroome Christ. There be
two especiall seruaunts, whom the Lord hath appointed to hunt
for these cubbes; the magistrate, and the minister. These are to
ioyne their force together; to be as brethren Moses and Aaron,
knit in loue and liking, to giue all diligence and mutual endeuour
for the apprehension of these foxes. For why? the vineyard of
the Lord is set ouer to their ouersight, and gouernement. Kings
and Queenes should bee as Nurces, to tender and cherishe the
church of Christ, to keepe euerie noysome and hurtfull thing
from it. Ministers are they, whom God hath set to sweate and
labour in the vineyard; to gouerne and feede the flocke, which he
hath purchased with his owne bloud. These are the Lords two
hands; to both these he speaketh when hee saith, <hi>Take the foxes.</hi>
But all the craft is in the catching. Wee must therefore learne
how they are to be taken.</p>
            <p>30 The minister hath his nets to take withall,<note place="margin">The minister taketh them by doctrine.</note> the magistrate
hath his traps. The first is the net of Gods word to cast into the
sea for fishes, or to set vpon the land for foxes. Preach the word,
be instant in season and out of season.<note place="margin">Luke 3.</note> The Lawe of the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth
soules. With this net Iohn Baptist caught at one time a
great number of foxes, Scribes, Pharisies, Publicanes, souldiers
and sinners: they came confessing their sinnes, and asking, <hi>What
shall we doe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> Peter cast out this net and in one Sermon brought
three thousand vnto Christ.<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> With this net at Cesarea hee tooke
Cornelius the captaine with a great multitude. Paul by spreading
this net gate huge numbers in Asia, in Africa, in Europe, in all
parts and quarters of the world. Christ himselfe with this nette
tooke so many that they saide,<note place="margin">Iohn 12.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the whole worlde goeth after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17219:35"/>
him.</hi> Philip tooke the Eunuche in this net; in the same net Lidya,
Dionysius, Paulus Sergius was caught. Ambrose set this net for
Augustine &amp; tooke him in it. Verily if this net were diligently set,
it would catche these cubbes apace. For they erre, because they
knowe not the scriptures; and they cannot knowe, because they
are not taught. Woe therefore to the idle and Idol pastor, to the
dumme dogge, to the vnpreaching minister. For the bloud of
all these that perish for lacke of taking through his negligence
shall be required at his hands.</p>
            <p>31 The second net is godlie conuersation,<note place="margin">By example of life.</note> good example of
life. This net holdeth hard. Examples are a great deale stronger
than words, and the voice doeth not so fully instruct as the life.
Therefore Peter saith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Be a platforme for the flocke to followe.</hi> He that
liueth otherwise than he speaketh, teacheth God to punish him
saith S. Chrysostome.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> Paul termeth such teachers as are fertile
in speeche and barren in life tinckling cimbals. They send foorth
a sound and inwardly are hollowe. Christ did what hee taught.
His innocencie and patience chaunged the hearts of the verie
souldiers that put him to death. And as the godlie example of a
good life draweth many to Christ; so an euill life giueth great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
The bad demeanor of Helies sonnes caused men to loath
the offering of the Lorde. <hi>And you,</hi> saith Iacob to his two sonnes
Simeon and Leui,<note place="margin">Gen. 34.</note> 
               <hi>haue made me to bee abhorred among the inhabitants
of the Land.</hi> Let vs therefore haue our conuersation honest among
these men, that as now they speake euil of vs as euil doers, so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
they may by our good workes which they shall see glorifie
God in the day of visitation.<note place="margin">1. Pet 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>32 The third net to take these foxes in is discipline.<note place="margin">By Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> Where
the former nets faile, this will take hold; it helde that incestuous
Corinthian whom no other way could haue taken.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> Hereby Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
brought the Emperor Theodosius himselfe to vnfained hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
and heartie repentance. <hi>Doeth it not appertaine vnto pastorall
diligence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. de cor. ca. 8.</note> saith S. Augustine, <hi>with feare, yea, if they resist, with feeling
of stripes to recall to the fold of the Lord those sheepe when wee finde them,
which haue not beene violently caried away, but by faire and soft vsage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seduced haue gone astray and began to be held in possession of straungers?</hi>
Those wilfull cubbes which neither by teaching nor by example
will be reformed must feele the smart of the rod. We haue, saith
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17219:35"/>
Paul,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> 
               <hi>in a readinesse punishment against all disobedience.</hi> Such as will
not come to feede with Christ willingly must bee compelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wils. <hi>Constraine them to come in.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 14.</note> Thus the minister
should take these litle foxes and winne them vnto the Lord with
the net of Gods word of good example and of discipline. Now
if they cannot be so recalled that themselues perish not: they are
to be cut off or tyed vp that they destroie not others.</p>
            <p>33 The magistrate therefore must also set traps to catch these
foxes withall.<note place="margin">The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate taketh foxes by ciuil punishments.</note> The chiefe trap the magistrate hath is the Lawe.
Artaxerxes writeth his letter vnto Esdras whom hee sent to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
to see the people gouerned, and requireth him hoth to
place Magistrates and Iudges ouer the people, and to see that
they might liue according to the Lawes of God and the king, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereunto a sharpe commination against transgressors,<note place="margin">1. Esd. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
will not doe the Lawe of thy God and the kings Lawe, let him haue
iudgement without delay; whether it be vnto death, or to banishment, or to
confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</hi> The kindes of punishment
here set downe are foure, Death, Exile, Confiscation, Incarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
These lawfull meanes are wisely to be vsed of Christian
Magistrates; as traps to take these litle foxes.</p>
            <p>34 The first is death.<note place="margin">By death.</note> It is the Lords commaundement, <hi>Let
the false Prophet die, Let the adulterer and the adulteresse be put to death,
Let the blasphemer be stoned.</hi> Moses obserued this in destroying Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
and hanging vp them that committed whoredome. The
Magistrate beareth not the sword in vaine. Asa the good king of
Iuda gaue commaundement, that <hi>if any would not seeke the Lord God
of Israel he should die,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Par. 15.</note> 
               <hi>from the least to the greatest, from the man to the
woman.</hi> Thus zealous Magistrates haue indeuoured to take rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
foxes.</p>
            <p>35 Exile is also a punishment fit for foxes.<note place="margin">By exile.</note> Zerubabel and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua
together with the rest of the fathers of Israel agreed,<note place="margin">Ezra 4.</note> not to
suffer the enemies of their religion those wilie foxes to ioyne
with them, but banished them out of their companie. <hi>It is not
for vs and you to builde a house to our God.</hi> The Emperor Theodosius
likewise being mooued thereunto by that zealous Bishop Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochius,
draue all the Arrians out of his dominion. These
foxes must be remooued, the further the better. And it were wel
with Christs Church, if they were all, as farre as Rome hence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17219:36"/>
from whence many of them came who now wander and raunge
amongst vs. God spared not to expel Angels out of heauen, men
out of paradise.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14.</note> And when Absolon had put off the duetifull
minde of a naturall sonne, then Dauid laying aside the tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a louing father banished him his countrie.</p>
            <p>36 The third trappe to take withall is confiscation of goods,<note place="margin">By confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>
which way is the easiest and not the woorst. For the most men
loue Mammon better than God, their riches more than their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
When the riche man heard that hee and his wealth must
part he went away very sorowfull: If he from Christ, it is to bee
hoped these wil from Antichrist. There can bee no sharper pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to a worldlie minded man, than to be taken in this trap.
God therefore commaunded the Egyptians to be spoiled, than
which there could be no plague more grieuous vnto them, being
so greedily set vpon their gaine.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 13.</note> When the Philistims would
keepe the Iewes in good order, and disable them to rebell, they
tooke their weapons and instruments of warre from them. It is
no euill or vnlawfull policie to weaken these enemies which are
readie to vse the strength of their wealth to the ouerthrow of the
Church, if occasion did serue. Touche them by the purse; It is
the most easie and readie way, whereby to take and tame these
foxes.</p>
            <p>37 The last way set downe by wise Artaxerxes is Incarcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">By incarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note>
When Ioseph had cast his brethren in prison, then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
their fault and repented; then they thought, <hi>Wee suffer
these things deseruedly for the hardnesse of our heartes against our brother.</hi>
Manasses was neuer reclaimed vntil he was inclosed in prison.<note place="margin">2. Par. 33.</note> He
was miserable in his kingdome, and blessed in his captiuitie. Thus
it is the duetie aswel of the Magistrate as the Minister to obey the
commaundement of the almightie, and by all meanes to preuent
wicked enterprises; to roote out euill, and to seeke the safetie of
Gods vineyard his beloued Church. Which God graunt them
once effectually to doe for their owne discharge, and benefite of
the people so deerely redeemed by the bloud of Christ. To

good prince should procure peace, pietie, and honestie to the
people; a good people should liue peaceably godlily and honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnder their prince. The exhortation is, <hi>Pray for all men, especially
Princes and rulers.</hi> In this part we haue to consider what praier is;
To whom we should pray; What be the parts of praier; When,
where, and how we should pray; For whom we should pray.</p>
            <p>3 Praier is a lifting vp of the minde vnto God,<note place="margin">What praier is, and what parts it hath.</note> or a friendely
talking with the Lord, from an high and a kindled affection of the
heart. In the word God speaketh vnto vs, in praier we speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. Praier is the powring out of a contrite heart, with a sure
perswasion that God wil graunt our requests and giue eare to the
suites which we make vnto him. This praier must be onely vnto
God. It is praier vnto God that onely hath promise, that onely
hath example in the scriptures.<note place="margin">Psal. 49.</note>

he would giue vs whatsoeuer is necessarie for bodie or soule;
and, for as much as we cannot obteine any thing for our owne
merites, that he would graunt vs all things for his sonne our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours

            <p>5 Supplications, when we praie to be deliuered from euill;
as when we pray that the wrath of God,<note place="margin">Supplications.</note> which we haue deserued,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17219:37"/>
may through his mercie be remooued from vs as farre as the East

            <p>6 Intercessions are,<note place="margin">Intercessions.</note> when we praie for such as doe afflict and
wrong vs; for our enemies which persecute vs; that God would
forgiue them, turne their hearts, and better them. Or when wee
praie for others; either for remoouing of euill from them, or for
Gods fauour and blessing towards them.</p>
            <p>7 Thankesgiuings are when we praise,<note place="margin">Thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings.</note> and thanke God, for
the great mercies, graces, and gifts which wee haue receiued at
his hands.<note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> For we must acknowledge, that euery good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
gift commeth downe from aboue, from the father of lights,
and is by his mercie freely giuen. Praier generally may be diuided
into two parts; Petition, and Thankesgiuing: in the one we aske
of God, in the other wee offer vnto God; both are accepted as
sweete smelling sacrifices; pure, and through the merite of his
sonne, pleasaunt in his sight. I shall not neede to put you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
that we must praie both for our selues and others;
that there is a priuate, and a publike praier; that we must pray for
things perteining to saluation absolutely, and for things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to this life conditionally. These are matters wherewith yee
are throughly acquainted.</p>
            <p>8 The next thing to be considered in praier is when,<note place="margin">When, where, and how to praie.</note> where,
and how to praie. When? Alwaies, without ceasing. Where? In
all places,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5.</note> especially that place which being sanctified to this vse
is therefore called the house of praier.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> How? from the heart, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp pure and cleane hands; that is to say in faith, and in loue.
Our praier fethered with these two wings flyeth straight into
heauen.</p>
            <p>9 Thus we are by the Apostle willed to pray before all things
according to the commaundement of our Sauiour.<note place="margin">Praier before all things.</note> Seeke first
the kingdome of God. Let vs begin all our workes, our enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
our actions, our iourneies, our lying downe, our rising vp,
our eating, our drinking, and all our studies with praier. So our
bread shalbe multiplyed, our oyle encreased, our meate sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all our endeuours and actions blessed. If the very Ethnicks in
the beginning of their bookes first prayed vnto their gods, to
prosper and giue good successe to their labours; it were a shame
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17219:38"/>
for vs not to praie to our God before all things, knowing that the
praier of the iust is greatly auaileable before him. Praier is a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
vnto vs, a sacrifice to God and a scourge to Satan. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are infinite.<note place="margin">Exod 3.</note> Israel in praier groned vnto God, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
out of Egypt.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> Moses by praier so held God, that he could

The young men prayed in the burning fornace,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> and their prayer
tooke away the force of the fire. The scriptures are full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of all sorts: Kings, Prophets, Apostles, faithfull Christians
haue called vpon the Lord in the time of their troubles; hee hath
heard them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> graunted their requests, and deliuered them from
their distresses. Wherefore before all things the Apostle heere
exhorteth vs vnto praier.</p>
            <p>10 But for whom? First generally for all men;<note place="margin">For whom we must pray, and for whom not.</note> then specially
for kings, and them that are placed in authoritie. It seemeth
some were of opinion that praiers should be made onely for the
faithfull, for the brethren, for Christians, and not for Infidels.
Paul to meete with this vncharitable error saith, <hi>Let supplications
be made for all men.</hi> S Iohn in his Canonicall Epistle seemeth to
make exception against this generall doctrine,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 5.</note> 
               <hi>There is a sinne vnto
death I say not that thou shouldest praie for it.</hi> This is that sinne, which
Christ calleth sinne against the holy Ghost, which neuer shall be
remitted, and therefore is not to be praied for. But because it is
hard for vs to discerne who sinne vnto eternall death, Christian
charitie wil that we hope wel of all, and obserue the generall rule
to praie <hi>for all.</hi> There were secrets reuealed to the Apostles of
Christ, which are hidden from vs; they had the gift of prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and discerning of spirits, to foresee and knowe, which gifts
these times haue not.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> Paul rapt into the third heauen learned se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
not to be reuealed;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> hee knewe that Himenaeus and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
were reprobates.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> We may not so iudge of others. <hi>Who art
thou that iudgest an other mans seruaunt?</hi> In outward shewe after the
iudgement of man Paul being a violent persecuter of Christ sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto death, yet was hee the elect vessell and glorious instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. Christ is the propitiation for the sinnes of the
whole world, he wil haue all men to be saued and to come to the
knowledge of the trueth. We must therefore haue a charitable
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17219:38"/>
meaning towards all and pray for all as he hath died for all. Praie
euen for your enemies, for them that persecute and slander you;
<hi>Blesse them that curse you.</hi> Wish well to them that doe ill to you. For
God suffereth his raine to fall, and his light to shine both vpon
good and bad. Abraham praied for Abimeleck, Moses for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Samuel for Saul, Stephen for them that stoned him, and
Christ for them that cruelly put him to shamefull death. Let vs
imitate these holie paternes.</p>
            <p>11 As we should praie for all men;<note place="margin">Praier to be made especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for kings &amp; such as are in authoritie.</note> so chiefely for kings, and
such as are in authoritie, because they chiefly neede it. In Pauls
time the kings and rulers of the people were Ethnickes, tyrants,
enemies to Christ and cruel persecuters of the Gospel: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
some thought it not conuenient for the Church to pray for
them who sought to destroie it. S. Paul abateth this opinion,
teaching them that they should chiefly praie for such as for men
in greatest daunger and most needing the helpe of their praier.
Praie for him that praieth not for himselfe. The prophet Ieremie
requireth the Israelites to praie for the cruel persecutor of Gods
people Nabuchadnetzar.<note place="margin">Ier. 29.</note> For God in his mercie giueth good
princes,<note place="margin">Esay 3.</note> and in his ire he giueth <hi>wantons,</hi> as Esay saith; and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 34.</note>
as Iob writeth. Both euill and good are the ordinaunce of
God. We must praie for ill princes, because the kings heart is in
Gods hand; that he may turne their mindes, and staie their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
of euil make them good, and of strangers from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth of his Saints make them pillers and staies vnto the
Church. For good princes we ought heartily to praise the Lord,
for them especially to pray as the prophet did for Salomon,<note place="margin">Psal. 72.</note> 
               <hi>Giue
thy iudgements to the King O God, and thy righteousnesse to the Kings
Sonne.</hi> For it is the singular gift of God not onely to set vp right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
gouernement in the world, but also to cherishe and preserue
the same. Euen they whom he hath furnished with the spirite of
righteousnesse and of iudgement, are vnable furtherfoorth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
their charge than they be specially directed by the hande of
God, and assisted from heauen with all helpes necessary for their
calling. If the Christians did praie for the wealth and prosperitie
of those princes which bent all their force and power against the
kingdome of Christ, surely for such as are defenders of the faith
and zealous patrones of Gods people,<note place="margin">Tertul in apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget.</note> wee ought daily, and

a long life, a safe gouernementt, a sure dwelling, valiant souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
faithfull counsellers, a good people, a quiet world, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the hearts of men or kings doe desire. And let all such, as
wil not say <hi>Amen</hi> to those praiers, assure themselues that they are
neither duetifull Christians, nor faithfull subiects; but disloyall
contemners of Gods ordinance, and rebellious despisers of his

            <p>12 If any Church,<note place="margin">No nation more occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned than the English to praise the Lord for their prince.</note> any people, any nation in the world haue
cause to praise the Lord for their prince; this Lande hath more
than any, in respect of the wonderfull blessings wherewith God,
by the ministerie of his handmaide, hath enriched vs far beyond
all that we are possibly able to conceiue. Israell was well apaide
with the good gouernement of Debora, Iudith, and Hester. But
they thought themselues twise happie when God gaue them
Moses, Samuel, Dauid, Salomon, Iehosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias,
to gouerne them. England liked well and tooke it for no small
blessing of God when Henrie the first, H. the second, Edward
the first, Edward the third, Edward the fourth; H. the fift, H. the
sixt, H. the seuenth, H. the eight, Edward the sixt bare rule ouer
it. But did God euer blesse the throne of any man as hee hath
doone the royall seate of his annointed at this day? Hath the like
euer beene heard of in any nation to that which in ours is seene?
Our Debora hath mightily repressed the rebel Iaben; our Iudith
hath beheaded Holophernes, the sworne enemie of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
our Hester hath hanged vp that Haman, which sought to
bring both vs and our children into miserable seruitude. And if
we may compare with the ancients of Israel Moses was not more
milde, nor Samuel more iust, nor Dauid more faithful, nor Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
more peacefull, nor Iehosaphat more readie to assist his
neighbours, nor Ezechias more carefull for Gods cause, nor Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias
more zealous to restore syncere religion: If, yee make the
comparison betweene her owne predecessors, neither was Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
the first better learned, nor Henrie the second more easie to
forgiue and put vp iniuries, nor Ed. the first more chast, nor Ed.
the third more loath to accept of forrein dominion being offred,
nor Ed. the fourth more iust in yeelding all men their owne, nor
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17219:39"/>
H. the fift more happie, nor H. the sixt more holie, nor H. the
seuenth more prudent, nor H. the eight more valiant in quelling
the Pope, nor Ed. the sixt more syncerely affected towardes the
Gospel of Christ. Looke vpon other princes at this day; some are
drunken with the poisoned cup of that harlot, whose venome her
Highnesse doeth abhorre; some haue imbrued themselues in
bloud, wherewith her Maiestie did neuer yet staine the tip of her
finger; when they tumble in warre, shee sitteth in peace; when
they breake othes and couenaunts, she keepeth promise: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath blessed the worke of her handes; shee found this
Realme in warre, she hath established it in peace; she found it in
debt, which she hath discharged; she hath chaunged drosse into
siluer and golde; she hath, by liuing within compasse, and sparing
wastfull expences, without pressing the people, or seeking more
than ordinarie and vsuall tribute, furnished this Lande with so
great a Nauie, with such store of armour and warlike munition
both for defence and offence, as Englande neuer had in former
times. This I speake not of flatterie (it was neuer my fault) but
rather in synceritie testifying the trueth, that seeing your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
you may be thankefull; and considering the wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, ye may fall into that meditation of the Prophet, <hi>What
shall I render vnto the Lord?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 117.</note> 
               <hi>All his benefites are vpon me. I will receiue
the cup of saluation, and call vpon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vowes
vnto the Lord euen now in the presence of all his people.</hi> God hath loden
vs with all his benefites. Farre be it from vs that our vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
should bereaue vs of this felicitie. That we heare the sound
of bels, and not the thundering of gunnes; that our goods are
not spoiled, our houses rased, our landes extended, our bodies
imprisoned, our wiues and children murthered before our eies;
that mercie and trueth are met together; that righteousnesse and
peace haue kissed eche other; that in libertie of bodie, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of conscience we may assemble thus together in the house
of God, to make our praiers, to heare his word, to receiue these
holie and heauenlie mysteries, doe we thinke it a small or a light
or a common benefite? How should we requite the Lord? We
haue nothing in vs woorthie the name of recompence. All that
we can render or repaie for that which we haue receiued is before
we craue more to be mindefull and thankeful of that we haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17219:40"/>
alreadie, to take vp the cuppe of saluation, call vpon the
name of the Lord in the presence of all the people: let supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
praiers, intercessions, and giuing of thankes bee made for
Kings; this one paiment doeth aboundantly satisfie God for all
graces, benefites, and blessings, which by the meanes of good
Kings haue beene powred vpon vs.</p>
            <p>13 Neither let vs praie for our prince only, but also for al such
as God hath placed in authoritie vnder her.<note place="margin">All that are in authoritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prince must also be praied for; be they good or bad; be their authoritie Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall or Ciuill.</note> For euerie power
is of God, whether it be Ecclesiastical or Ciuil power. We must
praie for all those that be in authoritie be they good or bad; for
the continuance of the one, and the amendement of the other.
Our praier for Ecclesiasticall powers must bee, that GOD
would place ouer his people good guides, louing and wise sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
such as may carefully gouerne the flocke ouer which the
holie Ghost doeth make them ouerseers; such as Peter, that will
feede as much as in them lyeth; such as Paul, that will preache in
season and out of season, that wil soundly instruct, sharpely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue,
seuerely correct, and diligently guide; such as Iohn, that
feare not to reprooue kings to their faces; as Elias, which wil not
spare to punish transgressors; that the Church may bee deliuered
from such as Iudas, and Magus buyers and sellers; from false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
from sacrificing Balamites, from deuouring wolues, wilie
foxes, insatiable dogges, dumme curres, deceitfull workemen,
makers of diuision, Idol pastors, vnsauourie salt, such as make
their bellie their God, their preferrement their religion, lewdely
and worldly minded men. Our praier for them in whose handes
Ciuil gouernement lyeth must be, that, for as much as one is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to beare the burthen of a commonwealth alone; such, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the counsel of Iethro, may be chosen, as be Salomons
not Nabals; men of wisedome, and not dotterels; men of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
that can, and of courage that wil both wisely, and boldly
discharge their duetie; men like to Gedeon, and not to Pilate;
such as wil not feare the face of Caesar, when they should doe
right; men able mightily to put downe sinne, men that feare God
syncerely, being louers of the trueth, not secret fosterers of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition;
men that hate couetousnesse, and are not takers of
bribes to peruert iudgement; men like to Samuel, not the sonnes
of Samuel. Woe be to that people which is led with blinde
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17219:40"/>
guides, and woe be to that common wealth, which is ruled with
base, bad, and euil gouernours.</p>
            <p>14 Let vs therefore blesse God, if we haue good rulers, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
praie that we may reape the good fruite of them;<note place="margin">The reason why we pray for al men and for princes, putteth both princes and al other men in mind of their duties. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that they should studie to make the people liue in peace.</note> that is to say,

amongest vs. Doubtlesse they that so watche ouer the people
committed vnto their charge, shewe that they are neither coldly
affected towards God, nor vncharitably towards their people.
Dauid, Salomon, Iehosaphat, Asa, Ezechias, Iosias are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of God for good rulers: because they were religious &amp; feared
God. These louing the Lawe of the Lord themselues, laboured
by all meanes to make the people partakers also of the like loue.
These were in deede the Nurces of the Church, hauing the same
affection and kindehearted inclination, which the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
had towardes them of Thessalonica,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 2.</note> vnto whom he was not
onely content to giue the milke of the gospel of Christ, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that they might sucke euen bloud out of his brest, so it were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17219:41"/>
for their benefite. So deare and precious they were vnto him.
Such a nurce was Moses, which fed the people with the Lawe of
God, the foode of life, meate sweeter than honie or the honie
combe. Such a one Iehosaphat, in sending abroade preachers to
feede the people. Such a one Ezechias, in washing and cleansing
the Church from Idolatrie, Iosias in reforming the house of God,
Salomon in deposing euil priests and placing better, in labouring
by all meanes to inlarge the glorious kingdome of God. These
did the parts of good and faithfull nurces, and God did highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
their seruice.</p>
            <p>16 After pietie,<note place="margin">In honestie.</note> honestie and order must be sought. This is
attained vnto by seeing good Lawes both made and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
For the execution of the Lawe is the life of the Lawe,
and a Lawe not executed is but a dead Lawe. And here let rulers
first learne to obserue Lawes themselues, and so with greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and better countenance they may punish by Lawe the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
of the Lawe. For this cause S. Paul would haue a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
whose office it is to reprooue others, himselfe to bee vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueable.
Iudah gaue sentence against Thamar for her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie,<note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note>
               <hi>Bring her foorth and let her be burnt.</hi> But when he once vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode
it was his owne offence, the case was altered. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid was driuen to the like. Those magistrates doe both
wickedly and shamefully which prescribe a Lawe of honest life
vnto others, and keepe it not themselues. It is fowle thing when
he that punisheth is more woorthie punishment than the partie
punished. Paul himselfe being blamelesse executed discipline
with great authoritie vpon that lewde incestuous person. Samuel
a faultlesse magistrate was not afraide to cut off the head of Agag
the king with his owne handes.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.</note> Moses could not with that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
haue hanged vp those Gentlemen-fornicators, had not his
owne life that way beene without staine or blemish. When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
themselues be cleare, they may boldely punish others,
and see diligently to the straite execution of Lawes. For want
whereof it commeth to passe, that for the most part Lawes are
accounted like to cobwebs, which take small flies and hold them
fast, but suffer hornets to breake through. In execution of lawes
we may not respect the person of the riche or of the poore; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
feare nor pitie must remooue vs; that which is iust must take
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17219:41"/>
place in both. For if Lawes be not executed without respect of
person, if sinne be not seuerely repressed, if the people bee not
kept in order; it wil shake the state, all wil be in an vprore, no man
shall be master of his owne or in any safetie of his life, al iniquitie
will abound, all honestie will be exiled, and the magistrate shall
beare the sword in vaine. To neglect it, is to neglect that thing for
which this ordinance of God was first appointed. For if men
without these meanes might be kept in order, surely God would
neuer haue established gouernement to keepe them in order by
these meanes. Barbarous therefore, and wicked is the opinion of
the Anabaptists, which condemne all superioritie, authoritie,
and gouernement in the Church. For what is this else, but vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expell both out of Church and common wealth all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
all peace, all honestie?</p>
            <p>17 Nowe as magistrates and rulers should by good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
procure peace,<note place="margin">The duetie of the people vnder their Princes is to leade a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a godly, and an honest life.</note> promote religion, and preserue honestie
amongst men: so our Apostle requireth at the peoples handes,
that they vnder gouernement leade a peaceable, quiet, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
life. There is a double peace, the one outward; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
peace with men, and peace with God. With God there is
no peace, but in Christ. Through faith in him wee haue peace
with God, and not otherwise. He hath peace with God, whose
sinnes are remitted;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> for, <hi>Blessed are they whose iniquities are pardoned.</hi>
But our sinnes are remitted onely in the bloud of Christ Iesus,
<hi>his bloud doeth purge vs from all sinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 1.</note> Christ therefore is our onely
peacemaker with God. This is that peace which passeth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
He that wil enioie it must be careful to keepe a good
conscience.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Haue a good conscience; that when men speake euill of you, as
of ill doers, they may be ashamed.</hi> For if our owne heart condemne
vs, God is greater and wil more syncerely iudge vs. A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
maketh a strong faith. Many by loosing their hold of the
one haue made shipwracke of the other.</p>
            <p>18 The peaceable and quiet life,<note place="margin">What it is to liue peaceably</note> which S. Paul in this place
doeth chiefly require, is to haue outward peace with men. <hi>If it be
possible and as much as in you lies haue peace with all men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 12.</note> Yet not peace
with all men so, but that we may be alwaies readie for Gods cause
to sustaine the hatred of all men in the world. We may not for
peace sake flatter men in their sinne; for that is to be partakers of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17219:42"/>
euill. We must haue peace with all, if it may be, and so farre as
in vs lyeth, euer preferring a good conscience and a Christian
minde. For it may not be which may not be honestly. Followe
those things that belong vnto peace, but vnto godlie peace. For
our God is the God of true &amp; of good peace. He detesteth them
that sowe discord, yea the soule of the Lorde abhorreth them.
Doeg was hated of God for setting dissension betweene Saul and
Dauid; Achitophel likewise for stirring vp Absolon to striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his father. For as peacemakers are blessed; so cursed are all
disturbers of peace, all breeders and maintainers of sedition. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
peace we must ioine holinesse, true and religious worshipping
of God.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> So saith the Apostle, <hi>Followe peace and holinesse, without
which no man shall see the Lorde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lorde thy God,

in spirit and trueth, in inward holinesse, not in outward shew
of holinesse onely; in synceritie, and not in ceremonie alone; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne will and commaundement, not according
to the fancie or inuention of man.<note place="margin">Aug. de consen. Euang. lib. 1. cap 18.</note> 
               <hi>Euerie God,</hi> saith Socrates,

            </p>
            <p>19 This our seruing of God in the Church of God in true
holinesse consisteth chiefly in true and earnest praier vnto God;<note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall publike duties of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse are praier, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the sacraments.</note>
in diligent and duetifull hearing of his word; in faithfull and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
receiuing of his Sacraments. In praier we beg of God those
things which we wish and hope to receiue, and wee praise him
for things alreadie receiued. This is a sweete and an acceptable
sacrifice. The hearing of his word is also a seruice wherewith he
is pleased.</p>
            <p>20 And as praying and hearing;<note place="margin">Two sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the supper of the Lord.</note> so the woorthie receiuing of
his sacraments, is not onely a sealing of his grace vnto vs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a testifying of our godlinesse towards him. His sacrameuts are
two in number, instituted by Christ to be receiued of Christians:
By the one, which is Baptisme, we are receiued and incorporated
into the Church of Christ; by the other, which is the Eucharist
or Lords supper, wee are nourished and fed vnto life euerlasting.
These are pledges, and assurances of remission of sinnes and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
purchased by the death of Christ. These are Gods seales,
added vnto his most certaine promises, for the confirmation of
our weake faith, weake by reason of the infirmitie of our fleshe.

an inuisible grace: there is a visible sacramentall signe of breade
and wine; and there is the thing and matter signified, namely the
bodie and bloud of Christ: there is an earthly matter, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
matter. The outward sacramentall signe is common to all;
as well the bad, as the good. Iudas receiued the Lords bread; but
not that bread, which is the Lord to the faithfull receiuer. The
spirituall part, that which feedeth the soule onely the faithful doe
receiue. For he cannot be partaker of the bodie of Christ, which
is no member of Christs bodie. This foode offred vs at the Lords
table is to feede our soules withall; it is meate for the minde, and
not for the bellie. Our soules being spiritual can neither receiue,
nor digest that which is corporall, they feede only vpon spirituall
foode.<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> It is the spirituall eating that giueth life. <hi>The flesh</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>doeth nothing profite.</hi> We must lift vp our selues from these
externall and earthly signes, and like Eagles flie vp and sore aloft;
there to feede on Christ, which sitteth on the right hande of his
father, whom the heauens shall keepe vntill the latter day. From
thence and from no other Altar shall he come, in his natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to iudge both quicke and dead. His naturall bodie is locall,
for else it were not a naturall bodie; his bodie is there, therefore
not here: for a naturall bodie doth not occupie sundrie places at
once. Here we haue a sacrament, a signe, a memoriall, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration,
a representation, a figure effectuall of the bodie
and bloud of Christ. These termes the auncient Fathers, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,
Tertullian, S. Augustine, S. Ierome, S. Chrysostome doe
vse. Seeing then that Christ in his naturall bodie is absent from
hence; seeing he is risen, and is not here; seeing hee hath left the
worlde and is gone to his father; <hi>howe shall I,</hi> saith S. Augustine,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17219:43"/>
               <hi>laie holde on him which is absent? how shall I put my hand into heauen? Send
vp thy faith and thou hast taken hold. Why preparest thou thy teeth? Beleeue
and thou hast eaten.</hi> Thy teeth shall not doe him violence, neither
thy stomacke conteine his glorious bodie. Thy faith must reache
vp into heauen. By faith he is seene, by faith he is touched, by
faith he is digested. Spiritually by faith wee feede vpon Christ,
when wee stedfastly beleeue that his bodie was broken, and his
bloud shed for vs vpon the crosse; by which sacrifice, offered
once for all, as sufficient for all, our sinnes were freely remitted,
blotted out, and washed away. This is our heauenly bread, our
spirituall foode. This doth strengthen our soules, and cheere our
hearts. Sweeter it is vnto vs than honie, when we are certified by
this outward sacrament of the inward grace giuen vnto vs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
his death; when in him we are assured of remission of sins,
and eternall life. Better foode than this thy soule can neuer feede

            <p>32 Thus I haue briefly,<note place="margin">The visible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of bread &amp; wine are neither chaunged in substance by vertue of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration; and they should in administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be giuen both vnto all; not one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other vnto priest or people.</note> simply, and plainely vnfolded vnto

false collections, abusing the scriptures, dreaming euermore with
the grosse Capernaites of a carnall and a fleshly eating. Beholde
the one part of this sacrament consecrated is termed bread; the
other a cup by the Apostle himselfe, <hi>Because what they were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

deliuered to the Corinthians in both kindes. As Christ saith, so
saith Paul, <hi>Bibite ex hoc omnes,</hi> Drinke ye all of this. That the whole
sacrament should be receiued of the people, and no mutilation
permitted, the auncient writers are most cleare, as Ambrose, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,
Chrysostom, Gelasius, Cyprian, &amp;c. This sacrament is to
be receiued in remembrance of Christ crucified. <hi>As oft as yee shall

            <p>23 In what maner we ought to prepare our selues thereunto
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17219:43"/>
Paul teacheth saying, <hi>Let a man prooue himselfe, and so eate of that
bread and drinke of that cuppe.</hi> This condemneth Anabaptists, which
thinking themselues to be without sin communicate with none
but such as they thinke like to themselues.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> Euerie man shal beare
his owne burthen; It behooueth therefore euerie man to trie him
selfe and not other men.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Trie whether ye be in the faith or no.</hi> Faith
hath his fruites: It worketh repentaunce, it causeth sorowe for
sinnes committed, feare of sinning againe and hope of pardon. It
breedeth loue towards God, and loue towardes our brethren. If
incredulitie, if impenitencie, if hatred and malice haue possessed
thine heart, then abstaine from the Lords table; least with Iudas
thou receiue the Lords bread against the Lord, the foode of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
to thy condemnation. But if thou beleeue, repent thee
of thy sinne, purpose to liue a charitable and godlie life, if thou
be cloathed with the sweete garment of the sonne of God; then
sit thee downe at the table of the Lorde, and at the feast of the
lambe. For this is his feast, this is doone onely in remembraunce
of him this is the blessed Eucharist, a sacrament of praise and
thankesgiuing; as for al other godly benefites, so particularly and
principally for the death and passion of Iesus Christ Gods onelie
sonne and our onelie Sauiour.</p>
            <p>24 These dueties being thus performed vnto God,<note place="margin">Honest life &amp; conuersation amongst men.</note> wee must
also endeuour to liue and leade an honest life. Peace is a great
meane to procure pietie, and pietie should breede honestie in vs.

the daies are euil; denie impietie, and worldely lustes; liue
soberly, iustly, godlily in this present world; looking for that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Sauiour Iesus Christ. If we wil be Christs Disciples, let vs treade
in his footsteps. If we follow him here in peace, pietie, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,

Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">The Apostles vehemencie in exhorting to brotherly concord.</note> with a most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
spirit, and most earnest obtesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doeth here exhort the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
if there were any consolation in
Christ, any comfort of charitie, any
communion of the spirite, any bowels
of tender affections, or any compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of his ioie followe peace, vnitie, loue and brotherly concord;
remoouing withall the lets thereof; and shewing the meanes how
vnitie, loue and concord may be continued, and preserued. And
that his exhortation might be of greater authoritie, and so take
better effect; he setteth downe our Sauiour Christ as an example:
who is the God of vnitie and peace, the Lorde of loue, and the
liueliest patterne of all pietie, and sweetenesse of maners; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

therefore is iointly to laie them both before you: and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating

is this, <hi>Bee like minded, hauing the same loue, being of one accorde,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17219:44"/>
and of one iudgement. That nothing be doone through contention or vaine
glorie, but in meekenesse of minde euerie man esteeme other better than him
selfe. Looke not euerie man on his owne things, but euerie man also on the
things of other men.</hi> Vpon this exhortation followeth the example,
<hi>Let the same minde be in you that was in Christ Iesus.</hi> The exhortation
standeth vpon three parts. First he mooueth vnto vnitie saying,
<hi>Be ye like minded hauing the same loue,</hi> and this vnitie by way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
he diuideth into two members, Be of <hi>one accord</hi> and of
<hi>one iudgement.</hi> Of <hi>one iudgement,</hi> in matters of religion; and of <hi>one
accord</hi> in brotherly loue. In the second part he remooueth the
lets of this vnitie and concord saying, <hi>Let nothing be doone through
contention and vaine glorie.</hi> These are great hinderances to vnitie and
concord. Lastly he telleth the meanes whereby agreement and
loue may be vpholden &amp; maintained, saying, <hi>In meekenesse of minde
let euery man esteeme other better than himselfe: Looke not euery man to his
owne things, but euerie man also to the things of other men.</hi> Here hee set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
downe two preseruatiues and defences of vnitie and loue:
the one, <hi>in humblenesse of minde to thinke better of others than of our
selues;</hi> the other, <hi>not to looke vpon our owne things onely, but euerie man
also on the things of other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 The Apostle requireth of vs a double vnitie in <hi>Religion</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

touching the substance of religion wee all agree in one

be such dissent in matters of small importance, in rites and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
that by contention in such things the course of the
Gospel should be hindered, Christs aduersaries strengthened, and
his church offended. The ministerie cannot bee well executed
without her rites, which rites are left indifferent to euerie policie,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17219:45"/>
so that they be not disagreeing from the word, so that they tend
vnto edification, so that they be seemely and according to decent
order. Bee it graunted that some rites vpon some consideration
might be bettered or omitted: yet can I not say neither any man,
I suppose, can prooue that any thing is set downe to be obserued
in the Church, wicked or contrarie to the woord. And it were
scarse wisedome when as in many yeres a beautifull and a costlie
house is builded, if a windowe be set a litle awrie, or some small
like eye sore doe appeare, in respect thereof to disturbe the
whole house, to put it downe, and laie it flat with the ground. For
euerie change being so full of perill, surely these great alterations
vpon so light aduise, these newe common wealthes, howsoeuer
they be shadowed with the plausible name of reformation, yet in
seeking (for vndoubtedly this is sought and that by many) to
haue the patrimonie of the Church diuided, mangled, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
they threaten the vtter ouerthrowe of learning and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For take away liuing at which roote this axe especially
striketh, and ye take away learning; take away learning, and yee
ouerthrowe teaching; take away teaching, and what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

               <hi>Where there is no vision</hi> there the
people cannot choose but come to decaie. There is no state (no
not the state of a prince excepted to whom feare, honour, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and tribute is due) that may more rightly chalenge a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
and sufficient liuing than the minister of the word of God.
They seeme to haue put out the verie light of nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
which repine at the reasonable maintenance of them that
minister before the Lorde in these sanctified labours. For who
doeth plant a vineyard and doeth not eate of the fruite thereof?
or who feedeth a flocke and eateth not of the milke of the flock?
Marke how the scriptures both in the Lawe and in the Gospell
doe beate vpon this point. In the Lawe it is saide, <hi>Thou shalt not
mussle the mouth of the Oxe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> Doeth God take care for Oxen? No

how Gods portion should be pinched; howe the ministers of the
word should be contemned; howe iniuriously men in these last
vncharitable daies would seeke for the hauocke and spoile of the
Church: this mooued him in so large and ample sort to speake of
maintenance, and honour due to his ministers. If any man bee
slowe and rechelesse in dooing his office, if there bee any Idol-sheepeheard
that feedeth himselfe onely and not his flocke; let
him be reformed or remooued: But for the fault of a fewe, that
the whole state should be subuerted, and the patrimonie of the
church of Christ spoiled and deuoured, it were verie hard. No
prince, nor people, Christian or Heathen, could euer consent to
such a thing without sacrilege. Wel, as we are at vnitie in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

also we may agree and be as one; euen as becommeth the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Christ, which is a societie linked and knit together, not
sundered by diuision, and rent in peeces by varietie of opinions
and iudgements. To this vnitie Paul exhorteth, <hi>Be of one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

Where dissent in religion is, there can hardly be consent in loue.
Diuersitie of religion sundered the Iewe and Gentile, caused the
one to be an abhomination to the other. Wherefore hee that
came to bring religion into the world, came not to bring with it
peace, but a sword; a sworde to diuide asunder not onely king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and cities, but euen the man and the wife; the father and
the childe; a sword to cut off one brother from another. For
there can be no agreement betweene Christ and Beliall, the light
of the one and the others darkenesse: such as are not of one true
religion with vs, their profession may be friendshippe, but their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17219:46"/>
practise is deceit; they may with speeche and countenaunce flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and fawne, but they carie for the most part a malitious heart
set vpon mischiefe. Caine spake Abel faire ynough:<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> but for the

               <hi>Qui perfidi sunt in Deum, in Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pem

to God-ward are not syncere. They count trueth heresie; and,
No PROMISE TO BE KEPT WITH HERETIKES is their
posie. Children they are like to their father which is a murtherer
and lier from the beginning. But when we speake of loue and
charitie, we speake of the badge of Christianitie, of the vertues
of true Christians: who consenting in faith, bring foorth the
fruite of faith which is loue; without which, howe neere soeuer
we approche vnto Christ in word and in outward profession, we
are in deede none of his. He cannot agree with Christ that is at
discord with a Christian. God is so delighted with this affection,
that he professeth himselfe to hate them that are enemies of it,
yea <hi>the soule of the Lord abhorreth him that raiseth vp co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions amongst

field, the fowles of the aire, the fishes of the sea, and fruites of
the earth; euerie beast doth loue his like; to our shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche,
if hauing so many schoolemasters to teach vs one thing
we learne it not, especially being so necessarie as it is. For in loue
and concord our praiers are accepted in the sight of God, and

alone, but for others also, for whom we should trauell as for our

for equalitie or superioritie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> but euerie man content himselfe with
his owne calling. The members reioice and suffer together: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so should wee bee kindely affected eche to other, mourning
with them that mourne, and being glad with them that doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice.
That member which hath not this sympathie, this mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
suffering, this feeling of other mens hurts is dead and rotten.
<hi>Remember them</hi> saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that are in bonds, as though yee your
selues were bound with them, and them that are in affliction as if yee your
selues were afflicted in their bodies.</hi> The members are sundrie and
haue sundrie offices. For if all were an eye where were the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
If all did commaund which should obeie? Euen so in this
resembled bodie, and ciuil societie there must be diuersitie as of
members so of functions. The prince is as the head, without
whose discreete and wise gouernement the Lawes would cease,
and the people being not ruled by order of Lawes, ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
would soone followe, eche contending and striuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
other the end would be the vtter subuersion of all. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the word are as the eyes to watche, and not to winke or
sleepe, and as the mouth to speake, and not be dumme. For then
they performe not their allotted function. They are placed as
watchemen ouer the Church for the good and godlie direction
thereof to take heede both to themselues, and to all the flocke
whereof the holie Ghost hath made them ouerseers, to feede the
Church of God which he hath purchased with his owne bloud,
to warne the people of the enemie euer at hand alwaies readie to
assault, to teache and instruct the people of God in the waie of
their saluation, to tell them of their sinnes, to crie vnto them and
not to cease. The Iudges are as eares who should sit in open pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to heare the causes and complaints of the people, opening
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17219:47"/>
the one eare to the plaintife, and reseruing the other to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
answere. The nobilitie are as the shoulders and armes to
beare the burthen of the common wealth, to holde vp the head
and defend the bodie with might and force, with wise counsel and
good aduise. Men of lower degrees are set as inferior parts in the
bodie, painefully to trauel for the necessarie sustentation both of
themselues and others. All these members are so necessarie that
none can want without the ruine of the whole. For euerie one
hath need of other &amp; by the help of the other is maintained. This
necessary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction should cause the Prince to loue the people,
as Moses, which wished rather to be blotted out of the booke of
life than that they should perish; and as Dauid, which besought
the Lord to turne his wrathfull hand against him, and to spare
the people. It should cause such loue in the people towards the
Prince, as was both in the people of Israel towardes their Prince
and gouernour Iosua,<note place="margin">Iosua 1.</note> when they said, <hi>All that thou hast commanded
vs we will doe, and whithersoeuer thou sendest vs we will goe;</hi> and in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids
subiects towards him, when they stoode fast by him at such
time as he fled from his rebellious and vnnaturall sonne; not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
that he should aduenture himselfe in the field, but they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for him to beare the brunt and burthen of the battell, <hi>Thou

               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 18.</note> 
               <hi>thou art woorth tenne thousand of vs.</hi> This should cause
the pastor to loue his flocke as Paul did loue his brethren, <hi>I would
wish my selfe separated from Christ for my brethren;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> and againe, <hi>Our good

               <note place="margin">1. Thess. 2.</note> This should cause the
people to loue their pastor deerely, as the Galathians loued Paul,
to whom he giueth this testimonie,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I beare you record that if it had
beene possible; you would haue plucked out your owne eies and haue giuen
them to me.</hi> Finally this should cause all men to walke in loue euen
as Christ our example hath loued vs.</p>
            <p>8 It followeth, <hi>Let nothing be doone through contention or vainglorie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note>

After that S. Paul hath exhorted vs to loue and vnitie,
now he remooueth the lets and enemies of them. The breache
of all concord is contention, and the daughter of contention is
dissipation. Wherefore our God is not the God of contention,
but of peace; not of confusion, but of order: his Apostles are not
breeders of stirs and mutinies, they are messengers sent to make
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17219:48"/>
peace; to this they prouoke and exhort eueriewhere, <hi>I beseech you
let there be no contentions amongst you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Followe peace, Let no roote of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse
spring vp and trouble you.</hi> Where the man and the wife, the
parents and the children striue one against another, that house
needeth no forreine enemie to bring it to nought, it will bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
of it selfe. A kingdome, a citie diuided by contention,
how should it stand? All times and examples are our witnesses.
Contention betweene Roboam and Ieroboam brought the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Israel first to a diuision, and then to confusion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
betweene Simon, Iohn, and Eleazar, chiefe men in the
citie of Ierusalem, was the last and vtter destruction of that citie.
If counsellers emulate and contend amongst themselues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

needes teare the state of the common wealth in pieces. It was
great wisedome therefore in M. Aemilius and Fuluius Flaccus,
that being at enmitie, yet when they were chosen Censors of
Rome together, they ioined handes and buried all iniuries; least
through their contention, the state should come to ruine. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

               <hi>Let there be no strife I praie thee betweene thee and me, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

Adam to seeke to be wise as God? Absolon to striue for his

men.<note place="margin">Vainglorie hardly bridled.</note> This vanitie staineth our best and purest actions; Our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 12 Now the lets of vnitie, which are Contention and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie,<note place="margin">The first meane to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue vnitie is humblenes of minde.</note>
being remooued, S. Paul teacheth in the last place by
what meanes vnitie and concord may be preserued. Wherein he
setteth downe two strong preseruatiues. The first is, <hi>In humblenesse
of minde euerie man to esteeme others better than himselfe.</hi> To esteeme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
better than our selues, is a lesson hard to be learned, a lesson
which neuer can enter into the braine of a proude hearted man.
And therefore S. Paul requireth humblenesse of minde in him
that shall thus frame and fashion his iudgement: according to
that whereunto he exhorteth in an other place, <hi>Walke woorthie of
the vocation whereunto yee are called;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> 
               <hi>with all humblenesse of minde and
meekenesse, with long suffering, supporting one another through loue, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
to keepe the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> For vpon
whom shall the spirit of the Lord rest, but onely vpon them that
are humble and lowlie? To whom should he giue grace, but vnto
men of a meeke and gentle spirite? But there are sundrie sorts of
humilitie.</p>
            <p>13 There is an humilitie which is constrained,<note place="margin">Diuers kindes of humilitie.</note> an humilitie
perforce, such as that whereof the Prophet saith, <hi>The Lorde relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the meeke and humbleth the wicked to the ground.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 147.</note> Such are then
humble onely when God hath humbled them by afflicting them.
There is a counterfeite humilitie, such as was in Absolon, when
he stole away the peoples hearts from the king. For it is the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
maner of some to bowe downe themselues,<note place="margin">Eccle. 19.</note> and to looke most
demurely, when their inward parts are full of deceit, and their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17219:49"/>
heads most occupied about wicked purposes. Againe there is a
superstitious humilitie,<note place="margin">Col 2.</note> such as that was, <hi>Touch not, Tast not, Handle
not,</hi> touch not the chalice, tast not an egge in Lent, handle not
the bread that by consecration is made holie; which things had a
shewe of religious holinesse, but were in deede meere daliances
deuised by Satan to no other end but onely to noozle the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in their blindenesse. But true humilitie is the lowlinesse of a
pensiue and contrite heart.<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> This humilitie was in the Publicane,
which thought so basely of himselfe that he durst not lift vp his
eyes towards heauen: this humilitie was in Paul when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himselfe the <hi>least</hi> amongst the Apostles,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> and the <hi>chiefest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
sinners.</hi> A man of this disposition which thinkes so basely
of himselfe will easily esteeme others better than himselfe. But
what? Should a king then in dignitie, place and authoritie prefer
a meane artificer or a daylabourer before himselfe? or should a
wise man esteeme a naturall foole wiser than himselfe? No. Saint
Paul is no author of confusion, neither will hee in any wise haue
Gods good gifts debased. He descendeth not to these extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but onely perswadeth vs not to thinke so arrogantly of our
selues, as in respect of our selues to condemne others. Euery man
hath the minde of a king in himselfe. Goliah thought bigly of
himselfe, but of Dauid how basely? This selfeliking hath infected
and possessed all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>flesh.</p>
            <p>14 The way to redresse it is to looke vpon our selues and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others,<note place="margin">The way to redresse that ouerweening which we haue of our selues.</note> but not vpon both with the same eyes; vpon our selues
with the eyes of straite iudgement, vpon our neighbours with
a fauourable and a charitable eye. Whosoeuer therefore thou
art that despisest another, consider in thy selfe these two things.
First whatsoeuer thou hast that good is, it is of God the author of
al goodnes: &amp; as al that thou hast is from him, so to him thou dost
stand accountable for it. Thou art but a steward of his goods,
which will call thee to a strict &amp; a hard reckoning for euery mite.
If thou consider this thou shalt find small cause to boast and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of thy selfe, but shalt giue all glorie to the king of glorie. But
open thine other eye and looke downe to thy sinnes, there shalt
thou see an ouglie sight; thou shalt be forced to leaue off glorying
and to crie with the Prophet Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Mine iniquities are gone ouer my
head, and as a waightie burthen they are too heauie for me.</hi> Yea if thou
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17219:50"/>
rightly looke vpon thy sinnes, thou shalt see in that glasse Gods
face turned away from thee &amp; his eares shut vp against thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.<note place="margin">Esay 59.</note>
               <hi>Your iniquities,</hi> saith God, <hi>haue made a diuision betweene you &amp; me.</hi>
If thou truely enter into thy selfe and consider of thy sinne, thou
shalt say with the prodigall childe,<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Lord I am not woorthie to be called
thy sonne;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 5.</note> and with Peter, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a sinner;</hi> and with
Dauid,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.</note> 
               <hi>It is I that haue sinned, as for these sheepe what haue they doone?</hi>
Thou wilt thinke of others as Saul did say of Dauid,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art more
righteous than I.</hi> But the prince of darkenesse hath dimmed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
put out both these eyes; we can neither see our gifts that be
good to be of God, nor our sinne as we should to be of ourselues,
and therefore we esteeme most highly of our selues &amp; most vilely
of others. Which we would not doe if we did louingly and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
beholde with reuerence the graces &amp; gifts of God which
are in them. For who is there in whom some commendable
thing doeth not appeare? Lazarus seemed a contemptible thing
in the eyes of that riche glutton; yet was his patience to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the others riches. The Publicane seemed ougly and
odious to the Pharisee; yet his humblenesse was much more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
praise than the others supposed puritie and holinesse of life.
There is no man so base but a charitable eye may finde out in him
some good and pretious thing. And no man may be despised in
whom there is any appearance at all of that which is good. At
the least this we may see in all men, that they shewe the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of him which made them, they carie the image of him
by whom they were created; and in them which are our brethren,
how high soeuer we beare our heads, yet thus much wee may
consider more, that they are as dearely bought as wee, the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bloud of the sonne of God was shed for them as well as for
vs, we haue not a foot more than they in that eternal inheritance
which God hath prouided for his humble-minded children. If
these considerations doe not make vs to esteeme others better
than our selues, yet somewhat they will abate and take downe
that proude humor which causeth vs to lift vp our selues so much
aboue others. And as in looking vpon our brethren we must haue
one eye open to behold the graces of God which are in them, so
the other must be shut and closed vp that those things wherein
they are weake may bee hidden.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> For <hi>Charitie doeth couer sinnes.</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:17219:50"/>
There can be no charitie in that mans heart whose eies are fedde
with beholding the infirmities of his brethren. Sem and Iaphet
turned away their faces when they went to couer their fathers
nakednesse, for which charitable deede they receiued a blessing:
but Cham for looking vpon his fathers fall brought a curse vpon
himselfe and his posteritie. To teache vs that hee which looketh
vpon other mens faults with pleasure and delight, doeth well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
that other men should looke vpon his plagues without
compassion. S. Paul therefore would haue vs to bee fauourable
censurers of our brethren, readie to pardon scapes, <hi>Considering</hi>
saith he,<note place="margin">Gal 6.</note> 
               <hi>thy selfe least thou also be tempted.</hi> And it is a good meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Augustine prescribeth in these cases,<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> 
               <hi>Such wee were or
may be.</hi> Wherefore as Christ doth not onely couer our manifold
sinnes, but also forgiue as it were and quite forget them: So let
vs, like good and pitifull Surgions, hide the sores of our wounded
brethren from the winde. This the Lawe of charitie and loue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
and this neither taketh away the sword from the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
nor yet the rod from the minister, but that eche of them
seuerally according to the order of his vocation may punish
sinne as he must pitie sinners.</p>
            <p>15 The other preseruatiue of vnitie is,<note place="margin">The second meane to maintaine concord is care not onely for our selues but for others also.</note> 
               <hi>Not to looke vpon our
owne things onely, but euerie man vpon the things of others.</hi> These words
doe suffer a double exposition. They may bee referred to the
words before by way of preoccupation, as if he should say, <hi>You
thinke it hard to preferre others before your selues, but you may make it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
Looke not vpon your owne things, such as minister occasion of ouerwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but looke vpon the vertues, qualities and graces, that bee in others.</hi>
Another exposition is to make this a proper meane to keepe and
conserue vnitie, rather than a waie onely to diminish loftinesse
and pride: so that the words are to this effect, <hi>Without vnitie there
can be no Christianitie, and a chiefe meane to liue in vnitie is that men bee
not euerie one for himselfe, but eche carefull to doe good to other, that wee
seeke not greedily our owne commoditie and neglect the commoditie of our
brethren. Loue seeketh not her owne.</hi> But in these euill daies chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is growen so colde that euerie mans song is, <hi>I am neerest to my

more sufferable than the rest.<note place="margin">2. Chron. 28.</note> Achaz spoiled the temple of God

his brother Esau great gifts, that hee may passe quietly by him

complaineth of it, <hi>It is a hard case,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the poore must still

others with some part of liberalitie. But either they doe it to
auoide an euill name, and least they should bee noted for nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
or else they doe it when it is wrung out from them by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor

Another sort giue, not because they are but because they would
seeme to be bountifull and liberall, as the Pharisees which made a
trumpet to be blowne that men might knowe when they gaue

            <p>17 Our Apostles meaning is not that we should in this wise

the Christians. These zealous and woorthie Princes being neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched with those afflictions which others suffered for Gods
cause, studied for their safetie as for their owne. This they did for
strangers: what would they haue doone if their subiects had clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
succour at their handes? would they haue put their owne
sheepe in the mouthes of bloudie and rauening woolues, which
were so careful to deliuer a strange flock from the butchers knife?
As it is treason for the subiects to forsake their Prince, so for the
Prince to forsake his subiects it is a fault not sufferable. If Christ
made himselfe poore to inriche vs, if he humbled himselfe to the
death of the crosse for our deliuerance, when wee were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
held in captiuitie vnder sinne and death, shall wee spare our
paines, our purses, or our liues for the releeuing of our brethren
the afflicted members of Christ Iesus? It was a plaine lesson
which Mardocheus gaue Queene Hester, <hi>If she neglected the people

to stand with him against his enemies, to serue him both with
scepter and with sword, to bee patrones and defenders of all his
seruaunts. It is a glorious thing for a prince to fight as Dauid did
the Lords warres against the Philistims, to be in the fielde vnder
Christs banner. But to drawe in one yoke with Infidels, to bee
in league with Antichrist, it is both an impious and a base

when the one appointed Iosua and the other Salomon to raigne
after them. The prince that hath not a speciall and singular care
ouer his people, hath denied the faith, and is woorse than an
Infidell.</p>
            <p>19 Neither doeth this concerne the duetie of Princes onely,<note place="margin">It concerneth also counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, ministers, and generally all men.</note>
but of Counsellers also. Their care should bee greater for the
Prince and common wealth than for their owne commoditie. I
wil not remember vnto you Codrus and Decius, Curtius, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,

I wil not put you in minde of those two precepts set down
by Tullie out of Plato, the one of not seeking for priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the other of not leaning to one part and neglecting another
of the common wealth. I like not so wel to deale with prophane
things in this place; the word of God beeing so plentifull and of
great power to mooue the hearts of such as beleeue. In the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God Counsellers haue examples laide before them of
both sorts; as well such as haue referred all their counsels to their
owne priuate gaine, as also such as haue faithfully employed their

his pretious life for his beloued sheepe. To bee short this must

This short sentence consisteth partly of a petition, and partly of a
promise. For first he praieth to be taught of God, secondly hee
promiseth to walke in his trueth. In the former part are these
things chiefly to be considered, first a request to be taught, <hi>Teach

that dare boast of knowledge? If S. Paul after so long studie, and

doone his best, he must then begin againe, as if all which hath

beene doone alreadie were in comparison of perfection nothing.
It is too much arrogancie in that proude man who thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to haue all knowledge hid in the chest of his bosome, and all
trueth cheined to his tongue, so that hee can neither deceiue nor

Wherefore Iosua was commaunded not to laie aside the volume
of the Law at any time,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> night nor day. The prophet Dauid made
it his continuall studie. The wisest gouernours of Israel would
not enterprise any matter of weight til they had turned the leaues
of this booke, thence to take aduice for their better direction.
This most pretious iewel is to be preferred before all treasure. If
thou be hungrie, it is meate to satisfie thee; if thou be thirstie, it is
drinke to refresh thee; if thou be sicke, it is a present remedie; if
thou bee weake, it is a staffe to leane vnto; if thine enemie assault
thee, it is a swoord to fight withall; if thou be in darkenesse, it is
a lanterne to guide thy feete; if thou be doubtfull of the way, it is
a bright shining starre to direct thee; if thou be in displeasure with
God, it is the message of reconciliation; if thou studie to saue thy
soule, receiue the word ingrafted, for that is able to doe it: It is
the word of life. Whoso loueth saluation will loue this woord,
loue to reade it, loue to heare it; and such as wil neither reade nor
heare it; Christ saith plainely they are not of God. For the spouse
gladly heareth the voice of the bridegroome,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> and <hi>my sheepe heare
my voice,</hi> saith the prince of pastors.</p>
            <p>4 But the world seemeth to be glutted with the word,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by knowledge is attained.</note> there be
many stomackes that cannot digest it, and many that loath it. I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17219:53"/>
stand in feare that God in his iustice wil giue vs instead of plentie
of this bread a famine;<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> and for wholesome foode, meate that shal
rot betweene our teeth. There is not that desire in vs to knowe
the wisedome of Christ, which was in the Queene of Saba to
heare the wisedome of Salomon. There were of the Iewes no
small numbers that heard Christ three daies together in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
and that fasting: but he hath fed vs so full that wee care
not for him. The seruaunts of Salomon were thought happy that
they might stand daily to heare his wisedome. Happie it were
both for the seruants of Salomon &amp; for Salomon too: if but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Sabaoth they would heare him which is farre both greater and
wiser than Salomon. There is no want except it be of willingnes
onely: for both we haue leisure ynough to heare, and there are
store of them whom God hath verie well enabled to speake. No
time can be better spent, nothing more necessarie for a Christian
Court. What more princelike than to honour the prince of all
princes with that seruice, wherein he is so highly delighted? The
bellie is daily and daintily fed: O suffer not the soule to want that
foode which abideth for euer. They are not blessed that feede
and pamper the flesh,<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> they are that <hi>heare the word and keepe it.</hi> This
word attentiuely and carefully heard would conuert our soules,
correct our liues, soften our hearts, inflame our mindes with the
loue of God; it would roote out vice and ingraft vertue; banish
vaine and cherish good desires in vs; it would lay our sins before
our faces, humble our proude and hawtie lookes, bring vs vnto
true and heartie repentaunce, throwe vs downe with godlie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
and raise vs vp againe with heauenly comfort in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and mercies of Christ Iesus;<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> it would perfectly perfect vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>5 The Prophet,<note place="margin">Vnto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge praier is as needefull as meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> beeing inflamed with a desire of knowledge

by ioyning with continuall meditation earnest prayer, <hi>Teache me

that praying was as needefull altogether as reading; that if there
be any difference at all, it is this, By praying we profite more than
by reading.</p>
            <p>6 As he desireth to be taught, so it is especially to bee noted
that his desire is to be taught of God. Teache thou me, <hi>O Lorde.</hi>

It is he that hath the keie of Dauid, which openeth and no man
shutteth, shutteth and no man openeth. For the outward rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the word without the inward working of his spirite is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The precise Pharisees, the learned Scribes red the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ouer and ouer againe; they not onely red them in bookes,
but woore them on their garments; they were not onely taught,
but were able themselues to teache others. But because this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
teacher had not instructed them, their vnderstanding was
darkened, their knowledge was but vanitie, they were ignoraunt
altogether in that sauing trueth which the Prophet Dauid is so
desirous to learne. The mysteries of saluation were so hard to be
conceiued of the verie Apostles of Christ Iesus, that he is forced
many times sharpely to rebuke them for their dulnesse: which
vnlesse he himselfe had remooued by opening the eyes of their
mindes,<note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> they could neuer haue attained to the knowledge of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
in Christ Iesus.<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> The eares of that woman Lydia would
haue beene as close shut against the preaching of Paul as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if the finger of God had not touched and opened her heart.
As many as learne they are taught of God,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> and <hi>no man knoweth the

            </p>
            <p>7 Nowe although Christ onely openeth the booke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">Dangerous to looke for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by reuelations.</note>
giueth vnderstanding, and reuealeth vnto vs the wil of his
father; although the spirite onely bee the schoolemaster that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
guideth the heart in the way of trueth: yet may wee not
gape for reuelations as the Anabaptists doe, or thinke that God
hath reuealed vnto vs whatsoeuer wee doe vainely imagine and
conceiue in our braines. For as there is a spirite of truth: so there
is also a lying spirit. S. Iohn therefore giueth vs a caueat not to
credit euerie spirit,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.</note> 
               <hi>but to trie spirits whether they be of God or no.</hi> We
are to bee taught of God, yet by such meanes as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
The riche man beeing in torments craued reuelations

He spake in old time by Angels, by dreames, by visions, by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
But now in these latter daies he hath spoken by his sonne,<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note>
and he by his ministers.<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> He taught the Eunuch, but it was by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip;
he taught Cornelius,<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> but it was by Peter; he taught Paul, but

            <p>8 But howsoeuer,<note place="margin">The thing which the prophet desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to learne is the way of the Lord.</note> or by whomsoeuer we taught, the thing
which we must learne is the woord of God, not the decrees and

not lying legends, not amorous arts, not the daungerous
discourses of Politikes voide of the feare of God, denying &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing

by the words following, <hi>Thy waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9 This word WAIE by a translation or metaphor in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Idlenesse was the roote of all that filth in Sodoma. Israel in the
absence of Moses being idle, fell to feasting, dauncing, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
And therefore seeing that such as bee idle are subiect to so
many noysome temptations: S. Ieroms counsell is this, <hi>See thou
be alwaies dooing somewhat that the diuell may finde thee occupied: he that
is out of good exercise is easilie snared of the diuell.</hi> And idlenesse, saith
S. Bernard, <hi>is the mother of toyes</hi> (he might haue saide of vices) <hi>and
the stepdame of vertues.</hi> Amasis king of Egypt made prouision by
Lawe against idlenesse, once a yere calling euerie man to a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what he had gotten, and what he had spent. In this recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was neither the gaine of carding, dicing, vsurie, briberie,
cousinage nor extortion allowed. <hi>Let euerie man walke in that voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherewith God hath called him.</hi>

these vocations. Yet dare I not say, neither will I, that for anie
man, at any time, in any sort, to recreate himselfe with cardes or

that these exercises are occasions of much sinne. And when
they are so, it were no doubt much better to bee altogether idle
than so ill occupied. Wee must not plaie, but walke.</p>
            <p>11 And least in walking wee should wander out of the waie,<note place="margin">Our walking must be in trueth.</note>
the Prophet now teacheth vs wherein we should walke. <hi>In trueth.</hi>

            <p>12 S. Paul complaineth grieuously of some walkers.<note place="margin">Walking in heresie.</note> 
               <hi>Many

               <hi>They are enemies of the crosse of Christ.</hi> The crosse of
Christ is taken here for the passion of Christ, which suffered on
the crosse. Whoso offereth vp Christ againe once offered and
sacrificed for our sinnes, he is an enemie to the crosse of Christ.
To seeke remission of sinnes, redemption, iustification, satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or saluation elsewhere than in Christ crucified, is to bee an
enemie to the crosse of Christ, and to walke not in the high way
of trueth, but in the bypathes of wicked men.</p>
            <p>13 S. Paul noteth other bywalkers,<note place="margin">Walking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the flesh.</note> which walk according to
the flesh. In this byway walked the Sodomites, the Beniamites,
yea and Dauid sometimes himselfe.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> This was the bypath of the
riche glutton, which fed daintily day by day, whose God was his
bellie, he serued no other Lord. In this byway walke all wantons,
flatterers, lyers, enuious persons, stirrers of strife, makers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision,
sectaries and such like. The ende also of this way is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

This path is haunted of all sortes of men, priests,
prophets themselues,<note place="margin">Ezech. 33.</note> and prophets children, yea kings haue
beene subiect to this fault. They are most miserable which take
this way. They enioie no quietnesse, they tire out themselues

they grieue the spirit, their toile and vexation hath neither ende
nor measure. The prophet therefore beggeth at the handes of

No enchauntment bee it neuer so wise can haue any force vpon

            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:17219:56"/>
16 Dauid complaineth of such walkers as are led by the
counsell of the wicked,<note place="margin">Walking in the counsel of the wicked.</note> as Eue by the serpent, Absolon by Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,
Saul by Doeg,<note place="margin">Psal. 1.</note> Roboam by a traine of lewde companions
rash heads. The waie of all these vngodlie ones shall perish.</p>
            <p>17 There is also another kinde of inordinate walkers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of by the Apostle,<note place="margin">Walking with the tongue.</note> which worke not at all, but vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of zeale and religion,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 3.</note> forsake all labour, and occupie their
heads wholy with searching and sifting other mens dooings, their
tongues onely with barking against such as God hath placed in
authoritie, their eares, with nothing but listening after straunge
and newe reports. These are spreaders of brutes, brochers of
newes, informers of men how the world shall wagge. They are
still beating and forging out newe plots of common wealths, and
vndermining the olde. They are one of the woorst kinds of men
that liue. The vnbridled malapertnesse of such men the prophet
Dauid seemeth to touch when he saith,<note place="margin">Psal 73.</note> 
               <hi>The tongue of them walketh
throughout the earth.</hi> They make no difference of any person high
or lowe, they stay no where. Dauid though a king, Paul though
an Apostle, Christ though the sonne of the liuing God, escaped
not the reach of these venimous creatures. Such walking tongues
would be tyed short. If men cannot bridle them, yet of this wee
are sure, that <hi>Slaundering and lying lippes the Lord will destroie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18 Ieremie complaineth also of certaine walkers,<note place="margin">Walking in trecherie.</note> whom he

               <note place="margin">1. Thess. 4.</note> 
               <hi>But,</hi> as S. Paul faith, <hi>What should I say

more? Time would be too short if I should</hi> remember vnto you all the
bywaies wherein the wicked doe walke.</p>
            <p>19 The prophet Dauid seemeth to bee much grieued at the
great swarmes of bad walkers in his daies.<note place="margin">The prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euill men y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause why euill wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Clergie.</note> 
               <hi>The wicked,</hi> saith hee,
<hi>doe walke on euerie side.</hi> And he yeeldeth the reason, <hi>Because they are
exalted.</hi> When bad men are placed in great roumes, when the
base are exalted and lifted vp into places of authoritie, then the
bounds of wickednesse are inlarged,<note place="margin">Psal. 12.</note> and sinne going on without
controlement gathereth strength. Christ therefore requireth
carefull choise of ministers in his church, his desire is to haue
them faithfull and wise. Paul would place none but such as were
well testified to be blamelesse in life, and apt to teach with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
doctrine. The admitters of ministers are too lauish in our
daies, they haue litle regard or care whom they take; S. Pauls les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>Lay not hands on any man rashly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> is forgotten. The preferrers
vnto liuings are no lesse faultie, they choose of the woorst, they
respect no abilitie but of the purse. What numbers are there pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
this day in the church,<note place="margin">2. Mac. 4.</note> as Iason and Menelaus were placed by
Antiochus in the priests office, not for learning, but for monie;
not for desert, but for reward? It goeth ful hardly with the church
of God when Balam is the Bishop, Iudas the Patrone, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
the Minister. This merchaundise wil make the house of God
a denne of theeues. No one thing this day more necessarie to be
reformed in the church of God.</p>
            <p>20 It were happie if the temporall policie were faultlesse in

such men as are chosen to beare office in the common wealth,
The Prince, as Iethro saide truely, cannot beare the burthen of

officers as eyes to see withall, eares to heare withall, tongues
to speake withall, hands to worke withall, shoulders to beare vp
the burthen withall, and legges also to walke withall. If the eies
bee blinded or looke asquint, if the eares be deafe or hard of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
if the tongue cannot speake or else doe stammer, if the hands
be nummed, the shoulders weakened, and the legges lamed, it
must needes make a lamentable bodie and a monstrous common
wealth. For such guides, such people. If officers bee ill chosen,
men of small wit and lesse wisedome, weake hearted and feeble
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17219:57"/>
handed, men not religious but popish, not fauourers but haters
of the Gospell, louers not of truth but of themselues, partially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
corruptly minded, such as bee mates with theeues, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of spoiles with extortioners, maintainers of euil men and of
euill matters, hauing their share with malefactors, pretending
iustice and dooing manifest wrong, not haters of couetousnesse
but takers of bribes, lingering out causes that are brought before
them in hope of commoditie, dispatching no matter but for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
such as are not ashamed to suck profite with Vespasian from
the homeliest things, such as would sell their verie soules for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
such as will not sticke if nothing else may be had to cut off e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the coates of men by the skirtes, if such bee exalted is it
maruell if the wicked doe walke on euerie side? King Dauid was
so carefull of this that hee would not suffer a wicked person, a
backebiter, an hawtie hearted man, a subtile deceiuer, a flatterer
or a lyer to remaine in his Court. Constantius would not suffer a
dissembler in religion, a seruer of times, a nullifidian, an Atheist,
an Idolater to be about him. For so it hath beene alwaies and so
it will be, when the vile are in credite wicked men will holde vp
their heads, they will band themselues in companies, all corners
will be pestered with them.</p>
            <p>21 Wherefore it greatly behooueth them that are in highest
authoritie to beare a watchefull eye ouer those which deale in
causes of importance vnder them,<note place="margin">Church-rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers vnder the name of Church-visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> that such bywalkers bee not
countenanced with authoritie as they are that trot from one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse
to another prying into Churches. The pretense is refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but the practise is deformation. They reforme not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
but for monie graunt licences still to offend. These Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyers
are spoilers of the patrimonie of Christ.<note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> When Moses
tooke vpon him to builde the arke of God, the princes and the

I shall most humbly beseeche our most milde Moses the
Queenes Maiestie, and that in the bloud and bowels of Iesus
Christ, as her Highnesse tendereth the glorie of God and the
continuance of learning and religion, and her owne saluation, to
make proclamation not to the arke-builders, but vnto these
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17219:57"/>
church-robbers to staie their hands. Truely <hi>Sufficit.</hi> It is ynough.
For there is no more to be had, except, as the prophet speaketh,
they wil <hi>put their verie skinnes off their-backes.</hi> Woe be to that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth where they are made ouerseers and examiners of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens waies, whose owne footsteps are vneuen. May not the
wicked be bold to walke on euerie side when so vile persons doe
beare such sway?</p>
            <p>22 But the way wherein the prophet promiseth to walke is
<hi>trueth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to talke of trueth; we must walke in it.</note> I will walke in thy <hi>trueth:</hi> I will embrace it with my heart,
I will frame my life after it, I will professe it syncerely and be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for it. I will not be a knower but a doer of thy Lawe. They
which know it and doe it not, deserue not praise but stripes. For
Christianitie doeth not consist in lowde and shrill crying, <hi>Lord
Lord,</hi> but in dooing the wil of our heauenly father. This toucheth
vs very neere, which content our selues with the bare profession
of the name of Christ, as if it were sufficient to make a flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
shewe as trees doe which are faire to the eye but fruitelesse.
The Gospel of Christ hath beene long taught amongst vs, wee
haue long heard it, the sound hath filled our eares, but whose
heart hath it pierced? whose life hath it bettered? Sinne is sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reprooued; yet iniquitie doth still abound. Wee haue often
promised with the prophet saying, <hi>We will walke in trueth,</hi> but wee
neuer set forward. Towards God we are hypocrites, towards men
deceitfull, double faced, double tongued, double hearted. Where
should one finde a faithfull man? It is to vs that the prophet Esay
speaketh,<note place="margin">Esay 48.</note> 
               <hi>Heare this O house of Iacob, which are called by the name of
Israel, and are come out of the waters of Iuda, which sweare by the name of
the Lord and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in trueth, not in
righteousnesse.</hi> We are verie counterfeites, we vse religion but for
a policie and for a cloake; we talke, we heare, wee pray, wee fast;
but what trueth, what synceritie is there in our dooings? Wee
would seeme to seeke reformation in religion; the pretense is
good, many things may be bettered, and we ought to striue vnto
better things; but God graunt that we haue not a meaning rather
to part the garments of Christ amongst vs. We will seeme to be
carefull of ciuill reformation, and to desire that all abuses in the
common wealth may bee redrest. But our intent is in deede to
make our gaine by corrupt and partiall execution of penall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17219:58"/>
our purpose is onely to benefite our selues by pinching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and by impouerishing many to inriche a fewe. Thus the
world is full of bywayes; and they are many that walke corruptly.
Yea we haue all declined, euerie one hath stept aside; from the
sole of the foote to the crowne of the head there is no soundnes.
Prince and people, and priest and prophet, all haue straied from
the way of trueth, though not all alike.</p>
            <p>23 Let vs therefore returne from the pathes of iniquitie,<note place="margin">This dutie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto all, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to such as are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause what way they take in the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will treade after them.</note> let
vs inquire after the good waie that wee may walke in it. Let vs
not make courtesie who shall begin, but striue rather euerie man
to be first; the pastor, because he hath the greatest skil; the prince,
because he hath the highest roume, the people, because they are
most in number. If the pastor goe before, the sheepe will be the
readier to followe after; if the fountaines bee sweete, the riuers
that flowe from them will not be sowre; if there be darkenesse in
the hils, there will bee more in the valleies, if those that should
giue light vnto others be turned into darkenesse, how great shall
the darkenesse of others be? Examples haue a meruelous force to
leade men. The whole world is led as they haue others especially
their superiors for examples. And therefore you that be chiefest
in authoritie should by reason be foremost in the waie of trueth.
Walke in what way you wil, you are sure to haue followers. Iosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
walked in the straite waie to heauen, and the people followed;
Ieroboam in the broade waie, and the people were caried after in
heapes. If you liue in securitie carelesse for Gods matters, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
for the causes of the common wealth, carefull to feede vpon
pleasures and fancies, carefull to passe ouer your owne times in
ease and quietnesse, the people will easily take after your, your
townes and cities will soone be made like to that secure and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
citie of Lais. If ye will haue the people of the Land watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
you your selues must not slumber. If you make light of the
word of God, the people will learne by your example to despise
it; if you embrace the truth, they also wil loue it. You my Lords,
you whom God hath placed before, you must goe before: for
Gods loue striue no longer, take your places and goe on that the
people of God being guided by you as by lights may follow after
in the way of trueth. It is a monstrous thing to see the basest liues
in the highest roumes. Your conuersation must be a glasse for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17219:58"/>
to looke into. Others shall aunswere for their owne faults,
but you for your owne faults, and for others, who through your
example are faultie. To conclude, let vs all so walke as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the children of the light; let it suffice that in times past wee
haue walked according to the vanitie of the Gentiles; let vs now
returne vnto the Lord; let vs cast away impietie and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,
and liue a sober, a righteous, and a godlie life; let vs
with true repentance craue pardon and mercie at the handes of
God, and hereafter walke humbly before him, not for a day, or
for a moneth, or a Lent season, but continually all the daies of
our pilgrimage vpon earth. He onely shall be saued that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
walking in trueth to the ende. God for his mercie sake let fall
plentifully the drops and dewe of his heauenly grace vpon the hil
of Hermon, and the mountaines of Sion, to the fruitefull wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the whole Land of Israel. Teach vs, O Lorde, euen our

Men for commoditie can transforme themselues into

            <p>10 Which practise the Familie of loue hath lately drawne

that men neede not openly be of any religion whereby they may
endanger themselues: that it is good Christiandome to lie, sweare
&amp; forsweare, to say and vnsay to any sauing such as be of the same
Familie, with whom they must only vse al plainnes &amp; keep their
mysteries secret from all others to themselues. These men may
doe any thing to auoide affliction, and they haue scripture for
that purpose:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Your bodies are the temples of the holie Ghost:</hi> you may

Christ with this poesie, <hi>Fili da mihi cor tuum &amp; sufficit;</hi> Sonne, giue
me thy heart and it sufficeth. Whether his Holinesse did meane
thereby to allowe dissimulation or no, I will not define. His pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
are mysticall, and his broode is so throughly framed in this
way, that they seeme to take the Popes embleme in no other
meaning. They halt on both sides, they serue all times, and turne
with all windes. By professing all religions, they shew themselues
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17219:61"/>
plainly to be of none. They haue double hearts, one heart for the
Prince, another for the Pope; one for Christ, and an other for
Baal; one for a Communion, and an other for a Masse. These dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
wolues put vpon themselues sheepes skins, to deceiue
withall. Now are they milde and gentle, flattering and promising
all loyaltie to the prince, conformitie to gouernement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to religion. But if the times should turne, they would turne
off the sheepes coate and play the wolfe in his right kinde. They
would shewe their rauenous nature by their cruell deedes; then
would they fil their bellies with that, after which they now thirst;
they would finde swift feete to shed the bloud of innocents. From
the mouth of the Lyon O Lord deliuer vs. This sort of people our
Apostle calleth double hearted.</p>
            <p>12 Herode was a double hearted man,<note place="margin">Such a one Herod, Caine, Ioab, Absolon, Matth. 2.</note> who calling the wise
men to him, bad them goe and searche out Christ, returne and
bring him word, that he also might goe and worship him. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to kill whom he pretended to worship. Iudas was like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note>
he kissed and betraied.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> Cains minde was as double, when
he spake faire vnto his brother, entised him into the fielde, and
there villanously murthered him. Ioab dealt euen so with Amasa
and Abner,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 2.</note> whom vnder pretense of friendship traiterously hee
slewe. Absolon inuited his brother Ammon to a feast, and in the
midst thereof sodainely bereaued him of his life.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>13 These double hearts died not with these men;<note place="margin">Such are all they towards God who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the truth in word and in life denie the power of it; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes men, they which fawne vpon them whom in heart they abhorre.</note> they liue stil
in their posteritie. With Herode all men pretend to woorship
Christ, but most part also with Herode in trueth, in heart, in life
kill him, and trample vnder their feete the pretious bloud of his
Testament. Whom wee professe in woord wee denie in deede,
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in doctrine we follow him in life we forsake. Thus in double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with Iudas we flatter, we dissemble, we courtesie, we kisse:
but the inward heart is full of malice and treason. Faithful friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
hath taken his flight away, <hi>There is no trueth in the earth.</hi> We
speake them full faire whom we hate full deadly. Whom we kisse
we can sell to death for a peece of monie. Iudges can talke of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and for monie peruert iudgement. For monie the vineyard
of the Lorde is laide wast by them who professe themselues the
keeepers of it. By them for monie the flocke of Christ is scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and left to the wolfe to bee deuoured. For monie an Idoll is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17219:61"/>
made a pastor: Iudas selleth, Magus buyeth, &amp; a thiefe by a thiefe
is placed. Beware of these double harted men. Cain is a murtherer
speake he neuer so faire. If Absolon feast thee, yet feare least thou
finde sowre sawce to thy sweete meate. The bond of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
is not of strength sufficient to retaine these double hearts.
Take heede of Ioab howsoeuer hee fawne: for hee carieth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
a bigge and hawtie minde. It is death to him that any
should be in credite or direct Dauid besides himselfe. Hee must
doe all alone. His outward speech is faire, but his inward thought
is ful of hatred, enuie and wrath.</p>
            <p>14 Such as the fountaine is such is the riuer that runneth
from it.<note place="margin">Double min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men are also common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double tongued.</note> A double heart maketh a double tongue. They which
thinke deceitfully speake deceitfully, and flatter with their lippes.
The Disciples of the Pharisees and the Herodians as they had
double hearts,<note place="margin">Psal. 12.</note> so had they double tongues. Before Christs face
they could say,<note place="margin">Matth 22.</note> 
               <hi>Master we knowe that thou art true, and teachest the
waie of God truely, neither carest for any man, nor respectest the person of

               <note place="margin">Luc. 7.</note> But behinde his backe they termed him <hi>a seducer, a companion

Whom they praise excessiuely being present, of him their
maner is being out of sight to speake most slanderously and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
So vnlike they are to our Sauiour Christ, who would not
praise Iohn to Iohns Disciples, but after their departure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him to the people. It is Saint Augustines iudgement,
<hi>that the hand of no persecuter is more grieuous than is the tongue of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.</hi>

               <hi>Your iniquities haue made a separation betweene me and you.</hi> To
sinne is to depart and fall away from God: The more wee sinne,
the faster and farther we flie from him. Iudas sinned deepely and
deadly: hauing sinned he could not abide the presence of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
whom he had betraied: but went out and vnrecouerably
fell away. The prodigall childe being loosely giuen, waxed wearie
of his fathers vertuous house, raunged abroade, fell to follie, fed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17219:62"/>
on filthinesse, and bathed himselfe in all loathsome sinne: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
touched with Gods hand, he repented and drew neere. What
should I name this or that man which hath gone astray? It is most
true that the Prophet saith, <hi>We haue all erred &amp; gone astray like sheepe.</hi>

in the face of the world: but his inward man is poisoned with
sinne. Of men hee is commended and reuerenced: but his false

before thy hands can be washed to any purpose. For as all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
riseth from the heart, and so pulluteth the hands: so must first
thy heart be purified and that will make all cleane. <hi>If thine eye bee
right all thy bodie will be cleare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 11.</note> saith our Sauiour. The stomacke well

saide that he was righteous; but he looked onely vpon his hands,
and did not see into his prowde and malitious heart. The penitent
Publicane wisely knocked vpon his heart; for there laie the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.
Euerie sinne breedeth in the heart, from thence it hath his

            <p>29 Pride polluteth mans heart.<note place="margin">It must be purged of pride.</note> This venome poisoned the
heart of the great Angell of God; of Adam the most perfect man
of God; of Nabuchodonozar the great and mightie Emperor; of
Ozias the king. <hi>Their hearts were lifted vp,</hi> and therefore GOD
threwe them downe. <hi>Pride is the first and greatest sinne:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with chiefest care to bee shunned. This hidden poison can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee smothered, it will burst foorth into the outward parts. It
will appeare in thy countenance, in thy pace, and in thy apparel.
Monstrous attire doeth shewe a monstrous minde. A minsing
tripping pace,<note place="margin">Esay 3.</note> as the prophet doth note, argueth a prowde and
an vnstable heart. A loftie countenance, a stretched out necke,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17219:64"/>
and a wandering eye are the pictures of an hawtie and a wanton
minde. <hi>Vnchast lookes are tokens of vnchast thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30 S. Paul hath made mention of three great and pestilent
infections of the hart.<note place="margin">It must be kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with surfets.</note> The first is banquetting and drunkennesse.
<hi>Beware your hearts bee not ouercharged with surfetting and drunkennesse.</hi>
Meate and drinke are ordained for man, and not man for them:
wee should eate to liue, and not liue to eate.<note place="margin">Luc. 21.</note> Nature is content
with litle, and by much the health is empaired. A full bellie dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the senses: and the more wine the lesse wit. The iudgement
of Plato is, that he which filleth his bellie twise a day shall neuer
prooue but a sot. Too much drinke laide Noa naked, and made
him ridiculous to his owne sonne.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Drunkennesse is a fawning diuell, a
sweete poison, a pleasaunt sinne: which whosoeuer hath, wanteth himselfe;
and whosoeuer committeth, doeth not commit sinne; but is altogether very
sinne it selfe.</hi> Let not your hearts therefore be oppressed and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with surfetting nor with drunkennesse.</p>
            <p>31 Another poison of the heart is chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.<note place="margin">From cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonnesse.</note>
The former breedeth the latter. And, <hi>Where fulnesse is there
filth raigneth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieron. sup. ep. ad Tim.</note> These are commonly linked together; and where
the one is neere, the other is not farre off. Ezechiel the prophet
addeth an other cause of this vice, and that is idlenesse. A ful bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and an idle bodie make an vnchast heart. Dauid taking an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoones
vacation, and walking idle in his gallerie, fell shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
away from his former puritie and dangerously from GOD.
Idlenesse and riotousnesse are the fewell of vncleannesse, which
S. Ierome considering breaketh out into these words, <hi>O infernall
furie; the matter whereof, is gluttonie; pride, the flame; the sparkes, lewde
words; the smoke, infamie; the ashes, impuritie; the last ende, hell miserie.</hi>
Our bodies are made vnto sanctification and not to fornication:
let vs vse them to that end to which they were created, that wee
may bring them to that ioiefull ende of eternall blessednesse.</p>
            <p>32 The third bane of the heart is emulation and contention.<note place="margin">From emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note>
               <hi>Let nothing be doone through contention and vaineglorie.</hi> Pride causeth
emulation, and of emulation commeth strife: so that the cursed
generation of vice is fruitfull. Pride made the diuelish Angel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
that his Lord and God should be aboue him: it made Adam
desire to be as full of knowledge as his creator: Absolon to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
his father and to thirst after his kingdome. Caesar was so
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17219:64"/>
prowde that hee could not abide a superior: Pompey could not
beare an equall.<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> Corah, Dathan and Abiram in the pride of their
hearts sought to displace Moses and Aaron, the chiefe magistrate
and the chiefe minister. They set downe a handsome platforme of
equalitie, and many of the multitude allowed of it as well pleased
with a popular estate; where the worst of them might be as good
as the best. But GOD brought their deuise and themselues to
nought. This emulation is euer contentious, and contention
bringeth dissipation.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> A kingdome diuided will not endure. <hi>Our
God is the God of peace and not of contention.</hi> In peace then wee shall
haue safetie, and be followers of our God. Wee ought therefore
to bee milde and quiet like sheepe: and not contentious and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
like dogges.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Whilest one of you doth bite another, take heede ye bee
not deuoured one of another.</hi> Therefore let euerie man bee content
with his owne estate. For God hath ordeined distinct estates,
and by his prouidence men are placed in them. Pride, surfetting
and drunkennesse, chambering and wantonnesse, emulation and
contention are infections of the heart and dangerously defile the
same: we must purge our hearts of them.</p>
            <p>33 Thus if we with a simple eie behold our hands,<note place="margin">Our harts and hands are not purged but by Christ.</note> and take a
viewe of our soules, we shall easilie espie fowle fingers and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hearts. We are bid by our Apostle to wash the one and purge
the other: but this is not in the abilitie of sinnefull man, it is the
worke of our gratious God. Christ is the onely Phisitian to heale
this our disease. Onely God remitteth and easeth vs of our sinne.
Therefore our defiled hands and depraued heartes can not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be washed and made cleane but onely with the bloud of that
immaculate Lambe.<note place="margin">1. Iohn 1.</note> For so the scripture witnesseth, <hi>The bloud of
Iesus Christ doth make vs cleane from all sinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> 
               <hi>If hee wash vs wee shall bee
whiter than snowe.</hi> Otherwise our filthie sinne will sticke to vs for
euer. And thus we see that euil must be taken away from al parts,
both inward and outward; our hands must bee cleansed, and our
hearts purged. This is the first part of our repentaunce.</p>
            <p>34 But this will neuer be doone,<note place="margin">Christ doeth not ease vs of the burthen of sinne vnlesse he see vs mourne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</note> vnlesse wee conceiue vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and heartie sorowe for sinne. Wherefore it followeth in the
woords of the Apostle, <hi>Be afflicted, be sorie and weepe, let your laughter
be turned into mourning, and your ioie into heauinesse. It is heard,</hi> saith the
Apostle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and that for certaintie, that there is forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17219:65"/>
among you and such fornication as is not once named among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
And ye are puffed vp and haue not rather sorowed.</hi> They shewed
as he thought litle token of antent to cleanse themselues who
sawe such filth and laughed at it. If wee haue purpose indeede to
drawe neere vnto the Lorde, our hearts must bee resolued into
teares, and our hands washt in the water of our eyes. Haue wee
sinned with Dauid? Let vs crie <hi>Peccaui</hi> with as grieued an heart as
Dauid did.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> Haue we denied Christ with Peter, not with our lips,
but in our liues?<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> Let vs then weepe for it with Peter bitterly. Haue
we in transgressing followed the wanton steps of Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene?<note place="margin">Luc. 7.</note>
Let vs followe her steps also in powring out teares plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
for our offences. Haue wee wandered, and gone astray
with the prodigall childe? Let vs with him likewise turne into
our selues, and behold our defiled soules; let vs with him returne
home at the length with a contrite heart, bursting out into that
confession full of sorowe,<note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Father I haue sinned against heauen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 51.</note> 
               <hi>A bruised and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
Repent you therefore of your sinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 3.</note> saith Peter, <hi>that your sinnes may bee
doone away.</hi> Let your teares shewe that ye doe repent, and let your
liues declare that ye are conuerted. <hi>When euils past are bewailed, and
things bewailed are not committed againe, this,</hi> saith Ambrose, <hi>is to
repent. It is a vaine repentance which is by and by sullied againe by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing.
Teares auaile nothing if we fall afresh into our sinnes. It is boote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to aske pardon for euill deedes, and when we haue doone to doe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
This is plaine, <hi>The dogge to his vomite, and the swine to his mire.</hi>
Let vs therefore wholy cast away all impietie and worldly concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence:
let vs change this idle, vaine, wanton, and prophane
life, with sober, righteous, and godlie behauiour. Let your laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be turned into mourning, and your ioie into heauinesse. For
our God seeth all our thoughts, he heareth all our words, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
all our workes. There is no wantonnesse nor wickednesse
but our God, who doth hate it, seeth it (the Lorde bee mercifull
vnto vs) yea our iust God, who will iudge vs according vnto our
deedes seeth it. O Lord be mercifull vnto vs. O Lorde who shall
stand in that most dreadful daie? Lord graunt vs true repentance,
that forsaking our selues and detesting our sinnes, we may flie so
vnto thy mercie that we may tast of thy tender compassions, and
not receiue according to thy iustice and our most sinnefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17219:65"/>
               <hi>Enter not Lord into iudgement with thy seruants.</hi> O let vs at the
length wash our hands and purge our hearts. Let vs mourne and
bewaile our sins: that so being cleane we may approch and come
neere vnto our God.</p>
            <p>35 The onely thing which hindereth and keepeth vs backe
from this,<note place="margin">We must be humbled and thrown down.</note> is that ouerweening which wee haue of our selues.
Whereby it commeth to passe, that when we should be sorowful
we are puft vp. The Apostle therefore to meete with this fault,
and remooue this let addeth, <hi>Cast downe your selues: Humble your
selues in the sight of God. The countrie which we seeke for is on high, but
the way is belowe that leadeth vnto it. He that seeketh the one must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
the other.</hi> The Publicane humbling himselfe before GOD,
drewe neere vnto him and was receiued. To whom hath God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard?
on whom doth he looke?<note place="margin">Esay 66.</note> to whom is he neere? <hi>Euen vnto
him that is poore and of a contrite spirit, add that trembleth at my woordes,</hi>
saith the Lord. Manasses notwithstanding his idolatrous sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
yet by humilitie drewe neere vnto God and found his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
mercie. And all that are, or shall be his, must learne of him
to be milde, as he is milde: to humble themselues vnto Christes
mercie, who humbled himselfe vnto mans crueltie.</p>
            <p>36 What hath man wherein of right he can boast himselfe,<note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vs why we shold not cary hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowlie mindes.</note>
or whereof he may be prowde? It is God who hath giuen vs those
good gifts which we haue, wee haue them not of our selues, and
he hath giuen them vs not to pride our selues in them, and so to
make them ill; but humbly to be thankefull for them, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of them well to his glorie, knowing and remembring that
we must straitely reckon for them. <hi>Render an account</hi> will one daie
be a fearefull speeche. For why? doth thy nobilitie, power and
authoritie lift vp thy minde? <hi>These are giuen thee from aboue. By me
kings raigne,</hi>

               <hi>by me Princes beare rule. There is no power but of God.</hi> He
that setteth vp can likewise cast downe. Nay, <hi>Hee hath cast downe
the mightie from their seate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and hath exalted the humble and meeke.</hi> And
what he hath doone once, he can doe againe. The highest place
is not the sweetest nor the safest place: much authoritie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred
with many cares. Such as haue entred into a great charge must
enter into a great account. And greater cause haue they to feare
their reckoning; than to bee prowde of their ruling. The more
that God hath lift thee vp the more thou oughtest to humble thy
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17219:66"/>
selfe before him least hee eternally cast thee downe.</p>
            <p>37 A Christian heart must be an humble heart:<note place="margin">The cause of our loftinesse is the want of looking into our selues.</note> and the way
to humble our selues is to knowe our selues. For if wee did looke
vpon our blacke feete, our faire Peacocke fethers no doubt would
soone fall downe. If we did cast our eyes vpon our fowle handes
and polluted hearts; if we did sift our selues, and search our soules,
and see how ouglie we had made our selues in the sight of God;
hauing blotted out his gratious image in vs, and cloathed our
selues with the maculate coate of sinne, the rewarde whereof is
that eternall death of hell: this sight would terrifie vs; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
would pull downe our hawtinesse, and cause vs to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and vtterly denie our selues, and flie onely vnto Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Our cheerefull countenance would be changed into an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie;
our mirth, into sighing; our pastime into praier. It would
make our sorowfull heartes to water our wanton eies with bitter
teares. It would cast downe our bigge and high lookes flat vpon
the earth; and turne our curled frisled writhen haire into a baser
vse, euen into a towell to wipe the feete of Christ withall. In the
steade of monstrous apparell we would put on sackecloth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes:

               <hi>Miserable man that I am who shall deliuer

This humilitie would cause vs to drawe neere vnto him; If wee

doth growe to the seeker. If I should particularly prosecute this
distribution, and followe it at large as euerie part shall minister
occasion of speeche, I should bee too long for this place. But I
minde breuitie, because I knowe before whom I speake. Fewe
woords will be sufficient for the wise, and to a minde well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
alreadie, a short putting in minde will serue. If I chaunce to
say what other men haue saide before me (for what can bee saide
which hath not beene saide before?) I must beseeche you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the words of the blessed Apostle S. Paul which was not
ashamed to tell euen his owne tale twise. <hi>To write vnto you the same

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2 God preferreth obedience before sacrifice. He accounteth
it better to obey than to offer. For as all vice is contaiued in the
name of disobedience,<note place="margin">God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs to seeke him.</note> because that onely is naught which God
misliketh, and that which he misliketh hee hath forbidden: So I
may be bold to say with S. Augustine, that <hi>There is no vertue but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

               <note place="margin">Luc. 7.</note> If therefore the Centurions souldiers obediently
went, came, and did what he commaunded; if the Israelites were

God doth bid vs goe we may not stand still. And that which his

            <p>3 But least that the maiestie of him which commaundeth
should rather astonish men than set them forwarde to seeke the

Not entising men with faire and sweete words only, but powring
his benefites also plentifully vpon them. So he dealt with his old
and auncient people whom by his Prophet Micheas hee putteth
in remembraunce of three especiall blessings whereby they were
prouoked to serue the Lord, <hi>Surely I haue brought thee vp out of the
Land of Egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mich. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and I haue
sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Myriam. O my people remember nowe
what Balak king of Moab had deuised, and what Balam the sonne of Peor
aunswered him, from Shittim vnto Gilgal, that ye may knowe the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17219:67"/>
of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 The chiefest benefite which the Lorde powred vpon his
people,<note place="margin">Deliuerance out of thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> and the first whereby hee allured them to seeke him was
this, With an outstretched arme hee brought them foorth from
the Land of Egypt, the house of bondage, where their dwelling
place was a prison, and a long life long miserie. No doubt a
mightie and a mercifull worke of God to deliuer his people out
of such thraldome, and to set them at such libertie as they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
enioyed. Bondage is an heauie yoke, an exceeding plague;
freedome and libertie a great benefite, a sweete blessing. The like
benefite in as great a measure of loue, fauour and power, we haue
receiued at the hands of our mercifull God. Hee hath doone that
for vs a reiected nation which hee did for his owne inheritaunce.
Hee hath deliuered vs from the tyrannie and thraldome of that
great Pharao; from Satan, sinne, hell, death and condemnation
by the mightie hand of our Moses, our graund captaine, Christ
Iesus: who on the crosse gate the victorie, spoiled our enemie,
cancelled the writing of our bondage and seruitude, brought vs
through the red sea, and by his bloudshed wrought our perfect
and full deliuerance. Againe, when we groaned vnder the heauy
burthens of a second, the childe of the former Pharao, when the
tyrannie of Antichrist lay grieuous vpon our soules, constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vs by force vnto those things, in comparison whereof the
gathering of stubble, or making of bricke, the sustaining of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
farre heauier than the Egyptian laid any vpon Israel would
haue seemed tollerable, light and easie; in the midst of these insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
griefes, euen then when these Egyptians were most fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and eagerly bent, when they thought their kingdome most
strongly established, and vs past looking for any deliuerance (and
what else could the reason of man suppose?) euen then our migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and mercifull God (to whose workes mans thoughts aspire
not) by the hand of his milde and faithfull seruaunt deliuered his
people out of that thraldome, of bond made vs free, discharged
vs from the intollerable tyrannie of Antichrist, deliuered vs from
the vsurped power of poperie, from the Romish yoke of seruile
superstition, that we might serue no longer that man of sinne, but
our God, not with a slauish minde, but in perfect freedome of
conscience; according to his most holie woorde, and not mans

            <p>5 God further prouoking his people Israel to seeke him,<note place="margin">The benefite of giuing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Aaron, and Marie.</note> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them in mind of a second benefite, of sending Moses, Aaron,
and Marie before them. Moses to be their Magistrate, and Aaron
to be their Priest, the one to iudge, and the other to teache; the
one to punish sinners, the other to praie and to offer for them.
These two were brethren that the bond of nature might vnite
their mindes in gouernement: and that their vnitie might more
aduaunce Gods glorie, and procure the tranquillitie and safetie
of their countrie.<note place="margin">2. Reg. 12.</note> So Ioas the king, and Iehoiada the Bishop ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Israel had a prosperous and happie state.</p>
            <p>6 Moses was a woorthie magistrate. And his greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
is that he was no lesse sharp and seuere in Gods cause,<note place="margin">Moses seuere in punishing publike offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, easie in pardoning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries doone to himselfe.</note>
than milde and gentle in his owne. His mildenesse caused him
many times to put vp other priuate iniuries; it neuer caused him
to spare such as attempted the ouerthrowe of true religion, or
made the people to bowe themselues vnto strange gods. In such
cases the verie heads and princes of the people escaped not his
iust hands.<note place="margin">Num. 25.</note> Hee did wisely consider that as it is a point of mercie
to pardon priuate wrongs, so not to punish publike transgressors
against God and the state were great iniustice, it beeing in doubt
whether their deedes were more pestilent, or their example if it
were strengthened by impunitie would be more pernicious. <hi>The
scepter of thy kingdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> saith the Prophet, <hi>is a scepter of righteousnesse.</hi>
And he prooueth it thus, <hi>For thou louest righteousnesse and hatest ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi>
Wilt thou knowe what is good, and what the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of thee?<note place="margin">Mich. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Surely,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>to doe iustice and to loue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 101.</note>
The song of Dauid had these two parts, <hi>Mercie</hi> and <hi>Iudgement.</hi>
Princes are Gods lieuetenants, his person they beare and his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
they must resemble. In him both these are ioined together,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17219:68"/>
               <hi>I am the Lord which shewe mercie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 9.</note> 
               <hi>iudgement, and righteousnesse on earth.</hi>
Mercie <hi>without iustice is not mercie but follie,</hi> saith S. Chrysostome.
And againe, <hi>Mercie is then rightly termed mercie if it be shewed so, that
iustice be not thereby brought into contempt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. ep. 54.</note> And S. Augustine saith,
that <hi>As it is mercie sometimes to punish, so sometimes to spare is crueltie.</hi>
Concerning our selues, thus much I can say that if care bee not
had thereof in time to keepe backe the rage of sinne by repressing
sinners, it wil be too late when the Land doth flowe with bloud to
thinke vpon it. Moses so loued the safetie of his people that hee
cried,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Lord spare them or wipe me out of the booke of life.</hi> To haue a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
like to Moses, milde and mercifull; yet not carelesse to be
zealous in Gods cause, nor vnmindefull in iustice to punish great
transgressors, is a great &amp; a rare blessing. Which if our God haue
bestowed vpon vs (for vnto him wee must acknowledge it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in this place I passe it ouer, because my desire is not to
please but to teache, neither did I euer vse flattering woords as ye
know) but if God haue beene mercifull to vs heerein, the Lorde
make vs thankefull for it.</p>
            <p>7 Together with Moses God gaue his people Aaron the
Priest:<note place="margin">Aaron, and Marie.</note> which gift he accounteth also as a great blessing. Yet Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
was a man though of great vertue not altogether without
blemish. We see how for feare of the people more than of God,
in the absence of Moses he plaied the milkesop, erected an Idol,
and with his bodie wheresoeuer his heart was become, either
committed Idolatrie or at least permitted it, perswaded hereunto
as some suppose, by Marie the sister of Moses. We haue too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
followers of the steps of Aaron in this weakenesse. Howbeit
vnto some God hath giuen a greater measure of strength &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
some there are more bold and constant in Gods cause and
their duetie, some that will not bowe their knees to Baal, that wil
not displease God for the pleasuring of man, some whose libertie
and liues are not so deere vnto them, but that they can be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not onely to bee bound but also to die for the testimonie of
Christ. Of this better sort although in comparison of the woorse
the number be not so great as good, yet I suppose that fewe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnder heauen haue moe faithfull and able ministers than
this Land hath. Beg we at the hands of the Lord of the haruest
to send moe pastors and fewer hyrelings, moe labourers and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17219:69"/>
loyterers. For in respect of the greatnesse of the haruest these
workemen though they be many yet are but fewe. When God
doth giue his people good gouernours and wise teachers; when
he maketh their men to excell in wisedome, their princes to be as
Moses, and their Priests as Aaron; and besides all this raiseth vp
women like to Marie amongst them powring out his spirite not
onely vpon their sonnes but vpon their daughters also, choosing
out of them, notwithstanding their weakenesse, mightie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his power, surely a benefite so rare and pretious should
winne mens hearts vnto God for euer.</p>
            <p>8 But the Prophet goeth forward and maketh mention of a
third thing,<note place="margin">The enemies curse turned into blessing.</note> which is that God did turne the cursings of Balaam
into blessings. <hi>Remember what Balak King of Moab had deuised, and
what Balaam the sonne of Peor aunswered him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 23.</note> 
               <hi>from Shittim to Gilgall,
that ye may knowe the righteousnesse of the Lord.</hi> It fretted the heart of
that prophane king Balak to beholde the flourishing prosperitie
of Gods people, to see Og the king of Bashan and Sihon king of
the Amorites conquered and slaine by them. <hi>This multitude,</hi> saith
he, <hi>will licke vp all that are about vs as an oxe licketh vp the grasse of the
fielde.</hi> Wherefore mistrusting his owne strength, &amp; hauing feene
trial of theirs, he deuised to hire Balaam the wisard to curse them,
and thought by that meane without all peraduenture to preuaile
ouer them. But ye knowe Balaams answeres, the first, <hi>How shall I
curse where God hath not cursed?</hi> the second, <hi>God hath blessed, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alter it;</hi> the third, <hi>How goodly are thy tents O Iacob, and thine habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
O Israel? As the valleies are they stretched foorth, as gardens by the
riuers side, as the Aloe trees which the Lord hath planted, and as the cedars
beside the waters.</hi> When hee sawe that God would not suffer his
tongue to curse Israel though it were hyred, hee gaue Balak this
aduise,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> to cause the daughters of Moab to steale away their
hearts by carnall pleasure, and so to allure them vnto the sacrifice
of their gods, that they forsaking the true God he might also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
them. This practise was a stumbling block in their way, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
they abode in Shittim they committed fornication,<note place="margin">Num. 25. &amp; 31.</note> they cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
themselues vnto Baal Peor, and ate of things sacrificed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Idols and diuels. Wherefore God plagued them, and laid his
heauie hand vpon them. Howbeit he withdrewe not his mercie
and kindenesse wholly from them,<note place="margin">Iosua. 5.</note> but in Gilgal tooke away this
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17219:69"/>
their shame, and sealed againe the couenant of reconciled loue.
So that as there was no curse which could take away his blessing,
so there was no counsell that could hinder his good purpose to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his people. Yee are not ignoraunt how the Balamite of
Rome hath cursed vs, our prince, our prophets, and our people,
euen as the Philistim cursed Dauid <hi>by his gods.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.</note> But we haue found
the promise of Christ most true,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed are yee when they shall reuile
you.</hi> Our God hath turned all his curses into blessings, his name
be blessed for it. The Pope that Balaam hath bitterly cursed the
ground whereon we goe, and the whole Land wherein wee liue.
But hath there growen a brier or a thorne the more vpon it for all
that mans curse? Hee that shall surueie it and viewe it well, and
marke the plentifulnesse of these latter yeeres, must needes
confesse that God hath bestowed vpon it more than ordinarie or
vsuall blessings. As the blessings of that man are by God accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so where he curseth there the Lord blesseth; and to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
reproofe of that our enemies vniust and vncharitable execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he hath in these our daies opened his bountifull hand farre
wider than in former times, when those Antichristian blessings
came posting yerely from Rome, and embraced our Lande so
kindely that they sucked the sappe of wealth both from braunche
and roote. The Land of Canaan was a pleasaunt and a fruitefull
Land, flowing with milke, and abounding with honie: truely it
was barren and almost beggerly in respect of our aboundance and
store. God may iustly say to vs,<note place="margin">Esay 5.</note> 
               <hi>What could I haue doone more vnto my
vineyard which I haue not doone vnto it?</hi> He hath miraculously giuen
and continued with vs that grand blessing of his glorious Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
he hath wonderfully preserued our Soueraigne his seruant,
he hath kept her safe as Moses and Dauid from Pharao, from Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and from Amalek; from Goliah, from Saul, from Absolon,
from the hands of her open enemies and treasons of her deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friends: he hath not onely giuen her a circumspect heart to
foresee and to preuent, and, I trust, to cut off all intended destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but also hath more than miraculously abated the pride and
confounded the manifold counsels of her and our enemies, and
contrarie to all expectation kept vs in peace and safetie. GOD
make vs thankefull and giue vs hearts syncerely bent to seeke him
which so mercifully by his benefites and graces hath sought vs.

must be assayed; if we wil not be led by faire meanes, we shall be

as hauing no delight or pleasure to punish; hee punisheth as one
vnwilling to destroie. Gods corrections is for our reformation,
but if it will not reforme vs, for our confusion. This selfe loue of
ours, this senselesse securitie, this contempt of Gods woord, this
want of godlie zeale, these contriuings of treason and conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
are tokens that God hath bent his dreadfull bowe, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

wherein the Lorde may be found of them that seeke him. But
some stop their eares at this and will not heare, they are too wise

long since impropriated vnto a Monkes which deuoured the fruits
and gaue a sillie stipend vnto a poore Sir Iohn to say Masse. And
as they left it so we finde it still. Where liuings were not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
by the Pope, there they are for the most part so handled,
that patrons maintaine themselues with those tithes which the
people giue: and ministers haue that which the patrons leaue.
The worlde dealeth with Gods Clergie as Dionysius the tyrant
with Iupiters Idoll. They make themselues as merie with spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Christs patrimonie as he with robbing Iupiter of his golden
cloake: which, being too heauie for Sommer, and too colde for
Winter, he tooke away, and left in stead of it a cotten coate light
for the one time, and warme for the other. To take from them
which liue idly and superstitiously in the Church they pleade it
to be lawfull, because those vnprofitable members were vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

these earthly commodities; and therefore euen of great deuotion
and zeale they will ease the Church of these her burthens. Thus
by men that cannot stand without the fall of the Church of God
all meanes are inuented to begger the ministerie. A deuise no
doubt of Satan and a practise of his impes to cause a famine of
the bread of life, by staruing the Oxe that should treade out the
come; and to withdrawe Gods people from seeking the Lord, by
weakening and discouraging such as should guide them in the
waie of life. Thus you see how God must be sought in his word,
which woord because all men must heare and learne, therefore
many must be sent to teache it.</p>

sustained through mens ingratitude towards him. He maketh pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

is nothing ours but imbecillitie and naughtinesse, which with our

profaned his sacred Gospell, his word we haue contemned and
abused, vsing it as a cloake to couer our deepe hypocrisie, Christ
was neuer more professed &amp; neuer lesse obeied. It is truly verified

               <note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note> Ezechiel teacheth that the sinnes
of Sodome that sinke of sinne were Idlenesse, of fulnesse of bread,
pride and vnmercifulnesse towards the poore. Are not these the
sinnes of this Land, of this Citie, of this Court at this day? Are
not these bad waies our waies? Halfe Englande liueth idly or
woorse occupied, we are fed to the full, and who is not puffed vp
with pride? or who relieueth his neighbours want? No man is
contented with his owne estate, but euerie one striueth to clime
higher to sit aloft. There is want of the true feare of God in all
sorts, estates, and ages. Yet we please our selues and walke on, as
if God either sawe not our sinne, or else in his iustice could not
punish it. Are the eyes of the Lord shut vp? or hath God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to be iust? Surely our sinnes will not suffer his plagues to
stay long from vs. What plagues I dare not presume to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
For God hath kept that secrete to himselfe. But I stande in
feare that we are the men to whom Christ saith, <hi>The kingdome of
God shall be taken from</hi> Yov; that wee are they whose sinnes will
bring the scepter of this kingdome into the handes of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.
If God in his iustice doe this, woe worth vs most wretched
men. The losse of the Gospell is the losse of our soules, and
the losse of our Soueraigne the losse of our liues. Truely
when I fall into consideration of the wickednesse of this worlde,
that all sorts of men fall to sinning with greedinesse, that there is
skant one left as Elias complaineth, that truly seeketh after God,
that in all conditions iniquitie doeth abound and charitie waxe
colde, that the zeale of God is vtterly dryed vp in the hearts of
men, that God is serued for fashions sake and not in trueth, what
should I thinke but that God hath gathered his lap ful of plagues
and is readie to powre them downe vpon vs? There is but one
way to staie him for which he himselfe doth staie and waite. Doe

the office of humanitie, the duetie of charitie decently to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the dead corps to the earth, out of which they came. This
charitable dutie is commended in Toby and others, whose names
I mentioned before, and was of the verie Heathen religiously
obserued. Secondly it is a thing verie seemely and conuenient,
with reuerence to laie the corps in graue, because our bodies are
the temples of the holie Ghost, wherein &amp; by which as by liuely
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17219:74"/>
instruments both God hath beene glorified, and his people haue
receiued good.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Knowe yee not that your bodie is the temple of the holie
Ghost which is in you?</hi> That which hath beene so notable an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would not be vnreuerently entreated though dead. Thirdly
our faith is hereby confirmed touching the article of our resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For we laie downe the bodie in the earth, vnder hope that
<hi>This mortall must put on immortalitie:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> as confessing with Iob, <hi>I beleeue
that my redeemer liueth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and that I shall see God in my fleshe, mine eyes shall
behold him and none other.</hi> But the Christian Church doeth not,
neither ought to vse funerals thereby to relieue or benefite the
dead.<note place="margin">Aug. de Ciuit. De. lib. 1. cap. 12.</note> 
               <hi>All these things,</hi> saith S. Augustine, <hi>furniture of funerals, order
of burying, and the pompe of exequies are rather comforts to the liuing than
helps to the dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> The glutton of whom S. Luke speaketh in the
Gospell, was buried no doubt with pompe ynough; yet his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
soule was plunged into hell. There commeth therefore no
part of blessednesse to the dead by funerals: but <hi>Blessed are the dead

Bernard. We are all tenants at will, vncertaine how long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in this our earthly tabernacle. Of this we are put in minde
in the Lords praier. Giue vs <hi>this day</hi> our daily bread. We say this
day as vncertaine of to morowe. It is written of one that beeing
inuited to a dinner on the morowe by his friend, hee aunswered,
<hi>These many daies I neuer had to morowe.</hi> Therefore saith S. Iames, let

               <hi>If the Lorde
will,</hi> and <hi>if we liue.</hi> The Egyptians considering the vncertaintie of
mans daies were accustomed at their great feasts in the midst of
their iollitie to haue one sodainely come foorth with an image of
death, and shewing it to the gests to pronounce this speeche:
<hi>Eate, drinke, be merie, within a while thou shalt be such as this.</hi> And the
Israelites dwelt in tents, vncertaine of their abode euer readie to
shift: whereby they represent vnto vs our peregrination in this
mortalitie; wherein because we are vncertaine to stay long, wee
ought at all times to be readie to depart so, that we may enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

hath made vncertaine for two causes: the one that his minde

our preaching nor praier neither any other ceremonie nor
circumstance can profite the dead, but are helping comforts to
such as liue, that onely in this life mercie remaineth for man and
after this life onely iudgement. As we now sowe so we shall then
reape. Here we are Christs souldiers to fight a good fight, so wee
may hope for the crowne of glorie. Which thing Iob doeth wel
declare vnto vs, First telling vs that wee are in continuall warre;
wherein both the generals, the captaines, the trumpetors and
common souldiers, that is the prince, the nobilitie, the ministers
and the people must take to them a good courage, be faithful, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17219:80"/>
and manfull in fighting the battle of the Lorde, euerie man
keepe his standing and answere his office. But we must all striue
for Gods truth and not struggle against it, not ambitiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for superioritie, or malitiously howe to vndermine and
wrong one another. This is no lawfull combat, no Christian
warre; this is not to fight a good fight. But wee must wage warre
against our common and our deadly enemies, the diuell, the
world and the flesh. The diuel is a roaring lyon, a subtile serpent,
who hath ouercome the perfectest, the strongest, the wisest. The
world is all wrapped in wickednesse. The flesh wrestleth against
the spirite. We must put on the armour of God, resist the diuell
and he will flie from vs, crucifie the world, chasten our flesh and
bring it into subiection vnto the more noble part, our spirit. At
length this our warrefare will come to an ende, wee may looke
for a change. All the world is mutable, and of all thinges in the
world man most mutable. We would change our condition, our
magistrates, our ministers, our religion, all things. But the
change that Iob speaketh of we least remember, wee litle thinke
vpon the change of this mortall life. Wee may assure our selues
that we all shall die. It is an act of Parliament that shall neuer be
repealed, it is the way of all flesh. The daies of man are short and
wretched: short, a spanne long: wretched, full of miseries. All
flesh is as grasse and as a flowre; both do fade, but the flowre soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Cares, wantonnesse, ambition, yea God in sundrie respects
cutteth off both the good and the bad, good flowers &amp; bad flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
but all as flowers. The time of our change is vncertaine, and
often sodaine; that our minde be not troubled, that we alwaies be
in readinesse. Iobs example admonisheth vs of this, <hi>I looke still
when my changing shall come.</hi> Let vs after his example daily looke for
our change. Let vs expect the comming of Christ. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in post, the forewarnings are fulfilled; Iniquitie aboundeth,
Christian charitie is frosen, the Gospell is preached: Then is the
ende. Let vs not slumber in securitie or driue off to returne vnto
our God. For it is hard for the buried in sinne to rise. Man often
is sodainely smitten, that he hath no time to repent. In his last
daie he is disquieted by sickenesse, by Satan, yea by his friendes,
yea by his owne conscience. Let vs liue in reuerent expectation
of the Lord with our loines girt, and with our lampes light, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17219:81"/>
let the trumpet of iudgement euer sound in our eares: it will wel
stirre vp our hearts. Let vs liue these fewe daies that remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, whom we ought to haue serued all our daies. And
lastly recounting the vanitie of the worlde, the miserable state of
this life, and the inestimable blessednesse of the life to come, let
vs with Iohn, Paul, Elias, the blessed seruants and Saints of God
looke for the appearance of the comming of Christ Iesus: who
will place vs vpon the right hand of his father, and giue vs posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our inheritance, that we may haue the perfect fruition of
all the treasures prepared for vs by our God in heauen. To him
euen the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost, three persons
and one God of eternall maiestie be all honour, &amp;c.</p>

hands. We are freed; therefore we were bond. And in this point
we haue to consider: First our bondage: then the meane of our

from God we lost our immortalitie, we lost our freewill, wee lost
our wisedome, our vertue, our light, our glorie, our ioie, our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
our God. Our peruerse heart became prone to all euill and

Iesus Christ doth deliuer vs from all sinne. And as he died to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
vs so rose he againe to iustifie vs. In rising againe hee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
ouer death now conquered; he burst the gates &amp; cheines
of hell, and set our feete in a place of great libertie, hee cloathed
vs with his righteousnesse, reconciled vs to his father, of enemies
made vs friends, of no people the people of God, of straungers
citizens with Angels and inhabitants of heauen, free denisons
with the children of God, and heires of his euerlasting kingdome.
This deliuerance out of bondage, this redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this kingdome
of God &amp; euerlasting inheritance our Christ hath purchased, &amp;
God hath granted to all such as thankfully will receiue him. <hi>As

of conscience, he hath led vs out of a maruellous darknesse
into a maruellous light, hee hath giuen vs (for his gift it is) an

hath sent Iesus Christ, vnto whom by this starre his shining Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

worke our deliuerance but onely this; his mercie. God therefore
which is rich in mercie, for the great loue wherewith hee loued

cause of our redemption was his good will onely.<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> For, <hi>By grace</hi>
we are deliuered. He did it according to the good pleasure of his
owne will, according to the riches of his grace. So that all the
steps to this our redemption are built vpon mercie only. God in
mercie made couenant of our deliuerance, in mercie confirmed
it with an othe, in mercie through the merits of Christ perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his promise to vs, so that our whole redemption is free,
not due; of mercie, and not of merits; <hi>Not by workes which we haue
wrought,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but according to his great mercie he hath saued vs.</hi> Man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
brought one stone to this building; man neuer laide one
finger to this woorke; it is the onely building and woorke
of GOD who in tender compassion hath both begun and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it. Wee may well wonder that God with so mercifull eies
looked vpon so miserable and so sinfull creatures, that the sonne
of God would die for the redemption of his enemies. This doth
in deede commend his loue, seeing that all which he hath doone
is of meere mercie in himselfe, without any shadowe of merite
in vs.</p>

The couetous man which serueth his monie is iustly called of
Paul <hi>an Idolater.</hi> For he is our God not whom we professe, but in
whom we repose our trust,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> and whom we serue and obey. When
the Lord commaundeth one thing and his monie perswades an
other: will not his obedience declare whom he maketh his God?
God saith,<note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Lend freely and looke for no gaine.</hi> But wil the vsurer whose
monie is his God, remit his interest because of this, because the
Lord hath so charged him? No he will not so let goe his tenne or
twentie or thirtie in the hundred. To him the glorie of God yea
and his owne soule is vile, nothing is pretious but onely money.
What the Prophet speaketh of putting foorth monie to vsurie
he full litle regardeth, but feedeth still vpon his mast, and blesseth
himselfe when hee waxeth fat, not perceiuing that God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
plagued him with a plague of all plagues the obduration

of his heart. And although that God hath giuen him ouer into
a dull and senselesse minde, his eares beeing so dammed vp that
nothing can haue entraunce to mooue or touche his hard heart:
yet he still blesseth himselfe and his accursed soule. Thou vsurer
thou idolater that doest glorie in thy shame, in thy euill gotten
golde: doest thou not knowe that thy wealth shall melt like snow

               <note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> perhaps this instant,<note place="margin">Luc. 8.</note> and then whose
is all this? After that Zacheus fell to the seruice of Christ, and
that Christ entred into his house, hee presently forsooke the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of Mammon, made a large restitution of that which he had
gained by such vnlawfull meanes, and then began to bee liberall,
not onely to lend freely but to giue for nothing: he gaue the one
halfe of all his goods to the poore. If God would at this day work
thus in the heart of one Zacheus, a rich vsurer: how many poore
might be relieued by such a restitution? He might mainteine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a needie man and saue his owne soule. Well this one thing
we knowe. This woord that proceedeth out of Gods mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vsurie <hi>shall not returne in vaine:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 55.</note> if it cannot worke reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it wil worke confusion.</p>
            <p>11 As these serue their monie so there are some <hi>Domino non
seruientes sed suo ventri,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not the belly as time ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> seruaunts to the bellie and not to the Lord.
He serueth the bellie who frameth himselfe to be of any religion
so that in this world he may liue by it: when poperie hath the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hand, then a papist; when the Gospell is in due estimation, a
protestant; all things to all men that somewhat may be gained or
saued to himselfe. Hee maketh no difference betweene the Masse
and the Communion, Christ and Beliall; but for his bellie sake wil
halt on both sides, serue all times and turnes. Such a one was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontius
Bishop of Antioch,<note place="margin">Theod. lib. 2. cap. 24.</note> who being in heart an Arrian, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his religion and ioined with the counsell of Nice in outward
profession of the trueth. So his soule was led by the diuel, and his
bodie by the world.</p>
            <p>12 Some and those many are seruauntes of men,<note place="margin">Not men as the popish faction, &amp;c.</note> as those
which in matters of religion wholly hang their soules vpon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
authorities and iudgements. So did the Corinthians; I

fauorites. And so doe those that choose to themselues newe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

praise and flatter men in their follie, thereby to winne themselues
estimation with them which haue mens persons in admiration
for gaines sake. Finally so doe they which repose their trust in the
merits of men, that seeke iustification or remission of sinnes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their owne woorkes or by the desertes of others. For
to knowe that hee is our redemption, sanctification, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
is no small part of Gods seruice: to giue this to any other is
to take it from him: which who so doeth is not woorthie to bee
named his seruaunt. He that serueth him must serue him alone.</p>
            <p>13 Not him and the worlde:<note place="margin">Not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, sinne and Satan.</note> For the worlde is wholly set on

haue dominion ouer you. We must die vnto sinne, that we may
liue vnto God through Iesus Christ our Lord. He that doth sinne
is the seruaunt of the diuell: the diuel is but a bad master to serue:
he is a lier, a theefe and a murtherer. And hee entertaineth no
seruants but such as be like himselfe, whose wages are fire, cheines,
brimstone, darkenesse, wailing, howling and gnashing of teeth,
in a word euerlasting death and damnation. Wee are nor ranso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
out of the hands of our enemies to serue these masters, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
the bellie, men, sinne, the world, or the diuell. But wee are
redeemed to serue him onely, to serue our Christ, our redeemer
that hath full deerely bought vs. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,</hi>

their masters. God will be feared of vs as children, but not as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts,
or if as seruaunts, not as slaues. The beleeuing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the regenerate childe of God, who through faith in Christ is
certaine of his deliuerance from the diuell and from hell, assured
of remission of sinnes and of life euerlasting in the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of Iesus Christ our Sauiour, he serueth in the reuerent
feare of loue, and not in that dreadfull feare of death and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17219:85"/>
damnation wherewith the reprobate minde is daunted. He
feareth not death, for hee is sure of life; hee feareth not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for he is assured of saluation; he beleeueth that which Christ
hath promised, and doubteth nothing of the obteining of that
which Christ hath procured for him. He is surely perswaded with
S. Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that neither death, nor life, nor tribulation, nor afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor any thing present or to come shall separate him from the
loue of God which is in Christ Iesus.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> Hee feareth therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the sting of death, nor the power of Satan. But this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Gods loue towards him in Christ and the testimonie of his
loue towards God againe casteth out all feare of eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
For ye haue not saith the Apostle, receiued againe the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of bondage vnto feare, but ye haue receiued the spirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option
by which wee crie Abba father. This spirit testifieth with
our spirit that God is our gratious father, and if he our father,
wee his children; and if his children, heires of his glorious
kingdome. The preaching of the Lawe letteth vs see our sinne,
but no remedie against the sting therof, so that it maketh vs feare
and with trembling looke for the reward of sinne which is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
death. But the spirite of adoption by the preaching of the
Gospel telleth vs that in Christ we haue remission of sinnes, we
are reconciled vnto God and adopted by him, we are his chosen
children and may boldly and ioyfully call him father. And this
certainetie of our saluation the spirit of God testifieth to our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whereby we put away all seruile feare of punishment beeing
assured of Gods constant fauour and eternall loue towardes vs:
who neuer leaueth vnfinished that which he hath begun, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh
him whom he hath chosen.</p>
            <p>15 Therefore daungerous and desperate is that doctrine of
the Papists which doth teache vs euer to be doubtfull and in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of our saluation.<note place="margin">Poperie tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in stead of feare, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust.</note> A lamentable, discomfortable, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
estate. Here it is in one woord confounded. For Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
saith we are redeemed to serue him without feare or doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For where doubt is there is feare, and what greater feare
than of a thing so fearefull? Hee that will serue God must serue
him in a quiet and ioiefull conscience with a sure and vndoubted
confidence of mercie and saluation in Christ the Lord of mercy.
<hi>With thee is mercie,</hi>

so despitefully vsed men sent vnto him of meere loue and heartie

of all kings hath in fauour, mercie and reconciled loue sent his
embassadors his ministers vnto you; to comfort you in your
griefes, and to bring you ioiefull tidings of a kingdome which it
hath pleased his father to bestowe vpon you. These messengers
ought of right to be honourably receiued. Entreate such with

and base outcasts of men. Away they are sent loaden with
spitefull words, with slanderous reproches, iniurious dealings, all
kindes of contumelie and disgrace. But note of whome: of the
Ammonites which feare not God, of the prophanely minded
Atheist, of the carnal gospeller, of the zealous hypocrite, of such
in whom the feare of God or the care of their soules remaineth
not; of such as also spoile the patrimonie of Christ, such as would
not sticke I thinke to sell Christ himselfe if they might for monie
as Iudas did, and to cast lots for his coate with Pilates souldiers.
This robberie and spoile, this despitefulnesse and ignominie done
vnto Dauids messengers he tooke in such sort as doone vnto him
selfe. For the wrong or ignominie done to the messenger is done
to the master who sent him, and on whose businesse hee goeth.
Dauid would not put it vp so but reuenged it. Hee comforted his
faithfull messengers, sent them newe apparell, and caused them
to remaine at an appointed place Iericho vntill their beardes
were growne againe, for it was ignominious to the Iewes to be
beardlesse. Afterward he addresseth forth an armie of strong soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who set vpon the Ammonites, put them to flight &amp; made
great mortalitie. And doeth not Christ our king esteeme the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie

Hath he not saide, <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me?</hi> No doubt hee

Oza supposed hee had doone God verie good seruice in

their giuing of almes: but who required these thinges at

is persecuted,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> secret congregations are allowed. When Christ
was crucified the Disciples kept themselues secretly together in a
parlour at Ierusalem for feare of the Iewes, and there serued God.
Such priuate congregations the Ecclesiasticall histories plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
set foorth and commend.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> In such tempests to serue our God
in deserts, in hils, in dennes and holes of the earth wee must bee
content. But conuenticles or priuate meetings, when the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of God being strengthened with the ciuill hand, hath his free
and safe passage, is publikely and syncerely preached, when al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
and feare therof is wholy vanished, haue beene euer sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious,
and they are the nurces of all errors. It is the propertie
of froward sectaries whose inuentions cannot abide the light,
to make obscure conuenticles when the doctrine of truth is set at
libertie. The Donatists, the Arrians, the Anabaptists, the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of loue with all others of the like sort, fostered vp their errors
in secret and darke corners. But such as bee of the flocke of the
great sheepeheard Christ ought to assemble themselues in one
sheepefold. Peruersitie neuer wants excuses, neither is satisfied
with any reason: but no man can in right refuse to communicate
with vs in our Church. It is the sanctuarie of the Lord, the house
of God, the arke of God; wherein the treasures of heauen are
laide open for our vse, no other than such as God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The golden pot with Manna, the flourishing rod of Aaron
and the tables of Moses: these are no bugges to fray away Gods
children. They haue nothing offered them but the heauenly
foode whereupon the elect of GOD should feede, euen that
bread which Christ hath sanctified and broken vnto vs for our
comfort.</p>
            <p>25 Such stray sheepe therefore as will not of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
assemble themselues to serue the Lorde in the midst of this
holie congregation may lawfully and in reason ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
thereunto.<note place="margin">Christian magistrates may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine their subiects vnto open assemblies where God is serued.</note> For though religion cannot bee driuen into
men by force, yet men by force may be driuen to those ordinarie
meanes whereby they are woont to be brought to the knowledge
of the truth. Parents cannot constraine their children to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
But parents may constraine them to repaire thither where
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17219:88"/>
they may be taught. Thus you see that God must be serued of vs
in holinesse: holinesse openly declared and professed, not secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept and laide vp onely in our hearts and bosomes.</p>
            <p>26 It followeth in the words of Zacharie,<note place="margin">With holines righteousnes must be ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> 
               <hi>And in righteousnesse.</hi>
This righteousnesse hath chiefly respect to the second table, and
putteth vs in minde how we ought to vse our neighbour. In doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

this is) in righteousnesse. One lesson well obserued were
sufficient for this matter. If we could loue our neighbours with

men.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Render vnto euerie one that which is due,</hi> this is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
            <p>27 They which are in authoritie are called <hi>Iustices,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Righteous magistrates.</note> to the end
that their name might put them in minde of that duetie which
they owe to the common wealth: If they doe not see that Lawes
be put in practise and execution; if in iudgement they doe not

betweene man and man with an euen hand; if for feare
they cruelly cast away the innocent (for cowards beene euer cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell)
or for fauour spare the rich; if they be men of corrupt minds,
patrones of euill men and of euill causes for their owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie;
if they be not wise, with Salomon; if they feare not GOD,
with Moses; if they loue not the truth, as Dauid; if they hate not
couetousnesse, as did Samuel: surely they doe not serue God in
righteousnesse and iustice, because they are iniurious towardes
their neighbours.</p>
            <p>28 The minister of Gods woord is also a seruaunt.<note place="margin">Righteous ministers.</note> Wee are

serued. This seruice is of vs very slenderly and slackely doone:
Christs impotent &amp; miserable members are sent away not relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
To suffer him in his members so to begge who hath giuen
thee all that thou hast is horrible ingratitude, it is not the part of

Let vs pray for the zeale that was in Christ Iesus, that wee may
with the sharpe whippe of vnfained repentance driue out of our
bodies which are the temples of Gods holie spirit all buying and
selling, all couetousnesse, vsurie, enuie, lying, deceite; that wee
giue not our bodies and soules to any such prophane vse, but to
be kept vncorrupt and pure as beseemeth the temples of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
spirit; that we may offer vp vnto God in the midst of these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
the sacrifice of an humble and of a contrite heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of righteousnesse, the sacrifice of praise. Let vs beseech him
I say to inflame our hearts with true zeale, that earnestly seeking
our owne saluation and the safetie of others, we may be zealous
as the blessed Apostle was with the zeale of God:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> euen holy and
zealous before the Lord.</p>
            <p>35 For as our zeale must bee coupled with iudgement and
knowledge,<note place="margin">Our zeale must be as in knowledge, so in synceritie.</note> so with truth and synceritie. God will not bee serued
with fained holinesse and with counterfaite religion, with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shewes and with the lippes, but with the heart. In our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
we must powre out our hearts before him: in repentance our
hearts must be rent asunder: in our almes we must keepe a single
heart: when the word is preached we must open our hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it: whatsoeuer we doe in his seruice we must doe it heartily
as to the Lord. For all our seruing of him is in vaine, nay it is
damnable if we seeke onely which way we may appeare holie and
righteous vnto men. Such as we would seeme to be we must bee
in deede, such we must appeare in truth before that Lorde who
seeth our verie hearts and examineth our in most reines. Let vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
remember that God looketh vpon vs with open eyes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
in greatest darkenesse, hee seeth the vnsearchable heart
and thought of man: no secret can be kept secret from him. This
would bridle in vs all inward wicked cogitations, all outward wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
workes, if we could well and as we should consider it. For if
we be ashamed and afraid to offend in the sight of man who hath
onely power ouer our mortall bodie; how much more should we
be ouercome with shame and feare to sinne in the sight of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
God, who hath power ouer bodie and soule to cast them
both into eternall fire?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:17219:90"/>
36 Thus we are to serue our redeemer,<note place="margin">Our seruing of God must continue all the daies of our life.</note> we are ransomed and
bought to serue not for a day, but for al our daies, we are redeemed
for euer to serue him for euer. He that runneth is not crowned til
he haue ended his race, and then beginneth his glorie. Iudas and
Demas began to serue the Lorde: but they were soone wearie:
their seruice was vnrewarded because it was vncontinued. Onely
he that continueth to the end shall be saued, which saluation of
our soules and bodies the Lord of his infinite mercies grant, that
wee may aspire vnto him in this life, and attaine vnto him in the
life to come through the merits of Iesus Christ, to whom with

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>VR Apostle in the former part of this Chapter hath
diligently set downe as well the office and authoritie
of a magistrate,<note place="margin">Magistrates ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Heathen or Christian.</note> as also what dutie and obedience the
subiects doe owe vnto him. Hee was occasioned
hereunto for that the Iewes the elect nation of God (who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
claimed to be a free people) could not abide so to subiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17219:91"/>
as to liue obediently vnder forrein Princes. The Gentiles
which nowe were become Christians thought it not agreeable
to their holie profession to yeelde obedience vnto wicked magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
persecuters of true religion, who by euill meanes had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
vnto that authoritie and behaued themselues as ill in it.
Paul in this treatie of a magistrate meeteth with both these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
He laieth downe this foundation for an absolute and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rule: <hi>Let euerie soule be subiect to the higher powers.</hi> This obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he requireth both of Iewe and Gentile; of Prophet &amp; Priest,
in summe of euerie Christian: and this position he prooueth by
sundrie forcible reasons.</p>
            <p>2 First there is no power but of God.<note place="margin">Why obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence should be yeelded vnto Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</note> The powers that are
bee ordeined of him. Be the magistrate Iewe or Gentile, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
or Heathen, good or bad, hee hath his authoritie from God
the magistrate of all magistrates. God hath placed him and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
him to bee thy gouernour, in respect whereof thou art
bound for thy conscience sake towardes God for to obey him.
Another reason why euerie soule should liue in subiection to the
higher power is, because whosoeuer resisteth the ordinaunce of
God prouoketh the iudgement of God against himselfe. If God
for thy sinne set a wanton, an hypocrite, yea or an Infidell ouer
thee, thou must obey that wanton, that hypocrite, and that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell,
and not rebell against him. GOD hath ordeined him;
to resist that power is to resist the ordinaunce of GOD,
to conspire against him is to conspire against GOD, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
him is to reiect God. Christ submitted himselfe to the
authoritie of Caesar, and to Pilates iudgement. Resisters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
receiue to themselues condemnation; they neuer haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euer shall escape the heauie hand of Gods wrath; they feele
it often in this life, but in the life to come, if they escape it heere,
they are sure to feele it. A third reason why we should liue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently
is, because there is no reason why wee should doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For why should any man desire not to be subiect? Because
he is afraide of the power of kings and rulers? Princes are a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
not to them that doe well, but to euill doers. Wilt thou then
be without feare of the power? Withdrawe not thy selfe from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
but doe well; so shalt thou haue praise and be without
feare. For this ende magistrates are appointed of God to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17219:91"/>
the good and represse the euill. And the magistrate is so
necessarie in respect hereof, that no common wealth can be safe
or long stand without him. For if the bad were not bridled more
by the authoritie of the magistrate than by any moderation in
themselues, they would eate vp the good, and a woonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
would soone followe. A fourth reason may be this. God
hath put a sword in the magistrates hands, to shewe that he hath
appointed him as his vicegerent to take vengeaunce on them
which doe euill. So that the very sight of the sword ought to put
vs in minde of his power and our obedience. For God hath not
deliuered him a swoord for nothing: hee is the minister of Gods
wrath, he hath not receiued the swoord in vaine, it is giuen him
to smite the wicked withall.</p>
            <p>3 Wherefore ye must be subiect not because of wrath onely,<note place="margin">Magistrates to be obeyed in the Lorde for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake and not for feare onely.</note>
but also for conscience sake. The Apostle concludeth vpon the
former reasons that wee must submit our selues obediently vnto
the magistrate, and attempt nothing against him: not onely for
feare of punishment, he being the minister of Gods displeasure;
but also for conscience sake, in that God requireth this obedience
at our handes. All this notwithstanding if magistrates should
commaund that which is impious and which God forbiddeth, in
such cases we haue our answere well warranted,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> 
               <hi>Melius est obedire
Deo quàm hominibus.</hi> It is better to obey God than men.</p>
            <p>4 In token of this obedience wee pay them tribute:<note place="margin">Tribute due to Princes.</note> as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
them to be Gods ministers. It is not a strange or a
newe custome to pay custome to princes: All nations, all people
haue euer vsed it and yeelded it, and magistrates well deserue it.
For their office is both painefull and chargeable; they euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the benefite of the common wealth, to represse the euill,
to strengthen the good, to set vp vertue, to cast downe vice, to
defend their people and countrie, and in well gouerning as the
good ministers of God to spend both their goods &amp; liues. These
magistrates must bee supported and may lawfully receiue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their labours: nay they must receiue it. Wherefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
ye wil be iniurious and withhold back from them that which
is theirs euen by debt and not by courtesie, giue to all men their
duetie: tribute to whom tribute, custome to whom custome,
feare to whom feare, and honour to whom honour is due. Wee
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17219:92"/>
must haue magistrates in great estimation and reuerence; wee
must feare them as the ministers of Gods wrath; we must honour
them, for that they occupie Gods place for our benefite; wee
must readily and willingly pay vnto them tribute and custome, for
God hath so appointed and they haue so deserued. And therfore
the Apostle saith, <hi>Reddite,</hi> Paie it. Whereupon S. Chrysostome
fitly noteth, <hi>We doe not giue it vnto magistrates, but we paie it vnto them.</hi>
It is as due as debt.</p>
            <p>5 Vpon this particular touching our duetie towardes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
our Apostle inferreth a generall exhortation.<note place="margin">What we owe to men, and what to God.</note> Owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to any man but this to loue one another, &amp;c. This exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
compriseth two things, our duetie to our neighbour, our
duetie to God. Our duetie to our neighbour consisteth in paying
him what we owe him and in louing him as wee loue our selues.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 6 Owe nothing to any man, pay thy debt: pay vnto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
obedience,<note place="margin">Examples of them which haue wel or ill discharged y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> debt they owe to magistrates Iosua 1.</note> feare, honour, tribute, custome: all this is
due vnto him, all this is thy debt. The people of Israel bound
themselues with solemne promise to pay this debt to their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
Iosua, whom the Lorde had giuen to bee their gouernour.
<hi>All things which thou hast commaunded vs we will doe, and whither so euer
thou wilt send vs we will goe, as we obeyed Moses, so will we also obey thee.
Onely let thy Lord thy God be with thee as hee was with Moses. Whosoeuer
shall rebell against thy commaundement and will not obey thy words in al that
thou commaundest him, let him be put to death.</hi> This is the debt we owe
to magistrates. Myriam would not pay this debt to her brother
Moses; and God plagued her with a fowle leprosie, so that shee
which had separated her selfe from common obedience was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from all companie. Dathan and Abiram with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
rebelliously murmured against their magistrate; and God
made the earth open and swallowe them vp, and a number of that
conspiracie he consumed with fire. Absolon rebelled and would
not pay this debt of obedience to his father. But God quickely
paide him that which was due to his rebellious and disloyall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
God is stil the same God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hateth iniquitie and wil not
suffer conspiracie, rebellion or treason against lawfull magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
either vnreuealed or vnreuenged. And therefore let all
subiects, as wel to auoide the wrath of God, as also for conscience
sake, pay this debt of true obedience in all lawfull causes to their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17219:92"/>
lawfull magistrate.</p>
            <p>7 Let the magistrate pay vnto the people the debt which he
oweth them.<note place="margin">The magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is a debtor to the people as they are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors vnto him: he of iustice as they of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> The debt of the magistrate is the iust execution of
lawfull punishment against transgressors. The sword is deliuered
vnto him for that purpose; neither is any open transgression of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kinde, whether it concerne the first or second table of the lawe
of God, or any man of any calling bee hee Prophet or Priest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from this iudgement. Salomon deposed Abiathar the
high Priest. Iehu slewe the false Prophets. Elias the Baalites.
This sword is giuen of God to magistrates, to execute iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against all sinnes and all sinners: and this part of debt is to
be paide. It is also a part of the magistrates debt to giue vpright
sentence in matters of controuersie betweene parties. For which
cause the Poets faine Iustice to carie a sword in the one hand and
a balance in the other: to kill sinne with the one, and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to weie litigious and controuersed causes.</p>
            <p>8 Such as are magistrates to whom the deciding of causes &amp;
punishing offences is committed,<note place="margin">Qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a gistrate.</note> should be chosen out of al the
people the best and fittest men for their wisedome and courage;<note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note>
their religion and heartie affection to the truth, and for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
which they beare to couetousnesse. For this is no office
for a foole: and he that feareth not God will shewe partialitie; he
that loueth not the truth will iustifie the wicked, and condemne
the innocent; he that hateth not couetousnesse will take rewards,
and be corrupted with bribes as the sonnes of Ely which receiued
gifts with the one hand, and with the other peruerted iudgement.
The eyes euen of the wise are blinded herewithall. Feare also, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and commiseration, with desire to please men, are great
hurts vnto iustice. Pilate for feare of Caesar gaue sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ: For feare of displeasing a man on earth hee mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
the king and God of heauen. Whom monie cannot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
affection will carie away, it is the cutthroate of al iustice, the
people daily both feele it and rue it. Pitie or commiseration made
Iosua spare the miserable Gabionites, contrarie to the expresse
commaundement of God.<note place="margin">Luc. 23.</note> Desire to please caused Pilate to send
Iesus ouer vnto Herod, who together with his band despised and
mocked him. It caused Herode to imbrue his hands in the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
bloud. It causeth many euen against the light of their owne
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17219:93"/>
consciences to iustifie the wicked and condemne the man whom
they finde innocent. Such doe very ill discharge the debt which
they owe vnto their brethren.</p>
            <p>9 The minister is also a debtor to the people committed to
his charge.<note place="margin">The debt of the minister to his flocke.</note> I am a debtor saith the Apostle both to Greekes and

these things against him beareth not in deed hearty and true loue
towards him. <hi>Therefore is loue the fulfilling of the Lawe.</hi> So that you
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17219:94"/>
see great cause why we should enter into this holie and Christian
band of loue.</p>
            <p>16 But whom must we loue?<note place="margin">Loue is due to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; &amp; who they be.</note> Thou shalt loue thy neighbour.
And who is our neighbour? Not hee onely to whom wee are ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by familiar acquaintance, by alliance or neerenesse of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but whosoeuer doth neede our helpe he is our neighbour, be
he Iewe or Gentile, Christian or Infidell, yea friend or enemie,
he is our neighbour. To him wee ought to bee neere to doe him
good. It is friuolous for thee to obiect, hee is mine enemie, hee
hath many waies wronged me, he hath raised slanderous reports
of me, he hath practised against me, spoiled and robbed me: how
can I loue him? If Christ had loued his friends onely, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
loued thee whosoeuer thou art. Loke vpon him whose hands
were stretched out vpon the crosse for his enemies, and for thee
when thou wast his foe. No man proposeth him as a paterne to
be followed whom in his heart he doth mislike. Thou mislikest
thine enemie because he hateth thee; if thou hate him then doest
thou imitate the very thing which thou hatest. Loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
therefore without exception; and loue him as thy selfe.</p>
            <p>17 For after this maner wee ought to loue.<note place="margin">Howe we ought to loue others; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our selues.</note> No man hateth
his owne fleshe, no man is enuious of his owne commoditie or
preferment. Nature breedeth a selfeloue in euerie man. And as
this Lawe of nature doth woorke in vs a very feruent and carefull
desire both to procure vnto our selues whatsoeuer wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
is good, and to auoide whatsoeuer seemeth hurtfull or
noysome: So the Lawe of charitie requireth at our handes like
readinesse and cheerefulnesse to benefite others. Of loue towards
our selues we hide and very warily couer all such faults as might
any way worke our discredit or disgrace. If we loue our brethren
as our selues, we will no more blase their offences than our own.
Charitie doth hide the multitude of sinnes. But when we inlarge
the sins of other men, that they may seeme great; or recken them
vp by one and one, to make them appeare as if they were many;
how fulfill we the Lawe of charitie? would wee doe this in our
owne transgressions? we are neuer wearie in dooing good to our
selues, but to doe good to others wee haue no sooner begun but
we are euen tired. Our selues we loue not in woord and shew but
in truth and in deede. If wee speake deceitfully euerie one to his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17219:95"/>
neighbour, if we flatter with our lippes, if we carie in our heads a
double tongue, and in our bodies a double heart, and say wee
loue: we lie. Which of vs beeing in his right minde doth lift vp
his fist to strike himselfe? If any part of our bodies be out of frame,
any bone out of ioint, we seeke by and by all the helpe we can to
set it in. The name of strife and contention would neuer he heard
of, if we were thus affected towards others. The onely breache
of peace is the want of loue, he that loueth al men wil haue peace
with all men.</p>
            <p>18 Yet this doth suffer a kind of exception. <hi>Haue peace with
all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A caution to be obserued in louing one another.</note> saith the Apostle, but he addeth: <hi>if it may be, and as much as
in you lieth.</hi> It may not be which may not be lawfully. Wee may
not so yeeld vnto loue, that wee yeeld vnto sinne withall; not so
haue peace with our neighbors,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> that to continue loue with them
we depart from the faith and loue of God; or that for peace sake
we flatter and followe our neighbour in his euill. That were to
fall out with Christ, that we may keepe in with men. If thy hand
or eye offend thee, cut the one off, plucke the other out: Loue
Gods creation, but hate all sinnefulnesse: the Lorde also doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
it. And therfore we must be well content to loose the loue
and beare the enmitie of the whole world, for the loue we beare
to God and his trueth. With that strife to keepe this peace the
Lord is pleased.</p>
            <p>19 But we are fallen into these euill times wherein iniquitie
aboundeth and charitie waxeth colde.<note place="margin">The great want of loue in these our times.</note> Heartie loue is turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heartie hatred, our handes are bloudie, and our hearts maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Hee liueth not that loueth his neighbour as himselfe. If
we did loue our neighbours as our selues, we would not oppresse
them with extortion and vsurie; we would not vndermine them,
and wring them in bargaining; we would not so proudely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
them, so spitefully enuie them, so impudently slander
them, or so greedily practise for their infamie and discredit; wee
would not speake them faire, and mind them euil; fawne on them,
and betraie them; seeke our credit by their reproche, our gaine
by their losse; when we see their necessities, we would releeue and
succour them, binde vp their wounds with the good Samaritan,
and charitably prouide for them. When wee suffer them for
want to perish in our streetes, this is an euident token and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17219:95"/>
argument that wee neither loue God neither them that are
of God: neither him, nor his. If the vertues which are in loue be
not found in vs, but if contrariwise we abound in those vices from
which loue is free; if we be voide of patience and courtesie, full of
enuie and froward dealing; if we swell in pride, and care not what
we do to aduance our selues aboue others; if euerie mans care be
only for himselfe; if our wrath be kindled with euerie light occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; any thing suffice to make vs alwaies thinke the worst that
can be surmised, and doe the woorst that can be inuented; if wee
rather be glad at the fall of our brethren, than reioice when they
constantly abide in the truth; if we be come to that passe, that we
can in a maner suffer nothing, beleeue nothing, hope nothing,
beare and endure nothing: what should we say but acknowledge
the arrearages in which we are cast, and confesse that wee haue
left that debt of loue which wee owe to our brethren vndischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
God graunt vs grace to amend this bad paiment, least hee
paie vs our due punishment. Thus much of our duetie towardes
our neighbour set downe in these words <hi>Owe nothing, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20 Nowe followeth the duetie which we owe vnto God. <hi>And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that considering the season,</hi>

               <hi>that it is nowe time wee should arise from sleepe.
For nowe is our saluation neerer than when we beleeued. The night is past,
and the day is at hand. Let vs therefore cast away the workes of darknesse,
and let vs put on the armour of light, so that wee walke honestly as in the

workes of darkenesse, to put on the armour of light, to put off
the olde man Adam, and to put on the new man Christ; to shake
off the ragged coate of sin, &amp; to cloath our selues with the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vesture of innocencie; to absteine from euill, and to doe good;
in a word, to repent and amend. Why wee should thus doe our
Apostle giueth reasons: The time doeth require that nowe wee
should arise from sleepe, our saluation is neere, the night is past,
and the day hath dawned.</p>
            <p>21 This time requireth a newe life.<note place="margin">The time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the paiments of this debt.</note> For this is the last houre;
the acceptable time; the day of saluation; the day when as God
doeth visite vs in his mercie, calling vs to the knowledge of him
and of his sonne Christ, by the preaching of the gospell to the
sauing of our soules. O that we could knowe the day of our visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and would take hold of this gratious time of mercie. Arise
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17219:96"/>
at length, arise from sinne, and redeeme the time past and lost.
We haue long yea too too long slumbered: it is now more than
high time to arise, to arise from slepe of error, of sin &amp; of securitie.</p>
            <p>22 Many are fallen asleepe in the blinde errors of mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;<note place="margin">The blindnes in which the world slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, althogh the night be past.</note>
many are yet drowned in the dregges of poperie, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
dreames, fancies, lies and fables before the heauenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Gods euerlasting trueth. The cause of this their blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is ignorance of the scriptures; the cause of their ignorance
is the hardnesse of their hearts. They neither knowe, they are so
ignorant; nor will knowe, they are so stubborne. When they are
exhorted to reade, they close their eies; when to heare, they shut
their eares; when to come, they drawe backe their feete. If the
sunne shine neuer so bright, they see it not; if the trumpe sound
neuer so lowde, it will not waken them. Christ compareth them
very aptly to the hard stonie way, whereon what good seede soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is cast, is lost; it can take no roote: for either it is eaten vp by
birds, or trodden downe by men. The stubborne-hearted and
stiffe-necked Iewes were cast into this dead sleepe, establishing
their owne righteousnesse, and reiecting the righteousnesse that
is in Christ Iesu, reposing saluation in their externall sacrifices &amp;
ceremonies, not seeking it there where it was onely to bee found,
in Christ which was the sacrificed Lambe from the beginning of
the worlde, that onely taketh away the sinnes of the worlde.
As those were then; so nowe these are: who with the proude
Pharisees iustifie themselues by their owne defiled woorkes,
not regarding the true iustification which we haue in Christ tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
faith, preferring the sacrifice of the blasphemous masse the
meere inuention of man or of Satan before the sweet and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
sacrifice which Christ made for vs vpon the crosse once,
not to be renued; and sufficient not needing helpe. Men they are
of dull eares and of hard hearts, a rebellious and froward genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to whom whatsoeuer we speake, this account we may make
before hand,<note place="margin">Ezech. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Surely they will not heare,</hi> neither will they arise from
the error wherein Satan hath rockt them asleepe, crie the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

               <hi>and the glorie of the Lord is risen vpon thee.</hi> The light is

            <p>23 Arise thou that sleepest,<note place="margin">As many sleepe in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, so the most in sinne.</note> whether it bee in error or in <hi>sinne.</hi>
This sleepe is so pleasant that all the world lieth in it, and hardly
can shake it off. King Dauid fell into it, and continued in it, slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
very soundly, neuer lifting vp his head for two yeres space,
till at the length Nathan the Prophet at the commaundement of
God awakened him. Zacheus slept a long time pleasauntly in his
vsurie with heapes of euill gotten goods vnder his heade, till the
sonne of God himselfe called vpon him and lifted him vp, by
whose voice hee was effectually and throughly wakened: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that his eyes beeing nowe opened to see the ouglinesse of
his sinne wherein he had so long time before slumbered, hee not
onely made restitution but also gaue the one halfe of al his goods
to the poore. This man awaked in an happie time. It is most
dangerous to slumber long in sinne. Custome of sinne maketh
sinne familiar, so that at the length we learne not to feare it at all,
but rather to take delight and pleasure in it, to commit it as the
Apostle saith with a kinde of <hi>greedinesse,</hi> to count sinne no sinne,
to swallowe it down without any remorse or contradiction. Their
case is lamentable which are thus fallen asleepe, and for the most
part their end miserable.<note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> Such was the sleepe of that riche man,
who hauing filled his barnes and prouided store for many yeeres
incouraged himselfe to sensualitie, <hi>Soule take thy rest.</hi> You that
loue the rest of your soules in deede, keepe your soules waking,
and doe not suffer them to take rest.<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Awake thou that sleepest,</hi> and
takest thy rest; <hi>stand vp from the dead and Christ shall giue thee light.</hi> It
is time to awake, we haue slept too long. God would not haue
vs to sleepe vnto death, but to awake vnto life: for he wil not the
death of a sinner, his desire is rather that we should repent. Now
is the time, nowe Christ calleth thee, nowe he stretcheth out his
armes, nowe he offereth mercie: come vnto him and thou shalt
finde true rest for thy wearied soule. Long hath beene thy sleepe,
great hath beene thy sinne: but God is full of compassion, prest
and readie not onely to graunt but to offer pardon. If nowe wee
refuse it offering it selfe to vs, it will refuse vs hereafter when wee
offer our selues to it.</p>
            <p>24 Of this we are not afraide,<note place="margin">Sleeping in securitie.</note> because we sleepe as well in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
as in sinne. We must therefore be raised out of this sleepe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17219:97"/>
also. Mans life is a warfare, and men are souldiers: we must keepe
our standing and watche, least we be vnawares both assaulted and
surprised. We haue both many and mightie and fierce aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
The diuell, who is violently and greedily set as an hungrie
Lyon, that roareth for his pray; The worlde, which hath infinite
slights to deceiue vs; The flesh, which mightily striueth &amp; wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
against the spirite. There is no place of securitie left for a
Christian souldiers there being so many great dangers. There is no
where any place wherein it is safe to be secure. <hi>Not in heauen,</hi> saith
Bernard,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> 
               <hi>nor in Paradise: much lesse in the world.</hi> In heauen the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
fel from the verie presence of the Godhead; Adam fel in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
from the place of pleasure, and Iudas in the world from the
schoole of our Sauiour. In the time of Noe they liued in great
securitie and the floud sodainely ouerwhelmed them. In the time
of Lot the Sodomites liued in as great securitie and were as sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
consumed with fire. Thus with fire and water securitie
hath beene plagued. God hath armed the verie elements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that thing, wherein notwithstanding we continue, as if we
would trie whether hee which wakened them by sending water
vpon the one and fire vpon the other, would waken vs by causing
the earth to swallowe vs vp. What we should looke for, GOD
doth best knowe; our securitie being the same with theirs can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
no lesse to vs than it brought to them. Wee crie peace
peace: what more euident token can there bee that our sodaine
destruction is at hand? Men are commonly neerest vnto perill
both corporall and spirituall, when their mindes are furthest
from thinking of preuenting it. It is written of the people which
were in Laish that because they had no businesse with any bodie
nor any bodie with them, no man raised any tumult or vsurped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dominion in their Land, and the place which they inhabited
was good and lacked nothing, therefore they dwelt carelesse,
quiet and sure. Which when the spials sent foorth from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Dan had once perceiued, they made no doubt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
the Land, but encouraged their brethren and set them
forward: <hi>Be not slouthfull to goe and enter, to possesse the Land. If yee will
goe ye shall come vnto a carelesse people, the countrie is large: surely GOD
hath giuen it into your hands.</hi> They went vp being onely sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, came to Laish, found the people without all mistrust
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17219:97"/>
of danger, put them to the sword, and burnt vp their citie. Their
peace bred plentie; their plentie, securitie; their securitie, their
destruction. And as in daungers of the bodie, so likewise or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much more in perils which beset the soule we shal find those
temptations most grieuous which assault vs at vnawares. For
this cause we are in scriptures so often called vpon to be watche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note>
               <hi>Watche and praie,</hi> saith our Sauiour, <hi>that ye fall not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Hee that falleth into temptation asleepe hardly riseth out of
temptation aliue. For if they that watch continually be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
but with much adoe: what shall become of them, vpon
whom Satan then laieth hands, when beeing lustie and strong
hauing whatsoeuer their hearts can wish, they are at peace, take
their rest, and because they haue no change, therefore feare not
GOD? Surely their destruction is as the swelling of an high
wall, it commeth sodainely downe and they are fearefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.
Watch therefore and sleepe not in securitie. Blessed is he
that watcheth.</p>

the trueth by it, wee seeke saluation, wee haue beene long
scholers, we ought nowe to growe to some good perfection: we
draw now neere vnto the end, therfore we shold amend our pace
in this our course. The neerer we come to the end of our race, the
faster we should run, if we desired to get the reward we runne for.
Let vs doe so. And seeing the race that we haue to run is euen in
a maner finished, and the crowne we run for is immortall, let vs
be earnest in the cause, let vs cast off all hinderaunces and striue
industriously vnto that saluation which is set before vs. Nowe
that wee are almost as it were within the reache of the crowne of
glorie, let vs take strength vnto vs, let vs double our courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our zeale, adde more and more vnto euerie good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
gift which wee haue receined from the father of light.
This the neerenesse of our saluation doth now especially require.</p>
            <p>26 Let them that sit in darkenesse and in the shadowe of
death sleepe on.<note place="margin">The night is past.</note> But vnto vs the night is past. Night in the
scriptures is taken for ignorance, the times whereof are now past.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17219:98"/>
The day starre is risen and hath appeared vnto vs. Christ the true
light is come into the world; he that nowe will walke in darknesse
is not blinde but wilfull, and runneth with open eyes to his owne
damnation. If the light had not come into the world, <hi>if I had not
spoken vnto them,</hi> saith Christ, they might haue pleaded ignorance;
but I haue tolde them the trueth, therefore they are left without
excuse. Christ that light of the worlde hath appeared, his crosse
is painted out before our eyes. If our Gospell bee hid it is from
them that perish, whom the God or rather the diuel of this world
hath blinded. We are in the light, the way of truth lyeth plaine
and open before our faces. Let not vs walke nowe as the children
of darkenesse. For darkenesse and the night are past.</p>
            <p>27 <hi>The day draweth neere.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The last day draweth nere.</note> The day of euerie mans particular
dissolution, and the day of that generall iudgement of all men.
Although the day of our death be vncertaine; yet because all our
daies are fewe, our first day is no sooner come but we are sure and
certaine that the last draweth neere. Wherefore it behooueth vs
continually to watch, to looke for our ende, and to put our selues
in a readinesse for it. For as we are found in that day, so shall we
finde in the day after that; the day of the glorious appearing of
Christ, when all secrets shall be vnsealed, al faults made manifest,
and euerie man receiue a blessing or a curse as he hath wrought in
his bodie good or bad. Many daies are past since Christ and his
Apostles did count it neere: therefore nowe it must needs drawe
much neerer and be euen at the doore. We may nowe say iustly,
It is time to rise from sleepe. Our saluation is neerer than
when wee beleeued. The night is past, the day draweth
on.</p>
            <p>28 Let vs walke honestly therefore as in the day.<note place="margin">We must therfore walk honestly as in the day.</note> We are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
and redeemed to walke and serue God, in whose seruice if

our conuersation according to our good profession. Wee
are set as it were vpon a stage: the worlde, Angels and men fixe
their eies vpon vs. And if the eies of all these were closed, yet he
to whom the night and the light are all one in clearenesse, our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

            <p>29 This we shall doe if we followe the counsell and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Sinnefull actions are called woorkes of darkenesse. First
because much sinne springeth out of ignorance which is blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and darkenesse; wherefore S. Paul alledgeth ignorance to be
the cause why hee persecuted the Church of Christ: Secondly
for that sinners, because their workes are euil, hate the light which
discouereth them, and loue darkenesse wherein they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
them. Thirdly because the workes of sinne are to bee cast
into that perpetuall and vtter darkenesse of hell, and bound in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
cheines of darkenesse vnto the iudgement of that
great day.</p>
            <p>30 Howbeit for that it sufficeth not to abstaine from euil but
it is required that we should doe good,<note place="margin">We must put on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of light.</note> therefore the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
vs not onely to cast away the woorkes of darkenesse, but
<hi>to put vpon vs the armour of light.</hi> Wherein looke what was saide
why sinne should be called by the name of darknesse the like may
on the contrarie side be saide why righteousnesse should bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the name of light.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> First for that good woorkes are the
fruits of the light of knowledge, wherein if we encrease more and
more in loue and in all spirituall vnderstanding we shall not onely
put a difference betwene those things that are more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but
bee pure also and without offence vnto the day of Christ filled
with the fruites of righteousnesse which commeth by Iesu Christ
vnto the glorie and praise of God; Secondly because they that
walke honestly as in the day time,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 1. Iohn 1.</note> delight in the light: <hi>For he that
doth the trueth commeth to the light that his deedes may be made manifest,
that they are done in God who is light and in him is no darknesse at all:</hi> And
therefore insomuch as they well vnderstande that the night will
come, wherein no bodie shall be able to worke, while they haue
the light they giue themselues to walk in the light, that they may
be the sonnes of the light; And thirdly because as Bernard saith,
<hi>Bona opera non sunt causae regni sed via regnandi:</hi> Good workes are not

fewe circumstances concerning them
wherein I will be short. We learne in
the text that goeth before in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that God was displeased with his
people the Israelites. And that it
might appeare how iust cause hee had
of offence giuen him, hee challengeth them, that his gratious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
towardes them, and their vnthankefulnesse towardes him
might be examined and tried in iust iudgement. And God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
the mountaines to be Iudges heerein, that is, as Ierome
expoundeth it, the Angels of heauen, whom God often vseth
as ministers for his glorie, and for the benefite of man. God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
therefore here by his Prophet first that hee neuer wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them, and therfore they had no cause to complaine; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he hath bestowed his manifold benefites vpon them, that
he deliuered them out of the house of bondage, from the tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

hands of cruell Pharao, whose slaues their fathers were; that
he had giuen them woorthie magistrates, and good Priestes to
rule, direct and instruct them, Moses, Aaron, Myriam, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that hee had turned Balaams cursings against them into bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
towards them. Nowe after that God had thus set forth his
great goodnesse towardes them, hee chargeth them with their
great vnkindenesse towards him: howe they fell from the seruing
of him to the woorshipping of false gods by running a whoring
after Idols, and sacrificing on their hill altars, committing most
grosse Idolatrie and foolish superstition: howe altogether they
contemned the woord of the almightie, the preaching of the
Prophets were drowned in sinnefull securitie, and fed themselues
with their owne phantasies the inuentions and vaine conceits of
man. These and such like were their faults, as may appeare in the
life of king Achas in whose time and raigne the prophecie was
written. The people vnable to gainesay so manifest a truth, were
forced to pleade guiltie, and to acknowledge their offences, and
therefore went about to seeke out meanes, howe to pacifie Gods
wrath and to satisfie for their sinnes, and being doubtful by what
meanes, or with what sacrifice, to please God, and appease his
anger, enquireth, <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord?</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Micheas directeth the doubtfull minds of the people in this

sundrie great benefites, so hath he blessed vs with the like

and deadly thraldome of Satan and sinne by the death and bloud
of Iesus Christ our redeemer, but also out of the seruile bondage
of the great Pharao, though lesser than the former, the Romish
Antichrist, who villanously bereaued vs of our spirituall libertie,
robbed vs of that inestimable treasure the woorde of God, and
oppressed vs with the intollerable burthen of vnprofitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
trained vs vp in ignorance, forced vs in Idolatrie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition

But God in his mercie hath remembred vs to doe vs good and to
worke our deliuerance, of bondslaues to make vs freemen, of the
children of darkenesse to make vs the sonnes of light in him, and
to restore vs to the comfortable freedome of conscience by the
gratious libertie of the Gospell. God hath also blessed vs with
good magistrates, hee hath not onely giuen vs his sonne Christ
the Prince of his people who by offering vp himselfe a sacrifice
for our sinnes procured vnto vs free remission of them, but hath
also blessed vs with worthie rulers vnder him, which gouerne in
equitie and syncerely seeke the glorie of God. He hath giuen vs
Moses our Soueraigne, a prudent and a gentle magistrate, who
seeketh not reuenge, but beareth with the muttering of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
yea with the rebellious Dathan and Abiron choosing rather
to put vp any tollerable wrong, than to see the ruine and subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

vs Aaron and Miriam, Priests and Prophets to minister vnto vs
the heauenly bread the foode of our soules, the woord of God,
the Sacraments of Christ, and that most faithfully and syncerely
without changing or mingling. And as I said of late in this place,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17219:100"/>
so I say againe, England hath at no time heretofore beene blessed
with so many and so faithfull preachers of Gods woord. Surely
God mindeth your saluation in that he so plentifully offereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of whose vnspeakeable goodnesse we haue receiued them.
The Israelites (their strange deliuerance out of Egypt, their good
Magistrates, their manifold blessings, benefites and graces not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding)
were found vnthankefull. And if God shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into iudgement with vs, and throughly examine vs (as one
day he will) may we not be accused and shall wee not bee found
guiltie of the like ingratefull crime? Haue wee not a longing as
they had vnto that from which the Lorde hath deliuered vs in
great mercie? God hath blessed vs with both magistrates and
ministers of great valewe, but so thankefull are we to him and to
them his seruauntes that wee can easilie abuse both, mutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the one, and despise the other; neither is obeyed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reuerenced according to the woorde and will of GOD.
But such as cannot away with Samuell, God in his wrath shall
giue them a Saul; and such as mislike of the true preacher, shalbe
rewarded with a false Prophet. The word is loathed; men are full
of the Gospell; and of many it is professed without all fruite, wee
shall therefore hunger for this bread, seeke it and not finde it; in
the stead heereof wee shall surfet vpon the fruite of our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
yea God in his iustice shall take his word from vs, and giue
it to a people that will bring foorth better fruites and more woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of so pretious a blessing. Thus truely considering our case,
&amp; entring into iudgement with God, we must with the Israelites
pleade guiltie and as professe his mercies so confesse our faults.</p>
            <p>5 The guiltie Israelites sought meanes howe to satisfie for
their sinnes.<note place="margin">The way which men haue deuised for remedie of this.</note> Their meanes were to sacrifice to God and to offer
vp calues, rammes and goates: yea some haue not shrunke to
powre the bloud of their owne children vpon the altar, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab
who offered vp his eldest sonne to pacifie the wrath of God,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17219:101"/>
when in battell he was beseeged and brought into straights. Euen
by like meanes, when our conscience hath accused vs of sin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
haue sought to make satisfaction to God for it: some haue
sought remission of sinnes in a great number of praiers vttered in
a strange tongue without either sense or zeale, neither made in
faith nor charitie, procuring hatred in Gods sight, while they
looked to be heard by their much babling: Some haue sought to
pacifie God by hearing and buying of many Masses, wherin God
was blasphemed and fowle Idolatrie committed: Some by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Christ the first begotten sonne againe, sacrificing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
as they thought vpon their hill altars for the dead and the
quicke: But they were deceiued. Some by the mediation of
Saints departed, robbing Christ of his office, who is the onely
mediator and intercessor betweene God and man: Some haue
thought to make amendes for their sinnes by buying popish par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
by taking their walkes in long pilgrimages to dumme and
senselesse idols, &amp; in such like not only vaine but impious deuises
of mans foolish braine. Thus sundrie haue sought out sundrie
ways some blasphemous and some of them ridiculous to appease
the wrath of God prouoked by their sinne. The Israelites doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by what meane to satisfie for their sinne, what God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they could not tell, they were altogether vncertaine which
way to please him. And truely it is lamentable that there bee so
many euen nowe in the cleare light of the sauing Gospell, which
doubt by what meanes they may bee saued, and in this doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
many still followe their owne fantasies, and through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
are led into the high way of damnation. Wherefore such
as are doubtful our Prophet Micheas clearely resolueth, such as
are out of the way he calleth into the right path, such as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
he instructeth, and such as will learne hee offereth to teache
what the good will and pleasure of the Lord is.</p>
            <p>6 He hath shewed thee,<note place="margin">The way which God hath prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by his Prophet.</note> O man, what is good and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him: surely not to take vpon thee to satisfie for sin thy selfe,
for that passeth thy power, all thy righteousnesse being but filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the pure sight of God; not to offer vp any sacrifice, as
being in it selfe propitiatorie for sinne, for that Christ onely hath
doone on the crosse and that but once and that for all: hee is the

shouldest followe thine owne phantasie, and doe that which is

we first learne this lesson: that no seruice wee doe to God can
please him, but such as himselfe in his woord hath prescribed; he
will be serued as he hath commanded in his lawe, and not as thou
hast deuised with thy selfe. That seruice which God in his word
doth not require at thy hands, if thou offer it him, it is in vaine
thou offerest. The Lord hath not asked it, and he wil not accept
it of thee. <hi>In vaine they worship me teaching doctrines the precepts of men.</hi>
It is not for nothing that God was so curious in platting foorth
the Tabernacle, and so precise in commaunding that all thinges
without exception should be doone according to that patterne.

thou teache another and doest not teache thy selfe? Doest thou
forbid mariage and thy selfe commit adulterie? Doest thou force
that yoke vpon others which thy selfe so shamefully shakest off?
What is emptinesse of reason and iudgement if this be not? The

Iustice and iudgement are commonly in the scriptures ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together because if there be a diuorce at any time betweene
these two, Gods familie and the common wealth goe to wracke
and ruine. The Psalmist seemeth to note a separation to haue

much heerein, I speake to wise and learned men which well
knowe their duetie, and I trust that the feare of God will direct
them Christianly to discharge the same: Yee doe not forget that
ye are called in the scripture God: not onely because yee are set
in Gods seate, but because ye are the mouth &amp; the hand of God;
the mouth to speake in awarding true sentence, the hand to strike
in executing iudgement without respect-of mens persons.
Wherein it behooueth you to take good heede, and to beware
what ye doe. For yee exercise the iudgement not of man, but
of God. If the seate be his, if ye be his mouth and hand, if sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be his, if his be the iudgement: then see to it that ye iudge
vprightly as the ministers of that vpright iudge. For there sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a iudge also vpon you: what measure you giue you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
when the great iudge shall proceede to his last and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

made him this answere, <hi>I robbe in deede with one litle shippe, but thou

            <p>12 God is no accepter of persons:<note place="margin">Acceptation of persons.</note> neither must you in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>13 The iudge may not giue place to commiseration:<note place="margin">Foolish pitie.</note> his place

crie of the Gabionites, the appearance of their miserable
estate and condition made the wise and woorthie iudge Iosua to
swarue from iustice and to breake the commaundement of the
almightie. The exclaming of the people hath many times as
much cause as had the harlots complaint made vnto Salomon

            <p>14 In proceeding in iudgement beware of swiftnesse and
much speede.<note place="margin">Iudgement neither too hastie nor too slowe.</note> It is good for a iudge commonly to haue leaden

ouer the harlots to the next terme,<note place="margin">1, Reg. 3.</note> but seeing by his wisdome the
truth of the cause proceeded foorthwith to iudgement. Paul was
set ouer from place to place,<note place="margin">Acts 24.</note> from terme to terme, and could not
receiue iustice; the cause is declared, Felix hoped for a fee. But
this fault of delaying iustice is laide vpon the Attorneies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
the Counsellers and Aduocates in the Lawe, who seeke
their greater gaine and wealth through the greater trouble and
losse of the people. If they would learne two short lessons of S.
Paul and learne withall to followe them, the matter easilie might
be amended. The one is to loue men &amp; not their monie. <hi>Non quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro

would quickely cut off many euil pleas, and driue back cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
controuersies.</p>
            <p>15 You to whom the sword of iustice and iudgement is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
take heede vnto it.<note place="margin">Partialitie.</note> Let it not spare mightie men: for their
sinnes are mightie sinnes. If such offend, their fall draweth down
others with them. God therefore commaunded Moses to hang
vp the princes of the people vpon gibbets that they might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of punishment who had beene examples in sinning. The
good Consul Iunius Brutus spared not his owne sonnes but cut
off their conspiring heads. And Aulus Fuluius in the like case
did the like thing. Pilate abused his office, when vpon sute hee
spared Captaine Barrabas the murtherer, and killed Christ our
sauiour. Spare not traitors, murtherers or theeues, least you bee
partakers of their sinnes. Your lenitie towardes them is crueltie
towards the common weale, the enemies of whose peace they
are. Serue God in feare, loue his trueth, promote his Gospell.
The seate, the iudgement, the sword is the Lordes, defend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his cause, see to the keeping of his statutes, enlarge his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
aduaunce his glorie: for he hath promised to glorifie them
that honour him, but they that despise him shall be full base: hee
shall make them vile and contemptible.</p>
            <p>16 Doing of iudgement may also generally be taken for iust

quarelling and contentious mindes of wranglers than to burthen
such as faile in their cause with great expenses &amp; amerciaments.
It would make them beware of quarels and vniust contending if

            <p>17 The second duetie to our neighbour is mercie:<note place="margin">As we must doe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so we must also loue mercie: which he that loueth doth not rashly iudge others.</note> Hee hath
shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth
of thee: surely to doe iudgement, and <hi>to loue mercie.</hi> Bee mercifull
saith our Sauiour as your father is also mercifull. This mercie as
Christ there teacheth wil shewe forth it selfe in three properties.
First it will bridle that vncharitable rashnesse of iudging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
others. <hi>Nolite iudicare,</hi> Iudge not. Mercie will not bee
hastie to iudge.<note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> There be iudgements ciuill, and iudgements Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall;
iudgements publike, and priuate iudgements. Christ
neither forbiddeth the magistrate neither the publike minister to
iudge according to the Lawe, neither the parent or master to
iudge and correct their offending children or seruaunts. It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
priuate iudgement which God forbiddeth when men
vnaduisedly take vpon them to giue sentence of others, as if God
had resigned his owne right into their handes: they condemne
whom they list, and say what they list, euen as they fancie so they
iudge. This man is a Saint and that man a sinner; he the seruant
of God, and hee the childe of death. Who art thou that so iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
anothers seruaunt? Is it not to his own master only to whom
he stands or fals? Who art thou that takest such seueritie vpon
thee? that dealest so vnmercifully with thy brother? He is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
so thou either art, or hast beene, or maist be: iudge therfore
thy selfe, trie and examine thine owne woorkes. Iudge I say thy
selfe and iudge not him least thou be condemned of the Lord, for
both not iudging and iudging.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> If a brother be ouertaken with a
fault, ye that are spirituall shew mercie, restore him with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of meekenesse: considering thy selfe, least thou also be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Verily this mercilesse iudging of others is the cause why wee
fall into many perils and secret temptations. Loue mercie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and iudge not. Hee that iudgeth with the Pharisee, with the
Pharisee shall be iudged.</p>
            <p>18 <hi>Another fruite of mercie is forgiuenesse. They who
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17219:105"/>
are hastie to iudge are for the most part in forgiuing slowe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Louers of mercie are readie to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and put vp iniuries.</note> 
               <hi>But

ought to correct and not to remit, because they deale not
with iniuries doone to themselues but to the lawes and common
wealth or church: But in priuate iniuries wee must all remember
the words and followe the example of our Sauiour. Be mercifull
and forgiue. Christ forgaue them that put him to death, Stephen
them that stoned him, Ioseph them that solde him, the king his
vnthriftie seruaunt 1000. talents. If wee forgiue not others, it is
in vaine to praie that which wee dailie praie,</hi> Forgiue vs. <hi>For so
doth Ecclesiasticus wel teache vs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclesiast. 28.</note> He that seeketh vengeance, shall
finde vengeance of the Lord: and he will surely keepe his sinnes. Forgiue they
neighbour, the hurt that he hath doone to thee: so shall thy sinnes be forgiuen
thee also, when thou praiest. Should a man beare hatred against man: and
desire forgiuenesse of the Lord? Hee will shewe no mercie to a man, that is
like himselfe: and will he aske forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes? If hee that is
but flesh, nourish hatred, and aske pardon of God: who will intreate for his
sinnes?<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
               <hi>And our Sauiours commaundement is,</hi> If thou bring thy gift
to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
leaue there thine offering before the altar, and goe thy waie: first bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to thy brother; and then come, and offer thy gift. <hi>Whereunto S.
Chrysostome alluding, saith,</hi> That God had rather want thy sacrifice
due to him: than reconciliation should not be made, betweene thee, and thy
brother.</p>
            <p>19 The next and third fruite of mercie mentioned by our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
is,<note place="margin">Merciful men are bountiful.</note> 
               <hi>Giue and it shall be giuen vnto you,</hi> He that loueth mercie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
almes, but the couetous man is cruell. God is so carefull to
haue the poore releeued that he hath bound himselfe by promise
to make almes most gainefull to the giuer: so that it is not in this
as in other common expenses, but <hi>whatsoeuer we laie out that we laie
vp.</hi> He that giueth to the poore lendeth to the Lorde, a sure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charger
of his debts to the vttermost. For hee leaueth not a cup
of colde water giuen in his name vnrewarded. The occasions
which we haue to shewe foorth this fruite of mercie are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great: we haue the poore with vs, and we haue them with
vs in great numbers. Are we not woorse than Iewes, if we suffer
our Christ, at whose hands we haue receiued all our riches, in
his naked and hungrie members to beg his bread at our dores, &amp;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17219:105"/>
pitifully to die euen in the midst of our streetes for distresse, for
colde and hunger? If our gospell bring foorth in steade of mercie
this crueltie, in stead of kindenesse this hardnesse of heart, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
God will take his pretious gospell from vs, and giue it to a
people that will bring foorth better and sweeter fruite. Nowe if
the loue of God and mercie towards our brother can not pierce
our flintie heartes, yet let shame of the worlde compell vs, and
our owne commoditie induce vs well to consider of this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
case. If that which is giuen were giuen in good order it would
ease this common griefe. By good order and wise prouision the
impotent might be so releeued, that they should not need to beg,
and such as are able might be forced in the sweate of their browes
to eate their owne bread. And if the matter were taken in hande
by them by whom it should, I doe not doubt but GOD would
touche the hearts of many a man with tender mercie that they
would both cheerefully and liberally contribute to this worke of
mercie, which God doth more esteeme than any other sacrifice,
nay he refuseth sacrifice and craueth this. The Lorde loueth a
cheerefull and a bountifull giuer and will plentifully reward him.
Let euerie good man set forward this worke: it is the worke of the
Lord, the fruite of mercie, good and gainfull not onely to others
but also to our selues. For behold howe the works of mercie doe
returne backe againe vnto them from whom they proceed. Iudge
not and you your selues shall not bee iudged, Forgiue and yee
shall bee forgiuen your selues, giue and it shall bee giuen vnto

turne away their faces from all men that desire any thing at their

aske to buie the loane with vsurie. The Iewes euen till this day
will not lend vpon vsurie among themselues, but lende freely to
their brethren and without gaine. Iudas himselfe that solde his
master for monie was not more cruel harted I suppose than these
men are who for monie deuoure their brethren. Their hearts are
yron hearts. They haue no sparke of pitie or compassion left in
them. Let them not thinke but that one day their gaine shall be
their exceeding losse. If Chrysostome thought that one euill

gotten groate laide vp amongest a chestful of monie would be as
a canker to fret out and eate vp the rest, what shall become then
of so much gotten by so vnmerciful &amp; vngodlie meanes? Where

            <p>21 Nowe that we haue seene what duetie we owe to men,<note place="margin">The dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God which the prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth at our hands.</note> let
vs see what God requireth to be performed vnto himselfe. Hee
hath shewed thee, O man, what is good. Our dutie towards him
is to humble our selues and to walke carefully with our God. He
that will walke with God must be of an humble heart. It is the
milde-hearted, and not the proude-minded; the Publican, and
not the Pharisee that walketh with him.</p>
            <p>22 To walke with him is to be syncerely and heartily carefull
to set forward his cause,<note place="margin">What it is to walke with God.</note> to promote his gospell, to defende his
trueth, to amplifie his kingdome to the vttermost of our powers.
Princes and they that iudge the earth whome God hath blessed
with so high an honour especially should in feare and reuerence
serue their God, loue his woord and gospell, earnestly &amp; cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
aduaunce, maintaine and defend true religion. They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to doe most good, and therefore most is required of them. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and ministers the dispensers of Gods blessed mysteries
should carefully trauell in their Lords cause and glorie, in season
and out of season to preache the gospell, euen so much as in vs
lieth: or else the <hi>Vae</hi> of God which hangeth ouer our heads shall
be powred downe vpon vs. But the saying of S. Paul is verified in
these our daies vpon al sorts of people, <hi>All men seeke their owne.</hi> The
preferring of true religion, the seeking of Gods glorie is the least
part of mens care or thought. It was otherwise with Moses who
both loued Gods seruice with perfect loue, &amp; hated superstition
with perfect hatred. Theodosius for want of this warmenesse &amp;
zeale in Gods quarell suffered by his too much lenitie the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
who denied Christ to be God quietly to spreade abroad their
heresies in his dominions without checke or controlling. The
good Bishop Amphilochius vpon this occasion repaired to the
Emperor who had at that time with him his sonne and heire Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17219:106"/>
The Bishop did his obeysance and dutie to the Emperor,
but saluted not his sonne; wherewith the Emperor finding fault
saide, Why salute ye not our sonne who shall sit on our seate?
No Emperor; for somuch as thou doest not care for the sonne of
God, but sufferest him to loose his honour and place, neither shal
thy sonne be regarded or sit on thy seate. Here at his owne cause
called into question hee waxed warme, and foorthwith expelled
the Arrians out of his dominions. Many of them who are hoat
in their owne matters are colde in Gods cause. Yet our Prophet
biddeth vs carefully to walke with our God and to bee earnest in
seeking of his kingdome and glorie.</p>

seene and marked of men and Angels. The world hath many eies,
eares, and tongues. London, Westminster, the Innes of Court

are as a fountaine from whence should spring all true religion, all
pietie, vertue and godlie conuersation. If this spring bee corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the riuers that flowe from it must needes bee polluted. If

A dogge returning to his vomit is a fowle and an ougly thing to

often mooued: but what effect hath it taken? God graunt
that there bee not a retyring from strength to weakenesse, from
vertue to sinnefulnesse. It is to be feared that many mens woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
zeale is transformed into colde securitie, their liberalitie into
greedinesse and biting vsurie, charitie into enuie, sobrietie into
wantonnesse, humilitie into pride and hawtinesse. This is the
common walking of men, for whom it were farre better if they
stoode still. The Apostle could not mention them but with
teares. <hi>There are many which walke,</hi> saith he, <hi>of whom I haue tolde you
often and now tell you weeping, they are enemies of the crosse of Christ, their
bellie is their God, their glorie is in their shame, their end is damnation.</hi>

walke we are sure to walke before him. We cannot shun his eie:
if we flie vp into heauen, he is there, if wee goe downe into hell,
there he is also. Hee seeth things doone in light and beholdeth
that which is couered with darkenesse: hee is priuie vnto mens
thoughts: he knewe the spitefull and malitious purposes of the

fruite: he looked vpon Cain shedding his brothers bloud: hee
perceiued the secrete sinnes of Sodome: he vnderstood the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

The cloaked adulterie and murther which Dauid had coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Our Lorde graunt this good effect for his great mercies sake.
Thus haue you heard the occasion, explication and application

that wise and mightie king, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat,
Ezechias, Iosias, Zorobabel,
with others most religious and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17219:108"/>
men which bare excellent rule in their dominions haue pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
trauelled not onely to builde, to amplifie and to inlarge the
kingdome of God by setting forwarde true religion, but also to
purge and reforme his temple by taking away such defilementes
and corruptions as grewe by meanes of carelesse gouernement.
The Apostles of Christ both among the Iewes and Gentiles did
first plant Churches by the diligent preaching of the gospel, and
afterward with like care and diligence visite them to see in what
state they stood, that if any thing were gone to decaie it might in
time be repaired.<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> This is recorded vnto vs in the historie of their
acts and deedes, and namely in the fifteenth chapter. Christ the
annointed king and priest, the great sheepeheard of the sheepe,
the perfect example giuen vs to followe did not onely goe about
through all Galilee and the costs of Iurie preaching the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the gospell and confirming his heauenly doctrine with
woonderfull miracles, but as it is in this present historie declared
perceiuing that through the subtiltie of Satan and couetousnesse
of the priests the temple of God was prophaned, in his pastorall
care he visited it and in the zeale of God voided them out which
did defile it. Howe the fathers of the Church and chiefe pastors
haue with great care and diligence euerie where at all times in al
ages doone the like I neede not declare vnto you, the histories are
plaine and plentifull. And thus considering my calling and the
charge committed vnto me, I thought my selfe by these former
examples in dutie forced and in conscience bound, not onely as
much as in me lieth to feede the flocke of Christ, but also to view
and see in what state the Church of God committed to my ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and gouernement standeth. And as Christ began with the
most magnificent temple of Ierusalem which hee found propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and polluted through the practise of the priests: so thought
I it conuenient and meete first to visite this most auncient and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
church, the head and example to all the rest, wel hoping to
finde it in better order.</p>
            <p>2 That we may learne by the doctrine and example of Christ
howe we ought to vse our selues in the house of God,<note place="margin">The Church purged, &amp; the vse thereof shewed by Christ.</note> as well for
the establishing of true religion &amp; of the syncere seruing of God,
as also for the expelling of that which is vaine, corrupt and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
there are in this action of Christ two thinges especially to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17219:108"/>
be considered of: first he commeth to Ierusalem, entreth into the
temple, findeth it full of corruption and doeth purge it, secondly
he teacheth the true vse of it, and sheweth them their fault who
did abuse it.</p>
            <p>3 Christ comming towards Ierusalem was at the first highly
magnified and receiued with applause of the people crying,<note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of Christ and his ministers in the world when they goe about to doe the worke of the Lord.</note> 
               <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanna,
Blessed is he that commeth king in the name of the Lorde, peace in
heauen and glorie on high.</hi> But this faire wether did not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.
So soone as hee entred into the citie and taught, the chiefe
priests, the Scribes &amp; the Princes of the people sought to destroy
him:<note place="margin">Luc. 19.</note> yea the people which before gaue so great applause crying,
<hi>Hosanna,</hi> soone after cried with a lowde voice, <hi>Crucifige.</hi> The gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in prosperitie hath many pretensed friends and fauourers: but
when it is persecuted by the wise and mightie men of the worlde,
then these counterfeits shewe themselues in their owne colours,
the hollownesse of their hearts is then descried. Let the minister
therefore which mindeth indeede the glorie of God beware that
he neuer depend vpon men whose mindes are changeable and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
wauering; but let him rest vpon GOD and relie himselfe
wholly vpon his prouidence. Let vs all faithfully and painefully
trauell in our function, making our selues readie for the crosse pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to suffer with Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>4 Being come to the citie hee streight way entered into the
temple,<note place="margin">Christs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the temple.</note> either as Gregorie noteth, to declare <hi>quòd ex culpa Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
ruina populi,</hi> that the fault of the priestes is the ruine of the
people, and therefore his principall care was to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them; or else to giue all men an example of diligence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
to the house of God.</p>
            <p>5 Hauing entred the temple he findeth there in steade of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
teaching the woord of God,<note place="margin">The state wherein he found the temple of Ierusalem.</note> drouers and brokers making
sale; in stead of pues for praier tables for exchange; in steade of
righteous men brute beasts; theeues in steade of a sanctified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.
Thus hee found the Church of Ierusalem disfigured
and forlorne: this was the state of that Synagogue at what time
he came to visite it.</p>
            <p>6 Howe to proceede in reforming a Church so greatly disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
our Sauiour hath taught vs by his owne practise amongst
the Iewes.<note place="margin">He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> He entred into the temple, threwe out the men that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17219:109"/>
bought and solde, whipped out the beasts, powred out the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
monie, turned their tables vpside downe, ouerthrewe the
seates of them that sold doues, and withall told them, <hi>Scriptum est,</hi>
It is written.</p>
            <p>7 In that wee reade howe Christ did all these things,<note place="margin">By whom the Church shold be reformed when things are found to be amisse.</note> wee are
thereby giuen to vnderstand at whose hands wee must expect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of things amisse in the Church of God. Christ had
authoritie to cast out of the temple whatsoeuer displeased him
because he was supreme Lord ouer it. The persons therefore to
whom this worke of reformation belongeth are not al men indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
but they onely to whom hee hath graunted the seate of
speciall authoritie in his Church. If they whom he hath set ouer
his house as principall seruaunts, guides and stewardes either ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly
or spiritually, as Moses or as Aaron to rule and gouerne it
vntill his comming shal in such maner as agreeth with their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places and callings performe his dutie in the church of Christ,
whosoeuer in such proceedings withstandeth them the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
rebelleth against God. Yea I say further when GOD
hath giuen his people kings which are as nurcing fathers,<note place="margin">Esay 49.</note> and
Queenes which are as nurcing mothers to his church, when
princes are not enemies but professors of the faith and protectors
of the faithfull, their hands ought to be chiefe in this worke: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it lawfull for subiects of what degree and order soeuer by
themselues to attempt alteration and chaunge in the church of
God though it be from woorse to better. In the daies of Iosias
Helchiah although he were the Lords high priest &amp; knew things
to be very much out of order,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 22.</note> did not thereupon according to the
custome of the turbulent and seditious, by woord or writing alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and estrange the mindes of the people from the present kind
of gouernment either of the Church or publike weale, but peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
and orderly hee sent Shaphan the Chauncelor to the king:
who perceiuing the things which were amisse, went immediatly
vp to the house of the Lord with all the men of Iuda and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Ierusalem with him, and the priests and prophets &amp;
al the people, where the faults and abuses being cleerely set down
that euerie one might see them, he gaue commandement to Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah
the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the
keepers of the doore to bring out of the temple of the Lorde all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17219:109"/>
the vessels that were made for Baal. Thus the prince did his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the priests theirs, he by iniunction, and they by execution;
they instructing him, and he strengthening them in the worke of
the Lord. Seeing therefore we haue on the one side (the name of
the Lord be blessed for it) the highest power zealous for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God as theirs was, let not vs whom this care ought especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to touche, shewe our selues lesse readie than they were to
bring out of the temple of the Lord all such filthie corruptions as
are crept into it by the wicked dealings of those vngodlie men
which care not howe shamefully they pollute and defile it, let not
vs whom the Lord hath made the ouerseers of his house be sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in proceeding to sweepe, cleanse and purge it according as
Lawes and statutes haue wisely prouided in this behalfe; let vs
consider that we are the Lords labourers,<note place="margin">Ier. 1.</note> that the worke we haue
in hand is his husbandrie, that our duetie is as well to destroie as
to build, to roote out as to plant.</p>
            <p>8 But what is that which we must labour to destroie?<note place="margin">What was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Christ in the temple.</note> what
weedes be those which we must indeuour to root out? We reade
here that our Sauiour did cast buyers and sellers out of the temple
terming them <hi>Theeues.</hi> For although to buy and sell be actions in
themselues lawfull and honest: yet the time and place with other
circumstances may so change their qualitie, that he which buieth
shall be as one that robbeth, and hee that selleth as one that stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.
They bought and solde in the temple, this Christ condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
Yet beholde what a beautifull colour they had set vpon
their wicked practises to make them seeme allowable before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For of the iudgement of God they made no account. It is written
in the Law, <hi>Thou shalt eate before the Lord thy God in the place which
he shall choose to cause his name to dwell there,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the tithe of thy corne, of thy
wine and of thine oyle, and the first borne of thy kine, and of thy sheepe, that
thou maist learne to feare the Lord thy God alway. And if the way bee too
long for thee, so that thou art not able to carie it because the place is farre
from thee where the Lorde thy God shall choose to set his name, when the
Lord thy God shall blesse thee, then shalt thou make it in monie, and take the
monie in thine hand and goe vnto the place which the Lorde thy God shall
choose, and thou shalt bestowe the monie for whatsoeuer thine heart desireth,
&amp; shalt eat it there before the Lord thy God, and reioice both thou and thine
housholde.</hi> Vnder pretense of prouiding that according to this lawe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17219:110"/>
men which dwelt farre off might alwaies at their comming to the
temple haue sacrifices there and offerings in a readinesse to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
before the Lord, their couetous humor fed it selfe vpon the
people without all feare of God, without any reuerence at all of
his sanctuarie. May they not iustly be termed <hi>Theeues,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thus to serue the Lord in his sacrifices, robbed and spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him in his Saintes? No doubt Ierusalem had shee knowen
the things which belonged to her peace would haue blest the
houre wherein the Lorde of the house came to ease that holy
place of so intollerable burthens, to rid his temple of so noisome
filth.</p>
            <p>9 Now because the roote from whence these abuses and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
grewe,<note place="margin">What wee should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> was the setled wickednesse wherewith the hearts
both of the priests and people were possest, therefore wee may
without swaruing from the true intent of this historie, take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
heere to note some speciall pollutions of the mysticall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of GOD which is his Church, and to shewe the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of remoouing them. Wherein (as the present occasion
of our assemblie at this time requireth) I will especially touche
such as properly belong to that part of the Church which hath
the spirituall regiment of the other. This therefore is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
matter which now we haue to obserue in the fact of our Lord
and master Christ, that if in visiting our temples wee finde them
possessed with wicked pastors, they are not there to bee suffered,
the rodde of seueritie must whippe them out. Who bee good
sheepeheardes and who be theeues it is soone discerned, yee shall
knowe them by their fruites.</p>
            <p>10 Vnto good pastors our Sauiour opposeth hirelings,<note place="margin">The vnkinde affection of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil pastors.</note>
theeues and robbers, shewing also the difference betweene the
one and the other.<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> The good sheepeheard loueth his flocke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,
it grieueth him not to powre out his verie soule for their
sakes, he gathereth them as Lambes into his armes, carieth them
in his bosome, and kindely intreateth them. Contrarywise the
hireling careth not for the sheepe, he beareth a sterne and a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
heart towards them. And as their inward affections are farre
different, so their outward actions are much vnlike, whether we
looke vpon their entring into their function or their dealing after
they are entred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:17219:110"/>

               <hi>to him the porter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth:</hi>
He taketh not this honour vnto himselfe, but expecteth a

to whom Christ hath giuen power and authoritie to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine.<note place="margin">2. Mat. 4.</note>
But theeues and robbers <hi>clime vp another way,</hi> they winde in
themselues by vnlawful meanes, with monie they purchase the
roomes which they occupie in the Church of Christ. Thus did
Menelaus get the priesthoode from Iason at the handes of the
king by giuing three hundred talents of siluer more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
albeit hee had nothing in himselfe woorthie of the high
priesthood, but bare the stomacke of a cruel tyrant and the wrath
of a wilde beast. Thus Leo the tenth, Innocentius the eighth,
Siluester the third, two Gregories, the sixt and the twelfth, yea
the most part of the Bishops of Rome for many yeeres haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
their popedomes. Thus doe their Cardinals, Bishops and
Prelates; thus doe their clergie euen to this day. And I would to
God this were onely their fault. A thing both condemned by the
commendable Lawes, decrees, and constitutions of sundrie
Councels, and also by the blessed Apostle S. Peter so grieuously
accursed in him whose heart was first therewith infected, that in
the whole bodie of the sacred Scripture a note of the like indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
conceiued against any other sinne (as I am perswaded) can
scarcely be found. For why? If they which bought and solde but
the beasts of the field and birds of the aire, doues, sheepe and ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
in the place which God had sanctified to himselfe, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
termed by a name that declareth their dealings to haue beene
as much abhorred in his sight as if they had spent all the daies of
their life in theft &amp; robberie, how can we think any bitternesse of
speeche or sharpnesse of punishment too great for so extreme li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiousnes
as theirs that make sale of the cure of soules, that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for the gifts of the holie Ghost? For so they are. The making
of Bishops, the bestowing of benefices, the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, instituting
and inducting of pastors, the placing of teachers, guides and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseers
in the Church, is and should be accounted the very work
of the holie Ghost. Attend, saith S. Paul, take heed to your selues
and to the whole flocke,<note place="margin">Acts. 20.</note> wherein <hi>the holie Ghost</hi> hath placed you
Bishops to rule the Church of God which hee hath purchased
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17219:111"/>
with his owne bloud. Whosoeuer therfore be the man that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
to staine a thing so holie with the execrable filth of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
dealing, of buying, selling, couenanting, bargaining ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for monie or monie worth, may it not as iustly bee saide to
him as to Magus,<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> 
               <hi>Thy monie perish with thee because thou thinkest that
the gift of God may be obteined with monie: Thou hast neither part nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
in this buisinesse: for thine heart is not right in the sight of GOD?</hi>
I counsel them with S. Peter that are in the gall of this bitternesse,
and in the bonds of this iniquitie, betime to repent them of their
wickednesse, and to praie vnto God that if it bee possible the
thoughts of their hearts may be forgiuen them.</p>
            <p>12 It is a true saying,<note place="margin">Their euill dealing after they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</note> 
               <hi>Vix bono peraguntur exitu quae malo sunt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choata

neither are their proceedings likely to be good whose beginnings
are so greatly out of order. They which enter not into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as did Aaron wil hardly behaue themselues in the house of the
Lord as Aaron did.<note place="margin">2. Mac. 4.</note> Iason obteined a superioritie in the Church
by monie: But howe behaued he himselfe in this his purchased
function? Began he not immediatly to drawe his brethren to the
customes of the Gentiles? Did hee not by and by change their
Lawes and policies, and bring vp newe statutes contrarie to their
Lawe? As the good sheepeheard entring in at the doore when he
is entred, guideth his sheepe as Dauid in the discretion of his
hands, feedeth them carefully with wholesome doctrine, &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in all vprightnesse of holie and vndefiled conuersation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them: so he that climeth vp an other way after hee hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
himselfe in, seeketh nothing but to steale, kil and destroie. <hi>The
theefe commeth not but to steale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> 
               <hi>to kill, and to destroie:</hi> Hee hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ende or purpose.</p>
            <p>13 The onely thing that should be desired by the pastor is the
weale and benefite of his flocke.<note place="margin">They steale.</note> For if the marke whereat wee
shoote be but to make our commoditie by the Gospell of Iesus
Christ: wherein doe we differ from theeues and robbers? Is not
our intent and purpose the very selfesame with theirs? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. Peters exhortation is,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> Feede the flocke of God caring for
it <hi>not for filthie lucre</hi> but of a readie minde. If a man haue al know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in so much that he be able to speake with tongues, yea and
to prophecie, yet if the thing for which he laboureth be his owne
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17219:111"/>
gaine, if he vse this vocation than which nothing is more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and holie onely as a way or trade to liue by, whatsoeuer hee
receiueth with such a minde he stealeth rather than receiueth it.
This is that whereof the Lorde complaineth so grieuously by his
Prophets,<note place="margin">Mich. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The priests teache for hire,</hi> the prophets prophecie for
monie: yet will they leane vpon the Lord and say, Is not the Lord
among vs?<note place="margin">Eay 56.</note> And againe, <hi>These sheepeheards</hi> cannot vnderstand,
they all looke to their owne way, euerie one for his aduantage
and for his owne purpose. Moses blessing Leuie before his death
saith first, <hi>They shall teache Iacob thy iudgements and Israel thy Lawe,
they shall put incense before thy face,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 33.</note> and then addeth, <hi>Blesse O Lord his
substance, accept the worke of his hands.</hi> As if he should haue saide,
So long as Leuie and his sonnes doe not seeke their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
but thy glorie, thou art righteous and canst not forget to
prouide in large maner both for them and theirs. As indeede till
the men of that sacred order tooke fleshhookes in their hands and
sought to better their estate by force,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.</note> til they became like to gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
mastiues, rauening curres, who euer sawe the Leuite of the
Lord forsaken, or the sonne of the Leuite begging his bread? So
likewise the Church of GOD was neuer spoiled till her pastors
were ouercarefull to be inriched. In the prime and first appearing
of Christian religion as long as that heroicall contempt of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things continued in the guides and leaders of the people, what
heapes of worldly treasure were brought and laide downe euen at
their feete? Men thought themselues to performe nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of that profession into which they were entred, vnlesse they
sold away their lands, goods and possessions, and gaue al to make
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rich by whose meanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues were become righteous. The
contrarie to which affection as in other parts of the Christian

               <hi>Ye haue spoiled me, euen this whole Nation.</hi> If
therefore we be grieued (as who is not grieued?) to see the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke
that is made of the Church of GOD, let vs change our
earthly and worldly affection that he may change the condition
of his Church. God is no puruey or for theeues and robbers. Let
vs in synceritie and in truth, heartily and in deede despise our own
gaine for his glorie, and prooue him if hee will not rebuke these
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17219:112"/>
deuourers for our sakes.</p>
            <p>14 The next thing which Christ obserueth in theeues is this,<note place="margin">They kill when they teach not the truth which saueth: This some doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot teach, some because they wil not.</note>
they destroie the flocke and make as litle conscience to kill as to
steale. They kill not the bodies but the soules of men. The life
of the soule is the word of truth, wherein whosoeuer hath taken
vpon him to instruct the flocke of Christ, and either cannot or
wil not doe it, what doth he else but kil and destroie? Moses spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the obedience of Israel to the Lawes and statutes of their
God, <hi>This is,</hi> saith he, <hi>your wisedome.</hi> But howe came Israel by that
wisedome? Did they naturally knowe the Lord as beasts doe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
knowe their dammes? No, <hi>The Lord said vnto me,</hi> saith Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>Gather the people together and I wil cause them to heare my woordes,
that they may learne to feare me all the daies that they shall liue vpon the
earth, and that they may teache their children.</hi> So they came neere
and stoode vnder the mountaine, and were taught of God which
spake vnto them out of the midst of the fire. Thus God taught Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
then. Afterward he raised vp prophets among them of their
owne brethren, and they were taught by men like vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Neither hath God at any time ceased and left off, but from
the beginning of the world to this verie houre he hath giuen men
knowledge by instruction and saued his elect by teaching. Can
not God then giue wisedome from aboue without a teacher? Yes
God is able to mainteine the life of man without bread. But why
doe we talke of his absolute power when his wil is that Cornelius
be taught by Peter, Lydia by Paul, Paul by Ananias, the Eunuch
by Philip, euerie soule that is wise in the doctrine of saluation by
Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists, teachers appointed for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering

Wherefore when the Lorde meant a blessing to his people hee
made them this promise, <hi>I will giue you pastors according to my heart
which shall feede you with knowledge and vnderstanding.</hi> When their
pastors were voide of knowledge and vnderstanding this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a token that their ruine and destruction was at hande. Come
nowe,<note place="margin">Esay 56.</note> saith the prophet, <hi>all ye beasts of the field, come to deuoure euen
all the beasts of the forrest,</hi> this people cannot continue nowe, they
must needes perish: for <hi>their watchemen are all blinde, they haue no

knowledge, they are all dumme dogges and cannot barke, they lie asleepe and
delight in sleeping.</hi> We are vnworthie of our liues if we doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the woonderfull blessing of God in our ministerie at
this day. For howsoeuer it bee debased by some, yet is it so farre
off God be thanked from the state of the Iewish Clergie in those
daies, that I am perswaded there neither is nor euer was a more
learned ministerie in any nation vnder heauen. Neuerthelesse I
acknowledge, It is much to be lamented that the glorious Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Christ nowe shining with so perfect beautie as it doth, in
the midst of so great light so many should still remaine in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
liuing as men without God in this present world, and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
through the ignorance of his sauing truth. In the meane
while they which are the chiefe and principal causes hereof think
they haue very wel discharged themselues by accusing others, as
if when they against all both religion and reason haue drawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselues those possessions which ought to maintaine such
as labour in the Gospel, a Bishop by striking the earth with one
foote might raise vp learned pastors sufficient to furnish a whole
prouince. But whosoeuer bee the principall cause of this disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they vndoubtedly cannot wash their hands of it that presume
to take vpon them the charge of soules for which they knowe
themselues vnfit and altogether vnsufficient. In these which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie
because they cannot saue there is onely a defect, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it woorthily deserue punishment doeth neuerthelesse
mooue some pitie and compassion if there be a willingnesse to do
that which there wanteth abilitie to performe. But against such
as wittingly and wilfully suffer the sheepe for which Christ died
to die for want of instruction, the soules of them that perish doe
crie as the bloud of Abel against Cain for vengeaunce and wrath.

writeth that when barbarous nations saw how the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
priests which were captiues,<note place="margin">Sozom li. 2. ca. 5.</note> did by their sober and reuerend
behauiour damme vp the mouthes of euil speakers, they thought
them to be men full of wisedome and vnderstanding, and hoped
to finde fauour at the hands of God if they should woorship him
after the maner of those woorthie and graue sages. Could the
auncient Prophets, the blessed Apostles, the holie Fathers in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times haue inlarged the bounds of the Church in so strange
wise as they did had they not conuerted moe by the rare integrity
of their maners than by the force aud power of their words? Not
without cause therefore doth the Prophet make request in the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17219:113"/>
Psalme that the priests of the Lord may put on righteousnesse as
a garment. For if their shame be seene who shall hide the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the people? Thus we see what should especially be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the principall part of the house of God.</p>
            <p>17 It remaineth nowe that somewhat be spoken of the maner
of reformation.<note place="margin">The maner of reforming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple orderly.</note> Christ in reforming the Church proceeded or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
knowing that disorderly remedies of euils are as dangerous
as the euils for which they are sought. His orderly proceeding
appeareth in this, that he first visited and then reformed. Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
if they bee vsed according to the true intent and prupose
whereunto they were ordeined are needefull and profitable in the
Church. For howsoeuer they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nowe abused by men of corrupt
mindes, the cause for which they were first established was the
maintenance of truth, the rooting out of heresie, the confirming
of good orders, the redressing of things amisse, the continuing of
religion, peace &amp; innocencie amongst men. If we reape not this
fruite and commoditie by them the fault is in our selues: in the
parties visited, when they hide and conceale that which should
bee reformed; in the visitors when they are carelesse in admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing,
and if that doe not serue in punishing offenders detected
and lawfully conuicted before them. Let the one sort therefore
remember the sinne of Achan, howe close it was kept, and howe
God plagued Israel till it was reuealed: and let the other consider
the example of Christ which proceeded no lesse seuerely in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
than orderly in searching out the faults and abuses of
the Temple.</p>
            <p>18 The rod in the hande of the pastor is as necessarie as the
staffe,<note place="margin">Seuerely.</note> yea perhaps more, because they are moe whom feare doth
constraine than whom loue doth allure to become vertuous. It is
noted that in the daies of Iason a dissolute and carelesse high
priest, the inferior sort of priests being let alone were no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
about the seruice of the altar, but despised the temple and
regarded not the sacrifices, they became frequenters of games &amp;
heathenish exercises, not without great disgrace to their calling.
When Nehemias returning from captiuitie found that Eliashab
the high priest had chambered his kinsman Tobia in the court of

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17219:114"/>
beene laide, by which meanes it came to passe that they receiuing
not their portions were fled, and so the temple was left destitute,
this, saith Nehemias, grieued me sore. But whence grewe this
fault? Where did Nehemias laie the blame but in the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours?

faith to be most certain wherein we acknowledge the Church of

there was a time when the Lord gaue expresse charge &amp; coman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,<note place="margin">Ezech. 44.</note>

<hi>Loammi;</hi> amongst them God was knowne, but as for the nations
they heard not of him; Iudea was the onely garden of the Lord,
the rest of the earth was a meere wildernesse; they were the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
and we the forrest; they within the wals of the citie of God,
and we without; they citizens and we strangers. But nowe the
bounds of the Church are inlarged, her elders as it is in the booke
of reuelation do now sing a new song, Thou hast redeemed vs to
God by thy bloud out of <hi>euerie kindred,</hi>

in the flesh made with hands, were at that time without Christ, and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liants
from the common wealth of Israel, and were strangers from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunts
of promise, and had no hope, and were without God in the worlde.
But nowe in Christ Iesus ye which once were farre off are made neere by the
bloud of Christ. For he is our peace which hath made of both one, and hath
broken the stoppe of the partition wall.</hi> This wee are willed to <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
For is it not a thing verie memorable, that in vs GOD
should nowe accomplish the promise which hee made to his
sonne so long before,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Aske of me</hi> and I will giue thee the heathen
for thine inheritaunce and the vttermost coasts of the earth for
thy possessions? Is it not memorable that the furious rage of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17219:117"/>
whole world mightily opposing it selfe against the kingdome of
Iesus Christ, it should notwithstanding growe so soone to this so
exceeding greatnesse, and that by so weake meanes, from so small
beginnings? Nowe sith God hath brought this so strangely to
passe for our sakes, sith the Lord hath doone it for no other cause
but onely to open the doore of saluation vnto vs, with how great
ioie of heart ought wee to heare his voice when hee saith of the
Gentiles, Let them ascend to mount Sion, when hee saith of his
house, It shall be called the house of praier for all Nations? Hee
that will not shrowde himselfe vnder this vine, hee that entreth
not into this arke, hee that will not be partaker of these celestiall
treasures, these heauenly mysteries, this true bread of life so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offered vnto all nations, if his soule die the death who wil haue
pitie or compassion of him? Wherefore to conclude let vs bee
followers of Christ as becommeth his deare children, let vs learne
by his example to be carefull and zealous for the house of God,
to purge and cleanse it as much as in vs lyeth from al defilements,
that as oft as we doe reuerently &amp; religiously frequent it to heare
the word of saluation, to receiue the blessed Sacraments of the
Lord, to powre out our praiers and supplications before him, his
spirite groaning with our spirits, and our requests ascending tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the forcible intercession of that only mediator which is to
bee heard for his reuerence sake, wee may reioice in
our saluation and he be glorified by our reioysing.

to declare vnto vs, that Iesus Christ
crucified is the promised Messias, the
redeemer and Sauiour of all that doe
beleeue in him. Neither is this matter
cleared more perfectly by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

S. Peter in this Sermon which nowe
we haue in hand. For therein is comprised briefly but most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
the fulnesse of the gospell, the perfect doctrine of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nowe because the occasion of hauing it preached was Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
the captaine, and the preacher of it was Peter the Apostle;
I will note somewhat in either of them seuerally for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of that which the Sermon it selfe shall laie before vs.
In Cornelius therefore first, what maner of man he was, on what
occasion he sent for Peter, &amp; in what sort he receiued him at his
comming.</p>
            <p>2 The curious description which S. Luke maketh of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
here,<note place="margin">The person of Cornelius.</note> declareth him to haue beene a notable and rare man,
both by other circumstances of his person, and by his manners.
The other circumstances which I meane are his countrie, his
calling, and the place of his abode.<note place="margin">His countrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Touching his countrie he
was an Italian, an Ethnike, bred of Ethnike parents, trained vp
amongst a people drowned in idolatrie and superstition, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
false gods,<note place="margin">His calling.</note> being ignorant of the true God. By calling hee
was a souldier, a captaine of the Italian band, a captaine ouer one
hundred souldiers. The Romans had soldiers out of al prouinces:
but their chiefe force was of the Italians, whom they trusted best
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17219:118"/>
as naturall subiects.<note place="margin">His dwelling place.</note> This Italian captaine made his abode in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea

Iurie was brought in subiection to the Romane Empire: and least
the inhabitants thereof should reuolt, certaine garrisons of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were placed in sundrie of the greater cities, to see them kept
in obedience, and to represse tumults, Cornelius the captaine
with the souldiers of his retinue were bestowed in Cesarea. If
we looke on this mans countrie, if we consider his calling and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
if we call to remembrance in what place he liued, and with
whom he was conuersant: we shall finde nothing but idolatrie &amp;

5 Cornelius the Ethnike-captaine,<note place="margin">The estate of the Iewes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom Cornelius was placed.</note> being placed in Cesarea
ouer the Iewes, putteth vs in minde howe the kingdome of Israel

elect and welbeloued people of God,<note place="margin">Rom 9.</note> the happie seede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
to whom pertained the adoption, and the glorie, and the
couenant, and the Lawe that was giuen, and the seruices of God,
and the promises. A most free people as themselues boasted.
We are Abrahams seede,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> and were neuer bound to any man. A
plentifull land flowing with milke and honie, a most flourishing
kingdome, a mightie and victorious people; for the Lord of hosts
did fight for them. Yet this elect, beloued, free and mightie
people was ouerthrowen, wasted, translated, brought into most
miserable bondage and slauerie, first by the Caldeis, then by the
Meedes, afterward by the Grecians, and last of al by the Romans.
And this was the Lords dooing.<note place="margin">Ier. 27.</note>

               <hi>A kingdome is translated</hi> (saith he) <hi>from one
people vnto another, because of vnrighteous dealings, and wrongs, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
gotten by deceit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and couetousnesse and pride.</hi> The things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied
Sodome were pride, fulnesse of breade, aboundance of
idlenesse, and that she strengthened not the hand of the poore &amp;
needie. The sinnes that consumed Gods people in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and of sixe hundred thousand left but two aliue, was loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the heauenly Manna,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> and lusting after the flesh-pots of
Egypt, worshipping of idols, fleshly fornication, tempting of
God, and muttering against magistrates. The cause why Iurie
was laide wast and Israel caried away captiue was the contempt
of Gods woord preached by Ieremie three and twentie yeres:<note place="margin">Ier. 25.</note> and
that there was no trueth,<note place="margin">Osee 4.</note> no mercie, no knowledge of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. Swearing, lying, murther, theft, and adulterie
had gotten the vpper hand: and one bloud guiltinesse followed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17219:119"/>
an other. Therefore did the Land mourne, and euery one that
dwelt therein was rooted out. God is alwaies a iust God, one
that hateth all iniquitie, hauing no respect to countrie or calling.
If our faults be like we may looke for like punishment. Let vs
recount with our selues, and compare our selues with others.
Are we not as guiltie of vnrighteous dealing, of oppression, of
extortion, are we not as couetous, are we not as proude, as euer
any people was? Is there not as much pride, belly-cheere, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
vnmercifulnesse in the citie of London as was in the citie
of Sodome? Doe wee not as much loath the true bread of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?
Cleaue we not as fast vnto idolatrie and superstition? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
we not adulterie, and filthie fornication? Tempt we not God?
Doe wee not mutter against the magistrates, as the Israelites did
in the wildernesse? Is there more trueth, mercie and knowledge
of God, lesse swearing, lying, murther, theft, adulterie and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in England, than was in the Lande of Iurie? If kingdomes
then be translated for wrongfull dealing, for couetousnesse and
pride: howe can vnrighteous, couetous &amp; proude England stand
long? If God spared not the flourishing citie of Sodome, can he
in his iustice spare the sinnefull citie of London? If God ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe
the mightie people of Israel in the wildernesse for their
sinnes: can he winke at our fowle and manifold offences? If the
Land of Iurie was laid wast, and the elect Israel caried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
for their ingratitude: will not God punish and plague our
shamefull contempt, our wilfull disobedience? For these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are written for vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> that we should not offend as they did, least
the like fall vpon vs as fell vpon them:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> knowing that if God spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not the braunches of the true oliue, hee wil not spare the
twigges of the wilde oliue. If hee spared not the transgressing
Angels, the offending Iewes, neither will hee spare vs most vile
and sinnefull Gentiles: Our sinne no doubt hath iustly prouoked
our God to anger. Let our sighing, and groning, our earnest
praier and true repentance remooue his wrath least our Niniuie
sinke, and perish in her sinne. Yet remaine there a fewe daies
of repentance for the safetie of our citie.</p>
            <p>7 Nowe to the former circumstances of Cornelius S. Luke
addeth also the description of his maners:<note place="margin">The maners of Cornelius.</note> testifying therein that
he was deuoute, that he feared God with all his familie, that hee
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17219:119"/>
gaue much almes, that he praied God continually. Here is he
set forth as a perfect paterne of true Christianitie, an obseruer &amp;
keeper of the Lawe of the almightie. And because the Lawe is
conteined in two tables, his pietie towardes God is commended
first: secondly his loue and duetie towards men. So that it is
shewed howe he liued towards God, how he ordered his familie,
and howe he behaued himselfe towards his neighbours.</p>
            <p>8 Towards God he was deuoute;<note place="margin">His deuou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; religious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards God.</note> he feared God, hee praied
continually. The foundation of deuotion is faith; the fruits are
the feare of God, and praier. Faith commeth by hearing of the
word;<note place="margin">His faith.</note> he heard (by reason that he remained amongst the Iewes)
that there was one true God, who was onely to be honoured. He
had heard of the promised seede in whom all people should bee
blessed, of the Messias which should bee the Sauiour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He beleeued in this promised Messias, and thereupon hee
is called deuoute, for without this faith there is no deuotion, no
pietie, no religion. That feare, that praier, that commeth not
of faith is but vaine, it is reiected as sinful in Gods sight. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is not of faith is sinne.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> The tree must be good before it
bring foorth good fruite.<note place="margin">Iohn 15.</note> 
               <hi>As the braunche cannot beare fruite of it
selfe except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me,</hi> saith
Christ. Cornelius brought foorth good fruite, and therefore by
faith he abode in Christ, that is he beleeued. The fruites of his
faith were the feare of God, and praier vnto God: for neither can
we feare God as we ought, nor call vpon him rightly except wee
beleeue in him.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Howe shall they call on him in whom they haue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued?</hi>
               <note place="margin">His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>earing of God.</note>
And they beleeue not in God that doe not feare him, that
doe not call vpon him. For true faith will exercise the faithfull
herein. This feare of God hath euer respect to religion. Come
ye children, and hearken vnto me: I will teache you the feare of
the Lord, saith the Prophet. That is, I will instruct you in true
religion, I will teache you the true worshipping of God. This is
the first lesson that a Christian should learne. And as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
so especially such as haue dominion and rule ouer others.
Whereupon the princely Prophet doth exhort them:<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ye kings, ye
iudges of the earth, serue the Lorde with feare:</hi> as iudging them
happie whose common-wealth is ruled by such as are professors
and fauourers of true religion, such as feare the Lord. Which is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17219:120"/>
most true. For happie was Israel while Dauid, Iehosaphat, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,
and Iosias ruled: because they were religious men &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
God. But vnhappie when as Ieroboam, Achab, Amon, and
Manasses ruled, because the feare of God was farre from their
hearts: they went a whooring after idols, and made Israel to sin.
Howe much the greater care should Christian Princes haue to
place none in authoritie but such as Cornelius, men that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
religious and feare God: such as Constantius the woorthie
christian Emperour retained in his Court,<note place="margin">Sozomen. lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> when hee cast out
them who forsooke Christ, saying that they could not be faithful
to their Prince, who were vnfaithfull to God. Neither onely
princes but the people also, to whom the election of magistrates
appertaineth should haue the like care: remembring the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that Iethro made to Moses, Prouide thou men fearing
God.</p>
            <p>9 And Cornelius praied God continually.<note place="margin">His continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in praier both publike and priuate.</note> Faith and feare
of GOD doe breake out into his praises, and calling vpon
him by praier. Praier is an acceptable seruice of GOD, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by himselfe, and practised by his seruaunts, to the glorie
of his name.<note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> 
               <hi>Call</hi> (saith he) <hi>vpon me in the day of trouble: and I will
deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> Of praier there are two sorts,
priuate and publike: both which Cornelius vsed. Publike with
his familie, which he brought vp in the feare of God; priuate in
secrete place hauing his appointed houres to praie. When the
Angel appeared he was in priuate praier, at the ninth houre, that
is at three of the clocke in the afternoone. Nowe as Cornelius
vsed them both: so by his example should euerie christian doe.
For touching publike praier the Disciples of Christ continued
altogether with one accord in it.<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note> When Peter was cast into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:<note place="margin">Acts 12.</note>
the church made earnest praier vnto God for him. Wee
reade of the Pharisee,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> and Publicane both, that they went vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the temple to praie. Whereby we may learne, that they who
refuse to ioine themselues in publike place the church of God to
praie with other men, they are woorse than either Pharisees, or
Publicanes. Cornelius made his house such a publike place for
his whole familie therein to serue God. For as hee feared God
with his whole familie: so is it to be thought that he serued God
with his whole familie too. Insomuch that there was a church
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17219:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in his house, as in the house of Philemon. A lesson for all them
who haue families: that they be religious and feare God indeede,
they should vse priuate praier in their houses, and cause their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
to frequent it. So shall they make their houses to be chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And Christ will be in those assemblies: according to his
promise, I will be in the midst of them. As for priuate praier it is
also fruitefull and effectuous. For therein without suspition of
Pharisaicall hypocrisie we powre out heart before God. Anna in
the temple so behaued her selfe in her priuate praier,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.</note> that Ely the
high Priest esteemed her as drunke and sharpely reprooued her
for it. To whom she aunswered mildely, <hi>I am not drunke, but in my
praier I doe powre out my heart before God.</hi> Christ appointed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
certaine times of priuate praier as in the garden, where hee
praied in such earnest &amp; vehement sort that there dropped from
him both water and bloud.<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> Dauid had his priuate night prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note>
wherein such was the earnestnesse of his affection that with
his teares night by night he watered his couch. It appeareth that
Cornelius praied earnestly and heartily: for his praier pierced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heauens, and was acceptable vnto the Lord. But God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth
praier that falleth out of the lippes, and proceedeth not
from the heart.<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> He detesteth the Pharisees, who woorship him
with their lippes, but their heart is farre from him. The Israelites
powred out many teares when they praied in Babylon.<note place="margin">2. Chron. 33.</note> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Ethnikes would not dallie in their praier with their false gods.
It is written euen of the Heathenish Romans that when they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
their idols with solemne praiers and procession,<note place="margin">In vita Numae. Plut.</note> the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
saide to euerie one whom they met, <hi>Hoc age,</hi> Set thy mind on
this thing wholly. Be attentiue to this and to nothing else. Praier
is the lifting vp of the minde to God. He requireth the heart. But
alas our praiers are for the most part onely for a fashion that men
may behold vs.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> Furthermore the praier of Cornelius was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall.<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5.</note>
               <hi>Praie ye continually without intermission.</hi> We must pray stil,
and not waxe faint.<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> Which yet is not meant, as though we shold
cease from all other trauell and giue our selues onely to praier.
That is the error of the Euchites: whose Disciples were the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Monkes that made the house of God a denne of theeues
by their hypocrisie. But we are taught hereby to praie often: for
we haue alwaies occasion of praier giuen vs.<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> Daniel praied thrise

howe he liued towards God.</p>
            <p>10 It followeth to be noted,<note place="margin">The ordering of his familie.</note> how he ordered his familie: hee
feared God with all his houshold. He plaied not Nicodemus that
came to Christ by night: hee openlie professed his religion and
faith, yea and instructed his whole familie therein. Neither did
he feare to send for Peter to teache him the religion and faith of
Christ. First the open profession of his religion is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The Romans had forbid by Lawe that any subiect shold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
or receiue <hi>peregrinam religionem</hi> a straunge religion. They
considered that it was dangerous to their state to suffer diuersitie
of religion. They seuerely punished the transgressors of this law.
Yet Cornelius had learned that it is better to obeie God than
man, that we must obeie princes <hi>vsque ad Aras</hi> as the prouerbe is:
so farre as we may without disobeying God. Although the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
religion was hatefull to the Gentiles: yet he followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Daniel, of the three young men, of the blessed Apostles,
who did boldly preach and professe Christ when they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

vpon God, hee deliuered them and powred his manifolde

strangers for the gospels sake, for the cause which we professe and
maintaine are ioyfully to be receiued, cheerefully and liberally to
be releeued. For in receiuing them wee doe not onely receiue
Angels as Abraham and Lot did, but we receiue &amp; releeue Christ
Iesus whom they professe and whose members they are.<note place="margin">Marke 9.</note> And
whatsoeuer we giue to them we giue it him and he will reward it.
But whosoeuer shall vexe, wrong, or offend any of them, better
it were that a milstone were tied about his necke, and hee hurled
into the bottome of the sea. I speake of godlie strangers that are
strangers for the truths sake; not of such as are of no religion, of
no church, godlesse and faithlesse people, some Papists, some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists,
some Arrians, some Libertines: these are to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
and cast out of the countrie, least for their wickednes God
plague the whole Realme. God is woont euer to blesse the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
for reteining and releeuing godlie religious strangers: so is
he woont to powre his plagues on them that nourish Cananites
among them. And thus much touching Cornelius the Italian
by parentage, by vocation a souldier: placed in Cesarea, who was
deuoute, feared God and praied to God, who brought vp his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie
in the feare of God, who was pitifull to the poore, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
gaue almes euen vnto strangers.</p>
            <p>12 The next point we haue to consider of is vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
hee did send for Peter.<note place="margin">His sending for Peter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of the Angell sent from God to him.</note> In his praier at the ninth houre,
(which is our three of the clocke at afternoone) an Angell of
God appeared vnto him, and tolde him that his praiers and almes
were come vp in remembraunce before God, and bad him send
men to Ioppe and call for Simon Peter who lodged at a tanners
house neere the sea, and he should tell him what he ought to doe.
After the Angel was departed he sent two of his seruaunts and a
souldier that feared God to Ioppe for Peter. Heere is the cause
expressed why hee sent for Peter. God by his Angel commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and he obeied. In the Angels Oration I note two things, in
Cornelius other two. The Angell comforteth Cornelius, and
telleth him what hee shall doe. Cornelius is afraide at the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage:
and doeth that which the Angel willeth him.</p>

good Angels to comfort,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> nourish, gouerne, guide and defende
his elect. The euill Angels are sent either to trie the godly, or to
punish, plague and destroie the wicked. This Angel was a good
Angel of God sent to comfort and instruct Cornelius the deuout
and righteous man. He doth comfort him declaring vnto him
that his praiers and almes are ascended vp in remembraunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: which is as much to say, as that God doth accept and
allowe of them.</p>
            <p>14 The papists abuse much these woords of the Angell,<note place="margin">Popish errors concerning preparation to grace and iustification by workes rising by false collection out of the Angels words.</note> stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thereby to set foorth their owne righteousnesse, to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the merit and righteousnesse which we haue by Christ.
For they inferre thereof that our owne woorkes before wee haue
faith are preparations to grace. Secondly they attribute our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
to our woorkes. Things more absurd than that they
neede confutation. For what preparation can there be in vs of
our selues to grace,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> when S. Paul saith plainely, that wee are not
able of our selues,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> as of our selues, to thinke any good? The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of God. And
howe can our praiers or almes which are not done in faith please
God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> when without faith it is impossible to please him?<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> And if
Cornelius had faith as it must needes be graunted he had that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was the gift of God as S. Paul teacheth vs. Nowe to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
iustification to our merits or workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> is to make of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the merite of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom 3.</note> to make grace, no grace. For remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sins is iustification: as the scripture sheweth, saying, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are they whose sinnes are forgiuen. But we obteine remission
of sinnes not by our workes, but through faith in Christ: wee are
iustified freely, by the grace of God, through the redemption
that is in Christ Iesus, whom God hath set foorth to be a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteousnesse
by the forgiuenesse of the sinnes passed. And our woorkes are
such,<note place="margin">Luc. 17.</note> euen the workes of the best men, that when we haue doone
all,<note place="margin">Psal. 143.</note> we are vnprofitable seruants. Enter not into iudgement with
thy seruaunts O Lord: for in thy sight shall no man liuing bee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
The Angel therefore meant not that Cornelius was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prepared to grace, or iustified, by his workes: but that God
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17219:123"/>
considered his pietie, praiers and almes, and would encrease his
good gifts in him. For God both accepteth good woorkes and
will reward them.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> He accepteth them for the mans sake, in that

his workes, and Gods remembrance of them.</p>
            <p>15 As for that he willeth him to sende for Simon Peter,<note place="margin">Cornelius willed by the Angel to send for Peter, and to learne of him.</note> and
learne of him what he should doe: this speeche doth import that
Cornelius in his praier had desired to knowe howe, and by what

telleth him that he must send for Peter by whom he shal be

Queene of the Ethiopians chiefe gouernour,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> as hee was reading
the prophet Esaias touching Christ. Hee prouided Ananias for

will haue his Gospel preached by men and not by Angels. Hee
will not haue vs looke for reuelations from heauen but to giue
eare and credit to the voice of his messengers to whom hee hath

            <p>16 At his message Cornelius was afraide.<note place="margin">He feareth.</note> The presence of
the Angel and the strangenesse of the message abashed him. Now
if he heard the voice of the Angel with trembling and feare: with
what awe &amp; reuerence should we giue eare to the voice of the son
of God Christ Iesus? Whensoeuer the gospel is preached, Christ
is present, Christ speaketh to vs. The godly tremble at his word
as we reade in Esay,<note place="margin">Esay 66.</note>

            <p>17 And he that doth reuerence the word of God truly,<note place="margin">He obeieth.</note> wil no

the Angel and straight way sent two of his seruants, and a

               <note place="margin">Psal. 85.</note> Neither may we consult with
flesh and bloud when God commaundeth,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> but we must obey, we
must not deliberate in his causes. Reason and experience would
haue told Cornelius howe dangerons it was publikely to professe
a strange and hated religion, it might not only tend to the losse of
his office, but of his life too. He might haue disputed also with
himselfe, What is Peter? Some odde sectarie fled from Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
who for feare least he with his errors should be condemned,
hideth himselfe in a tanners house. What learning, what pietie
can I looke for to come out of such a schoole, and from such a
schoolemaster? This would worldly wisedome and flesh &amp; bloud
haue said vnto him: but faith putteth no such perill but readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth
whatsoeuer God commaundeth. It doubteth not, it stac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kereth

the embassador of God; hee reuerenced him as his spirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he gaue vnto him that double honour which S. Paul saith
is due vnto him.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The Elders that rule well are woorthie of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi>

the Galathians in this behalfe that they loued him as an
Angell of God, yea as Christ Iesus, yea if it had beene possible,
they would haue plucked out their owne eyes, and giuen them
him. But our times are altered: men are otherwise affected. They
enuie and mutter against Moses, and Aaron. They are become
such of whom God complaineth by his prophet Hosea: <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

but they saide in like sort; <hi>O men why doe ye these things? We are

the Angel likewise, but the Angel refused, <hi>See thou doe it not; I

religious honour is giuen to any creature. It cannot be
thought that either Cornelius or Iohn would robbe God of his
glorie, and giue it to Angel or man. But yet they were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to doe that which they did, least they should attribute more
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17219:125"/>
to the messenger of God than they ought through preposterous
zeale. It is not so great a daunger to honour a prince with al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,
therein men cannot so easilie exceed because the honour
is ciuill. But the danger is in a spirituall person, least in respect of
his holie office they honour him too much. And here is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
pride of the pope reproued who vaunteth himselfe for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
successor. Peter tooke vp Cornelius and would not suffer
him to worship him. His successor compelleth princes to cast
themselues downe before him and to kisse his filthie feete. This
beastly pride declareth him neither to be Christs vicar nor Peters
successor, but rather his childe who saide to Christ in the mount,
<hi>All these will I giue thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt 4.</note>

declared withall howe readie he was to heare him. For in that he

them glad tidings, the word of saluation. <hi>He sendeth his woord and

               <note place="margin">Psal. 107.</note> saith the prophet. <hi>Let them confesse therefore before the

               <hi>that all they

            </p>
            <p>22 Nowe howe readie himselfe and his companie were to
heare Peter preache it appeareth by the woords following:<note place="margin">His readinesse to heare and learne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God commanded Peter to preach.</note> 
               <hi>We
are all present here before God, to heare all things that are commanded thee
of God.</hi> Wherein both the dueties of the hearer and the preacher
are plainely set downe. The dutie of the hearer first to be present
before God. To remember that he standeth in the sight of God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17219:126"/>
the seer and searcher of hearts, from whom nothing is hid. To
stand before the preacher is to stand before God. The presence
of God requireth feare and reuerence. Feare and reuerence
should occupie the hearts of them who stand so. Secondly to
heare and learne. There is none so well learned but hee may
learne more. For while we liue <hi>we knowe in part,</hi> saith S. Paul, and
therefore we must giue diligent care, and applie our mindes to
that which is spoken. We must not be as a beaten way, where the
seede can take no roote. We must not suffer preiudice to treade
downe and destroie the seede, nor the birds of the ayre, Satan to
pull it out at the one eare, so fast as it entereth in at the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We may not let our mindes wander but comming of purpose to
heare to our profite, we must beseeche God to giue vs memorie,
and vnderstanding, to print into our hearts that which wee heare
with our eares. Thirdly to heare all things, euen all the doctrine
of God: not things that doe please, but things that displease our
flesh; not other mens faults but our owne; not onely profession
but also conuersation; not onely faith, but also workes; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to heare,<note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> but also to doe. Herod heard Iohn gladly while hee
carped others, but hee could not abide to bee rubbed on the gall
himselfe. Hee heard Iohn in many things: but not in all. The
Iewes at Rome heard Paul vntill hee applied the woords of Esay
vnto them:<note place="margin">Esay 6.</note> 
               <hi>The heart of this people is waxed fat, and their eares are dull
of hearing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 28.</note> 
               <hi>and with their eyes haue they winked: least they should see with
their eies, and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their hearts, and
returne that I might heale them.</hi> Then they shrunke from him and
would no more heare him. The preacher is gladly heard of the
people that can carpe the magistrates, cut vp the ministers, crie
out against all order, and set all at libertie. But if hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
their insolencie, pride and vanitie, their monstrous appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
their excessiue feasting, their greedie couetousnesse, their
biting vsurie, their halting hearts, their muttering mindes, their
friendly words, &amp; malitious deedes, they will fall from him then.
He is a railer, he doteth, he wanteth discretion. Not so Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
and his companie: but they were readie to heare all and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
and framed according to all that which God by his word
should require at their hands.</p>
            <p>23 The duetie of the preacher is expressed in these woords,<note place="margin">The dutie of teachers to teache that which God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:17219:126"/>
That are commaunded thee of God. The preacher may teache
no other than he hath commission to speake, than is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him of God. He may not adde to the written word neither
take from it. Gods Lawe is perfect, it doth perfectly instruct and
teache all things necessarie to saluation. The Disciples must on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breake those loaues vnto the people which they haue receiued
at Christs hands. They may not teache their owne dreames, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,
or doctrines. For God will not haue them woorship
him so,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.</note> but <hi>thou shalt heare the word</hi> (saith he) <hi>at my mouth, and giue
them warning from me.</hi> And thus much of Cornelius what he was,
on what occasion he sent for Peter, and howe he receiued him at
his comming to him.</p>
            <p>24 Likewise in Peter three things we haue noted.<note place="margin">The messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers sent from Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius find Peter praying.</note> Howe he
was occupied when the messengers came to him, howe readilie
he went with them, and what the sermon was that hee preached
to them. The messengers found him at the sixth houre (which
is twelue as wee count) fasting and praying on the house toppe,
where he sawe a vision in his traunce, a sheete let out of heauen
knit at foure corners, wherein were all fowre footed beasts of the
earth, and wilde beasts, and creeping things, and fowles of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And a voice saide, arise Peter, kill and eate. First wee see
that Peter had his appointed houres of praier. Praier is an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
sacrifice to God, and a Christian exercise: for the vse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the godlie will prescribe themselues certaine times. For mans
corrupt nature is easily caried away to worldely affaires. Hee
matcheth fasting with praier, as needefull to stirre vp our sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
drowsie spirits to pray the more feruently. For a full bellie
maketh a faint praier. And he sought also a priuate place to pray
in: because in priuate places we may powre out our hearts more
freely vnto God. But of this I haue spoken before.</p>
            <p>25 The vision that appeared was to teache him that Christ
was borne a Sauiour to the whole world:<note place="margin">The vision of Peter.</note> that the Gospel was to
be preached to all, that he would all should be saued and come to
the knowledge of the trueth. And so was declared the calling of
the Gentiles. For Peter was commaunded to make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene Iewe and Gentile, although the Gentiles were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
as vncleane in the eyes of the Iewes. Peter being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to kill and eate, abstained in respect of the Lawe. God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17219:127"/>
told him that he should not take as polluted that which hee had
made cleane. All meates are sanctified by the word and praier.
So are the Gentils as cleane as the Iewes, whose hearts God hath
purified.<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> To forbid meates or mariage as vncleane seeing that the
Lorde hath purified them by his woord is the doctrine of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>
For all things are cleane to them that be cleane, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
Gentile is accepted of God as wel as the beleeuing Iewe.<note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

While Peter mused at this vision: Cornelius his messengers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for him at the doore; and God spake vnto him and saide, Goe
with them, and doubt nothing for I haue sent them.</p>
            <p>26 Peter hauing the woord of God for his calling,<note place="margin">His cheerefull obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent to preache.</note> went chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
forward on his iourney readie to preache to them to whom
God did send him. He alleaged not howe dangerous it was to
preache the Gospel in Cesarea; howe long and tedious a way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
howe odious to be conuersant with the Gentiles; he inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not what reward he should haue; hee asked not who should
beare his costs; he alleaged not his worne bodie; his olde age; he
was voide of all such put-offs, he knewe that, Woe be vnto him
if he preached not he remembred his lesson giuen to others, <hi>Feed
the flocke of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> he forgat not Christs lesson giuen vnto him, <hi>If
thou loue me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 21.</note> 
               <hi>feede my sheepe:</hi> he knewe that the minister of the word
ought to preache in season, and out of season. And he tooke the
thing in hand the more gladly, hauing hope that he should winne
vnto Christ by the word a Captaine, a man of might, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
in getting of whom he should also get a great sort, he should
get an hundred souldiers who easily would be drawne to bee like
affected with their Captaine: he should win a great familie with
the rest of Cornelius friends &amp; kinsemen, and euen so it came to
passe. It is a great gain vnto the Church of Christ when as a man
in authoritie is woon by the word. Therefore S. Paul vsed all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
to drawe king Agrippa to be a Christian,<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> knowing what
great aduantage would come thereby to Christs Church. To
winne a prince is to winne a multitude; yea a nation. The Church
of Christ encreaseth and thriueth apace when Kings &amp; Queenes
become nurces to it.</p>
            <p>27 Peter being come now to Cornelius,<note place="margin">His entraunce into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> and perceiuing how
God had touched his heart with the rest of his companie, and
made them most readie and greedie of the word of God, opened
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17219:127"/>
his mouth and saide; <hi>Of a trueth I perceiue, that God is no accepter of
persons,</hi> and so foorth. Now Peter entereth into his sermon see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so wide a doore opened vnto him, so great an occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
so large and apt a field to sowe Gods seede in. In which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
there is ynough for a Christian to learne; all matter needful
to saluation is comprised in it. He that hath taken out this lesson
needeth not to learne another. And a great occasion of it as of
other excellent sermons was in the people. For the holie Ghost
soweth seede plentifully where he findeth a good ground to cast
it in, and giueth great vtterance lightly to the minister, when he
giueth good will to the auditorie to heare. If the field be barren
the seede is spared least it should be spilt. Hee will not haue his
seede cast in an vnfruitefull ground. Surely when the people are
woorthie of the woord: God will sende preachers with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of it.</p>
            <p>28 <hi>Of a trueth I perceiue that God is no accepter of persons.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Being taught of God he teacheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before was ignorant.</note> This is
S. Peters entrance to his matter: wherein he declareth that hee
hath nowe learned that the Gospel of Christ, the doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
doth as well pertaine to the Gentiles as to the Iewes. For
although there was a partition-wall which diuided them, now it
is taken away.<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note> The Gentiles were aliants from the common
wealth of Israel, strangers from the couenant of promise, and had
no hope, and were without God in the world: but now in Christ
Iesu they which were farre off, are made neere. For he is our
peace, which made of both one, and hath broken down the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall
to make of twaine one newe man in himselfe so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
peace. Through him both Iewe and Gentile hath an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
vnto the father by one spirit. And Peter hauing had this
reuealed to him before in his vision doth now affirme to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
in the beginning of his speeche: partly to winne fauourable
hearing in that he enuied not their saluation as other Iewes did,
but carefully sought it: partly to make them attentiue to heare
those things which pertained to their saluation. Of a truth I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
Peter confesseth his former ignorance touching the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Gentiles and that he hath learned that which he knew
not before. A token of his great humilitie. His successor the
pope is led by an other spirite, hee cannot abide to graunt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or that he can erre: all knowledge is shut vp <hi>in scrinio pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:17219:128"/>
(as they terme it) in the hutch of his brest. Paul would not
arrogate all knowledge,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> though he were taken vp into the third
heauen, and sawe mysteries not to be reuealed vnto men, for he
saith, <hi>We knowe in part.</hi> These Romish Rabbies will be no Disciples
but masters. They will aunswere him that shall take in hande to
teache them:<note place="margin">Iohn 9.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art borne wholly in sinnes, and doest thou teache
vs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>29 But what hath Peter learned?<note place="margin">God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> That God is no accepter
of persons. I regard not that which man doth regard, saith God
to Samuel.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.</note> For man regardeth that which is before his eyes;
but God regardeth the heart. The person heere is taken for the
outward apparance, and qualities as you would say, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of persons: as circumcision, vncircumcision; man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
magistrate, subiect; Iewe, Gentile; English-man, French-man;
master, seruaunt; riche, poore; faire, euill fauoured; a tall
man, a dwarfe; a citizen, a countrie man; a wise man, a foole; a
learned, an vnlearned. These &amp; such other things are here meant
by the persons of men. GOD is no accepter of these outward
shewes, he iudgeth not as man iudgeth. <hi>There is neither Iewe, nor
Gretian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> 
               <hi>there is neither bond, nor free; there is neither male, nor female;
for ye are all one in Christ Iesus.</hi> There is no respect of persons with
God, neither ought we to be caried away with externall shewes
of magnifical pompe, of glorious titles, of great authority, much
learning: nor in matter of religion to respect the messenger but
the message. Paul reprooueth the Corinthians for respecting
of persons in matter of religion; some would heare none but
Paul,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> some liked none but Apollos, others followed after Peter,
&amp; would only be his disciples. Is Christ diuided saith S. Paul? The
preacher is to be heard for the woords sake and not for his owne
sake. If Scribes and Pharisees teache out of the chaire of Moses,
if Iudas teache the Gospell of Christ, they are to be heard. To
heare or not to heare in respect of the person, is to iustifie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the woord for the person. Respect not persons, but reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the matter; when thou hearest the minister preaching the
truth thou hearest not him but the sonne of God the teacher of al
truth Christ Iesus. Plato was as honest a man, and as good a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
as was Diogenes for all his pretense of simplicitie and
contemning of the world. Haue no respect to outward pretenses.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17219:128"/>
Iudge not according to the sight: least in opinion you condemne
the good and iustifie the euill. In matter of saluation neither
ought the childe to respect his parent, nor the seruaunt his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
nor the subiect his prince, nor posteritie the predecessors:
for we may not hang vpon man but vpon God.<note place="margin">Ier. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Cursed is hee that
maketh flesh his arme.</hi> We must herein onely giue eare and respect
what the sonne of God shall say vnto vs who is the wisedome of
his father: whom our heauenly father hath commaunded vs to

            </p>
            <p>30 In euerie nation he that feareth him,<note place="margin">God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them which feare him in euerie nation.</note> and woorketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
is accepted of him. God respecteth not the outward
person but the inward man. He regardeth not the shape but his
owne image that is in man. Hee is not partiall to the Iewe more
than to the Gentile: Riche and poore, learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are all one in his sight. He accepteth of such as feare him
and worke righteousnesse. Herein is comprised perfect religion:
our duetie towards God, and our dutie towards man, the former,
and the latter table, to beleene in God, and to doe right to our
neighbour, to loue God aboue all, and to loue our neighbour as
our selfe. To feare God is in true holinesse to serue GOD: to
worke righteousnesse is not to hurt but to help our neighbour, to
doe to others, as we would be doone vnto our selues. Hee that
will be a wise man in deede must learne to feare God. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of wisedome,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.</note> is the feare of the Lord. All other wisedome
wherein the feare of God wanteth is but earthly,<note place="margin">Iam. 3.</note> sensuall, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish.
Such as feare God shall be strengthened to stand against
all assaults of Satan; yea they shal continue and stand stedfast vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end, euen to the last gasp. Canst thou not away with want?
Wouldst thou haue plentie?<note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> There is nothing wanting to them
that feare him. Canst thou not away with infamie? Wouldest
thou be praised? The greatest praise that can come to any man is
that he feareth God.<note place="margin">Eccles. 10.</note> It is the glorie of the riche, the noble and

God.<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.</note> For they who feare God, will honour and obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;<note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note>
they who feare God will diligently exercise themselues in

feare of God were planted in our hearts: wee would learne after
so many admonitions to leade a better life; wee would practise
such lessons as we haue beene so long in learning; wee would not
liue in such carelesse securitie as we doe, the Gospel would take

would be more diligent in feeding of the flocke; the people
more readie to heare the voice of the sheepeheard; the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
more carefull ouer the common-wealth; the subiectes
more obedient to frame themselues to liue vnder Law: the riche
would not suffer the giuer of their riches to goe on begging: the
poore would endeuour to get spirituall treasures, and to be riche
in Christ: finally we would not feede our bellies so daintily; nor
so vainly and superfluously cloath our bodies: but vse temperance
in diet, and sobrietie in apparell, hauing what to eate and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be cloathed we would bee content. Verily to conclude,
such as feare God abstaine from euill and doe good:<note place="margin">Eccles 15.</note> and as our
Apostle S. Peter saith, they doe worke righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>31 Righteousnesse compriseth in it all such duetie as we doe
owe vnto our neighbour.<note place="margin">And them which worke righteousnes.</note> Whatsoeuer is contained in the second

we worke righteousnesse, who are as vncleane things, and al our

<hi>There is not one that doth good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 14.</note> 
               <hi>no not one?</hi> In deede we are not able to
worke perfect righteousnesse. For if wee could then Christ had
died in vaine, with whose perfect righteousnesse we must be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
by imputation, that wee may bee accepted as righteous in
Gods sight.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> 
               <hi>For God hath made him which knewe no sinne to be sinne for
vs, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> But when
we are iustified so by the perfect righteousnesse of Christ: wee
must endeuour to serue God in righteousnesse, and bring foorth
good fruites though they be vnperfect, such as in this frailtie of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17219:129"/>
the flesh we may. And these are accepted of God for Christes
sake, their weakenesse and imperfection being pardoned in him.
Wherefore in this sort we must worke righteousnesse, and follow
sanctification. Hitherto howe all estates must apply themselues
to worke righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>32 Omitting therfore others whom generally this toucheth,<note place="margin">Children put in minde of a worke of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their parents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whose consent to bestow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a thing vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</note>
I will at this present remember children onely of a point of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
which they must worke in giuing due honour to their
parents. For there is a great fault in many at this day, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they are specially bound to their parents both by the linkes of
nature and by the bonds of Gods word: they burst those bondes
asunder, &amp; dispose of themselues in mariage as they list without
consent of their parents. A fault as most heinous in the sight of
God, and condemned by his law: so condemned too by the law of
nature, the Lawe Ciuil, the Lawe Canon, and the opinion of the
best writers. For the Lawe of God doeth not onely charge chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
generally to obey their parents in all thinges,<note place="margin">Col. 3.</note> but also parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
doth shewe by sundrie examples, that children ought to
be giuen by their parents in mariage, and not to bee left to their
owne fantasies. And among the Ethnikes euen by the Lawe of
nature as their Poets shew, mariages for children were not made
by themselues but by their parents. It is written in the Lawe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil;<note place="margin">In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss, de statu hominis l. Paul.</note>
If a sonne marie a wife against his fathers will: the child that
shall be borne of that mariage shall not be counted lawfull. In
the Canon Lawe it is saide,<note place="margin">30. q. 5. c. Aliter.</note> Mariages are then lawfull when mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
are asked to wiues of their parents, and are giuen by them
openly to their husbandes: otherwise they are not mariages but
whoredomes. The best writers both olde and newe subscribe
hereunto: Tertullian, Ambrose, Chrysostome, Augustine, with
all the learnedst of latter times: whose particular sentences I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to recite for breuities sake. But if youthfull children haue
so litle reuerence both of God and men that such admonition wil
not make them leaue such disordered mariages, it behooueth
magistrates who are the common parentes of the weale publike,
to bridle their lusts with seuere Lawes, for the redresse of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and the mischiefes ensuing of it. And thus much of
S. Peters entraunce into his sermon: the sermon doeth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.</p>

33 Ye knowe the word which God hath sent to the children
of Israel,<note place="margin">The summe &amp; substance of S. Peters Sermon is peace by Christ Iesus.</note> preaching peace by Iesus Christ, and so foorth. The
summe of the sermon is this. Iesus Christ which is Lord of all,
the preacher and author of peace, did faithfully performe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for the which he was sent, preaching to the people the glad
tidings of the Gospell, and healing all their diseases, for God was
with him, and hee was slaine and hanged on tree; the thirde day
he arose again from death, he ascended into heauen, from thence
shall he come to iudge the quicke and the dead: to whom all the
prophets beare witnesse that through his name all that beleeue in
him shall haue remission of their sinnes. Such as this is, were
the sermons of the Apostles. Here is all things necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
expressed. This is that which God commanded his great
Apostle S. Peter to preache. In this doctrine would hee haue
his people trained vp. The people receiued it as a sufficient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note>
Peter and Paul were directed by one spirite: they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
esteemed to knowe any thing but Iesus Christ, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
neither could they testifie or preache ought but him. This
sermon is diuided into three parts:<note place="margin">The parts of his sermon.</note> the first that Iesus Christ the
Lord of all was sent vnto the people of Israel to preache peace;
the next, that he died &amp; rose againe from death to procure vs this
peace; the last, that we are made partakers of this peace by faith in
his name. Iesus Christ the Lord of all was sent vnto the people of
Israel to preache peace. Let vs weie the words seuerally: they
are most effectuous, fully setting foorth the mysterie of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>

he is a full,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> perfect and onely Sauiour. He is the Lambe of God

And Iesus is called so, because hee was annointed of
God aboue his fellowes. Whereupon Esay the prophet writeth

               <hi>The spirit of the Lord is vpon me; for he hath annointed me.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed

               <hi>The scepter of thy kingdome is

is that triumphant prince which hath most victoriously vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and throwen vnder foote our enemies. They labour in vaine
that kicke against the prickes, that striue against his Gospel. For
he is a prince of might that doeth defend it:<note place="margin">Act. 19.</note> and the gates of hell
shall not preuaile against it.<note place="margin">Matth 16.</note> The sunne wil runne his course: the
passage of the Gospel cannot bee stopped.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> The Gospel is not

other; once, and not often; vpon the crosse, and not vpon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
sufficient for all such as shall be saued. He is the priest, the
high bishop that maketh intercession for vs: the onely mediator
betweene God, and man; to teach man the wil of God, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
God to man; to make intercession betweene God and man.
These are the peculiar duties of Christ, as wee are taught in the

               <note place="margin">Christ the Lord of all.</note> Least the Gentiles should conceiue

Christ was sent to preache peace.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> He preached peace, and made
peace betweene Iewes and Gentiles; or rather betweene them

and Galilie. Not to poll, and pill; to extort and wring out of
the people what he could: but it was to doe good, and to heale
such as were oppressed of the diuell, to preache the woord and to

oppresse the stranger, and feare not me saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Nothing is

               <hi>Vengeaunce is mine, I will repay</hi> saith the Lord. For priuate

               <note place="margin">Psal. 143.</note> Christ therefore is giuen as S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
teacheth to be our Iesus, that is our Sauiour, our Christ that
is annointed, a king, a priest, and prophet; the Lord of all whom
we ought to serue in holinesse and righteousnesse; sent of God,
and made man; he preached peace betweene God and man, and
betweene men among themselues; he died to bee a sacrifice for
vs, he rose againe to iustifie vs; hee is made our iudge, and doeth
iudge iustly.</p>

that which is his owne. And here is the controuersie betweene
the aduersaries of the Gospel the papists and vs. We giue vnto
Christ that which is his right: they rob, and take from him that
which is his due. We spoile our selues of all righteousnesse, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17219:133"/>
seeke to be cloathed with his righteousnesse. They cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with their owne righteousnesse, not caring for that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
which is in him. We hope to be saued by him our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
priest, our sacrifice, our mediator. They haue shauen priests,
and vnbloudie sacrifices, and infinite mediators both of Saints
and Angels. To be short we acknowledge Christ our whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
and all the glorie thereof we giue vnto God. They will be
saued by themselues, their merits, their pardons, they impart the
glorie of God vnto dead men, to images, to relikes, &amp; to dumme

            <p>44 All flesh hath sinned,<note place="margin">Remission of sinnes free.</note> and doth neede forgiuenesse. God
is the onely forgiuer of our sinnes.<note place="margin">Marke 2.</note> Neither doth he forgiue them
in respect of mans merits:<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> but of his mercie, good will and free
mercie. The onely meanes that mooued God to bee mercifull
freely to sinnefull man was that most acceptable sweete bloudie
sacrifice which the innocent sonne of God offred vpon the crosse
for our sinnes.<note place="margin">Rom 3.</note> All haue sinned and are depriued of the glorie
of God: &amp; are iustified freely by his grace, through the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in Christ Iesus. He tooke our vnrighteousnesse vpon
himselfe and cloathed vs with his iustice,<note place="margin">2. Cor 5.</note> and <hi>He who knewe no sinne
was made sinne for vs, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in

There is no other name giuen vs vnder heauen whereby we may
be saued.<note place="margin">Acts 3.</note> 
               <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> No man commeth to

him: and through him all sinnes are forgiuen freely.</p>
            <p>45 The meane whereby wee are made partakers of this free
remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">Of remission of sins we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers by faith.</note> in the death and resurrection of Christ, is
faith in Christ. For all (saith Peter) that beleeue in him shall
receiue remission of sinnes through his name. God doeth freely
offer vnto vs remission of sinne, and peace in Christ. The meane
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17219:134"/>
and instrument to receiue it withall is faith. He that beleeueth
is made partaker of it: and not of it onely but of eternall life also.
For he that beleeueth in me hath life eternall,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> saith our Sauiour
Christ.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> But this faith, this iustifying faith doth worke through
loue,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> and sheweth it selfe by workes.<note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> The good tree will be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
The beleeuing iustified childe of God will feare God and
worke righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>46 This doctrine of iustification by faith in the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of Christ Iesu is witnessed by all the Prophets.<note place="margin">Vnto this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine all the Prophets beare witnes.</note> It is no
newe doctrine, but olde: not onely proceeding from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
but also from the Prophets. For Moses and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
beare witnesse of him.<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> And as they: so the Apostles after
them. Whose steppes we must followe, and acknowledge that
no doctrine is to be established but that which is testified by the
Apostles and Prophets.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> The true Church of Christ doth builde
her faith on their foundation. God will be worshipped and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
according to his prescript woord, and not according to the
braine of man. The Prophets and Apostles with all such as be
ministers of the woord are heere and elsewhere called witnesses:
Yea Christ himselfe termeth himselfe a witnesse of the truth. For
this cause am I borne, and for this cause came into the worlde,
<hi>that I should beare witnesse to</hi> the truth.<note place="margin">Iohn 18.</note> And Christ saith to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,<note place="margin">Acts 1.</note>
               <hi>Ye shall be witnesses vnto me, both in Ierusalem and in Samaria;
euen to the vttermost endes of the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>47 The truth is to bee testified by publike preaching.<note place="margin">Bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the truth both by teaching and by suffering for it.</note> Paul
commendeth the Thessalonians for beleeuing his <hi>testimonie.</hi> His
testimonie was the Gospel which he did preache and testifie vnto
them. According to the voice that did speake vnto him when
he was cast off his horse:<note place="margin">2 Thess 1.</note> 
               <hi>I haue appeared to thee for this purpose: to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
thee a minister and witnesse both of things which thou hast seene;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and
of the things in which I will appeare vnto thee.</hi> The truth is also testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by writing. By the writings of the Prophets, Apostles and
Euangelists the truth of God Iesus Christ was most plainely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
As Iohn (to name one of them among many,) <hi>This is
that Disciple which testifieth of these things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 21.</note> The truth is also witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when as it is testified in bloud, for a martyr is a witnes. Christ
told Peter that when he was young hee girded himselfe and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
whither he lusted, but when he waxed old other should gird
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17219:134"/>
him and carie him whither hee would not. Nowe this (saith
Iohn) he spake signifying by what death he should glorifie God.
Many Martyrs haue thus testified the truth with suffering for it.
But they ouercame by the bloud of the Lambe, and by the woord
of their testimonie,<note place="margin">Reue. 12.</note> not louing their life, no not to the death.
That minister which will neither testifie it by publike preaching,
nor by writing, will hardly testifie it by suffering, but will rather
say with Peter, <hi>I knowe not the man.</hi> But I must here make an end
for the time hath ouertaken me:<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> and without repetition, as you
knowe the maner is.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> To God the father, God the son, &amp; God the
holie Ghost, three persons &amp; one almightie &amp; almerciful God, be
rendred all thanks &amp; all glorie giuen for euer and for euer. Amen</p>

who, being persecuted of his wicked &amp; vnnatural son, &amp; dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of that glorious tabernacle, which with great
triumph &amp; ioye himselfe had placed in the Citie of Dauid, where
he was woont with the rest of the people to call vpon the name
of the Lord; to heare the Lawe; and to offer sacrifice vpon those
beautiful altars: conceiued such a deepe impression of griefe, by
the sorowfull meditation of those sweete and heauenly comforts,
whereof his soule had tasted in former times; that, forgetting
quite the losse of all other royalties whatsoeuer, he maketh mone
for nothing, but onely this, that he might not nowe be partaker
of those inestimable benefites, and the comforts of minde and
conscience, which he was woont to receiue at the hand of God,
at such time as with the rest of the Israelites he resorted to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
where God promised to be present, and fauourably to
heare the petitions there made vnto him. Of this his great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferie,
he complaineth him lamentably in diuerse of his Psalmes:
but especially in the 84, where he breaketh out into these woords
of great zeale:<note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord of hosts, howe amiable are thy Tabernacles? My
soule longeth, yea and fainteth for the courts of the Lorde: mine heart and
my flesh reioice in the liuing God.</hi> He goeth on, and magnifieth the
blessed estates of those sillie birds, which might haue their nests,
and lay their young euen close by the altars, from the presence of
which he was exiled. In the ende, to shewe the happie case
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17219:135"/>
wherein they are, to whom continuall and daily accesse to the
house of the Lord is graunted; he preferreth one day spent there,
before a thousand any other-where; the meanest roome about the
house of God, before the highest throne in the pallaces of the
wicked. In another Psalme he so speaketh, as if euery daies ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from that holie place were a thousand yeeres.<note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> 
               <hi>When shall I
come to appeare before the presence of God?</hi> As if he should haue said,
Shall I neuer?<note place="margin">Psal. 137.</note> Neuer shall I be so happie? So the Israelites at such
time as they were exiles in Babylon, declared their earnest desires
this way, by their bitter teares: Nehemias, by his heauinesse in
the presence of the king: Christ, by leauing his mother, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
himselfe at holie exercises in the temple, being but as yet of
greene and tender age. And with what zeale, ioye and gladnesse,
the Disciples of Christ, after the death of their master ioyned
themselues together in priuate houses, when by reason of the
cruell persecution by the Priests, they durst not shewe themselues
abroade; it appeareth both in the Euangelists, and in the Acts of
the Apostles. Yea, when afterward the spirite of God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
descending vpon them, had increased both their zeale and
courage, they openly professed him, whom before they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in secrete places. No feare, no prohihition, no threatning of
higher powers was able to withholde them: they spake, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the temple; they taught daily; and beeing persecuted,
were glad that God thought them woorthie to suffer for his sake,<note place="margin">Acts 5.</note>
who had died for theirs. God, according to his promise, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

our heauenly father, who hath in so ample manner, in the midst
of our manifold distresses &amp; griefes, caused the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to shine in the faces of vs his poore afflicted seruaunts?
For althogh because we, our princes, our prophets &amp; our people
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:17219:136"/>
haue grieuously sinned in not esteeming so preciously, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
so religiously his blessed Gospel as we ought to doe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he hath bereaued vs of our worldly prosperitie, and brought
these miseries vpon vs, wherein we nowe are: yet knowing that
we are the sheepe of his pasture, howsoeuer wee haue wandered
and gone astray; it hath pleased him in great aboundance of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
so to temper the sharpenesse of his correction, that we finde
him still our present helper at hand, and readie most to succour
vs in our extreemest neede. Could wee wish for more at the
hands of God, than beeing banished, and constreined to forsake
all the profites and comforts which we inioied at home in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
countrie; here amongst aliens and strangers, to finde a citie, so
safe to dwell in; maintenance, so competent for our needeful and
reasonable sustentation; such grace in the eies of the godly magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
vnder whom we liue; such fauour and respect to our hard
estate; such free libertie to come together, to call vpon God in
our common praiers, to heare his word syncerely and truly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in our owne natural tongue, to the great and vnsearchable
comfort of our soules; finally all things so strangely and almost
miraculously ministred, and brought vnto our handes, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we could neuer haue found heere, if the Lorde himselfe had
not gone before, as it were to make readie, &amp; to prouide for vs? O
what tokens of mercie &amp; special fauour, hath our kind &amp; gratious
father shewed vs in this our exile and distresse for his Gospell; in
these our sorowful and afflicted times; Wee haue lost the sauing
truth at home, and found it abroade; Our countrie-men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our enemies, and strangers are made our friends; Being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by our natiue rulers, foraine magistrates haue shewed vs
fauour; In banishment, wee haue a place to dwell in; In anguish,
we abound with comfort: And, as the Apostle speaketh, hauing
nothing, we are as possessing all things. Therefore, deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
hauing receiued these so great and rare graces, at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull

but rather note vnto you in what sense the holie Ghost doth
chiefly vse it in this place. Grace is the fauour and mercie of God
towards sinnefull men. It is called grace, because it is giuen <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:17219:137"/>
freely and vndeseruedly on our parts,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal 30.</note> to whom it is giuen. For
vs it is purchased, by the onely meane and meere merite of our
Sauiour Christ: and to vs it is both offered and exhibited, by the
voluntarie and vnprouoked operation of the spirite. This grace
in it selfe being large, &amp; more than sufficient for all men; the holy
Ghost diuideth and bestoweth vpon eache, breathing where and
as he listeth, according to the secrete pleasure of his will. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
it we haue saluation; whereas through sinne wee deserue
death. For out iniquitie was heinous in the sight of God, first
committed by Adam, and since continued in vs: but farre more
exceeding was the mercie of our Lord, who when we were his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
sent foorth his sonne, made of a woman, and made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Lawe, that he might redeeme them which were vnder the
Lawe,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> and that we might receiue the adoption of sonnes. No
tongue can expresse, neither any minde conceiue this gratious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Yet let vs ponder it with such consideration as we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Great therefore I say was the mercie of our creator, who
gaue his sonne; and great the loue of our Sauiour, who gaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
himselfe for vs. Our thraldome was great, that required a
ransome of such value: our guiltinesse much, that could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
be washed away, but with the verie heart bloud of the
innocent lambe of God, Christ Iesus our Lord: Yea inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and vneffable was the loue of our gratious Lord, who to spare
vs, spared not himselfe. He was content to become ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
before men; that we might be glorious with his father; to be
condemned, that wee might be absolued; to bee crowned with
thornes, to purchase vs a crowne of immortalitie: to loose his life,
that we might gaine life; to suffer death, that we might escape it;
and to become as hated and accursed of God, that we might find
fauour and eternall grace with him. In his death our sinne is
pardoned: by his bloud, our filthinesse is washed away: by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
we are reconciled to his father, and made at one with
God. Let vs not breake this so happie truce betwixt the Lord
and vs: let vs not through sinne condemne our selues againe;
nowe that we are iustified: let vs not walke toward hell, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made plaine and easie the path to heauen. The image of
God in vs, defaced through Adam, is repaired by Christ: Let vs
appeare therefore in this pure image before God, that wee may
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17219:137"/>
be acceptable in his pure sight. Through Christ we are called
to be citizens with the Saints, and Gods houshold-seruaunts: let
vs then put on the garments of trueth and innocencie, that so it
may appeare whose seruaunts we are by our Lords liuerie. We
are made the happie heires of his glorious kingdome, and fellow
heires with Iesus Christ: wherefore let vs not seeke so possessions
here, that we loose a better inheritance aboue in heauen. If wee
doe, it is in vaine that the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ hath
beene so largely offered vnto vs, and plentifully powred on vs.
Yea his grace will encrease the wofulnesse of our destruction.</p>
            <p>7 Grace is offered and receiued by two especiall outwarde
meanes:<note place="margin">Grace offered by the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> the preaching of the Gospel; and the holie administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the blessed Sacraments. These two are the instruments,
or rather the hands, by the which the holie Ghost doth offer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite,
seale and deliuer the grace of God vnto vs.</p>
            <p>8 And there bee two sorts of men to whom grace is offered
by the word in vaine.<note place="margin">Grace offered in vaine by the word to such as wil not heare it.</note> The one are they which wil not giue it so
much as the hearing; but doe vtterly contemne, and vnkindely
refuse that which the Lord doth so kindly and so gratiously offer
to them. The other, they that heare it indeede, reade it, but
consider it not, receiue it but altogether without fruite, and for
fashions sake. Of the former sort are all such as Pharao was,
who enioined Moses to come no more in his sight, for hee would
not heare him.<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> Such also were the Iewes, to whom when Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
preached, they stopped their eares. Such they of whom
the Lorde complaineth by the Prophet;<note place="margin">Esay 66.</note> saying, <hi>I spake; and they
would not heare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9 Of the latter sort there be three kindes shadowed in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the sower,<note place="margin">To such as heare it but reteine it not.</note> which went foorth to sowe his seede: whereof
some fell in the high way side;<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> some in stonie &amp; grauelly ground;
some also amongst thornes. That which fell by the high waie
side, either the birds of the aire picked vp, or men trod vpon with
their feete. Which our sauiour applieth vnto him that heareth
the word of the kingdome, and vnderstandeth it not; and by and
by the diuell taketh it away, least he should beleeue, and so be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For it fareth with the woord preached, as with the seede
sowen. Some are so dissolute and rechelesse, that they let it in
at the one eare, and out at the other. The hearts of some be so
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17219:138"/>
be so hardened, and parched, because they want the watering of
Gods spirit; (which doth only mollifie) that his word can take no
roote in them. The diuell and his deceitful Angels doe so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch
them, and fil their harts with vain cogitations, so abalienate
their mindes and trouble their memorie; that they cannot tell
what is saide; it is forgotten by that it is spoken. Yea the diuell
doth so throughly occupie the hearts of many other, with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
opinions and fond perswasions, or with such worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
such fleshly lusts, such froward affections; that the hearing
of the blessed word is a wearisome worke vnto them; euery houre
spent that way, is as tedious as a yere, and thought to bee wholly
lost. Many likewise both heare the woord preached, and reade
the Scriptures as the Pharisees did heare them: that they may
seeme to fauour the Gospel, and so vnder pretence of holinesse
blinde the eyes of others, and purloine commoditie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Such come in amongst the children of God, as did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
of old: yet God knowes them to be children of darknesse, not
of light; yea and oftentimes he so shaketh them out of their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rags; that the whole world may espie their ouglie and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
nakednesse. Whilest by their hypocrisie they labour to
deceiue others; they deceiue, yea and damne themselues. To
this sort of men therefore the word is offered: but all in vaine. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they receiue it not: or they receiue it to their owne destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>10 The second sort are resembled to the stonie soile,<note place="margin">To such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine it but not still.</note> which
receiueth the seede, and it taketh roote for a time: but when the
heate of the sunne commeth, it withereth away. Many such
there be, which haue gladly heard the Gospel: haue frequented
sermons with appearance of great deuotion; and could freshly
talke of the holie scriptures of God. But when the heate of the
sunne burst out, when persecution &amp; fire followed the professors
of it: O Lord howe many haue shrunke, yea and vtterly fallen
from it? Howe many persecuters nowe which then were profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors?
Not one amongst fourtie hath taried the beame and blase of
his burning and trying sunne. O Lord God woonderfull is thy
mercie, yet their estate is pitifull. These our times (deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
haue maruelously tried what ground we bee: what roote
Gods word hath taken in vs. Much grauelly ground doth now
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17219:138"/>
appeare; which before was thought to be sound, and battle. So
it is; the timeliest fruite often commeth to least proofe. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shest
Gospeller in appearance, in experience is found not to be
the soundest: and the greatest talkers, oftentimes the idlest wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:
and such as haue bragged most; when it came to be tried i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the field, haue first fled. Such are Gods iudgements; who seeth
farre otherwise than man can see, and through a fawning face es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth
a traitors heart. Howe vainely therefore a great sort haue
receiued and gloried in this Gospel, we nowe perceiue, and with
mornefull hearts doe rue it. The Lord forgiue them, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vs with his grace vnto the ende. Heere wee learne, that
persecution followeth this seede of God. Christ testifieth, that
he came to send the sword amongst vs,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> and not peace: signifying
that the Gospel would procure many enemies and much perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Wherefore my sonne, saith the wise man in the booke
of Ecclesiasticus,<note place="margin">Eccle. 2.</note> when thou commest to the seruice of GOD,
stand in iustice and feare, and make readie thy soule to trial. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
is that ground, which beeing tried is found good and fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>11 The third sort are compared to ground ouergrowne with
thornes.<note place="margin">To such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it and reteine it, but vnprofitably.</note> For as thornes choke the seede which is sowne amongst
them; so that it cannot bring foorth that fruite which it ought to
doe: so the cares of the world, and the pleasures of this life, which
bee as thornes to wound; as brambles and briers to entangle the
mindes and consciences of men; destroie that spirituall seede,
which in a heart well prepared and purged from these weedes,
would growe vp vnto euerlasting life. In this number wee may
recken those base-minded worldlings mentioned in the parable:
who being inuited, came not; because their fermes, their oxen,
and their wiues withheld them. The inordinate care that some
haue for their children and familie, howe to finde them food and
raiment, more than sufficient; the desire that others haue to
keepe their worldly substance, their possessions and riches, and
also to encrease the same, and get to liue in wealth themselues,
and to leaue their children riche; the pleasure that some other
haue to liue in honour, and to be in office, finely to feede, and to
goe gorgeously, to followe their lusts and the transitorie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this vaine world; hath ouergrowne, yea vtterly choked in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17219:139"/>
a great sort of men, a great deale of good seede. Many there be
whom the cares, the riches and the pleasures of this sinful world
haue so bewitched and drawne into so corrupt a sense; that euen
like the Gadarenes,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> or Gergesites, rather than loose one of their
pigges,<note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> tbey will bid adieu to the Gospel of Christ, and beseeche
the Lord of saluation to depart out of their costs. Most true ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is which S. Paul noteth in them, whose hearts are possest
with carefulnesse of this worlds good. They that will be riche,
fall into temptation and snares,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> and into many foolish and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
lusts, which drowne men in perdition and destruction. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are the nurces of all vaine delights and fleshely pleasures.
This caused our Sauiour so heauily to threaten; Woe be to the
wealthie.<note place="margin">Luke 6.</note> Let vs therefore learne, by this warning of our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
when the Gospel of Chiist is preached, to take heede that
neither it be deuoured by birds, nor trodden downe with feete,
nor withered with heate, nor choked with thornes, and so made
vnprofitable: but rather beeing receiued, kept, and cherished in
the ground of our heartes, it may growe and encrease so aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantlie;
that when the Lord shall see it readie for the sickle, and
send his Angels to cut it downe, it may fill the reapers hands, and
make riche the barnes of him that looketh for fruite of it.</p>
            <p>12 Nowe as the graces of God purchased for vs by Christ,<note place="margin">Grace offered by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
are offered vnto vs by the woord: so are they also most liuely and
effectually by the Sacraments. Christ hath instituted and left
in his Church for our comfort and the confirmation of our faith
two sacraments or seales: Baptisme; and the Lordes supper. In
Baptisme, the outward washing of the flesh declareth the inward
purging and cleansing of the spirite. In the Eucharist or supper
of the Lord, our corporall tasting of the visible elements, bread
and wine, sheweth the heauenly nourishing of our soules vnto
life, by the mysticall participation of the glorious bodie &amp; bloud
of Christ. For in as much as he saith of one of these sacred ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
This is my bodie which is giuen for you; and of the other,
This my bloud: hee giueth vs plainely to vnderstand, that all the
graces which may flowe from the bodie and bloud of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
are in a mysterie heere not represented onely, but presented
vnto vs. So then, although we see nothing, feele and tast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but bread and wine: neuerthelesse let vs not doubt at al, but
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17219:139"/>
that he spiritually performeth that which he doth declare &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
by his visible and outward signes: that is to say, that in this
sacrament there is offered vnto the Church that verie true and
heauenly bread, which feedeth and nourisheth vs vnto life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
that sacred bloud, which will cleanse vs from sinne, &amp; make
vs pure in the day of triall. Againe, in that he saith, <hi>Take, eate,
drinke ye all of this;</hi> he euidently declareth that his bodie and bloud
are by this sacrament assured to be no lesse ours, than his; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incorporate into vs, and as it were made one with vs. That
he became man, it was for our sake; for our behoofe and benefite
he suffered; for vs he rose againe; for vs he ascended into heauen;
and finally for vs he will come againe in iudgement. And thus
hath he made himselfe all ours: ours his passions, ours his merits,
ours his victorie, ours his glorie, and therefore hee giueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and all his in this sacrament wholly vnto vs. The reason and
course whereof is this. In his word he hath promised and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
vs of remission of sins, in his death; of righteousnesse, in his
merites; of life, in his resurrection; and in his ascension, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
and euerlasting glorie. This promise we take holde on by
faith, which is the instrument of our saluation: But because our
faith is weake and staggering through the frailtie of our mortall
flesh: he hath giuen vs this visible sacrament, as a seale and sure
pledge of his irreuocable promise, for the more assurance &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of our feeble faith. If a prince giue out his letters patent
of a gift, so long as the seale is not put to; the gift is not fullie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and the partie to whom it is giuen, thinketh not him selfe
sufficientlie assured of it. Gods gift without sealing, is sure; as hee
himselfe is al one, without changing: yet to beare with our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
and to make vs more secure of his promise; to his writing &amp;
woord he added these outward signes and seales, to establish our
faith, and to certifie vs that his promise is most certain. He giueth
vs therfore these holie and visible signes of bread &amp; wine &amp; saith,
Take and eate this is my bodie and blood: giuing vnto the signes
the names which are proper to the things signified by them; as we
vse to doe euen in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon speach, when the signe is a liuelie repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
and image of the thing.</p>
            <p>13 Let vs therefore bee thankefull vnto our redeemer Christ,
for these his great benefites, and so vnspeakeable and vndeserued
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17219:140"/>
mercies:<note place="margin">Howe grace is receiued by the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; not in vain.</note> and let vs receiue this holie sacrament as a sure pledge,
that the vertue of his death and passion is imputed vnto vs for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
euen as though we had suffered the same which hee did in
our owne naturall bodies. Let vs not be so peruerse, as to drawe
backe when Iesus Christ calleth vs so louingly to this royall feast:
but with good consideration of the woorthinesse of this gift pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
we our selues with a feruent zeale, that we may come woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
to this holy table.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Let eche man trie himselfe, and so eate,</hi> saith
the Apostle. Let vs enter into our selues therefore, and examine
the estate of our hearts and soules: and consider in what case we
stand. If we be not of the sanctified houshold of God, not Christs
seruaunts and faithfull Disciples; shall we dare presume to presse
in, being aliens and strangers, to the Lords, as most comfortable,
so also most dreadfull table? No: let no impenitent blasphemer
of God, no whoremonger, or vile and vnrepented sinner, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to touch or tast this foode: for such shall not feede vpon
Christ and his merits: but they receiue their owne damnation.
But such as wil woorthily feede at this blessed feast, must earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and truly mourne for their sinnes past; in a setled purpose and
resolution, neuer willingly to defile themselues againe. And
such as will be partakers of this bread that came from heauen, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, our one and onely Sauiour; must also be as one bread
or loafe, and as one bodie ioined together in brotherly loue, and
all other offices of godlie and Christian charitie. For if thou
come to this banket without this vesture of loue, it shall be saide
vnto thee;<note place="margin">Matt. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Friend howe camest thou hither not hauing on thy wedding

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 14 Concerning the second member, wherein wee are put in
mind that this is the time to shewe our selues woorthie receiuers
of grace;<note place="margin">The time to receiue grace offered, is when God calleth by the preaching of the Gospel.</note> he applieth to his purpose the words of the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
who speaking vnto Christ, as in the person of his father, saith,
<hi>In an acceptable time haue I heard thee, and in a day of saluation haue I hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
thee.</hi> The acceptable time is that, whereof S. Paul speaketh.
<hi>When the fulnesse of time came,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 49.</note> 
               <hi>God sent his sonne made of a woman.</hi> It
was indeede an acceptable time and full of grace,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> wherein the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Christ was so gratiously accepted, and his praiers heard
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:17219:140"/>
of God. And it may well be called <hi>a day of saluation,</hi> wherein his
father gaue him a triumphant victorie ouer those so bitter tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of death. An acceptable time was it, a day of saluation;
not so much in respect of him who at all times was accepted; as
of vs, who without him and his death had beene refused. For in
that day was your redemption wrought by our redeemer: and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
saued by his passion who had no sinne. And as hee died, and
rose;<note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> so he praied and was heard for vs. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for
the world, I pray for them whom thou hast giuen me,</hi> saith our Sauiour.
Nowe the acceptable time and day of saluation which Esay spake
of, S. Paul doth very aptly and effectually applie to his present
occasion; <hi>Beholde, nowe is the acceptable time: beholde, nowe is the day
of saluation.</hi> For the Fathers liued in hope of this acceptable day
of grace and fauour to come: but the verie time beginneth from
the suffering of Christ Iesus, and continueth euen to the worlds
end. And vnto euerie one of vs, so much of this acceptable time
is granted, as we haue time granted here to liue. Which being not
long (because our life is but as it were a span) it may fitly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a day, or rather an houre of saluation. This day therefore grace
is offered vs of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> Against whose maiestie, <hi>forasmuch as all haue
sinned,</hi> and by sinne <hi>are depriued of his glorie;</hi> wee must needes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that for the recouering of our losse, wee stand all in
present neede of his grace. Nowe is the time wherein our soules
doe groane to be releeued with grace and mercie. For who can
say; <hi>My heart is sound: I neede no Physitian?</hi> What one man is there
amongst vs all, who hath loued God as he ought to doe? or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
his neighbours case as he would his owne? We may dallie
with our selues, and thinke that we suffer not for our owne trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;
that we are not cause of that great plague &amp; calamitie,
which presently is come vpon our countrie. Beloued; do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
your selues. Our God is a righteous iudge; who blesseth the
innocent, and heapeth punishment vpon the offending soule.
For truly if we searche our selues as we ought to doe with a single
eye; if we examine out thoughts, take a reckoning of our words,
and peise our deedes and waies in an equall ballance; aske our
hearts, and they wil tell vs; enquire of our conscience, &amp; it wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto vs, that euerie one of vs hath wel deserued more than
hath happened vnto any of vs: Yea wee shall finde that all haue
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17219:141"/>
not suffered halfe so much, as euerie one hath deserued. Our first
parents for tasting the fruit that was forbidden them,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
cast out of their pleasaunt habitation, and punished in all
their posteritie to come for euer. Haue wee being terrefied by
the horror of their example, withheld our hands and bridled our
affections from euerie vnlawful and forbidden thing?<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and Abiram with their fauourites and confederates, were
swallowed vp of the earth for whispering against Moses and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

lawfull magistrates, against our iudges, and against the Lordes
ministers?<note place="margin">2. Kings 14.</note> Dauid, for numbring of his people, procured such a

consciences doe knowe how farre otherwise the case doth stand.
I will not enter into particulars, nor open the sores of any man:
but send you home into the closet of your owne heartes to see it.
And if we prosecute the comparison in such wise as hath beene
touched; I nothing doubt but euerie one of vs may iustly lay the
cause of this heauie displeasure of God, and grieuous plague vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himselfe: euerie one may say and crie out with the prophet
Dauid; It is I that haue sinned, I that haue committed iniquitie
and deserued this great vengeaunce. The smart whereof, as wee
doe outwardly feele; so if it inwardly pierce vs to the quick of our
hearts and soules, if we be truly wounded and humbled in deede
with the grieuous remembrance of our former sinnes: this is, of
all other, the most acceptable time for vs to receiue the sauing
health of God: who as he taketh his time to offer vs grace: so we
must also take ours, to receiue it beeing offered. To day, saith
the Apostle, if you wil heare his voice, harden not your heartes.
It is to day, so long as he speaketh by his Prophet, saying, <hi>Returne
euerie one from his euill waie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 18.</note>

sufficient to set vs forward to repent, to turne and come to our

time of their repentance; which else had come too late. So they
which repented at the preaching of Iohn,<note place="margin">Matt. 3.</note> made speede to retire
from their owne by-paths, and ro turne into the waies of God.
As many as receiued fruitfully and effectually the grace which
the Lord did offer by the hands of Peter,<note place="margin">Acts 3.</note> preaching the remission
of sins; they also tooke the opportunitie of that selfesame houre,
&amp; so were saued.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> All these things (as S. Paul witnesseth) are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for our instruction: that wee might learne wisely to redeeme
the time, and to knowe the day of Gods most gratious visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>15 Especially nowe;<note place="margin">The most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial time to receiue grace is when God afflicteth.</note> sith we doe not onely heare the sound of
his voice, but also feele the smart of his correction. There is no
hope that euer we wil receiue the grace of God: if in the midst of
our afflictions we refuse it. His case is desperate whom aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie

When men are heauie laden with griefe and sorowe, then are
they fittest to call for, and to receiue refreshing. Examples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are almost infinite. After Iosephs brethren were brought into
comber and into feare of their liues,<note place="margin">Gen. 42.</note> they remembred their fact
committed against their brother; and it grieued them much,
which before had much contented them. Whilest men are at
ease and haue rest in the flesh, grace is no grace, the promises of
God cannot haue their effectuall and powrefull operations,<note place="margin">2. Par. 33.</note> no
not in the very elect of God. Looke vpon Manasses in his
throne, and in prison: vpon the people of Israel, at home in peace,
and abroade in banishment:<note place="margin">Psal. 136.</note> vpon Noah, Dauid, Ezechias, all
the Saints and seruaunts of God in their flourishing estate, and in
their grieuous troubles: and yee shall finde, that the gratious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of God were neuer receiued woorthily in deede but in great

extremities. <hi>When a man is striken with sorowe vpon his bed, and the
griefe of his bones is sore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 33.</note> saith Elihu in the booke of Iob; <hi>so that his
life causeth him to abhorre bread, and his soule daintie meate.</hi> If in such
a case there be a messenger with him, or an interpreter, one of a
thousand, to declare vnto man his righteousnesse, how that God
wil haue mercie vpon him, and wil say; Deliuer him that he goe
not downe into the pit, for I haue receiued a reconciliation: such
a message of grace no doubt will then be heartily accepted, or else
be in vaine for euer. It is affliction that maketh the kingdome of
heauen to suffer violence. When we are in miserie, in trouble, in
distresse of bodie &amp; mind, then especially is the acceptable time,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the high day of our saluation.<note place="margin">Ier. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Thou didst chastise me,</hi> saith the
Prophet Ieremie, <hi>and then I came to vnderstanding.</hi> So that the
most especiall time to shewe our selues woorthie receiuers of the
grace of God, is when his chastisements are vpon vs, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
doth afflict our soules. Wherefore most properly (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the Lord) to you it may be spoken; Receiue not the grace
of God in vaine. This is the acceptable time, this is the day of
your saluation. Although the grace of God haue heeretofore
beene offered, and vnkindely refused; yet, nowe that the hande
of his heauie displeasure, nowe that the rodde of his correction
is laide vpon you: O receiue it not nowe in so acceptable a time
in vaine!</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 16 The onely way to shewe our selues woorthie receiuers of
grace,<note place="margin">The right way of woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuing grace is by heartie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> is by heartie and vnfeined repentaunce to acknowledge
that we haue sinned in peruerting righteousnesse, and to amende
that which we knowe and acknowledge to bee amisse. If wee
thinke to be receiued into his fauour without this; brethren, wee
deceiue our selues. He is gratious; but to the penitent: and will
haue mercie vpon sinners; but vpon sinners which forsake their
sinnefulnesse. It is true that he wil heale whom he hath spoiled;
and whom he hath wounded he will builde vp; he wil quicken the
dead and raise vp them that are throwne downe: yet so, if they

               <hi>Come, and let vs returne vnto the Lord.</hi> The first effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the doctrine whereof we are throughly ynough acquainted, We

wanteth: whereunto wee are so slowe, and so hardly are
drawne; that in this one point we wearie out all our teachers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this one thing they wast, they spend themselues. And in
the end; we are most commonly as wee were at the first; like the
Leopard, that chaungeth not his skinne. To bring men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
is such a worke of weight, that God himselfe seemeth
as it were tired with labouring so long about it. As appeareth by
those passionate and grieuous complaints recorded in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I haue spoken; they doe not heare: I haue stricken, they are
not grieued. How often would I haue gathered them as a hen
her chickens vnder her wings; and they would not bee gathered.

Yet neither were they ignoraunt, and we doe very wel know, that
there is no other medicine saue repentaunce onely to heale the
wounds of our soules: no other way to restore our selues againe
to our fathers home,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> but onely, <hi>Father; I haue sinned:</hi> no other
meane to quenche the wrathfull indignation which our sinnes
haue caused to burne and flame as an ouen; but onely our teares.
Though our sins be red as skarlet, or as fire; yet being bathed with
the water of our eyes, they are scowred &amp; made as white as snow?
It is written of Marie (not of that vertuous Marie, but of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute)
that she was <hi>Mulier peccatrix;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> notorious for her light and
lewde behauiour. Yet by repenrance, as she died vnto sinne;
so the memorie of sinne being dead vnto her, she liueth stil in the
glorious remembraunce of that righteousnesse which penitent
sinners obteine by faith. She is honourably mentioned where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the Gospel of Christ is heard: all men speake of her teares;
of her sinnes no one is mentioned or knowne. The pretious
oyle wherewith shee was woont to annoint her selfe, that shee
might be more pleasaunt to the senses of her louers; shee nowe
powreth out, and for loue sake bestoweth it vpon her Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
The eyes which were woont to cast wanton lookes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the dissolute; did nowe gush out with water, and serued as
conduites at the feete of Christ. The haire which before had
beene wrapt in golde, had beene coloured, pleated, and borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
laide out, and beset with pearles; was now imployed to a far
other vse; that the honour receiued from the feete of Iesus, might
put out the shame which before it had taken from the eyes of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17219:143"/>
lewde and amarous beholders. Hauing washed and dried, she
could not satisfie her selfe til she had also kissed her Sauiours feet;
whose mercie had now eased her heart of that deadly sting, which
the lips of wantons had imprinted &amp; left behind them. O blessed
paterne of true contrition, howe woorthily art thou left for al po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
to talke of; to behold and to follow? Such conuerts shew
plainely that they are woorthie receiuers, and that the grace of
God hath not appeared vnto them in vaine. For they who in
this fort denie vngodlinesse and worldly lusts; will surely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the blessed Apostles exhortation which followeth, giue
offence to none.</p>
            <p>17 For although there must of necessitie offences rise:<note place="margin">By walking without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> yet,
Woe be to him hy whom they rise. Why? Were not the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
offended at the scholers and disciples of Christ, for not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;
for eating with vnwasht hands; for plucking the eares of
corne on the Sabaoth day; and for such like things of their owne
inuention, toyes of no importance? Nay did not the most chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
deedes of Christ himselfe offend these peeuish hypocrites?
It is true; they were offended with him and his: as at this day the
Romish Pharisees are offended with vs and ours. But we must
marke and obserue, that we are warned onely not to giue offence
to any man. If men bee offended with vs, which by vs are not
offended; such offences being not giuen of vs, but taken of them;
are not our faults, but their follies. Vnto vs therefore at this time
S. Pauls exhortation importeth thus much: that sith God hath
graunted vs fauour in the eyes of this people with whom we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
conuerse, it were a thing most intollerable for vs, with Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
children to commit such crimes, or giue such offences as
might make vs odious and lothsome in their sight. The Gospel
hath nowe gotten honour and renowne by these our sufferings
for it: let it not hereafter bee ill spoken of and slandered through
our disordered conuersation. Of all others wee had neede to
walke most warily. We are set as it were a citie vpon a mountaine,
to be gazed at. Our conuersation is marked of all men: and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
searche made of it on euerie hand. Friends, enemies and
strangers obserue our steppes: and a litle fault in vs will be taken
as a great offence. Let the woord of Christ dwell richely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, with all wisedome; that ye may bee blamelesse and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17219:143"/>
pure, as the sonnes of God, without rebuke; that we may bee as
shining lights in the world, holding foorth the word of life, that
in the day of Christ we may reioice and be glad, as they who haue
not receiued the grace of God in vaine. Let vs forsomuch as
our heauenly father for the merites of his sonne, and by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his spirite, doth gratiously offer and exhibite vnto vs
his manifold mercies and benefites, especially in his holie woord
and sacraments; thankefully and woorthily receiue the same: and
namely in this acceptable time, the onely time appointed of God
for vs to receiue, and for him to offer grace: Finally let vs shewe
that his grace hath taken roote and place in our fleshie, not flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearts: in bringing foorth the woorkes of the spirite, the fruite
of true repentance, of sanctification and good life; giuing offence
to no man, no not to those which are without, but walking quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
honestly and orderly in all things, that men seeing our blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and inoffensiue conuersation may glorifie God the giuer of
all goodnesse, and the eternall father. To whom, with the Sonne,
and the holie Ghost, one God of most glorious maiestie, be all
honour and praise rendered in the Church for euer. Amen.</p>

he, his mother and kinsfolke gladly went, there to feast with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
where it pleased him miraculously to increase their cheere
and withal their honour. For it is not nothing which this doth
adde to the holy and reuerend estimation thereof, that the first
miracle which Christ wrought, was wrought at a mariage, and is
so by the holie Ghost recorded. Nowe besides this that almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
God himselfe ordeined mariage, and that in Paradise a most
heauenly habitation, and that before the innocencie was stained
with sinne; besides this that Christ did allow and many waies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
the same, yea and moreouer vouchsafed to resemble his
spirituall coniunction with his Church vnto this estate, we finde
that the Patriarkes, the Priests and Prophets, the holiest men of
God, Abraham, Moses, Aaron, and the rest of that blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
haue chosen to liue rather in mariage than otherwise; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
thereby the state of mariage to be vndoubtedly no
lesse allowable if not more honourable than single life.</p>
            <p>4 Concerning the second point, that is to say the honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which riseth from the causes,<note place="margin">Mariage is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

state of wedlocke, the scripture noteth especially three. The first
is mutuall societie, helpe and comfort. And this were a cause suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to esteeme of mariage highly, if there were no other. For
God hath saide, It is not good that man be alone: <hi>Let vs make him

            <p>5 The second cause why matrimonie was ordeined,<note place="margin">Gen 2.</note> and must
be honoured; is increase and propagation.<note place="margin">Propagation.</note> For although that
this may be; as we see it it is in lewde and shamelesse persons too
often, without this estate of mariage: yet this is so much against
the dignitie of humane nature, that such broodes haue beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
basely accounted of, by men which haue had but the bare
light of naturall vnderstanding. Wherefore the blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
hath saide,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> I will that the younger sort marie, and bring
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17219:145"/>

be no seemely propagation of mankinde, saue onely in mariage.
Children begotten in the state of matrimonie, are the blessing of
God;<note place="margin">Psal. 127.</note> and the fruite of the vndefiled wombe is a reward: as Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wisely acknowledged in the Psalme. For a man to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with the name of a father, to be renued and continued in
his posteritie; if it be not a speciall blessing of God, &amp; a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great reward; why are men &amp; women so desirous to see

a small benefit that God hath raised out of the bodie of Abraham,
so many Patriarchs, Priests, Prophets, Iudges and Kings; such a

blessed saints and citizens in heauen? If it were an honour vnto
Abraham to be a father of many nations: surely mariage, which
made him a lawfull and an honourable father, ought very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to be esteemed.</p>
            <p>6 Another cause of honour giuen vnto mariage,<note place="margin">Remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.</note> is for that

It is true that all haue not neede of this remedie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all are not subiect to the daunger and perill of this disease.
But if any man be subiect to this disease, let him beware howe he
despise this remedie. There bee no doubt that haue the gift of
chastitie by birth; and there be that haue made themselues chast
by indeuour:<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> but of all this men are not capable. As it is the gift
of God; so it seemeth to be a rare and not a common gift. Such
as haue it and so liue sole, they are more fit to labour in Gods
Church; it must needes be graunted: for they are combred with
fewer cares. But be these cares neuer so many and great: better it is
to marie than to burne; and to be burthened with ordinarie and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17219:145"/>
nest cares, than with vnordinarie and dishonest carelesnesse to
be destroied. There are many that deceiue themselues, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a single and a chast life to be all one. To bee pure in bodie
and in spirite; this is chastitie. Hee that seeth a woman, and in
his heart hath a lewde desire towards her, hath defiled his heart,
and is in soule vnchast. If euerie man trie himselfe according to
this rule exactly; peraduenture hee shall see a disease in himselfe
that needeth remedie. Which if he neglect and so perish; whom
may he blame? The medicine is commended with a title of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that thereby we might be allured to vse it. The daunger of
not vsing of it if neede require, is death, For harlots and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

            <p>7 Thus much beeing spoken of the causes for which honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is giuen vnto mariage:<note place="margin">Mariage honourable in respect of mutual duties betweene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties maried. The duties of honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the husband to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his wife Ephes 5.</note> I wil briefly speake of the duties of honour
required betweene parties maried. Howe honourably a man
should vse his wife, S. Paul teacheth plainly in many places; but
especially in his epistle to the Ephesians. Men: loue your wiues, as
Christ hath loued his Church. In which place he instructeth not
onely by precept, but also by setting a paterne before our eyes to
followe; and that is Christ, the true spouse to his Church, the
congregation of the faithfull. The husband ought to loue his
wife, euen as Christ did his Church. But Christ suffered death
to redeeme his Church. Euen so the truely the husband if necessitie
so required, to saue his wife, should ieopard his owne life. His
life is wel spent in sauing of her: and by loosing of her ill spared.
Christ purged and made his Church beautiful, voide of spot or
wrincle, that it might resemble himself, as neere as might be in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
Euen so the husband shold labour to reforme his wife; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
&amp; frame her to discretion, sobrietie, al matron-like vertues,
&amp; all godlinesse: A wise wife maketh a happy husband and in her
goodnes he shal find gladnes. The husband is called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of his
wife, as Christ is of the congregation. When as the head espieth
faults in the members of the bodie; it doth not studie how to cut
them off, &amp; make separation; but doth muse vpon a remedie, &amp;
labour to procure a medicine to applie vnto the hurt parts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the bodie, &amp; to couer the fault if he cannot cure it. A good
husband is a good head: his indeuour will be to cure his diseased
wife, and not to cut her off from him: especially to winne her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Christ, if she wander out of the right waie. Her faults will
make him sorowfull, not furious: and to pitie her infirmities,
without hating of her person. Wisedome is required in the head,
to rule and gouerne well the bodie which is placed vnder it.
He that braggeth and boasteth that hee is the head; and yet wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the prudencie which the head should haue; is vnwoorthy to
be named that which indeede he is not. A wise husband must
winke at many faults, and beare with many of his wiues infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
He that foolishly champeth vpon those griefes, which wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
would haue be swallowed; if hee liue in continuall miserie,
may say, that hee onely liueth happily, which liueth wisely: no
greater wisedome than to deuoure follies. Yet the husbands le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
ought not to be such, as to nourish foolishnesse. Vertue is
alwaies discreete: and in all things the mediocritie. S. Paul gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the reason why men should giue this honour to their wiues:<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note>
for he that loueth his wife, loueth himselfe, they two beeing one
flesh. No man euer hated his owne flesh. Our owne bodies wee
loue, as Christ hath loued his Church. If a mans natural bodie
were neuer so mangled, so sicke, so corrupted, so crooked and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
fauoured; he would yet loue and feede it, and cherishe it so
much the more, by howe much more it needed comfort. Euen
so ought a man to nourish, comfort and helpe his wife: bee shee
neuer so deformed or out of fashion, whether it bee by nature or
by casualtie, in bodie or in minde. Wee haue Christ for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
When the Church ran a whoring, and committed loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
idolatrie, he did not forsake it; neither yet doth our gratious
Lord forsake his beloued spouse, wonderfully spotted with sinne;
but couereth and forgetteth faults; and vseth all meanes possible
to reforme and make vs fit for him. The like should appeare in
the husband to his wife; seeing Paul setteth foorth Christ to be a
paterne to followe. This is that which S. Peter meaneth, when
he exhorteth men to dwell with their wiues according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note>
He would haue husbands to rule according to wisedome,
and not to play the tyrants: not to be sowre, cruell, rash &amp; rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
but to gouerne them according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Gods word, in al
sobrietie grauitie, gentlenesse, loue and discretion; prouiding for
them by honest meanes, as for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. For if he that prouideth
not for his familie, bee woorse than an infidell: there is none so
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17219:147"/>
bad as he that is carelesse for his wife. No infidell neglecteth his
owne bodie. And as S. Paul in the place aboue mentioned, so S.
Peter in this which was last alleaged, sheweth reasons why the
husband should giue this honour to the wife.</p>
            <p>8 Giue honour vnto her,<note place="margin">Reason why the wife shold be honored of her husbande.</note> 
               <hi>velut infirmiori,</hi> as to the weaker.
This may seeme rather to bee a cause to contemne, than to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
For such is the vse. The rich despise the poore; the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the ignorant; the strong, the weake. But this vse is wicked.
Hath not God chosen the weake of this worlde to ouercome the
strong, the foolish to confound the wise? Are not the ignoraunt
as well as the learned Gods? Haue the riche one foote more of
possessions in heauen than haue the poore? Despise not therfore
the weaker creatures, least thou dishonour the creator of them.
But seeing that man and wife are members of one bodie, they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
ought to beare one with anothers infirmities; to couer,
to dissemble and to forgiue eche of them others weakenesse. Yea
the viler the members of our bodies seeme to bee, the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
we are to couer and to honour them, for so S. Paul speaketh.
In like maner, the more weake the woman is; the more diligent
should her husband be to giue her this honour, to couer her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
and not to broache it abroade. For in dishonouring her,
he dishonesteth his owne bodie. Wee easily forgiue children
when they offend by reason of their age. The want of discretion
is for them excuse sufficient. So a man ought to consider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
of his wife, and to beare with her for it. The second cause
of honouring her, is for that God doth giue her honour. God
maketh her partaker with thee of his spirituall graces, and fellow
heire of euerlasting life. Dishonour thou not therefore her on
earth, whom God hath honoured with a place in heauen. The
third cause why the wife should bee well esteemed of, is for vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake. For contempt doth breede contention, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is an hinderance to deuotion. Honour your wiues therefore,
<hi>Ne preces vestrae interrumpantur,</hi> that your praiers through strife bee
not interrupted and broken off. Thus much for the duetie of
the husband.</p>
            <p>9 Touching the duties of honour which the wife doeth owe
to the husband;<note place="margin">Duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour required in the wife.</note> we finde in the beginning of the booke of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
that because of her transgression (for Eue seduced Adam;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17219:148"/>
not Adam Eue:) God gaue her a lawe of subiection to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
that she might euer after be better directed by him, than he
had beene at that time by her.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Sub viri potestate eris, &amp; ipse domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur
tui.</hi> S. Paul also in his Epistle to the Ephesians and Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
putteth wiues in remembrance of this subiection. Wiues
be subiect to your owne husbands,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> as to the Lorde: because the
man is the head of the wife; as Christ is the head of the Church.
And therefore as the Church is in subiection to Christ: so ought
wiues to be in subiection to their husbands, What should wee
seeke more reasons? this one is sufficient. God hath set the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ouer the wife in authoritie: and therefore shee ought wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
&amp; dutifully to obey him, else she disobeyeth that God, who
created woman for mans sake, and hath appointed man to bee
womans gouernour. Peter also setteth foorth this obedience,
and bringeth Sara for an example.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> Wiues bee obedient to your
husbands, euen as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him Sir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose
daughters ye are made in well dooing. Yea we are taught that
wiues should be of so good behauiour, and of such modest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation;
that by their chast and milde life, and the sweetenesse
of their godlie maners, they might winne their euil husbands vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God; and of Atheists make Christians. S. Paul in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to Titus also teacheth a wife her duetie:<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> that is, that she goe
apparelled as becommeth holinesse; that she be no quareller, or
false accuser; but studie to be sober, to loue her husband, to loue
her children, to be discreete chast, abiding at home, good and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to her husband. Obey in all things, saith S. Paul; euen
as it becommeth you in the Lord.<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> So that except it bee against
Gods word, the wife ought in all things to obey her husband. It
is the wiues dutie, as Theophilact well teacheth to regard those
things that be within the house, not lauishingly to wast or spoile
their goods; but to spare with discretion, by such frugalitie as is
conuenient; to see things safe and set in good order. God hath
appointed her to be an helper, not an hinderer. If shee cannot
get, yet let her saue. As he is to followe his affaires abroade: so
she is to ease him to care and cost at home. Let her bee milde-worded
and milde-manered. For, <hi>Melius est habitare in angulo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 21.</note>
               <hi>quam cum muliere litigiosa.</hi> It is better to dwel in the corner of
an house, than with a contentious woman. An honest and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17219:148"/>
woman is an honour to her husband, but the dissolute wife
and vndiscreete is a death. She may not bee a gadder abroade, a
tatler, or a busie bodie; but sober, quiet and demure; not an open
teacher, but readie to learne of her husband at home; obedient in
all lawfull things, taking example of Sara and giuing example to
the younger women of well demeaning themselues. Thus the
man and wife ioyning themselues together in true loue, indeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to liue in the feare of God, &amp; dutifully behauing themselues
the one towards the other, either of them bearing wisely the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
infirmities, doubtlesse they shall reape ioye and comfort by
their mariage, they shall finde this their estate which is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in all, happie and profitable vnto them.</p>
            <p>10 Nowe that we see the honour which is due vnto mariage
in respect of the author, causes and duties thereunto belonging,<note place="margin">Mariage dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by heretikes that holde it not to be of God.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
it remaineth that wee consider by what meanes that honour is in
eche of these defaced. The honour of wedlocke in respect of
the author is diminished, partly by the false perswasions of such
as doe not thinke it ordeined of God; and partly through their
lewde and corrupt affections, who not denying this ordinance to
be from him, enter notwithstanding carelesly into it without such
reuerend consideration as is requisite in things which he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished.
Satan the sworne enemie of all godlinesse, hath euer
by all meanes laboured to vndermine, deface and ouerthrow the
credite of this kinde of life, vsing the ministerie of many wicked
and forsaken heretikes, by whom it hath beene not onely misliked
as troublesome, but vtterly condemned as vncleane and beastly.
The Manichees condemned mariage as a thing whereof satan
was the first author, they denied vtterly that God created male
and female, they affirmed as many as like the vse of matrimonie
to be impes of satan, not seruaunts of God. Others allowing
mariage so it were but once; if happily it were iterated, disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it: with which error some of the auncient fathers themselues,
as it seemeth, were ouertaken. <hi>It is,</hi> saith one, <hi>a Lawe of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
not to iterate matrimonie.</hi> A Lawe. But whose Lawe? Sure
we are that in the booke of the Lawe of God there is no such law.
Againe, there were that approoued wedlock, yea though it were
iterated, but if priests did marie they helde them no better than
vncleane persons. Finally there are that say mariage is if not
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17219:149"/>
honourable, yet tolerable and that in priests, but so, if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into priesthoode being once maried, not into mariage being
once priested. Against these howesoeuer in their sole &amp; single life
they pretende great puritie and perfection as it were of Angels
(although their glorie most commonly hath beene their shame,
and the virginitie of most of them hath beene whoredome and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie)
it sufficeth vs that S. Paul doth terme their lessons the
doctrine of diuels; and that the godlie Patriarchs and Prophets
whom I named before, liuing in the state of mariage were famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
with God, and most deare in his vndefiled sight. In so much
that by S. Augustine speaking of this matter, Abraham is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Iohn Baptist for his holinesse, and by Chrysostome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with Elias.</p>
            <p>11 This state therefore,<note place="margin">Mariage dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by them that seeke it: &amp; not in him whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be author of it.</note> whatsoeuer heretikes haue taught to
the contrarie, being in consideration of the first ordeiner thereof
honourable, we ought in no wise vnaduisedly, lightly or wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take in hand a matter of such weight and of so graue impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
least we dishonour it by our disordered affections as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
by false perswasions haue doone. In entring therefore into
mariage the first caution is that which S. Paul hath to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
whom he teacheth howe their widowes should bestowe
themselues. For although the rule be in particularitie applyed
to them, yet it serueth not for them alone, but for all, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all being herein like to theirs. Whether it be a widowe
therefore that bestoweth her selfe, or a virgin which is bestowed
in mariage,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> the thing she doth is lawfull, <hi>Onely in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12 They doe not this in the Lorde that marie either whom
they shold not,<note place="margin">Mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties too neerely lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by nature.</note> or as they shold not. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shold not as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
either naturally or spiritually vnfit to ioyne in mariage. Of
persons vnfit to be yoked in wedlock by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natural bonds
wherwith they are alreadie coupled,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law hath plainly said, <hi>None
shall come neere to any of the kindred of his flesh.</hi> The vnrulie desires of
men which presume to go further in these cases than the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes
of natural honestie doth permit, must be restrained &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.<note place="margin">Marke 6.</note>
For this cause Iohn the Baptist tolde Herode, It is not
lawfull that thou shouldst haue thy brothers wife. For this cause
S. Paul dealt so sharpely and seuerely in the cause of that lewde
Corinthian,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> with whose foule and vnnaturall fault the whole
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17219:149"/>
Church of Corinth was much disgraced.</p>
            <p>13 In mariage therefore there ought to bee a reuerend regard
of nature,<note place="margin">Mariage without care of religion.</note> that this state be not dishonoured by vnseemely copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as in like sort it is by the vngodlie ioyning of the faithfull
with vnbeleeuers. Of this thing holie Abraham in prouiding
a wife for his son, had as we see an especiall care. For the eldest &amp;
therefore by likelyhoode the discreetest seruaunt of his house,
yea and the trustiest as it seemeth, (for he had rule ouer al which
Abraham did possesse) was not permitted to deale in this matter
without taking a corporal oath before hand. <hi>I wil make thee sweare,</hi>
saith Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> 
               <hi>by the Lord God of heauen and God of the earth, that thou
shalt not take a wife vnto my sonne of the daughters of the Cananites amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst
whom I dwell.</hi> Abraham would not linke his sonne with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Hee remembred what had come of such mariages in the
age before him,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> when the sonnes of God tooke them wiues of
the daughters of men onely for their beautie, without regard of
religion or honestie. Their destruction was a lesson vnto him,
he auoided their sinne by fearing their punishment. GOD
gaue his people expresse charge concerning this, that
they should beware in ioyning mariage with Amorites and
Cananites, the indwellers of that prophane Countrie, not
onely forbidding this kinde of mariage, but also shewing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why his people should forbeare it, least idolatrous wiues
should make their husbands also to become idolators, <hi>least they
make thy sonnes goe a whoring after their gods.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> Whereof wee haue
a notable example in Salomon,<note place="margin">1. Reg 11.</note> whose pitifull fall being so wise a
prince to so horrible impietie, ought to be admonition sufficient
vnto vs, to submit our wisedome to the wisedome of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and our desires to his commaundement. But had Salomon
neuer beene, or had his fall beene vnrecorded, our owne times
may teache vs what fruites haue come of such vngodlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions.
Mans nature is corrupt and fraile, he runneth head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into wickednesse, but to righteousnesse must be drawen by
God, and sooner can the euill peruert the good than the good
persuade the euill. This kinde of mariage therefore seemed so
wicked vnto Esdras,<note place="margin">1. Esd. 14.</note> that hee caused the Israelites after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
out of captiuitie, to put away their strange not women on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but wiues which they had taken to themselues in Babylon.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17219:150"/>
And shall Christians doe wel in receiuing such into mariage, as
Iewes being maried vnto, did wel to put from them?</p>
            <p>14 But the common sort of men in making their matches
this way haue chiefly two outward vntoward respects,<note place="margin">The cause of irreligious mariage is the ouergreat res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting of beautie or wealth.</note> regarding
nothing in their choise except it be either beautie or monie. The
sonnes of God of olde bewitched with the beautie of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of men, procured the general flood to ouerflowe them all, &amp;
to wash the defiled world. Samson tooke one of the daughters
of the Philistims to wife,<note place="margin">Iud. 14.</note> because shee pleased his eye: but what
came of it? It cost him a polling, wherein stoode his strength,
and it lost him both his eyes which before were rauished in the
beautie of that deceitful woman. Others there are yet of a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
note whose only care is to match themselues wealthily. Their
question is with what monie, not with what honestie the parties
whom they seeke are endowed; whether they bee riche, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be godlie; what lands they haue on earth, not what pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
are laide vp in heauen for them. Such as marie for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
as the monie wasteth, so their loue weareth, neither is there
any loue or friendship constant, saue onely that which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on constant causes, as vertue and godlinesse, whereof onely
neither time nor man can spoile vs. There was a riche man in
Athens which had a daughter to marie, and he asked counsell of
Themistocles howe to bestowe her, shewing him that there was
a verie honest man that would gladly haue her, but he was poore;
and there was a riche man which had also desired her, but he was
not honest. Themistocles aunswered, that if he were to choose,
he would preferre monilesse men before masterlesse monie. It is
true that S. Paul saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Godlinesse is great gaine.</hi> Whether it bee
man or woman that is godlie, they be rich, and as Salomon saith,
<hi>He that findeth a good wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 18.</note> 
               <hi>findeth a good and a pretious thing,</hi> the value
of golde is not to be matched with her. In mariage therefore
it behooueth vs to be carefull, that they whom we choose bee of
the houshold of God, professing one true religion with vs, the
disparagement wherein is the cause of all dissension, true friende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
being a louing consent, as in all things so chiefly in Gods
true seruice.</p>
            <p>15 But this is not ynough. For although the parties mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
be such as the lawe of the Lorde alloweth to come together,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17219:150"/>
yet can it not be saide that they marie in the Lord,<note place="margin">Mariage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of pare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

marie in such sort as the lawe prescribeth. For mariage may be
as much dishonoured by the one as by the other. For orderly
entring into the state of matrimonie, it is required that they which
be vnder the tuition and gouernement of others haue the ful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of their parents, tutors, or such as haue rule ouer them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and guide them.<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> Abraham prouided a wife for his sonne

what honour is giuen vnto parents, if in this chiefe case beeing

The lawe saith, <hi>If a man finde a maide that is not betrothed, and

of the virgin fiftie shekels of siluer, and she shall be his wife.</hi> What?
Although the parents be against it? No. For, <hi>If her father refuse to
giue her to him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 30.</note> 
               <hi>he shall pay the monie and not marie her.</hi> Againe the

an oath to binde himselfe by a bond, hee shall not breake his
promise, but shall doe according to all that proceedeth out of his
mouth. Neuerthelesse if a woman vowe a vowe vnto the Lord,
and binde her selfe by a bond beeing in her fathers house, in the
time of her youth, and her father disallowe her, the same day that
he heareth all her vowes and bonds wherewith shee hath bound
her selfe, they shall not be of value, and the Lord wil forgiue her,
because her father disallowed her. If promises made to GOD
without consent of parents are of no effect, can promises made to
men be effectuall where the parents consent is not had? <hi>Children,</hi>
saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Col. 3.</note> 
               <hi>obey your parents in all things.</hi> In all things? and
not in this the greatest of all? When S. Augustine was required
to helpe to make a mariage in the behalfe of a young man, &amp; the
other partie was named,<note place="margin">Aug. ep. 133.</note> hee aunswered, I like that matche well,
<hi>Sed mater adolescentulae non adest, cuius voluntatem, vt nosti, requirere
debemus,</hi> but the mother of the young damsel is not present, whose
good will (as you knowe well ynough) wee must aske. And as
the parents or tutors consent is to bee had in all good and lawfull
mariages, so it is against the duetie of good parents either to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17219:151"/>
keepe their children longer vnmaried than in conuenient, or tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
an ouergreat desire of enriching them (which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
disease) to marie them against their liking. Such mariages
seldom or neuer proue wel, but are for the most part the cause of
great sin &amp; much miserie. There can be no lawfull &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable

a religious and a godlie choise; hauing the full consent of their
parents or tutors, doubtlesse God is no author of their mariage,
it is not he that coupleth and ioyneth them together, their estate
is base and not honourable in his sight.</p>

we haue heard that the first is mutuall helpe and comfort. For

that hath no husbande. And, <hi>As where no hedge is, there the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session

This is the iudgement of the wise. But the mouths of fooles are

which the maried are woont to sustaine in the flesh, neuer

God created him for necessitie. In like sort mariage which
God hath giuen as a remedie and not onely as a meane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
propagation. If therefore we neede it and doe not vse it, howe
doe we honour it? S. Paul was so careful in this respect that euen
where he giueth the highest commendation to single life,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> there
he addeth, <hi>This I speake</hi> for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, not to tangle you in a

power ouer his owne will.</hi> Otherwise were it not better to vse an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
remedy, than to nourish and increase an incurable sore?
Let vs take heede howe we feede the flesh in her vnlawful desires.
For it cannot be in vaine that God should speake so directly and
as it were so particularly vnto euerie one that lewdely defileth &amp;
prophaneth the temple of the holie spirite, <hi>Perdet te Deus,</hi> Thee
God shall destroie. This the enemie knoweth, &amp; therfore he labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

that although they frie in the heate of their vile affections, yet
their outward continencie of bodie is of it selfe meritorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>19 I will therefore adde somewhat concerning the disgrace
which commeth vnto mariage, in regard of the duties thereunto
belonging, and so end. The companie and felowship of maried
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17219:152"/>
folkes, if discreetely, louingly and religiously they performe
those needefull dueties eche vnto other which God requireth at
the handes of both, then no doubt their estate is blessed of the
Lord and deserueth to be honoured amongst men. But if there
want discretion in them, wee see what contentions, strifes and
heart-burnings are wont to grow betweehe couples, to the great
disquieting of their owne mindes inwardly, and, if thinges doe
chaunce to breake out as such flames commonly doe, to the
discrediting also of their persons openly in the worlde. How
vnsweete and vnpleasaunt such a life is, the wise man shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
by comparing a troublesome and contentious wife to a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

by the other? When Satan despaireth, of al other meanes
he vseth this as the surest to speede in accomplishing wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
He found no such instrument as Iesabel to make Achab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wallowe
in bloud, as idolatrous women to bewitche Salomon, as
the daughters of Moab to steale away the heartes of the children
of Israel. It is godlinesse and religion, conscience and feare of
sinne that keepeth them within the limits of their duetie. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this they are not only carelesse of that comely shamefastnesse
and sober temperaunce which beseemeth the honestie of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
but exceeding the bounds of all modestie, they ouerflowe
and breake out euen into extreme lasciuiousnesse with others.
Heereby the honourable ordinaunce of God is loathed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

the dueties that eche partie linked in mariage doeth owe vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the honour which mariage hath by euerie of these; and in
these the ground from whence discredite and dishonour groweth
vnto mariage. God graunt that whether we bee called to this

we may keepe both our soules and bodies vnstained, &amp;

the sea of Galilee. Howbeit the multitude left not him,
but because they had seene the signes and woonders which hee
wrought, miraculously recouering the sicke and restoring them
to perfect health, therfore they flocked after him in great troups.
When Iesus therefore had lifted vp his eyes, and sawe that a very
great multitude came vnto him, hee saith to Philip, <hi>Whence shall
we buie bread that these may eate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 The first reason therefore why Christ forsooke Ierusalem
and went beyond the sea of Galilee,<note place="margin">To auoid the handes of the wicked.</note> was to the ende hee might
conuey himselfe from the tyrannie and persecution of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.<note place="margin">Matth. 14.</note>
So we reade in the Gospel according to S. Matthew, that
hearing howe his forerunner was beheaded, he went aside, tooke
boate, and retired into a solitarie place apart. Whereby wee are
giuen to vnderstand, that if our liues be particularly sought, wee
may lawfully flee from the cruell and bloudie hands of our perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.
Christ foretelling his Disciples of the grieuous &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
entertainement which they should finde at the handes of the
worlde, giueth them this lesson, <hi>Beware of men,</hi> and withall this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
<hi>When they shall persecute you in this Citie,</hi>

               <hi>flie into an other.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I neede not much to perswade, fraile and fearefull flesh is euer
readie to flie perill. But what scripture those wen can alleage
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17219:155"/>
for themselues that flie not for the Gospel but from the Gospell,
that flie before they be persecuted or their bloud sought as yet I
cannot learne. Belike they feare least they should bee repayed
with their owne measure. No, our Gospel is a doctrine of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and not of malice; they which syncerely professe it are full of
clemencie, and altogether ruled by pietie; our Church consisteth
of milde sheepe and not of cruel woolues; the popish Church is
the wooluish and bloudie Church; we seeke reformation and not
destruction, knowing that Christian hearts are to be perswaded
by the Scriptures and not by fire and fagot to be inforced. Yet
doe I not meane by this speeche but that the obstinate, the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and disturbers of religion, the false prophets and deceiuers
of the people may be lawfully cut off: the sword may lawfully be
drawne against such as are manifest traitors vnto the trueth and
to the state. But this is not the matter whereof they stande in
feare. It is not outward daunger but inwarde terror for which
they flie.<note place="margin">Prou. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Fugit impius nemine persequente,</hi> the wicked man flyeth
when no man pursueth him, he trembleth where nothing is to be
feared, the wagging of a leafe doeth make him shake because his
heart is euill.</p>
            <p>9 Another cause why Christ went aside into the wildernesse,<note place="margin">To take some rest.</note>
may seeme to haue beene a desire of taking some rest after the
great and manifold trauels that hee and his Disciples had sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as appeareth by the woords which he spake to his disciples,
<hi>Come apart into the wildernesse and rest a while.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marke 6.</note> This lesson is glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learned and too much practised. <hi>Requiescite</hi> pleaseth euerie
man. The trueth is that the bodie and minde of man must after
labour be refreshed with rest. But he which laboureth not is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as vnwoorthie to rest as to eate. Againe such as will take
rest and ease after labours, must learne of Christ as well to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
their ease as their paines. Hee permitteth his Disciples to
take their rest: but he limiteth and restraineth his permission say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Rest a while.</hi> For by too much rest men are not made the
more fit but the lesse willing to take paine. There is no one
fault from which the wise man doth so much indeuour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
men as from sloth. For this cause he putteth vs so often
in minde of the great blessings which God doth heape vpon the
painefull man.<note place="margin">Prou. 28.</note> 
               <hi>The hand of the diligent shall beare rule. Hee that til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

               <hi>She laboureth cheerefully, her candle go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

but laboured by all meanes to make them odious: sometime
by setting their forlorne estate before mens eyes,<note place="margin">Prou. 26.</note> 
               <hi>I passed by the field

Wherefore though wearinesse, though labour and trauell doe
cause thee to desire necessarie rest, yet beware that the sweetnes
of rest doe not cause thee to thinke that labour is vnnecessarie.
Rest, but rest <hi>a litle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10 The last cause that I gather of Christs going into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,<note place="margin">To auoid the feast of Easter.</note>
was as it may be coniectured to auoide the feast of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
at Ierusalem. For so the Euangelist speaketh, <hi>Easter a festiuall
daie of the Iewes was nowe at ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de.</hi> It seemeth strange that Christ
the example of all good order &amp; behauiour should flie from this
solemne feast of Easter which he himselfe by his Prophet Moses
had straitly commaunded to be obserued and kept. You must
therefore consider that the Iewes neglected the commandement
of God, and in stead thereof set vp their owne traditions, as S.
Paul recordeth, so that the temple was nowe become a denne of
theeues. Christ therefore auoyded too much fellowship with
this wicked generation.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> For what societie hath righteousnesse
with vnrighteousnesse? what communion hath light with darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
what concord hath Christ with Belial? what part hath the
beleeuer with the infidell? what agreement hath the temple of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:17219:156"/>
God with idols. In this we ought all to followe Christ, all to flie
as he did from the place where the seruice of God is openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned,
and his name intolerably blasphemed. <hi>Depart, depart,
goe out from thence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 52.</note> Choose rather to suffer want in the wildernes
with Christ than to enioye the pleasures of the worlde with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
conscience, to be partakers of the word of life in a desert, than
to raigne where the aduersarie of Christ and Christianitie bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
sway. God be praised for euer, in our Churches of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to our great comfort, God is serued euen in such sort as him
selfe by his holie woord hath prescribed. So that no misconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
person can alleage any reason sufficient why to withdraw him
selfe from our assemblies. Our Church-praiers are the Psalmes,
our lessons the scriptures, our sacraments according to Christes
institution. Which thing not many yeeres sithence I alleaging
vnto one of no small account nowe in Louain, his aunswere was,
<hi>I must confesse that is good which you haue in your Churches, but the trueth
is you haue not ynough.</hi> Indeede wee haue lesse in their eye than y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
But if we weie things according vnto that rule, <hi>What so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

               <hi>thou shalt put nothing thereto,
nor take ought there from:</hi> then can it not be denied but that our <hi>litle</hi>
is sufficient, and their <hi>more</hi> is too much.</p>
            <p>11 As these considerations droue Christ into the wildernes,<note place="margin">Occasions which moued the multitude to followe Christ.</note>
so the Euangelist setteth foorth some motiues which caused so
great a multitude to followe him. Some were drawne with the
strangenesse of those things which hee wrought and taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them.<note place="margin">Nouelties.</note> To whom in these our daies wee may compare
them which haunt sermons for no other end, but either vainly to
hearken for newes, or curiously to note what order &amp; eloquence
they may finde in the preacher, or maliciouslie to take holde of
things spoken, when they may by froward construction be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to an offensiue meaning. These labour to their owne losse,
they are vnprofitable followers.</p>
            <p>12 Others followed Christ for bread.<note place="margin">Hunger.</note> Such followers our
times haue brought out to many. So long as the Gospell can
feede, cherish and mainteine them, they are willing and glad to
be professors of it: but when persecution commeth they shrink.
A great sort of halting and dissembling ministers doe now occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
roomes in the Church, which in heart hate the Gospell, yet
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17219:156"/>
for bread sake they are contented to goe in the same ranke with
the followers of Christ Iesus. But he knoweth their secret cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and will one day make them knowne vnto others what
they are.</p>
            <p>13 Sundrie there were which followed for a desire which they
had of bodilie health.<note place="margin">Health.</note> For Christ <hi>went about healing euerie maladie,
and euerie infirmitie in the people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> We see by daily experience that
the bodie is more cared for than the soule, the flesh than the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
the carcase than the minde. If the bodie be diseased, we seeke
phisicke and are willing to paie well for it; to preserue the bodie
from griefe and sickenesse who is not carefull? but where is hee
that studieth howe to auoide the diseases of the soule, that morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the noysome desires of the fleshe, that keepeth his heart in
awe and subiection, that dieteth himselfe according to the rules
which that blessed Physitian hath prescribed? Chrysostome fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
great fault with parents in this behalfe, who if their children
fall sicke in bodie, weepe and lament, but if they be neuer so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
vexed and tormented with sinne, they make light or no
account of it. These men loue the bodies of their children as
it seemeth better than their soules. So this fraile carcase this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of claie is much made of. To procure things good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
for it, we can be content to trauel sea and lande, to be at
any cost, to endure any paines. If health may be had, though it be
in a wildernesse it wil be sought.</p>
            <p>14 The last and best sort of followers were such as followed
Christ to heare his word.<note place="margin">The worde of life.</note> This is that trauell that chiefly is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

Gods woord. <hi>My sheepe</hi> heare my voice. Thus you see the
causes why Christ was followed of the multitude.</p>
            <p>15 Christ was quietly set with his Disciples in the mount
when this people approched.<note place="margin">Christ with his Disciples quiet in the mount when the multitude came vnto him.</note> The hill as S. Chrysostome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
may represent the kingdome of God: the inheritors where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are alwaies delighted to clime vpward, to seeke those thinges
that be aboue, to take pleasure in nothing but that which is from
heauen. Christ and his Disciples being on the top of the mount
were quiet. And the Church of Christ euen in the wildernesse
in the midst of affliction doth in him finde rest. In the worlde,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:17219:157"/>
saith our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note> 
               <hi>You shall haue distresse:</hi> but haue confidence, I

            </p>
            <p>16 Nowe followeth the miracle which our Sauiour wrought
by occasion of the multitude which was there assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him and his Disciples.<note place="margin">The miracle which Christ wrought, and the circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and in himselfe. The people were the vulgar sort.</note> In this there are many things
conteined very woorthie of your good and godlie considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which for orders sake we may reduce to the persons of the
people, of the Disciples, and of Christ. Concerning the people
the words of the Euangelist S. Iohn are these, <hi>Sequebatur eum tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
multa,</hi> A great troupe followed him. But S. Marke more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressing the great zeale and desire they had to the Gospel of
Christ,<note place="margin">Marke 6.</note> saith, <hi>They ran flocking thither on foote out of all Cities.</hi> In
whom we haue first to obserue that they were not of the Princes
nor of the priests which came vnto him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> but <hi>turba</hi> the common
and vulgar sort.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Num quis ex principihus?</hi> Doth any of the rulers
or of the Pharisees beleeue in him? <hi>Not many noble, not many
wise,</hi> saith the Apostle. The noble and mightie loued libertie
of life and feared mutations. The wise were circumspect, and
sawe that the Gospel would marre their workes. Onely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they which were basely accounted of in the worlde, they
which knewe not the Lawe came vnto Christ.</p>
            <p>17 The second thing to be obserued in them is their cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,<note place="margin">They came cheerefully.</note>
their alacritie, their zeale and courage. They came not
dragging their legges after them, they <hi>ran</hi> vnto Christ. Neither
care of things at home, nor feare of daunger abroade; neither the
length of the waie thither, nor the lacke of lodging and foode
there; neither the feare of the Priests, the Scribes and Pharisees,
the knowne and professed enemies of Christ, nor any other by
respect in the worlde was able to staie them. Shall not this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rise vp in iudgement, thinke you, against vs, whom God hath
by so many blessings allured and as it were entised to come vnto
him, and notwithstanding findeth vs so farre from this cheerefull
and gladsome following of him, that when hee doth followe and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:17219:157"/>
seeke after vs we turne our backes and flie from him? Could wee
doe thus,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> if indeede we did beleeue that he hath <hi>the woords of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> and that as many as <hi>continue with him to the end, they shall be
saued?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18 The thirde thing especially to be noted in this people is,<note place="margin">They did obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently as they were comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note>
that their willingnesse to come was not greater then their ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to obey him vnto whom they came. For when they were
willed to <hi>sit downe vpon the grasse,</hi> although they were so many and
had so little in sight before them (for what were fiue loaues and
two fishes to relieue almost fiue thowsand men?) neuerthelesse
they made no aunswere, they gainsaide not, but without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
did that which they were commaunded. Elisha prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
in the name of the Lorde and promised plentie to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Samaria being grieuouslie afflicted with extreeme famine.
But a Prince in great fauour and authoritie with the king replyed
against the man of God,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Though the Lorde woulde make windowes in
the heauen could this thing come to passe.</hi> The same Prophet sent one
to Naman the Syrian with this message, <hi>Goe and washe thee in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
seuen times and thy fleshe shall come vnto thee againe and thou shalt bee
cleansed.</hi> But Naman replied, <hi>Are not Abanah</hi> &amp; Pharphar riuers
of Damascus better than all the waters of Israell? may I not wash
me in them and be clensed? This is the manner of the wise ones
in the worlde: when they should obey God they reason and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the matter with him, as if he knewe not what hee did. But
the faith of this people did subdue their witte and reason to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
worde and will of God.</p>
            <p>19 This may suffice concerning the people.<note place="margin">The disciples cause the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to sit down</note> Of the Disciples
of our Sauiour it is said that <hi>They made the people to sit downe.</hi> Hence
Ministers Pastours and Teachers may learne, that sith God hath
ordained them as the meanes whereby the elect must be brought
to the obedience of Christ Iesus, they cannot approue their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
vnto him except they bee carefull to fulfill the worke for
which he hath appointed them.<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> 
               <hi>I say vnto you that many shall come
from the East and West, and shall sit downe with Abraham Isaac and Iacob
in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> In this sense that wee might also <hi>sit downe</hi>
Christ hath established those high and holie functions before
mentioned. Wherefore S. Paule professeth that for this cause
he receiued grace and <hi>Apostleship,</hi> that <hi>obedience</hi> might be yeelded
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17219:158"/>
               <hi>to the faith</hi> amongst <hi>all nations.</hi> For this he laboured as in other
places so in Corinth also, both deliuering them the doctrine
which he had receiued, and executing amongest them the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
which their grieuous abuses did deserue.</p>
            <p>20 The seconde thing to be noted in the Disciples is that they
neither purloyned nor chaunged the peoples foode.<note place="margin">They deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the bread which Christ appointed to the people.</note> They recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
bread, and they deliuered bread. But there are deceiptfull
workmen which haue entred by a postern gate into the Church,
which preache and deliuer not what they haue receiued at the
handes of Christ, but what Antichrist hath deliuered them. For
sweete breade they giue soure leauen, for wheat darnell, for whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
meate venimous poyson, for the word of God the doctrines
of man, for truth fables and vaine fancies, for the holie commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
popish priuate blasphemous Masses, for the seruing of God
the worshipping of Images, for fishe and loaues stones and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes.</p>
            <p>21 The next thing to bee noted in the Disciples is that when
the people had eaten sufficiente they gathered vppe the broaken
meate which remained.<note place="margin">They gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that which was left.</note> By which frugalitie of theirs we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
to vse the creatures of God in such sort as they may be
most beneficiall vnto manie, after wee haue taken for our owne
contentment then to reserue for the vse of others, that nothing
be wasted which may profitablie be saued. God loueth a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
but not a wastfull hande. For although it be true which the
Prophet saith that God <hi>hath giuen the earth to the sonnes of men:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be graunted that we may rule ouer the fishe of the sea,
and ouer the foule of heauen, and ouer euerie beast that moueth
vpon the earth, vsing them not onely for our necessitie, but also
for our honest delight and conuenient pleasure: yet we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that this power is rather a stewardship than a Lordship,
ouer the creatures of God in earth. We stand accountable for
them, we may not lauish them out as we list.</p>
            <p>22 That which hitherto we haue obserued in these Disciples
is both allowed of God and written that it might be followed of
vs.<note place="margin">They douted how the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could be fed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they saw not wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall.</note> Another thing there is which we may not let passe although
it be a blemish and a staine in them. For when Christ spake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them of feeding the multitude, one aunswered, two hundred
peniworth of breade is not sufficient for them that euerie man
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:17219:158"/>
may take a morsell. Another said, here is a boy that hath fiue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and two fishes but what are they among so many? The like we
reade of the seruaunt of Elisha in the seconde of Kinges. There
came a man from Baalshalisha which brought the Prophet twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
barely loaues, and certaine corne. The Prophet willed it to
be giuen to the people that they might eate. But his seruaunte
answered,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 4.</note> 
               <hi>how should I set this before a hundred men?</hi> Wel, giue it, saith
the Prophet, that they may eate. For thus saith the Lord, They
shall eate and there shall remaine. Then he set it before them &amp;
they did eate &amp; left ouer. This mistrust of the power and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prouidence of Almightie God is the very roote of all euill. It
cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the rich man spoken of in the Gospell to hoorde vp corne

it caused the Israelites when their citie was besieged to make

            <p>23. But let vs now come from the people and disciples to the
person of Christ himselfe:<note place="margin">Christ dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his office.</note> In whom the first thing which we haue
to obserue is his diligence in his office. He preached in the
cities, in the temple, in the villages, in the ships, on the shoares,
in the wildernes: he neither spared any labour nor omitted any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to doe good.</p>
            <p>24 The next thing is his pitifull affection towardes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vpon whom when he looked his hart was touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion:<note place="margin">Pitifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them which had no Pastour to feede their soules.</note>
First because they were as sheepe without a Pastor. The
high priestes, the learned Scribes, the holie Pharisies were their
appointed Pastors, to gouerne them, to teach them, and to lead
them by example of honest life. Neuerthelesse Christ saith, they
were <hi>sine pastore,</hi> without a sheepehard. The glorious, couetous,
deceiptfull, ceremoniall, and superstitious rable of popish guides
God doth not account amongst the guides of his people, neither
are they to be called Pastours but deuourers of the flock. Pastors
which cannot or will not teach are no pastours. <hi>Because thou hast
refused knowledge,</hi> saith God by his Prophet Ose,<note place="margin">Ose. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I will also refuse
thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me.</hi> Vndoubtedly their heartes are
not touched with any pitie or compassion at all ouer Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17219:159"/>
who for their owne priuate gaine and commoditie thrust such
pastours vpon the Church that when the Church hath them it
may iustly be saide, it hath no pastours. This is the plague, the
poison, the bane of al religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it threatneth ruine to christianity.</p>
            <p>25 The other cause that moued Christ to compassion was,<note place="margin">Towardes them which wanted foode to refreshe their bodies.</note>
that the people which had taried long with him were hungrie &amp;
in the wildernes coulde get no meate. By this we learne of our
maister Christ to beare pytifull heartes towardes our needie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and hungrie breathren.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.</note> For whosoeuer hath this worldes
good, and seeth his brother haue neede, and shutteth vp his
compassion towardes him, how dwelleth the loue of God in such
a man? In former times here hath beene prouision for the poore,
&amp; some as yet remaineth: but it is for the most part much abused.
I shall therefore exhorte you the citizens of London &amp; in Christ
Iesus require it at your handes that such order may be taken that
the poore may bee prouided for and not suffred to crie in your
streetes. If you that be magistrates will take the thing in hande,
you shall finde, I doubt not, a great sorte of liberall heartes and
helping handes hereunto. The suffring of the people to begge
breadeth great inconuenience both in the Church and common
wealth. I do therefore in Christ againe require you to take due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
hereof that this thing may bee reformed. So shall you
well please God, ease and profit your selues, and giue a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to the rest of the realme. God cannot bee vnmindfull of
so good a worke. It wilbe an hundred times requited both in this
life and in the world to come.</p>
            <p>26 The last thing which I purpose to note in the person of our
Sauiour is that he did not onely conceiue an inwarde pitie and
therewith content him selfe:<note place="margin">He gaue thankes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided breade, and it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> but his compassion brake out and
declared it selfe in workes of mercie. He sent them not awaie, as
the maner is, loaden with wordes and emptie of almes; he fed
them largelie, and gaue them till euerie man had enough. But
first he gaue thanks to his heauenly father, leauing vs an example
thankfully to acknowledge that whatsoeuer wee receiue it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from him as from the principall authour, &amp; whatsoeuer we
bestow he is the Lord &amp; owner of it. In deuiding the bread hee
vse the ministerie of his disciples, as the stewardes and disposers
of his riches. Be it therefore corporall or spirituall sustenaunce
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:17219:159"/>
which we receiue; although it bee at the handes of men, yet is
it vnto vs as if Christ him selfe in his owne person did reach out
his hand from heauen to feede vs. They are therefore too nice
which refuse their meate, because they like not the man by whom
it is brought and set before them. They by whose meanes wee are
made partakers of good thinges are vnto vs the Angels of God,
and ought accordinglie to be honoured of what qualitie soeuer
they be in them selues. The foode which they gaue to the people
did miraculouslie growe by diminishing, and by consuming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
So it was with the meale and oyle of that poore widow of
Sarephta.<note place="margin">3. Reg. 17.</note> It was in sight too little to suffice one; in vse it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
more than sufficient for manie. So it is with all the graces &amp;
giftes of God: they grow in the handes of him that spendeth, and
in the cofers of him that saueth they wast. Thus I haue brieflie
gone ouer such thinges as I thought most conuenient for this
time. The Lord blesse the seede of his word sowne amongest vs,
and giue it a plentifull and a large in crease, to his owne glorie and
our comfort, through the merite of Iesus Christ by the gracious
operation of the holie Ghost, to whom &amp;c.</p>

the Lawe, the seruice of God, the promises were impropriated:
of them were the fathers, and of them, as concerning the fleshe,

the Arke, the Temple, and the Oracles, with a promise that
God woulde be their God, and they shoulde be his euen Gods
owne elected and beloued people (if they walked in his wayes,
and wrought his will) for euer. But this vngracious and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
nation was vnworthy of such worthynesse: they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
God with lippes, and not with heart; outwardly in shew,
but not inwardly in harty &amp; sincere truth; according to the letter,
but not according to the spirit, after their own conceipts, but not
agreeablie to his blessed will reuealed in his holie word. Their crie
was still,<note place="margin">Ierem. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lorde,</hi> but through
their prophanation, they made the temple of the Lord, a den of
theeues. They cried Lord Lord, but they did not his wil on whom
they cryed, for sweete grapes, they yelded soure, for hartie and
sincere seruice, hypocriticall and painted shewes of religion:
their glorie was in the externall beautie of their materiall temple:
they wondred at the stones, and goodlie buildinges, at the gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
furniture and precious guiftes, wherewith it was both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and inwardly adorned, and enriched.</p>
            <p>2 Wherupon our Sauiour to take away the cause of this vaine
hope and foolish ioy tooke occasion thus to prophecie of that
glorious temple:<note place="margin">A prophecie concerning the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of their temple, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance therof.</note> 
               <hi>Are these the thinges that you looke vpon? The dayes
will come, wherein there shall not be left a stone vpon a stone, which shall not
be destroyed.</hi> This prophesie was as euidently accomplished as it
was made. For thirtie eight yeares after that they had crucified
Christ, their promised Messias the Lorde of glorie, God raysed
vppe the seruauntes of his wrath Vespasian and Titus Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of Rome, who beseeged conquered and rased their Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
made hauocke of the people as of dogges, murdered ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hundred thousande, man woman and childe of that cursed
nation. Then was fulfilled the crie of those crucifiers, His bloud
be vppon our heades and vppon our children. It hath bene, and
shall be for euer. Yea the violence of the Romaines proceeded
farther and pulled downe the Temple, and layde flat with the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:17219:160"/>
grounde their onely glorie, insomuch that according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
wordes of our Sauiours prophecie they left not one stone
vpon another. The Iewes sundrie times, hauing licence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
attempted to builde it vp againe, but it woulde not be; for
what their hande builded in the day, the hande of the Lord most
miraculouslie hurled downe by night. Most true it is, that Christ
sayth, there is not one worde, that commeth out of Gods mouth,
not one title, or iot written in his word, which shall not in his due
and appointed time be accomplished.</p>
            <p>3 Hence we may take this instruction that God is not deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in outward shewes,<note place="margin">God deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not in the outward beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of any thing.</note> in gorgeous pompes, in beautifull buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges,
in painted sepulchers: It is the inward beautie of the
kinges daughter, and not the outwarde brauery of the harlot of
Babylon, wherewith God is pleased: It is the contrite heart of the
postrate Publican, and not the proude ostentation of the Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
wherein he doth take delight. God aloweth as well of Peter
in his mantell, as of Aaron in his miter. All these external shewes;
are but as the beautie of a paynted wall, not onely not acceptable
but euen lothsome vnto God, when the soule, the minde, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parte is polluted.</p>
            <p>4 The causes,<note place="margin">The cause of their ruine, they knewe not the time of their visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Visitato<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mercie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them not.</note> why this house, this costlie building, and temple
of God, was so miserablie destroyed, Christ himselfe declareth,
saying, <hi>Because thou hast not knowne the time of thy visitation.</hi> There
is a double visitation, the one in mercie, the other in iustice. Our
mercifull God first visited this people in great &amp; often mercy: He
deliuered them out of the handes of Pharao: He gaue them good
guides: He deliuered vnto them his law written in tables of stone:
He caused heauen to giue them bread &amp; the hard rocke to yeelde
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drink:<note place="margin">Luc. 19.</note> He made them triumphe ouer their enimies &amp; possesse
strang cities: He brought them to a land, that flowed with milk &amp;
honie, &amp; caused them to reape that which their fooes had sowne:
He gaue them Priests &amp; Prophets, &amp; builded them both an Arke
by Moses and a temple by the handes of Solomon wherein
he woulde be worshipped. All which notwithstanding this stif-necked
people was obdurate and vnthankefull: no benefittes
coulde euer winne them. They prouoked their gratious Lord
vnto most fierce and most iust wrath. After their deliueraunce
they lusted to returne to the place from whence they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17219:161"/>
they muttered against Moses, and despysed holy Aaron;
They loathed and misliked the verie foode of heauen, euen the
meate of Angels; the written lawe of God, they mightely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed,
his messages they contemned, the Prophetes and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
they derided, euill entreated, murdered, lastly to adde a
crowne to all their former wickednesse, their promised Messias
their king, Christ Iesus the Sonne of the liuing God, they most
spitefully cruelly and villanouslie crucified.</p>
            <p>5 This great vnthankfulnesse of theirs,<note place="margin">Visitation in iustice.</note> did greatly prouoke
the iust Lord to displeasure &amp; as it were enforce him to visit them
in iustice sharpely, and with the rod of more then vsual correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Wherefore he plagued them with mortalitie in the wildernesse,
onely two entred the land of promise of all the number that came
out of Aegypt: he gaue them ouer into the hands of their enimies
and they that hated them were Lordes ouer them, he cast them
into exile and miserable bondage, he burnt vp their holie citie, he
destroied their glorious temple, he left them to be deuoured with
pestilence, with hunger, and with the sworde the accustomed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes
of his wrath. Insomuch that euen to this day the
remnant of that elect and chosen people is scattered farre and
wide, and doth liue in all contempt hatred and slauerie, marked
like Cain to be knowne as a murdering vagabond vpon the earth,
to be a byword, &amp; an example of Gods Iustice to all the worlde,
throughout all succeeding ages.</p>
            <p>6 Now all these thinges came vnto them not onely for their
punishment but also for examples vnto others,<note place="margin">These thinges recorded for our benefit.</note> &amp; were written to
admonish vs, vpon whom the endes of the world are come. They
are patterns for vs to looke vpon, that seeing their sinne and the
punishment thereof we may eschew the one if we desire to escape
the other. And they crie dayly in our eares. Let not your faults
be like their faultes, least your destruction also be like to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
for God is the same, yesterday &amp; to day &amp; for euer, he
hateth sinne no lesse now then before, no lesse in vs, than in them.</p>
            <p>7 He hath visited vs in mercie as he visited them, yea we haue
tasted perhaps more aboundantly of his goodnes than euer they
did.<note place="margin">Our blessings as great as theirs our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse greater.</note> And as the benefittes, we haue receiued, doe at the least
equall theirs, so their vnthankfulnesse is much behinde ours, if it
be rightly and duelie considered. God hauing so straungly, so
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17219:161"/>
farre beyond all hope, so much beside our expectation, and more
besides our desert so many times and so many wayes deliuered vs,
not out of one Aegypt, from vnder one Pharao, through the
middest of one sea, but out of sundrie places, of most grieuous,
irkesome, and tedious captiuitie, from vnder the heauie yooke
of sundrie cruell tyrants, through the middest of sundrie maine
seas of troubles and afflictions: Yet haue we for all this buried the
memorie of our deliuerance in forgetfulnesse, yet doe wee for all
this, sinne dayly and that with greedinesse, yea and spiritually as
farre as in vs lyeth crucifie Christ a freshe, and sheede his most
precious bloud againe. We are wearie of the Gospell, the foode
of life is reiected as a thing vnsauorie, we haue no liking to feede
as the Lordes table, our desire is rather to franke vp our selues
with that which we shoulde abhorre and loath: Euerie house
and corner is full of idolatrie and superstition, of sinne and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
full of murmuring against God, full of grudging and
repyning against the Lords annointed. For of his Prophetes what
shoulde I say? was there euer any time, any age, any nation, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
or kingdome, when and where the Lordes messengers were
worsse entreated, more abused, despysed, and slaundered, than
they are here at home, in the time of the Gospell, in these our
dayes? wee are become in your sight and vsed as if wee were the
refuse and paringes of the worlde. Euerie mouth is spitefully
opened, euerie tooth is sharpened and whetted against vs. Harde
it is to finde one foorth, that will loue and reuerence vs as fathers,
obey vs as gouernours, honour vs as Gods embassadours, learne
of vs as of schoolemaisters, here and follow vs as sheepeheardes,
giue vs worthie wages as workemen that take paines for your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
But our exspectation is not deceiued, Christ our Sauiour
hath told vs long ago that the world should hate vs, &amp; our case is
no worse herein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blessed Apostles was, our reward is great
in heauen. And it were well if this vnkinde affection did reach no
further than vnto vs only. But it spreadeth wider, &amp; regardeth as
little the throne of Dauid, as the chaire of Moses, the sworde as
the booke, the Prince as the Prophet, the ciuill as the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
state. Some desire a chaunge. Others not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it but conspire for it too and contriue treacherie, greedelie
expecting their looked for time, the daie of their felicitie and of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:17219:162"/>
their great ioy. But if God in his wrath graunt such a time, which
for his mercie sake I trust he will neuer do, it wilbe, euen to them,
who now so earnestlie desire it, a day of death and not of life, of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
and not of ioy. What gayned they who desired the
chaunge of Samuell for Saull, of Christ for Barrabas? they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
Gods wrath, their owne confusion, &amp; perpetuall slauerie.
So it fareth with miscontented mindes. Their own desires plague
them.</p>
            <p>8 Thus we cannot but see Gods godnesse,<note place="margin">Therefore without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be lesse then theirs.</note> and our vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
his giftes, and our abusing of them, his patience and
our continuall frowardnesse. Our sinnes are come to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with the Ammorites, iniquitie hath gotten the vpper hand,
and crusheth downe all pietie. Can our God thinke you winke
at so manifest or holde his hande at so grieuous sinne? If he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not the braunches of the true oliue, not his first borne Israell,
not his elect people, but often punished and at length gaue them
quite ouer, for that they neglected his worde, and despysed the
Preachers of it; if he spared not his owne onely citie, not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
temple, wherein he woulde be worshipped, but for that they
were both polluted and prophaned, destroyed both for euer; whar
can wee, which are but as wilde twigges, whose father was an
Ammorite and whose mother an Hittite, who haue not hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to his worde sent from heauen, who haue defiled his sacred
temple, and euen crucified his Christ, looke for any other, but
Gods great plagues, and dreadfull vengeance to be powred vpon
vs to our eternall miserie? doubtlesse we haue deepely prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him vnto anger. The onely way to pacifie and appease his
wrath, to mitigate his indignation, and to remoue his plagues
from vs, which euen now hange ouer vs, is our earnest repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
to turne vnto our God, with our whole harte, that he may turne
to vs;<note place="margin">The disciples question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both the particular destruction of the Iewes and the generall consummatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole worlde.</note> to lament and forsake our wickednesse, to trust in mercie,
and to craue pardon, to promise &amp; performe amendment of this
sinnefull life. Thus we must doe, and that speedelie, or else with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt and without delay we perish.</p>
            <p>9 The threatned destruction of the temple hath occasioned
me thus much to say. Now when Christ had vttered the sentence
of ruine &amp; desolation against that holy place, the Disciples, as
Mathew reporteth,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> cam secretly vnto him, &amp; asked not only of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17219:162"/>
time when the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple should be destroied, but also of the second
comming of Christ and of the end of the worlde. They enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as men desirous to learne that whereof they were ignoraunt.
And they asked of Christ the wisedome of God, the appointed
schoolemaister of whome we should seeke for knowledge. They
asked as I sayde three seuerall thinges, of the destruction of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
of the seconde comming of Christ, of the ende of the
worlde, which two later are indeede but one. To whom Christ
maketh answere, not assigning any certainetie of the times when
these thinges should be accomplished, but shewing signes that
should goe before as well the destruction of Ierusalem, as also
his seconde, comming. It is not for you to knowe the times and
seasons, (sayth he) which the father hath put in his owne power.
No not the sonne of man as man knewe them.</p>
            <p>10 This knowledge is kept from men,<note place="margin">The time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the end of the world shall be is for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses concealed from men to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the signes that go before it are reuealed.</note> for two causes as Saint
Augustine well noteth. The one, least it should hinder and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
vs from perfourming our necessarie duties, least it should
terrifie and amase vs, and make vs carelesse to prouide for our
selues and others. An other reason why the time both of our
owne particular ende, and of the generall consummation of all
thinges is left vncertaine, is that we might at all times make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and prepare for it, seeing it might happen at any time euen at
any instant. Watch and pray, because ye know not what hower.
God hath therefore kept the time it selfe secrete, but hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
certaine tokens, and signes going before it: that when we see
the messengers and forerunners of him, which commeth swyftly
to iudge quicke and dead wee may lift vp our heades, knowing
that our redeemer and redemption is neere at hande. Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheweth
(as I saide) the signes that should happen as well before
the ruine of Ierusalem, as also before his second comming in the
ende of the worlde. The Euangelistes haue mixed and folded
them one within another, so that which do serue for the one, and
which for the other, it cannot precisely be discerned. S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
thinketh, that all the signes, simply and literally vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
haue relation to the destruction of Ierusalem; but mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
or spiritually considered of, they may be applyed to the end
of the worlde. Others whom in this I do rather followe, referre
the former signes, as false prophets, warre, sedition, earthquakes,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17219:163"/>
famine, pestilence, persecution, hatred of the Disciples of Christ,
and beseeging, to the destruction of Ierusalem: And these latter
signes in the sunne, moone, &amp; starres, &amp;c. to the latter comming
of Christ to iudgement.</p>
            <p>11 In this comming of Christ to iudge the quicke and the
dead,<note place="margin">Fiue thinges to be noted in the comming of Christ to iudgement.</note> we may for our better instruction consider these thinges:
First that there shall be a Iudgement, and who shalbe that iudge;
Secondly the time when this iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe; Thirdly the signes
which shall goe before it; Fourthly the manner of it; Lastly how
we ought to be in perpetuall preparation and readines therunto.</p>
            <p>12 <hi>A day the Lorde hath set,</hi>
               <note place="margin">There shall be a iudgement.</note> 
               <hi>in the which he will iudge the worlde in
righteousnesse by that man whom he hath appointed, whereof he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
an assuraunce to all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> 
               <hi>in that he hath raysed him from the deade.</hi>
Heere we see plainely that there is a day appointed for righteous
iudgement of the whole worlde: that there is a man appointed
to giue sentence in that day: that there is an assuraunce alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
giuen to all men of all thinges that are written concerning
both the day the iudgement and the iudge.<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.</note> 
               <hi>With God</hi> (sayeth the
Apostle speaking to the faithfull which suffred tribulation for the
name of Christ) <hi>with God it is a righteous thing to recompence tribulation
to them that trouble you, &amp; to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are troubled rest.</hi> This righteous
thing with God is not perfourmed heere as yet. For this worlde
is as an hel vnto the godly, &amp; an heauen vnto them which despise
righteousnesse. Therfore it cannot be but that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a day heereafter to iudge the worlde with that iustice which
shall giue vnto euerie man according to that he hath done, be it
good or euil, &amp; which shall render vengaunce vnto them that
know not God, but rest vnto such as now are trobled for his sake.
Our Lord knoweth to deliuer the godlie from temptation but to
reserue the vniust vnto the day of iudgement to be tormented.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note>
Wherefore S. Peter threatning false prophetes and lying mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
which bring in sectes of perdition and denie him that
bought them euen the Lord,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> sayeth that <hi>their iudgement long agoe
was not farre off, and their perdition sleepeth not.</hi> The day of their
eternall condemnation is appointed,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> the man that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them is alreadie assigned and well knowne.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> We must all
appeare before the iudgment seate of Christ.<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> The father hath
giuen all iudgement to the sonne. He is constituted iudge of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17219:163"/>
quicke and deade.</p>
            <p>13 This iudge hath three properties.<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of him that shal iudge. His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legde.</note> First he is more priuie
to our thoughtes, wordes and deedes, then we our selues are, he
seeth in darkenesse as well as in light, at midnight as at noone
day; no secrete is hidde from him, neyther can any man conuey
himselfe out of his eyesight. He sawe Adam when he ate of the
fruite which was forbidden him, he looked vpon Cain when he
slewe his onely brother, he behelde Cham when he discouered
his fathers nakednesse, he tooke a viewe of Sara when she laught
behinde the doore, of the sonnes of Iacob when they solde their
brother Ioseph into Egypt. His eye was open vppon Dauids
filthie and bloudie actes, vpon Absolons treason, vpon Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phels
wicked counsell. The oppression of Achab, the crueltie
of Iesabell, the pride of Haman, the couetous heart of Balaam
and of Geze, the pride and hypocrisie of the Pharisee could not
be kept from him. Hee seeth all sleightes in merchaundise, all
shiftes in vsurie, all malitious mindes, all flattering tongues, all
lying lippes. He looketh downe from heauen and beholdeth all
the children of men from the habitation of his dwelling place,<note place="margin">Psal. 33.</note> he
beholdeth all them that dwell on the earth: he fashioneth their
heartes euerie one and vnderstandeth all their workes. Hee
shall be both a iudge,<note place="margin">Epist. Iud.</note> and a witnesse in that day <hi>of all the wicked
deedes which the vngodly haue committed and of all the cruell speakinges
which wicked sinners haue vttered against him and his,</hi> who, as nowe
they cannot auoyde his sight, so neither shall they then be able
any way to escape his hande. O consider this you that forgette
God. He that made the eye shall not he see? Can your deedes
be concealed from him that seeth all the children of men, and can
call them euerie one by his name?</p>
            <p>14 Another propertie of this heauenly iudge is the infinite
greatnesse of his power.<note place="margin">His power.</note> He doth what pleaseth him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> all thinges
are subiect vnto his will, vnto him euerie knee boweth of thinges
in heauen, and thinges in earth, and thinges vnder the earth. He
hath power to saue and to kill, to lift into heauen and to cast into
hell; heauen is his seate, earth is his footestoole. What he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
is as sure as it were alreadie done. We should feare therefore
this mightie iudge who hath such power to doe his will, and who
will doe that only which is iust.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:17219:164"/>
15 For his third propertie is his iustice.<note place="margin">His iustice.</note> Hee taketh no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
his scepter is streight, his iudgement righteous, his eye
simple, he will not be intreated of the wicked, neither shew them
any mercie. In that day, euerie one of them shall receiue iustice
and iust punishment. These are his properties and hee chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them not. He seeth all, he hath all power, hee is a righteous
iudge of all &amp; ouer all for euer. By this which hath beene spoken
we see that we haue to looke for a day wherein the worlde shall be
iudged and we see who it is that in that day shall iudge the world.</p>
            <p>16 Of this the Lorde hath sufficiently assured vs.<note place="margin">The certainty and assurance of these things</note> For when
diuerse thinges are spoken of before they come to passe, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmaunce
of the first is the assurance of the rest. He which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to raise vp Iesus from the dead hath also promised to iudge
quicke and dead by the same Iesus so raised. Sith the one is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed,
how can we stande in doubt of the other? We may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our selues that there is a day of iudgement to come, because
the resurrection of the iudge is alreadie accomplished past and
gone.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> So then euerie one of vs shall giue accounts of himselfe to
God. There is no prince, no potentate, no prophet, no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
no man, no woman, neither rich nor poore, high nor lowe,
that can escape this iudgement. We must aunswere for our facts
euen as euery man hath wrought. We must aunswere for euerie
idle worde, for euerie corrupt and wicked thought. What can
the vncleane fornicator, the couetous vsurer, the mightie oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
the proude contemner, the ambitious climer, the enuious
hypocrite, the bloudie murderer, the false deceauer, the cruell
prince, the vnfeeding pastor, the vniust iudge, the deceitfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt,
what may they aunswere in that day but pleade guiltie;
and what can they looke for but, <hi>Ite maledicti,</hi> Go ye cursed? Once
againe I say, <hi>O consider this ye that forget God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17 But when shall this iudgement be?<note place="margin">The time of iudgement.</note> As this question is
mooued by two sortes of men, so there are in scripture two kinds
of answeres made vnto it. There are mockers which walke after
their owne lustes,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> and these aske, <hi>Where is the promise of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?
Since the fathers died which were ouerwhelmed by the floude of
Noah all thinges continue as they were from their first creation.</hi> To whom
Saint Peter maketh answere, that they erre of set purpose. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they that are so wittie in reasoning against the truth of Gods
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17219:164"/>
promises might knowe this, that the power of the worde which
created the worlde, and kept it till the day appointed for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the wicked by water, doth also nowe keepe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
and the earth in store and reserue them to fire against the
day of iudgement, and of the destruction of vngodly men. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
stopped their mouthes with this aunswere he leaueth them
without any further instruction, because they were but swine and
the doctrine of the iudgement to come is precious. But the
Disciples of Christ with an other minde making this demaunde,
<hi>Tell vs when these thinges shalbe, and what signe of thy comming and of the
ende of the worlde,</hi> are abundantly instructed by their Lorde and
maister which knoweth all thinges, and withholdeth nothing
from his which is any way needefull to be knowne. Touching the
time they are forbidden to enquire about it. For as in the dayes
before the floude, they did eate and drinke, marrie and giue in
marriage and knewe nothing till the floude came and tooke them
all away:<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> so shall also the comming of the sonne of man bee. <hi>In
the howre that ye thinke not will the sonne of man come, in a day and in an
howre which no man knoweth, no not the Angels of heauen, but the father
onely.</hi> It is therefore both vaine and daungerous which some haue
attempted in setting this and that yeere beyond which the world
cannot endure. But such is the crookednes of our nature. In
watching, which is commaunded, howe carelesse are wee? And
howe curious in seeking out the time and season,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> which to do we
are so oft and so expressely forbidden?</p>
            <p>18 Touching the signes and tokens going before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christ to iudgement,<note place="margin">Signes going before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ: to iudgement.</note> they are set downe for our benefit
and instruction: And therefore let vs make some stay in the due
consideration of them. <hi>There shall be,</hi> (sayeth the Euangelist)
<hi>signes in the sunne, and in the moone, and in the starres. &amp;c.</hi> These signes
shall appeare before the comming of Christ, partly that the
worlde may be admonished of the fearefull iudgement that is at
hande, and thereby prouoked to repentance; partly that the
wicked may in this life be punished by the creatures of GOD,
whom they haue abused; partly that it may appeare that the
creatures which haue serued sinnefull man against their will, will
nowe no longer serue the enemies of their creatour; and partly
to declare that the worlde is come to his iust olde age and shall
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17219:165"/>
haue an ende. There shall be signes in the sunne. What signes
these shall be it is elsewhere in the scriptures declared. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
shall shake, the sunne and moone shall be darke, and the
starres shall withdrawe their shining. Againe,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> the sunne shall be
turned into darkenes, and the moone into bloud before the great
and terrible day of the Lord come. The like we reade in the booke
of Reuelation.<note place="margin">Apocal. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I behelde, and loe, the sunne was blacke as sackecloth of
heare, and the moone was like bloud, and the starres of heauen fell vnto the
earth, as a figge tree casteth hir greene figges, when it is shaken of a mightie
winde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> Whereunto the wordes of S. Matthew also do agree, <hi>The
sunne shall be obscured, and the moone shall not yeelde hir light, the stars shall
fall from heauen, and the powers of heauen shall be shaken.</hi> The simple &amp;
literall vnderstanding is that there shalbe wonderfull and terrible
Eclipses in the sunne and in the moone: which things in this last
age, in this last houre of the worlde since the ascension of Christ
haue sundrie times and in most strange sort beene seene. Or else,
euen as when Christ was crucified, the sunne lost his light, and
darkenes for a time was vpon the face of the whole earth: so shall
it be at his seconde comming to iudge the children of darkenesse
with eternal death.<note place="margin">Beda.</note> Others expound it that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ shal come
in his glorie the beames of his brightnesse shall so farre surmount
the shining of the sunne, moone, or starres, that in comparison
thereof they shall seeme darke &amp; giue no light. Of this his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
he gaue a glimse when he was transfigured in the mount Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.
To seeke out many expositions of these woordes, it shall not
neede. This wee may obserue in the writinges of the prophetes
that with them it is vsuall, when they foreshewe great plagues, to
vse these and the like spheeches. So doth Esayas in his prophecie
concerning the plagues of Babylon.<note place="margin">Esay. 13.</note> 
               <hi>The starres of heauen &amp; the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
thereof shall not giue their light, the sunne shalbe darkened in his going
foorth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and the moone shall not cause her light to shine.</hi> Againe, <hi>The earth
is vtterly broken downe, the earth is cleane dissolued, the earth is moued ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
the moone shall be abashed, &amp; the sunne ashamed when the Lorde
of hostes shal raigne in mount Sion.</hi> The like we read in Ezechiel threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
destruction and desolation to Egypt.<note place="margin">Ezech. 32.</note> 
               <hi>I will couer the heauen and
make the starres thereof darke: I will couer the sunne with a cloude and the
moone shall not giue hir light, all the lightes of heauen will I make darke for
thee, and bring darkenes vpon thy lande, sayth the Lorde.</hi> I might alledge
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:17219:165"/>
the like out of Ioel, Ieremie, Amos and Micheas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the matter

wise hearer, which can discerne betweene interpretation of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; application thereof. In the one we giue you the bare sense
of the scripture, in the other we teach you the profitable vse of it.
For the vse of scripture may be very well shewed not only by such
collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as do probably gather or necessarily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude one thing
out of another, but also by those allegoricall comparisons which
shewe how in one thing another is shadowed &amp; a spirituall thing
resembled in a corporall. As for example if heere we refer the sun
to Christ, that sunne of righteousnes; the moone to the Church,
and the starres to the pastors and doctors of the Church.</p>
            <p>20 The sunne in this sence is most euidently in this our age
darkned,<note place="margin">The darkning of the sunne by false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> Christ is obscured, by that great enimie Antichrist the

mediator betwene God and man sauing only Christ Iesus which
is not onely man but also God; To seeke else where remission of

only in this Iesus &amp; in him crucified doth darken &amp; make dimme
both him and his merites. And of this treason the Romish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Church which they terme Catholike is founde guiltie.
For the children of this harlot labour by al meanes to obscure the
sonne of God, to robbe him of the glorie of his desertes in our
saluation. I would neuer haue beleeued that any professing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or hauing had but a glimse of the course of the woorde of
God, could haue beene so grosse in such sort to haue eclipsed the
brightnesse of Christ Iesus by giuing his glorie vnto earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
if of late I had not to my great greefe and their great shame
heard their owne blasphemous con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strumpet hath rubbed hir forehead, hir children are become
altogether shamelesse, whatsoeuer shee determineth they make
it equiualent with the written word of God. There is no absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in poperie (in which there are ful many and full grosse) which
they doe not defende to be right good and Catholike. The Popes
pardons, purgatorie, masses, merites, praiers both for &amp; to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17219:166"/>
pilgrimages, images, reliques, yea holy water and holy bread:
All these they will haue some one way and some another to bee
forcible remedies against sinne and death. This is their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and seruing of God, thus they honour the Lambe that was
slaine for the sinnes of all the worlde. If this doe not derogate
from him and stoppe the brightnesse of his glorie, who is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
once offered propitiation for all our sinnes, by whose bloud we
are only purged, whose death only hath made vs free from death,
if this doe not obscure the glorious beautie of Christ Iesus, if this
doe not deface the woorthinesse of his merites, what doeth? or
what can do? Hath the glorious sonne of God sacrificed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
life for our sakes vpon the crosse, that Thomas of Caunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries
bloud powred out in an earthly quarrell should make pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to heauen for vs? Is there any man in whose heart the light
of the glorie of God hath shined, which seeth not how this fogge
doth darken this blessed sunne?</p>
            <p>21 Againe this sonne is obscured when as we professe that in
our woordes,<note place="margin">The darkning of the sunne by corrupt life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.</note> which in our liues and deedes we doe denie. After
that king Dauid had committed adulterie, Nathan the phophet

               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> When men professe wel &amp; liue ill, their life

Law did not practise it, the Law which they professed heard euill

wicked dayes, these our times are clowdie and full of this darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
our light doth not shine to glorifie God, but our darkenes,
doth abounde to the obscuring of his Christ. The mercilesse rich

For as the moone hath hir light from the sun, so the Church hirs
from Christ. And as the sunne being vnchangeable, is at all times
exceeding bright and glorious; but the moone doth change, and
some times is at the full, sometimes at the wane, hir light to the
eye of the worlde, now encreasing, and nowe diminishing, nowe
filling the whole globe, and now in no part thereof appearing: so
Christ, and his Church. Christs glorie is alwaies great, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
one. His Church vpon earth doth varie; nowe she flowri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,
and nowe is blacke; sometimes shee ouer spreadeth the
face of the whole earth, at other times she is brought to so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
streightes that mortall eye is vnable to espie hir. When
the Church of Christ is persecuted as it was in the dayes of
those cruell Emperours which were of olde, and as it is at this
daie vnder Antichrist and Antichristian Princes, this is as it
were the chaunging and resoluing of the moone into bloude.
Heereby it commeth to passe that shee which looketh as the
morning and is faire like the moone, chaungeth hir outwarde
shape and figure and appeareth in the eyes of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
hir like a garment dyed in bloud. By this wee see what
the spouse of Christ is to looke for in this worlde. Wilt thou
be of the number of them that liue godlie? prepare thy selfe
to suffer. All that will liue godlie in Christ must doe it, it is
their portion. If he were persecuted, why should we be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
if he despised, why wee well reputed of? Let vs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be dismayed though we see the Church of God in heauie
case. Let hir fooes debace and oppresse hir for a while, hir king
shall at length deliuer hir, and crowne hir with eternall glorie.
Shee was neuer I thinke in greater distresse, the enemie neuer

ayde and succour of the Church practise nothing but theft
and robberie. Shee is both wounded by hir aduersaries and
spoyled euen by hir owne children: the one haue made hir
bloudie, and the other beggerly. Howebeit as the Arke of
Noe was tossed vppon the waters, but could not be drowned,
the Lorde susteyning it with his mightie hande: so the Church
in the ende shall haue a glorious triumph ouer all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

            <p>23 It followeth that the starres also shall fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.<note place="margin">The falling of starres from heauen.</note>
Vnto starres wee may verie well compare teachers, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,

               <note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> a candle which doeth both shine and burne. They
which are as starres vnto others heere shall heereafter shine
as the brightnesse of the firmament and as the starres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for euermore. But these daungerous dayes haue made
manie of these starres to fall from the firmament of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
doctrine to the dregges and dreames of mans learning.
And one starre falleth not commonly alone, Lucifer drewe a
traine of others after him. The starre which falleth to the
earth becommeth earthly, looseth the light which it had and
like a brande which is smoothered spendeth and wasteth it

Gods holie spirite and hath tasted of the good woorde of
GOD and of the powers of the worlde to come, if hee fall

For touching our owne countreymen and brethren ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleshe, the greatest withstanders of the trueth
at this day are such as haue beene eyther preachers or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
professors of that which nowe they hate so deadlie, and
by impugning so fiercely persecute. They are fallen from
heauen to earth; Christ they haue forsaken and betaken them
selues to the man of sinne Christes aduersarie; they embrace
darkenesse in steede of light; errour in place of sounde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
damnable heresie for the pure and sauing trueth. Had
it not beene better that these Apostataes had neuer knowen,
this blessed way, than knowing it so traiterouslie and so dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie
to shrinke from it? But to leaue them to their despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
resolution others there are that stande in doctrine but
fall in life and manners whose conuersation is not in heauen,
but altogether vppon the earth, beeing worldly minded, not
like starres of light but like cloudes of darkenesse, teaching
others and not themselues; that say and doe not; They are
wholie bewitcht with loue of this present base worlde; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
they seeke (and would to God they sought themselues
aright:) but they seeke not Christ, without whom themselues
are lost. This is the great scandall of the worlde at this day:
woe vnto them by whom it commeth.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> Well by that which
hitherto hath beene spoken we see how Christ the sonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
the brightnesse of his father is obscured as well by
false doctrine as by wicked conuersation: howe the moone the
Church is made blacke and bloudie by cruell persecution: howe

both by heresie from heauenlie doctrine, and by dissolute

Iudas was carefull by any meanes to gather money, and to

In this daungerous estate wee finde no helpe in our selues. But

where helpe is to be sought in the middest of these manifolde and

also his. Wherefore it behoueth vs to knowe and discerne the

her true ornamentes whereby to be knowne. Therein are layde
vp the treasures of God, most precious iewels. S. Paul telleth vs

So that where nothing is taught but according to the written

the rod and scepter of gouerment is vsed, there is Christ, there
is the Church. And wee may thanke our God for euer that in

For S. Luke sayth <hi>dixit omnibus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> he spake vnto all: and S. Marke
<hi>Et turbae &amp; discipulis dixit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 9.</note> he spake it both to the multitude and to
his disciples.<note place="margin">Mark. 8.</note> No man therefore can looke to come vnto Christ
by any other way. We must beginne with the plaine denying of
our selues, that is to say the forsaking of our impietie and fleshlie
lustes.</p>
            <p>6 To denie impietie is to forsake false doctrine,<note place="margin">Our impietie.</note> false worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God, and whatsoeuer is against the first parte or table of
the law.<note place="margin">Tob. 14.</note> 
               <hi>The house of God,</hi> saith Tobias <hi>shall be built for euer with a
glorious building, as the Prophetes haue spoken of it: And all nations shall
turne and feare the Lord God truely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and shall burie their idols:</hi> that is to
saie, they shall forsake their impietie and so be numbred with the
Saintes of God. When the Ephesians which had vsed curious
Artes were conuerted to the faith of Christ, they brought their
bookes and burned them as many as were worth by estimation
fiftie thowsand peeces of siluer. By the writinges of Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Clemens, Iustine martyr, Arnobius, Minutius, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
and many other of the Auncientes it appeareth that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
first thing which those men of famous memorie did in their
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17219:172"/>
conuersion from Gentilitie to the truth was openly to proclaime
defiance to that impietie wherein they had bene nuzled and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp. Constantine considering with him selfe the liues and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
of former Emperours, and finding that their estate had
bene alwaies worse which had worshipped the gods of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they which gaue greatest credit to Idolatrous spirites of
diuinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were but deluded, that none had fairer promises of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
euentes then they whose endes were most infortunate,
that his father onely amongest the rest putting his trust in the
God which created heauen and earth had by experience all the
time of his life founde him a mightie protectour and a bountifull
rewarder of them that feare him: when it pleased God by this
meane to bring him to a loue and liking of the truth, he began
forthwith to shew great tokens of fauour vnto Christians, to haue
conference with their Bishops and chiefe professours, to restore
them whom crueltie had cast out of their lawfull possessions for
beeleuing in the name of Christ, to erect houses of great charge
for prayer and holie exercises of the Church, to doe whatsoeuer
might any way be deuised not onely for the succour and needeful
reliefe but also for the honour and dignitie of Christians. Nowe
by this that Tobias foresheweth how the Gentiles being conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the truth shall burie their Idols; that S. Luke recordeth
howe the Ephesians burned all their impious bookes; that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in their first conuersion wrote so vehemently against paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme;
that Constantine gaue so many and so great tokens of a
minde detesting all impietie and burning with the loue of Christ
Iesus; by this I say we may perceiue how impossible it is to steale
a true denial of impietie, how impossible for a man which in deede
hath denied it not to shewe his deniall in his deedes.</p>
            <p>7 To denie impietie it is not enough except wee also denie
our fleshlie lustes.<note place="margin">All our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fleshlie desires.</note> If we looke into our euill and corrupt nature
wee shall finde nothing but that which leadeth vs cleane from
Christ, nothing but rebellion against the spirite, distrust in
the prouidence of almightie God, ioy and delight in earthlie
thinges, blindenesse of minde, hardnesse of heart. All this we must
mortifie, this we must shake of, we must quite relinquish our own
wils and submit our selues wholy to the will of God. Shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to do this, when Christ him selfe hath said I seeke not to haue
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:17219:173"/>
               <hi>mine owne will but the will of him that sent me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> And againe, it is <hi>meate</hi>
vnto mee to doe <hi>his will.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> And in his greatest agonie, <hi>Not as I
will O father but as thou wilt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> This is a doctrine harde to practise and
put in vre. It is the fault of our corrupt flesh, we thinke too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of our selues, we are too much wedded to our owne wils, the
blessed Apostle (as we thinke) speaketh like a man besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
when hee saith.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> 
               <hi>If any man seeme to bee wise amongest you in this
worlde let him be made a foole that he may become wise.</hi> This is but the
entrance vnto christianitie: yet how few are there which be come
thus farre? The rich yong man in the Gospell seemed to be verie
forward in the way:<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> but Christ discouereth his affection &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that he had not denied him selfe, and therefore was no fit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
for him. It made him heauie and pensiue to thinke of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so great possessions and of weining his heart so soone from
the worlde. He coulde haue bene contented to denie impietie,
but Christ would haue worldly concupiscence also to be denied.
For the grace of God our Sauiour, sayth the Apostle, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to all men teaching vs that denying <hi>impietie</hi> and <hi>wordly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi>
we liue soberlie and iustly and godly in this present worlde.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>8 This is the way wherein Christ must bee followed by as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
as desire to be shipped with him,<note place="margin">The waie to follow him in the ship is i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.</note> to bee of the number of his
people. This is the doore of entraunce into the Church. When
wee are once entred and receiued into the ship, as wee followed
him thither by beleeuing the Gospell, by denying impietie and
worldlie lustes: so there wee must followe him by walking as wee
haue him for our example,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.</note> purging our selues <hi>euen as he is pure,</hi> &amp;
shewing forth <hi>the vertues of him that hath called vs</hi> out of darknesse

               <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 11.</note> sayth the Lorde.
As according to his similitude and likenesse wee were at the first
created, so now according to the same similitude we must also bee
framed and fashioned anew. Sith we were first light and became
darkenesse afterwarde, and are made now againe of darknes light
in the Lord, it is no reason that wee should any more frame our
selues vnto the lustes of our ignoraunce,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> 
               <hi>but as he which hath called
vs is holie,</hi> so likewise ought we to bee holie in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.

            <p>10 Their estate in the worlde which follow Christ in such wise
as hath bene shewed is here resembled by a ship tossed and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie
shaken with a tempest.<note place="margin">They which are wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their lot whether they be vpon sea or land, to be in perill, to stande
in feare, to haue winde and weather against them. As manie as
follow him must denie them selues, &amp; hauing denied them selues
they must take vp the crosse. The crosse signifieth al afflictions
which may be deuided into two kindes, afflictions of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and afflictions of triall: the former are common vnto all, the later
are proper to the elect of God.</p>
            <p>11 The sinne of Adam brought miserie vnto man,<note place="margin">Afflictions common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men.</note> and a curse
vnto all the creatures of God. Hence it commeth to passe that
with sorrowe and teares wee enter into the worlde, and when wee
are in it we haue a short continuance: yet in that shortnesse good
Lord vnto how mane cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces &amp; cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges are we subiect? In the end
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:17219:174"/>
wee die and who doth knowe what becommeth of vs? our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
keepe vs secret. As the waters passe from the sea, and as
the floude decaieth and drieth vp, so man sleepeth and riseth not,<note place="margin">Iob. 14.</note>
he lieth in the dust and <hi>shall not be raised from his sleepe till the heauen
be no more.</hi> O how bitter is this to such as put their trust in, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
riches? how dreadfull is the remembrance of death vnto the
wicked? But they onely are not subiect vnto death: the sorrowes
of the graue take holde on all in asmuch as all haue sinned. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
in these afflictions which come as punishmentes vnto all
there is a difference. They come not vnto all with like intent of
him that sendeth them: they fall vpon the godly for their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but they bring confusion vnto the wicked.</p>
            <p>12 There are other afflictions proper to beleeuers,<note place="margin">Afflictions peculiar vnto Gods elect.</note> tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
which God doth sende as speciall tokens of fauour to his dearest
Saints, trials which are vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beare them patiently, seales
&amp; assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces that they are counted worthy of the kingdom of God
for which they suffer. For the world which hateth both the truth
and the light cannot but hate all such as loue the truth and as
walke in the light. Out of this fountaine spring all those molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the godly do suffer for righteousnes sake at the hands
of wicked and vngodlie men.<note place="margin">Psal. 35.</note> Dauid saw this when he saide. <hi>Many
are the troubles of the iust.</hi> S. Paul did consider it and therefore said,
<hi>They that will liue godlie in Christ Iesus shall suffer persecution.</hi> Christ did
often put his disciples and scholars in remembraunce of it, <hi>If they
haue persecuted me they will persecute you.</hi> In the worlde wee are sure
to finde heauie intertainement, but this is our comforte: with
whom we suffer, with him we shall raigne; we shall liue with him
in glorie with whom now we are in miserie, if so be we take vp our
crosse and follow him. Patience perfoce is no patience. Not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one which beareth any manner of crosse, but he which taketh
it vp, that is to saie which is willing to beare it he shall receiue an
immortall crowne of glorie. The wilde, restie, and vnbroken
horse if hee kick and fling neuer so much yet is hee forced to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
his rider, but being managed and tamed, he passeth on quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
with his burthen. The wicked mutter, they murmure &amp; blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
when they are once touched: but the seruauntes of God
doe not onely take that patiently which is laide vpon them, but
they reioyce that they are thought worthie to suffer. Be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:17219:174"/>
so much afflicted in body the end of their affliction is alwaies
ioy in the spirit. The wicked kick against the prick, the godly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them selues to the yoke, knowing that they are striken with a
tender hand, that he which humbleth them loueth them &amp; shall
turne all things to their good. Yea they take vp not only their own
crosses but also the griefes &amp; suffrings of others vpon their backs,
they are content to feele the smart euen of other mens stripes, to
put their shoulders vnder the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their brethren, to weepe
for the sorrowes of other men as much as for their owne, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are bound, to be as if they were in chaines with them. These
are the suffringes of the church of Christ, these are the crosses of
his children. As for hereticks they haue no portion in this cuppe.
Though they offer themselues vnto all kindes of torture, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they suffer not for the truth but against the truth, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
looke for that rest which is promised to Gods afflicted when
the Lorde shall shew him selfe from heauen accompanied, with
his mighty angels.<note place="margin">2. Thes. 1.</note> For it is not the crosse but the cause that makes
a martyr. <hi>Blessed are they that suffer for righteousnes sake.</hi> There is no

            <p>13 To these afflictions whereof wee haue hitherto spoken the

                  </gap>
               </note> from the beginning it hath ben
tossed and much troubled. Abel the image of the church was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
murdered by the bloudy hand of his owne brother. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
the father of our faith with his familie a figure of the
church liued as a pilgrime and they as straungers vpon earth. The
Israelites were in Aegypt tyrannized by Pharao, in the wildernes
many wayes chastised of the Lord, afterwardes in continuall stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
war, &amp; battle, before they could be placed in the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:
when they were come thither &amp; had dwelt long there, in the
end their temple was spoiled, their people murdered, their cities
razed, &amp; they led captiues into strange countries. This was the lot
of Gods church, the portion of his elect &amp; chosen people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times. In the last daies Christ himselfe was no sooner in the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17219:175"/>
worlde but he was by &amp; by forced to saue his life by flight. There
was no day no houre that passed ouer him without griefe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
time of his birth to that verie moment wherein he yeelded vp the
ghost. How it fared with his disciples after him, &amp; after them with
the churches which they had planted it may appeare by the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
partly of their acts &amp; partly of those times wherein Nero, Traia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
Domitian, Diocletian &amp; others of the like disposition liued. But
no time so bloudy &amp; cruell, as since that Romaine strumpet hath
vsurped authority ouer Christ &amp; his church. The church coulde
hide it selfe in no corner of any kingdom in the whole worlde but
his tyranny found it out to vexe it to persecute it and to spoile it.
What bloud he hath shed, what murthers he hath committed in
these latter daies, Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, &amp; Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce can suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
record. By this it is euident to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eyes how the church
in the midst of this wicked world is tossed like a ship vpon the sea.</p>
            <p>14 As the whole church of Christ,<note place="margin">Vpon euerie particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> so euery member that true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professeth him, is subiect vnto great tentation. If the ship be in
danger, how can they be without perill that are in it? As soone as
we professe the name of Christ, the Deuill stirreth vp his stormes
&amp; tempests of temptation to make vs deny &amp; forsake our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
wherin his assaults be most fierce, in which respect the blessed
Apostle doth cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firie. So it pleased God to chastise &amp; keepe
vnder euery sonne whom he receiueth. And if we would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affliction then were we bastardes &amp; not children.</p>
            <p>15 If both the whole body &amp; euery member therof be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted
vnto suffring, the chiefest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers must looke to be in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
dangers.<note place="margin">Vpon the principal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers specially.</note> That which Christ told his disciples must be verified
in all their successors, <hi>The world shal hate them.</hi> For why? they which
hate to be reformed cannot brooke to be reproued: And we must
needes rebuke the world of sin. What misery soeuer commeth to
the church the minister is alwaye the first that feeleth the smarte
of it. This we finde to haue bene true in the Prophets, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
&amp; in others, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time haue borne the roomes of
ouerseers in the Church. <hi>Quem prophetarum non persecuti sunt.</hi> sayth
Christ. What Prophet can be named which hath not bene perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?
The time would not suffer me to make but onely a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersall
either of the ancient worthy guides of the church, which
haue ben most cruelly entreated &amp; murthered in former times, or
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:17219:175"/>
of your owne pastors whom our late euill daies haue seene taken
from vs in most cruell sort.</p>
            <p>16 By this it is plaine that the whole church of Christ &amp; euery
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the same is subiect to tribulations afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">The causes from whence such stormes do rise as tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> church.</note> &amp; troubles,
&amp; the chiefest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers most subiect. Let vs now consider how &amp;
why this commeth to passe. The most neere &amp; immediate cause
of their troble which are tossed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sea is the rising of windes
&amp; the raging of the waters. This is manifest vnto sense. They that
go downe to the sea in ships &amp; vse trafficke in great waters do see
that when the stormie winde ariseth &amp; lifteth vp the waues, they
which are in the ship mount vp to heauen &amp; desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the deepe,
so that their soule melteth for trouble: they are tossed to &amp; fro &amp;
stagger like a drunken man, &amp; al their vnderstanding is swallowed
vp. Wherfore the blustring winds &amp; the stormy seas were the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
cause why the ship wherein Christ with his disciples sayled
was sore tossed &amp; greatly dangered. Now if we looke into the sea
of the world we shall finde that all our griefe &amp; vexation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
from those vnquiet motions which are raised by our spirituall and
ghostly enemy who neuer resteth but tumbleth to and fro raising
one tempestuous storme in the necke of an other. What maruell
then if the church be troubled, or rather how can it be otherwise
then troubled &amp; sore assalted seeing Satan hath so many waies to
molest it &amp; vseth as many as he hath? Sometimes he stirreth vp
cruell &amp; bloudy persecution. If that will not serue hee vseth such
windes as are somwhat more calme, but no whit lesse dangerous,
the windes of diuision and contention then which nothing doth
sooner hazard the church of Christ. A kingdom being at vnity in
it selfe, though it be smal, yet may be strong: but diuided &amp; distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s though it be mighty how should it stand? This is
a thing which I wish greatly that we did throughly consider. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
(such is is the mercy of almighty God) our enemies haue
not preuayled against vs although they bee many, and wee but
fewe; they strong, and wee weake. But if a few sillie weake
ones be miserably diuided, what may wee looke for but ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ruine? It is lamentable that the Gospell of peace should
bring forth schisme. This is both slaunderous &amp; vndoubtedly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
to our profession. Vnto them whom Satan hath abused as
his instruments to worke this euill, I may speake in a maner as the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:17219:176"/>
clearke of Ephesus did to the people when they were in an vprore
without cause. There is no idolatry no impiety maintained by the

good to resist sin betimes, least when the conscience is therewith
ouerburdened if the Diuel cast our sin before vs together with the

withstand and resist that which fighteth against the spirit may be
saide to wake as long as it worketh, &amp; to sleepe then when it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

gouernours the magistrate and the minister. It is daungerous if
either of them be not watchfull. When such kings ruled Israell as
liued securely, tooke their case and cared not for the publike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
such as Manasses and Ieroboam, then was there great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
in the Church and common wealth, God was not serued:
idolatrie euerie where was committed. It is a great fault in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and iudges of the earth when their eyes are not open to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the disorderly dealinges of the wicked, nor their eares to
receiue the complaintes of the poore, the fatherlesse, the widow
and them which suffer wrong. There was sometime a Sergeant
that now resteth (I hope in peace) who when a poore man cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his aduise in a matter and offered him no mony, aunswered
<hi>I heare thee but I feele thee not.</hi> This mans heart was awake vnto co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes,
but vnto iudgement and iustice asleepe.</p>
            <p>20 Ministers are termed by a speciall name of <hi>watchmen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">By ministers.</note> to
shewe that they aboue all others shoulde beware of too much
sleepe.<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Sonne of man I haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi>
saith the Lorde to his Prophet. Nowe if the people take a

he seeth the sword come vpon the lande he blow the trumpet and
warne the people, then he that heareth the sounde of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
and wil not be warned if the sword come and take him awaie,
his bloud shalbe vpon his owne heade. For he hearde the sounde
of the trumpet &amp; woulde not be admonished: therefore his bloud
shall be vpon him, as contrariwise he that receiueth warning shal
saue his life. But if the watchman see the sworde come &amp; blowe
not the trumpet and the people be not warned, if the sword come
and take any man from amongest them, he is taken away for his
iniquitie, but his bloud will I require at the watchmans hande.
Wherefore there coulde not a greater plague happen to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

it may be marueiled how that thing which he keepeth can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to so many stormes &amp; tempestes which might be preuented
if hee did not suffer him selfe or vs, or them whom he hath set as

               <hi>The Lorde will keepe thee</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>from

thou see vs cast away and not consider it? Of the like complaints
of the people of God in the middest of their distresses we reade in
sundry places especially of the Psalmes:<note place="margin">Psalm. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Vp why sleepest thou O Lord?</hi>
Awake, be not farre of for euer. Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
and forgettest our miserie and our affliction? Our soule is beaten
downe vnto the dust, our bellie cleaueth vnto the grounde, rise vp
for our succour &amp; redeeme vs for thy mercies sake. These grones
and cries be not powred out in vaine. Christ rebuketh the windes
and seas: his seruauntes haue their wish, their requests are no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
vttered then graunted. If wee as good disciples of these disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
doe in our troubles flie vnto Christ for aide, in his mercie he
shall heare vs, and deliuer vs by the strength of his mighty power.
He cannot suffer vs to be tryed aboue that which wee are able to
beare. Be our sute neuer so desperate he can helpe it. For nothing
is impossible with God. Would you see some fit examples? The
Israelites groned vnto him in Aegypt, he hearde them and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them from the tyrannie of Pharao. The yong men in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
called vpon him &amp; were preserued. The crie of Daniell stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the mouthes of Lions, Paul and Sylas being in bondes praied
and their chaines fell loose from them, the doores opened and
gaue them passage. Although wee bee plunged neuer so low, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the floudes run cleane ouer vs, in so much that wee seeme
to our selues as it were past helpe and recouerie, yet wee are not
past helpe so long as we are not past desire to be holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of our perill can bee no stop to our deliueraunce, because the
power of our deliuerer is infinite. In deed we see that men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
amazed and in a manner bereft of wit and vnderstanding
when they feele them selues daungerouslie tossed to and fro. But
do we not also see that when they cry vnto the Lord in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
hee bringeth them out of distresse, hee turneth the storme to
calme, so that the waues thereof are still? do we not see how they
passe throught tribulations to the kingdom of heauen, &amp; through
stormie tempestes are brought to the hauen where they woulde
be? This the Lord doth that we might confesse his louing kindnes
before him, and his wonderfull workes before the sonnes of men.
To him therefore euen God the father God the sonne, and God
the holie Ghost be all honour and glory for euer and euer, Amen.</p>

Againe there hath beene in a manner a generall falling
from the Catholike faith: as the Apostle long before foretolde
vs: some vnto Mahomet, some vnto Antichrist his brother. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
about one time Mahomet appeared, and the Pope swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from the true faith of Christ, the one renouncing him in

of Christ and denying at all to professe him in woorde. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
keeping his name but robbing him of his office and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him out of his right place; both falling from the faith.

of.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>In the latter times men shall fall from the faith, giuing

<hi>There shall come in the last dayes mockers,</hi>

               <hi>that walke after their owne
lustes and say, where is the promise of his comming?</hi> Thus heretiques
and Atheistes haue fallen from Christ and Christian faith. We
that professe Christ and his Gospell are also charged with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
a schisme and a falling away. But in euerie Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
two thinges must be considered from whom and to whome
this sliding is. We gladly graunt that we are fallen away from
the Bishoppe of Rome, who long agoe fell from Christ, wee
doe vtterly abandon, his vsurped and proude authoritie, we haue
happely forsaken that Synagogue of Satan, that den of theeues,
that polluted Church, that simoniacall temple, and we ioyfully
confesse, that we haue no societie or fellowship with his darknes.

that triple crowned beast, that doublesworded Tyrant,
that theefe and murderer, who hath robbed so many soules of
saluation and sucked so much innocent bloud of Christian mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
that aduersarie vnto Christ, that pretensed vicar, who
hath displaced the person not onely taking vpon him Christes
roome and office, but also boasting himselfe as if he were a God,
&amp; being content of his parasites so to be called. This wicked man
of sinne is at length reuealed by the sincere preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
Daniell in his prophesies, Paule in his Epistles, and Iohn in
his Reuelations haue most liuely described &amp; pointed him foorth
euen as it were with the finger. Yea through his pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his vsurping authoritie and worldly rule, his tyrannie and
persecuting of Christ in his members, hee hath sufficiently
reuealed and detected him selfe, if none had doone it for him.</p>
            <p>6 This wicked man the Lorde shall destroye with the breath
of his mouth and then shall be the ende.<note place="margin">The destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</note> The blast of Gods

a crampe that hee beginneth nowe to halt: his long and farre
reaching arme is marueilously shortned: his cofers are waxen
leaner: his falshoode is espied; many princes refuse to tast any
more of his poysoned cuppe: he is fallen from beeing the head
and come almost to be the taile: he was too cruell and too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to continue. There is no counsell nor power against the
Lorde. And that as all men so especially he hath felt. It is too
hard for him to kicke against the spurre, to fight against the Lord
of hosts. Seeing therfore that this man of sin is not only reuealed
but in a maner ouerthrowne too, doubtles the Lord is comming
and the ende of all thinges draweth neere. <hi>Iniquitie</hi> (sayth our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour)

brought out swarmes of such as loue them selues: but neither
God nor their neighbours. Gods woorde neuer sounded more
shrill, neuer was preached more sincerely than at this day. It is
not bound or shut vp in straightes it hath free and large passage.
Iniquitie thus flowing, charitie thus ebbing, and Gods Gospell
thus sounding throughout the worlde, I may conclude with S.
Peter, <hi>The ende is neere at hande.</hi>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17219:180"/>
first parentes for passing the limites of sobrietie lost the godlie
possession which God had giuen into their handes. Through an
vnsober desire of knowing all thinges they knewe too soone their
owne miserie. This hawtinesse of heart set Absolon so farre
besides himselfe that neyther force of nature, feare of God, nor
shame of men and the worlde, could withholde him from trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
attempting to teare the crowne from his fathers head. It is
strange to see howe Herode was swollen with the arrogant ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
and proude conceite of his owne eloquence. His
strange blasphemous pride had a strange and fearefull punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Nabuchodonozor through his affection being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be the highest amongest men, was made the vilest among
beastes. Those are ougly paternes of monstrous mindes voide
of that sobrietie which was in Paule, who, although God had
exalted him to the thirde heauen and there shewed him more
than a man might conceiue: thought neuerthelesse modestlie
and meekely of himselfe.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> 
               <hi>I am the least of the Apostles not woorthie
to be called an Apostle.</hi> The like affection was in Saint Peter, it
caused him to loath himselfe at the sight of the Maiestie of the
sonne of God:<note place="margin">Luke. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from me</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>I am a sinnefull man.</hi> It
was in that Centurion which thought himselfe vnwoorthie to
open a doore vnto Christ Iesus. It was in the Publican that
durst not cast so much as an eye vp to heauen. Such againe passe
the boundes of this sobrietie as seeke after needelesse thinges
neglecting necessarie. The Philosopher that gazed vppon the
skyes heeding not the pit that was vnder his feete was deserued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laughed to scorne by a girle. We are all tainted with this fault,
whereby it commeth to passe, that we wast (sayeth Seneca) a
great part of our life in dooing nothing, a greater in doing euill
the greatest of all in medling with those thinges which are not
for vs. They that in matters of religion will knowe more than
God hath reuealed, thinke not soberlie, but arrogantly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Woe be to them which are wise in their owne eyes, they
are foolish in the sight of God. The roote of this vice is a false
perswasion which we haue taken that we can stand of our selues.
Wherefore the Apostle putteth vs in minde of our daunger vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

Man alone were a miserable creature, hee could neyther cloath

concerning their children, Esau and Iacob; Sara more than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
in the mother of Ismaell. Naaman followed the counsell
euen of his seruaunts, and it did not repent him so to haue done.</p>
            <p>9 Nowe as this inwarde sobrietie of minde and iudgement is
required:<note place="margin">Outward so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie in diet.</note> so are we exhorted likewise to an outwarde sobrietie,
which consisteth in diet, in apparell, in gesture, and in speech.
Be sober in diet. Nature is contented with a little: but where so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie
wanteth, nothing is ynough. The bodie must haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
least it faint in the middest of necessarie duties: but beware
of gluttonie and drunkennesse. And Christ sayth, take ye heede
ouerloade not your heartes with these burthens of excesse. Be
not drunken with wine. These lessons are fit for Englande where
auncient sobrietie hath giuen place to superfluitie: where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
such rich men are, as fare daintely day by day. God graunt
their ende be not like his, who riotouslie wasting beere the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God wanted afterwarde a droppe of water when hee
would gladly haue had it. Iohn Baptist was content with a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
diet, Christ with verie slender fare. But there are of vs I feare
me, whose God is their bellie, and whose felicitie is meate and
drinke. Our excesse this way is intollerable and abhominable, we
striue to equall almost Vitellius, who had serued vnto him at one
feast 2000. fishes &amp; 7000. birds: and Heliogabalus that monster
of the worlde, who at one supper was serued with 600. ostriches.
There is no birde that flieth, no fish that swimmeth, no beast that
moueth which is not buried in our bellies. This excesse is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
both to wealth &amp; health: it hath cut off much housekeeping
and brought many men to extreme beggerie: and as many great
diseases are cured by abstinence, so fulnesse hath beene the cause
of sundrie, straunge and vnwoonted sicknesses. Aurelian the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:17219:181"/>
did neuer sende for phisitian in time of his sicknesse, but
cured himself only by thin diet. And as immoderate feeding doth
much hurt to the bodie, so it is more noysome to the minde. For
as the grounde if it receiue too much raine is not watered but
drowned and turneth into myre which is neither fit for tillage nor
for yeelding of fruite: so our flesh ouerwatered with wine is not
fit to admit the spirituall plough or to bring foorth the celestiall
fruites of righteousnesse. The herbes that growe about it will be
lothsome and stinking weedes, as brawling, chiding, blasphemie,
slaunder, periurie, hatred, manslaughter and such like bad workes
of drunkennesse and darkenesse. Are not these vnsauourie fruites
ynough to make vs abhor the tree? A drunken bodie is not a man
but a swine, fit for Diuels to enter into. For these sins are against
nature, which being moderately refreshed is satisfied, being stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
is hurt, violated, &amp; deformed: God hath giuen vs his creatures
soberly to vse, and not so shamefully to abuse: we should if we did
well, feede the body to serue &amp; not to rule, to obey &amp; not to leade
the spirite.<note place="margin">1 Cor 9.</note> 
               <hi>I chastise my body,</hi> (sayth S. Paul) <hi>and bring it into seruitude.</hi>
Is it not perillous trow you, to pamper &amp; make strong our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
or haue we a greater or stronger enemie than our rebellious
flesh? Ful bellied drunkards are no better then traytors in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

the rest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were afraide or lay downe to drinke their fill, he sent

to serue God, nor able to fight against the Madianites, Satan, and
sin; Gods and Gods peoples enemies. The Israelites lusted after
quailes but to their owne confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Esau for his belly sake sold his
birth right &amp; inheritance. Beware their examples. Lucullus a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
had a seruant alwaies at his elbow to pul him by the sleeue
at such times as he porred in too fast. But we haue the blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
of Christ the seruaunt of God to put vs in minde of sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in diet. Nor in diet onely, but also in attire.</p>
            <p>10 <hi>A mans apparell,</hi>

this is to be obserued,<note place="margin">Ecclesiast. 19.</note> that auoyding vanitie &amp; pride therein

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:17219:182"/>
holinesse in a Fryers coule than in a sheepheardes cloke. Yet that
is comely in one, which is not seemely in an another. Saint Paule
is verie earnest with women, and requireth them to goe in sober
apparell decking themselues with shamfastnes and modestie, <hi>not
with brodered haire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> or with <hi>golde,</hi> or <hi>pearles,</hi> or <hi>sumptuous attire,</hi> but as
becommeth women that professe the feare of God. And S. Peter
telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that their godlie mother Sara went soberly apparelled.
Sara was a good woman, a rich woman, and a noble woman, such
as followe hir footesteppes neede not be ashamed. Yet doe I
not condemne all other apparell: yea euen such apparell as is
costlie and gorgious may be fit for some states and personages.
I doe not doubt but that Hester and Iudith did weare golde and
were gorgiously decked. But if Paule and Peter did liue in our
dayes, they would not spare the vanitie of our women, much
lesse of our men. The vaine and monstrous apparell of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countries and nations Englande hath scraped together and
in a brauerie put it on, the estimation whereof is this. A light
wauering minde matched with a vaine proude heart, desireth
a light, vaine, strange, proude, and monstrous apparell, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and cladde it withall. But sobrietie is content with that which
is seemely. Be sober in your apparell.</p>
            <p>11 Be yee sober also in your speech and gesture.<note place="margin">Sobrietie in speech and gesture.</note> Be slowe
to speake, and when you speake let your woordes be so seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that they may be wholsome and not offensiue to the hearer.
Let no lewde speech proceede from your mouthes. A mans
speech and gesture will bewray his thoughtes. The talke of a
foole is vnsauourie altogether and his gesture vncomely: but a
wise mans vnderstanding is seene euen in his lookes. A foole
exalteth his voice in laughter: but the man that is soberly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
will scarcely smile to himselfe. He that is guiltlesse hideth
not his face; but the murderers heade is in his bosome. Our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
actions are liuelie tokens of our inwarde disposition from
which they proceede. Wherefore it greatly behooueth al estates
and conditions of men both inwardly in minde, and outwardly in
diet, attire, speech, and gesture to be sober.</p>
            <p>12 With sobrietie S. Peter ioyneth watchfulnesse.<note place="margin">Awaking out of error, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and sinne.</note> 
               <hi>Be sober and
watching.</hi> I will not heere recite vnto you the manifolde kindes of
watching, whereof the Scriptures make mention, but rather note
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:17219:182"/>
a fewe vnto you most necessarie and such as the Apostle chieflie
meaneth. Before we can watch we must be wakened. Wherefore
he sayth,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Awake thou that sleepest and stande vp from the dead and Christ
shall giue thee light.</hi> He speaketh not of naturall sleeping, but of a
sleepe which is in death. He that liueth in pleasures is dead being
aliue, and they that wake vnto sinne, are asleepe vnto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
All such as liue in error and lie in sinne are but dead men in
the sight of God. Aristotle saith, that seuen houres of sleepe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
naturally the bodie. Let it suffice the soules of men to haue
slept in the lappe of Antichrist 700. yeares and to haue beene
rocked so long in the cradell of that deadly errour. It is now high
time to awake and arise from the dreames of poperie for they are
not sickly but deadly. At the length let Christ shine vnto thee: the
light of his Gospell if thou embrace it, will driue away the darke
cloudes of errour and ignoraunce. Awake I say at the sounde of
Gods woord from thy former superstition and at length embrace
the trueth, which will be as a lanterne, nay as a bright shining
starre to guide thee vnto Christ. S. Paul speaketh to the elect of
God, who doubtlesse will at length awake. As for the reprobate
they still shal sleepe on in their errours and sinnes vnto their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death and confusion.<note place="margin">Esay. 60.</note> But <hi>arise Ierusalem and be thou enlightned:</hi>
arise Ierusalem from death to life, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> errour to truth, from darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to light, from Antichrist to Christ, who by his holy spirite
will illuminate thee that thou mayst knowe God the father, and
him whom he hath sent Iesus Christ, and that is the only way to
euerlasting life. Plinie reproouing our drowsinesse, sayeth: that
sleepe doth steale away the halfe of our life. But this sleepe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we speake stealeth away the whole life of the greatest part of
men. Dauid himselfe lay slumbering in the filthy sleepe of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
a whole yeare at the least, and could not awake vntill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
blewe in his eare and stirred him. But Dauids sleepe was
but a nappe in comparison of such as are so hard and fast a sleepe,
that they will neuer stirre, vntill fire out of heauen flee about their
eares to waken them. So were the Sodomites wakened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.
Awake therefore and when ye are wakened then watch.</p>
            <p>13 Watch that ye be not deceiued by false prophetes,<note place="margin">Watching that we our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues be not deceiued by false teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our dutie towards our neighbour consisteth in loue. <hi>He that loueth
another hath fulfilled the lawe.</hi> Iohn the beloued disciple of Christ,
was the preacher of loue, it was euer in his mouth as it is in his
writings: in so much that lying vpon his death bed, his disciples
requesting to haue one lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him before his departure, he was

haue our loue to be earnest &amp; hote. Euery one loueth himself very
vehemently but our loue towards others is very cold &amp; chill. Our
loue for the most part this way is in word &amp; in phraise, but not in
deede &amp; in truth. This world is dubble harted, disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling is made

that salute &amp; say <hi>Aue,</hi> but their next word is <hi>Apprehendite.</hi> If Christ
came nowe, he were like to finde litle faith, but lesse charity: yet
without charity al that we do is vaine: yea it is very sin. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
loue as God hath loued vs, he loued vs not slenderly when he
tooke so bitter a death for vs. A God for his enemies. See therfore
that ye haue vehement, sincere &amp; hearty loue among your selues:

not contenting your selues barely to haue it in shewe vnlesse yee
shewe it by these effectes which Saint Peter in this place setteth
down. Vehement loue heere spoken of is described by these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.
First it couereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude of sins. Secondly it causeth
vs to be giuen to hospitalitie. Thirdly it will not suffer men to hide
those graces which they haue receiued at Gods handes, but is a

theirs. If God loue vs, his mercie is as a cloke that hideth all our

Of such especially it is written and prouided for in the lawe. <hi>The

               <hi>&amp; thou shalt loue
him as thy selfe: for ye were strangers in the lande of Egypt: I am the Lord
your God.</hi> God hath offered vs at this time great occasion, to shew
foorth our charitie: many of Gods good children are straungers
in Englande. Let vs not omit this good occasion to doe good.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17219:184"/>
Abraham and Lot were liberall towardes straungers, and when
they supposed to haue receiued men they receiued Angelles to
their great benefit. But we no doubt in receiuing these strangers
which wander from place to place beeing cast out of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
for confessing and professing Christ, receiue not Angels but
the Lorde of Angelles. <hi>Hee that receiueth you, receiueth me.</hi> In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good to straungers, we doe good also to our selues, for great
shall be the benefit when Christ shall say,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
               <hi>I was a straunger and yee
harboured me.</hi> As great the curse to them to whom it shalbe said,
<hi>I was harbourlesse, and ye did not lodge me.</hi> Saint Peter would haue
vs giuen to hospitalitie without murmuring, and with kindnesse
entertaine straungers. For in shewing of beneuolence there
are three speciall vertues, which if they be wanting, our benefits
loose their grace and goodnesse. The first is willingnesse: <hi>God
doth loue a cheerefull giuer.</hi> The seconde is bountifulnesse: For <hi>he
that soweth sparinglie shall reape sparingly.</hi> The thirde is singlenesse
of heart: for if we giue vainegloriously to be seene of men, wee
loose our rewarde at Gods handes, as by murmuring we deserue
no thankes of men.</p>
            <p>19 There be two graunde enemies of hospitalitie.<note place="margin">Enemies to hospitalitie.</note> The one
is couetousnesse, the other profusenesse. Nigardlinesse would

as much vpon a garment as would almost ransome a king. Some
with building, some with banquetting, some by one meane and
some by an other: whereby it is come to passe that hospitalitie
it selfe is waxen a straunger and needeth harbour: we haue shut
it quite and cleane out of doores.</p>
            <p>20 The last fruite of heartie loue is the good bestowing of our
graces and giftes to the benefit of others.<note place="margin">Charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And these giftes we receiue to bestowe vpon others as good ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
of the Lorde. S. Peter doeth seeme chiefly as it were to
point vnto two sortes of high and principall stewardes, at whose
handes an especiall reckoning of the graces of God will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
the magistrate and the minister. For God leadeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
like sheepe by the hande of Moses and Aaron, whose gifts
are the sworde and the woorde: whereof the one may not be
borne in vaine, but drawne to the punishment of euill doers, and
to the aduauncement of them that doe well, the other is to bee
preached in season and out of season, to the confirmation of the
trueth, the refutation of errour, the exhortation to vertue, the
disswasion from vice, that the man of God may be perfectly ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to euerie good worke. Howbeit as magistrates and ministers
are principally ment in this exhortation, so are all sexes and sorts
of people called vpon. For we shall all giue an account of our ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardship,
we must all make a reckoning of the talentes we haue
receiued, be they fiue two or one. No man is borne nor brought
vp to himselfe, but to the benefit and behoofe of an other: and
as stones in one building, or members in one bodie, so is euerie
man interessed and inuested in the possession ech one of an other,
to the ende no man should seeke his owne thinges, but the things
that make for the profiting of an other. Which one lesson a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
many if once we would heare to learne it, and learne to

by the monstrous &amp; vnnaturall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
which his ambitious sonne Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
raised against him. This forced
him to flie vnto God for aide, and by
earnest prayer to seeke help from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
The summe and substance of the
Psalme consisteth in these pointes. First he crieth vnto God for
deliueraunce from this wicked conspirasie,</hi> Heare me when I call O
God of my righteousnesse, thou hast set me at libertie when I was in distresse,
haue mercie vpon me and hearken vnto my prayer. <hi>Secondly he reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the wicked enterprise of his foes, and therewithall moueth
them to repentance,</hi> O ye sonnes of men howe long will ye turne my glorie
into shame, louing vanitie and seeking lies? For be yee sure that the Lorde
hath chosen to himselfe a godly man, the Lorde will heare when I call vnto
him; tremble and sinne not, examine your owne heart vpon your bed and be
still, offer the sacrifice of righteousnesse and trust in the Lorde. <hi>Thirdlie
as one assured of present helpe, he turneth his talke againe vnto
God, and reioyceth in the sweete and comfortable feeling of his
grace, saying:</hi> Many say who will shewe vs any good? but Lorde lift vp
the light of thy countenaunce vpon vs, thou hast giuen me more ioy of heart
than they haue had when their wheate and their wine did abounde, I will
lay me downe and also sleepe in peace, for thou Lorde only makest me dwell
in safetie.</p>
            <p>2 The prophet in calling vpon the name of God maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his owne innocencie,<note place="margin">The prophet alleageth his innocencie &amp; righteousnes.</note> Heare me when I call O God of <hi>my

saying in an other place, <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
for in thy sight shall no fleshe liuing be iustified.</hi> For one dutie scarce
performed he is able to charge vs with a thousande omitted, nay
we cannot alleage him one for a thousande, why then doth the
prophet speake of innocencie? Why doth he vse this phrase of
speach? <hi>Heare me O God of my righteousnesse?</hi> Surelie he knewe that
God is a mercifull defender of them whome the world doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deseruedlie
hate and persecute. And in respect of his enemies,
for anie cause which they had so to conspire and rebell against
him, he might iustlie and trulie euen in the sight of God protest
him selfe to be innocent. He was a mercifull and a iust prince
neuer offering wrong to anie, his rebellious sonne he had sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
times spared but neuer offended, he neuer greeued his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
counseller Achitophel, neither yeat the raging people which

he alleageth his righteousnesse and innocencie, his hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him selfe milde and mercifull.</p>
            <p>3 The Prophet hauing thus professed his vprightnesse vrgeth
and prouoketh God to take the defence of his cause now as at all
times he had heretofore protected him,<note place="margin">He maketh mention of Gods wonted mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast set me at libertie
when I was in distresse.</hi> Dauid passed through manie trobles, but
God deliuered him out of all. He strenthened him against that
huge and monstrous Philistine farre beyond the reason or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of man. For if ye compare a younling with one of
perfect age, a simple shephard with a souldier exercised in feates
of armes, one of smale stature, with a vast giant, a naked manne
with one most stronglie armed, the combat could not choose
but seeme in all pointes verie vnequall, in so much that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listine
plainlie contemned him. But God fought for him &amp; gaue
him the victorie. Besides this, he deliued him also from the fraud
&amp; trechery of wicked Doeg, from the treason of the men of Caila
and Ziph, which laboured to giue him into his enemies handes.
God deliuered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Achis king of Geth where he was in great
danger. How often &amp; by what miraculous meanes he saued him
out of the hands of Saul y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> histories do manifestly &amp; plainly shew.
Therfore he putteth God in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this his wonted mercy.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:17219:186"/>
God is well pleased when his benefits are well remembred. Vpon
this experience of Gods former mercies he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiueth great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and sure hope, that his protector woulde not leaue him
now in the bryers, that the God of whose mercie hee had so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
tasted, seeing that his cause was iust, woulde not nowe leaue
him as a praie to his enemies, neither suffer them to trample o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him.</p>
            <p>4 Thus wee see that the security of princes doth not rest vpon
their power be they neuer so strongly garded,<note place="margin">He reproueth those which conspired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> but vpon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie;
wee see from whence they ought in their troubles to
looke for succour; we see by what meanes they may assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of helpe from heauen. In the seconde parte of the Psalme
the Prophet reporteth the rebellion of his foes, and withall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them to repentaunce. He reproueth them especially for two
causes: first for that they laboured to displace the prince whom
God had set ouer them, wherein the ignominie which they did
vnto him was not so great as the iniurie which they offred vnto
God.</p>
            <p>5 The contriuers thereof were not men of meene calling but
of high place and great authoritie:<note place="margin">What kinde of men they were which conspired.</note> and therefore they are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> but the sonnes of <hi>man,</hi> filii <hi>viri,</hi> noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages.
Conspiracies are not wont to bee bred in the heades of
the meenest sort: which thing the Prophet noteth in the seconde
Psalme, <hi>The princes</hi> are assembled together in counsell against the
Lorde and against his Christ. Marie the verie sister of Moses a
woman of place and countenaunce deuised a plot to displace hir
brother. Moses spared hir because shee was his sister, but God
plagued hir because shee was a rebell and cast vppon hir a most
foule disease. Core Dathan and Abiram which conspired also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Moses were not the meenest men in their tribe. Ieroboam a
man of great might conspired against Salomon and openly rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against Roboam. The kinges sonne Absolon, the great wise
counseller Achitophel rose vp against their lawfull Soueraigne &amp;
armed the people against him. If I shoulde enter into prophane
histories and receite vnto you the authors and contriuers of ciuel
seditions from time to time, it woulde appeare that they were for
the most part <hi>filij viri.</hi> It is sometime otherwise. For wee reade
that simple men, that men whose names are not spoken of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17219:187"/>
some speciall note of extreeme basenesse, haue notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
stirred vp daungerous tumultes. But such are either set on
by other of greater calling, or else as heedlesse men they soone
vanish and come to nothing. But if potent and mighty persons
attempt the ouerthrow of a state, except they be discouered and
cut of at the first they ouerwhelme all like a maine sea. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commaunded Moses especially to punish the princes of the
people,<note place="margin">Numb. 25.</note> as the chiefe authours of all euill. Take all the <hi>heades</hi>
of the people, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>them</hi> vp before the Lord. It is not safe to thinke
of mercie when the mighty haue determined to cast downe them
whom God hath set vp, to displace whom he hath setled, to bring
into ignominie whom he hath aduanced to the seate of honour.</p>
            <p>6 The continuance of these wicked ones in their traiterous
purpose sheweth both their cankred and incorrigible malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in their wicked purpose.</note> and
also the patience and long suffring of that good king. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saith, O ye sonnes of man, <hi>How long?</hi> Such malice they
conceiued, such desire they had to aduance themselues, so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
they were of gouernment and to beare the whole swinge, that
they ceased not, they gaue not ouer. Men easily staie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from proceeding in good thinges but hardly are drawne
from performing euill. This propertie the Lorde did note in
them which sought to make them selues famous by building a
tower as high as heauen. Behold saith the Lorde, this they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to doe, neither can they nowe bee stopped from whatsoeuer
they haue imagined to bring to passe. But God defeated that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
by deuiding their language. Such as loue to clime aloft, to
build in the skies, to make their dwelling place amongst the stars,
will neuer staie till God cast them downe.</p>
            <p>7 Ye sonnes of man, <hi>How long?</hi> This rebellion rose not vpon a
sodaine rage,<note place="margin">Their cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning practises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lordes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</note> it was with much consultation first contriued, and so
continewed from time to time. After Absolon had imbrued
his handes in bloud, after he had cowardly slaine his brother, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his heart was inured with so great and grieuous sinnes, he staid
at nothing, but went on adding bloud vnto bloud. If moderate se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity
could haue bettered him, he was driuen out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fathers
presence; if vnspeakeable clemencie could haue caused him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
his murder was pardoned he called home &amp; receiued into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
But his ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kred hart could neuer be scoured. It is true which
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:17219:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wise man saith, <hi>There is no trusting of a new reconciled enemy.</hi> Being
now in fauour in the court hee sought all meanes to wreake his
wrath &amp; by conspiracie to compasse the kingdom. First he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to win the fauor of the people, he was gentle &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one, so curteous that he kissed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he lamented that they were
not wel entreated, that their causes were not indifferently heard,
that they were oppressed with grauntes from the king wherein
priuate mens gaine was sought and the common wealth much
hindered, hee wished the publique benefit were better conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of. By these meanes he stole awaie the hartes of the people,
he became popular &amp; was thought a great good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealthes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
if anie thing fel out wel he was reputed the onlie author &amp;
occasioner of it. Touching religion because it was generally wel
liked, therefore hee neglected no occasion wherin he might make
any plausible shewe of a minde most religeouslie enclined. He
asked leaue of his father to goe to Hebron there to paie his
vow and to sacrifice vnto God. This holie hipocrite would
hide his treason vnder the cloake of religion. While he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the seruing of God according to the law, he minded a lawlesse
rebellion against God and his anointed, most vnnaturallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
against his deare father. Manie of the nobles suspecting
no treason liked well of him, honoured him as chiefe next to
kinge Dauid and accompanied him to Hebron the chiefe citie.
In the meane while hee sent closely abroade his secret messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
his sworne men whom hee trusted best, in euerie coast at
one certaine daie and houre to proclaime him king: and the

if you cut of one moe will start vp vnlesse the neck be seared. The
Pharises and Scribes with the Herodians neuer ceased till they
brought our Sauiour vnto his crosse. The Pope with that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
generation wil neuer be pacified, but still practise against
the Lord and against his annointed. The froward rebellious Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
coulde not rest till Samuell was taken from them. It is the
nature of the wicked the longer they continew in sinne the lesse
to be werie of it, they haue no soner brought one thing to passe

            <p>8 The wonderfull patience of the good king in bearing with

be tamed, it is almost impossible that one which hath drunke of

            <p>9 But the Prophet goeth on condemning their madnesse, for
as much as the thing which they deuised was but <hi>vanitie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">All their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises were but vanity.</note> They
might sooth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in their purpose for a time: but he sheweth

in their subtile inuentions deuises and counsels, not considering
that there is no deuise no counsell that can preuaile against the

did laugh and had them in derision, that he woulde make Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophell
to snare him selfe in his owne deuises; that he would take
them in the pit which they had digged for others. This he knewe,
and this he willeth them also to know, that whom the Lord hath
set vp he will maintaine and defende. <hi>Be ye sure that the Lord hath
chosen to him selfe a godlie man, the Lorde will heare when I call vnto him.</hi>
The consideration hereof (if we way it as we should) may giue vs
courage and strength against that man of bloud which at this day
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:17219:188"/>
doth so cruelly persecute the professours of the Gospell, and so

wont to offer sacrifice to pacifie God as appeareth in the law. But
for the most part this was done without feeling of their sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
true repentance, formallie and for fashion sake onely. But
outward seruice without inwarde remorse and repentaunce for
sinne God doth abhorre. The rebell Absolon offered sacrifice
in Hebron; but in vaine, because his heart was full of treason. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist

vttereth these wordes which I haue chosen to speake of at this
time.</p>
            <p>11 To offer vp sacrifices it hath hen vsual in all ages,<note place="margin">Sacrificing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> amongst
all people kinreds and nations of the earth. But I will onelie
speake of such as the people of God haue offered vp. Before the
law Abell, Abraham, Iacob, Iob, and othets: in the time of the
law Aaron with the Leuites presented offerings before the Lord.
In the time of the Gospell the Apostles had and at this daie also
Christians haue their sacrifices which being faithfully offered are
graciouslie accepted in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>12 Sacrificing is a voluntarie action whereby wee worshippe
God offring him somewhat,<note place="margin">Sacrifice God requireth.</note> in token that we acknowledge him
to be the Lorde and our selues his seruauntes.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Ye are made,</hi> saith
S. Peter, <hi>an holie priesthood to offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to
God by Iesus Christ.</hi> God therefore doth require this dutie at our
handes. It was commaunded in the law, the Prophet Dauid cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
for it, and S. Peter teacheth that euen now it is also due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God from men.</p>
            <p>13 Let vs now consider who are priestes to offer vp these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.<note place="margin">The priestes by whom sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is to be offered.</note>
For there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no sacrifice without a priest, as there can
bee no priest where there is no sacrifice. In the scriptures I finde
a threefold priesthood allowed of God: a Leuiticall priesthoode
such as that of Aaron and his sonnes; a royall priesthoode fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
in Melchisedeck and verified in Christ; a spirituall priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
belonging generallie to all christians. The Leuiticall priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
continued vnto Christ then ceased. For being a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the truth which was to come, the truth being come it
coulde no longer continue. Neither is there in the roiall priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
of Melchisedeck anie other that hath succeded but onely
Christ. He is a priest for euer according to the order of Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,
a king &amp; a priest, a God &amp; a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, perfectinnoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vndefiled,
vnspotted, seuered from sinners: yet numbred, punished, plagued
with the wicked; humbled to the depth and exalted farre aboue
the highest heauens; without beginning without ende; without
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:17219:189"/>
father as man, without mother as God. The thirde priesthood is
that which is common to all Christians. For <hi>he hath made vs kings
and priestes vnto God, his father.</hi> Where the popish priesthoode
taketh footing, in what grounde the foundation thereof is
layde I cannot finde in the Scriptures. Antichrist is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of that priesthoode, to him they sacrifice, him they
serue.<note place="margin">The sacrifice which Aaron offred the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, and our sacrifice.</note>
            </p>
            <p>14 What sacrifices Aaron did offer vp and what sacrifice
Christ hath presented to his father we all knowe. It followeth
now to bee considered what kinde of sacrifice we must offer. Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
offered sacrifice which coulde not in it selfe bee accepted of
God, nor take awaie the sinnes of them for whom it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For whether they bee offeringes of thankes giuing, they
were not of that value that God should take delight and pleasure
in them; or sinne offeringes, it is <hi>impossible</hi> that the bloud of bulles
and goates shoulde take awaie sinne, impossible. But the priest
according to the orer of Melchisedeck hath offred the sacrifice of
his owne flesh, acceptable euen for the worthinesse of it, and by
the vertue which is in it forcible and more then sufficient to wash
awaie all sinne.<note place="margin">Esa. 53.</note> This he did willingly,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
               <hi>He made himselfe an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for sinne.</hi> Hee did it perfectly, <hi>without offring hee consecrated
for euer them that are sanctified.</hi> Where full remission of sinne is
there needeth no further sacrifice for sinne: and the holie ghost
beareth vs recorde that wee haue full remission of all our sinnes,
<hi>Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Wee are <hi>healed</hi> with
his stripes: &amp; where there is no sore there needes no salue. Not
that wee haue no sinne, but acknowledging that wee haue it, it
is as if we had it not, because hee is faithful to forgiue it &amp; iust to
cleanse vs from it. The bloud of Iesus clenseth vs <hi>from all sinne:</hi>
The bloude of Iesus <hi>once</hi> shed, the offring of the bodie of Iesus
Christ <hi>once.</hi> So that there remaineth no other sacrific to be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
offered, but the sacrifice <hi>of righteousnesse,</hi> which wee must all
offer.<note place="margin">The sacrifice of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note>
            </p>
            <p>15 At the handes of the minister it is required that hee feed
the flocke committed vnto his charge: this is righteousnesse in
him, it is his sacrifice. God will haue no blinde, no lame, no
vncleane thing to be offered: therfore let as many as offer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of righteousnes take heede to that they doe. The wordes
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17219:190"/>
of the Lorde are <hi>pure</hi> wordes,<note place="margin">Psalm. 12.</note> like siluer tried in a fornace of earth
fined seuen times.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> He therefore that speaketh, let him speake <hi>as</hi>
the wordes of God.</p>
            <p>16 Furthermore as it is reason that they which sacrifice at the
altar shoulde liue of the altar:<note place="margin">The mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the minister to offer sacrifice.</note> euen so it is against all equitie and
right that the labour of preaching the Gospell shoulde rest vpon
any mans backand the maintenance due for the same be withheld
and kept from him. It hath beene tolde you often, and some haue
beene angrie to heare it so often tolde that the ministerie is too
much pinched, the liuing of the Church so fleesed that manie
worthy ministers haue scarce, nay they haue not wherewith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerablie
to sustaine themselues.</p>
            <p>17 To come from the minister to the magistrate,<note place="margin">The sacrifice of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</note> when hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
crimes are detected and brought to light, there is then a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
sacrifice of righteousnesse required at his handes: such a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
as Ioas offered, who following the good aduise of Iehoida
the high priest his faithfull counsellour, put Athalia which had
murthered the kinges children and vsurped the kingdome to the
sworde. The Lorde sometime doth so deale with his people,
that they plainely see his wrath to be kindled and his heauie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
impossible to be appeased til this sacrifice be offred him.
The Israelites were ouerthrowne in battle till Achan was stoned
to death.<note place="margin">Ios. 7.</note> King Dauid founde no rest in his kingdome till Absolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; Adonias had that which their rebellious practises did deserue.
God requireth as well the sacrifice of iustice as of mercie, yea he
sometimes accepteth iustice for a sacrifice and plagueth mercie
as a grieuous sinne. If Dauid had not spared his sonne for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his sonne had not troubled him with rebellion. For rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
he woulde also in fatherly pity and compassion haue spared
him: this God coulde not suffer, but tooke execution of iustice
him selfe, stretched out the arme of an oake, and strangled the
gallant in his owne haire. Saul suffred Agag: but he felt the
wrath of the Lorde for it to the losse of his kingdome. <hi>Quiparcit

               <note place="margin">Chrysost. Rom. 13.</note> hee that spareth a wolfe spilleth the bloude of

to be a reuenger vnto <hi>wrath</hi> vpon him that committeth euil. They
which glorie to haue the sworde rustie in the sheath when they
woulde drawe it out peraduenture shall not so well be able. Let

            <p>18 As this sacrifice belongeth peculiarlie to them,<note place="margin">The sacrifice of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans offring their goodes.</note> so there
are others belonging although to them yet not to them alone
but to all Christians. Wee must all sacrifice vnto the Lorde
with our goodes, with our mindes and with our bodies. For all
these we haue receiued to serue him withall. With our goodes

made a sacrifice; let no vncleane word escape thy tongue, and it
is an offring, let thine hande doe no harme and it is an oblation,
saith S. Chrysostome. To the like effect Origen, when thou sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duest
pride, thou dost affer a calfe; when wrath, a ram, when lust,
a goate; a doue, when a vaine and wandring cogitation. But the
most precious sacrifice of the bodie is when being mortified it
is also offered to the crosse for the testimonie of Iesus Christ, in
whose cause the death of the Saints is deere in the sight of God.
If the Prophetes, the Apostles, the martyrs of all ages haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred

be acounted faithfull as they were, vnlesse wee be willing to doe

most vnlike; for happie were hee that might followe so blessed a
guide though it were with far vnequall paces. The citie is like, the
people are like, my departure from you is like, but the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of my office amongest you, I must confesse, hath ben much
vnlike. And good cause why: for God alike hath not bestowed
his gracious giftes. Yet my conscience beareth me record I haue
endeuored to treade in the same steps. And in doctrine which is
the chiefest point I dare affirme euen the same which the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
doth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> I haue deliuered no other vnto you then that which I
haue receiued of the Lord: yea safely in the sight of the most high
God I may saie with him,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 2.</note> you haue receiued of vs not the word of
men, but as it was in deede the worde of God. In distribution
whereof neither haue I vsed flatterie, as you know; neither colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
couetousnesse, the Lorde will testifie, neither haue I sought
mine owne praise, my heart is witnesse. And this testimonie of
conscience that I haue dealt sincerely in the house of God as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
doctrine hath bene my great reliefe and comfort in all the
stormy troubles which by the mighty assistance of almighty God
I haue waded throwe. Concerning diligence in the execution
of mine office, although I haue had a ready will, yet my weake bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
being not answerable to my desire, as all flesh herein is faultie,
so for my part I must pleade <hi>guiltie.</hi> One debt and duety with S.
Paule I protest I haue truelie paide you, for with a tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I haue loued you. The nurce was neuer more willing to
giue the breast vnto hir childe, then I haue beene that you
shoulde sucke not onely milke but also bloude from mee, if it
might stande you in steede or serue to your safetie. God hee
knoweth, that with this loue I haue loued you. In vsing corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
I haue sought reformation and not reuenge, to punish hath
bene a punishment to my selfe, I neuer did it but with great griefe,
I haue alwaies laboured rather by perswasion to reclaime trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors
then by correction: with which kinde of dealing because
stubborne mindes will not be bowed, my softnesse I graunt hath
rather deserued reproofe then praise. My life and conuersation
amongest you I leaue wholy to your secret iudgementes. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:17219:193"/>
not saie (for who can?) that my heart is cleare. If <hi>in manie
thinges we offende all,</hi> how can any man saie hee is no sinner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
hee saie also that God is a lier? Howbeit this the God of
my righteousnesse knoweth that wittingly and willingly I haue
wronged no man:<note place="margin">Iac. 3.</note> if I haue, <hi>reddam quadruplum</hi> I will render foure
times so much good. If any haue wronged mee, I hartelie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
and will forget it for euer. While I liue I will acknowledge
that I haue receiued more good liking fauour and friendship at
your handes then I coulde either looke for or deserue. God no
doubt hath his people, hee hath many a deere childe in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But nowe that by his prouidence not by my procurement,
I am called from hence to serue elswhere in the church of Christ,
I will with S. Paule take my leaue of you: and that the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
as well because it is Gods good will and appointment, as
also for that I trust the chaunge shall bee good and profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. My hope is that the Lord hath prouided one of choice
to bee placed ouer you: a man to vndertake this great charge
so well inabled for strength, courage, grauitie, wisedome, skill
in gouernement, knowledge as in manie other thinges so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie
in the heauenlie mysteries of God, that I doubt not but
my departure shall turne verie much to your aduauntage: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
whom sith a great parte of my life is nowe spent, and a
fewe euill daies doe remaine otherwhere to bee bestowed, I must
vse the wordes of the blessed Apostle, <hi>For that which remaineth
my brethren fare ye well,</hi> my deere and faithfull flocke farewell, my

I must in bodie goe from you, yet in heart and good will
I shall euer bee with you, you shall euer bee most deere vnto
me, and I shall not cease (God forbid I shoulde) to powre out
my prayers before the almightie in your behalfe, that the greate
sheepeherd of the sheepe of the Lorde Iesus Christ may take
charge of you, and by his holie spirite direct and gouerne you
in all your waies. In like sorte I most hartelie craue at your

I may walke worthely in my calling and fulfill the ministerie
which I haue receiued, that God may open vnto mee the doore
of vtteraunce to speake the misteries of Christ as becommeth
mee to speake, that I maie in faith and boldnesse do his message,

that hee maie deliuer mee from the disobedient, and that
my seruice maie bee accepted of the Saintes, that the worde

the residue of my course in the Gospell of Christ to the glorie of
God and profit of the Church.</p>
            <p>3 And nowe brethren for my last and longe farewell I can
vse no fitter wordes of exhortation then these are,<note place="margin">An exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
               <hi>Bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

thinges there are comprised in these wordes, an exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and a promise. Wee are exhorted to bee perfect, to
bee of good comfort, to liue in vnitie and peace: and wee
are promised that so doing the God of loue and peace shall

            <p>4 Integritie or perfection is of two sortes:<note place="margin">Perfection in God.</note> the one is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,

is not so much as anie shadow of imperfection at all in him.
<hi>Hee is light,</hi>

               <hi>Shall I cause to bring foorth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 66.</note> 
               <hi>and shall I bee barren?</hi> sayth
the Lorde. Hee cannot but be perfect in himselfe, which is
the cause of all perfection in others.</p>
            <p>5 And as he is perfect,<note place="margin">In his worde. Psalm. 119.</note> so all thinges are perfect which are his.
His law is perfect, and maketh them perfect which fulfill it. <hi>O that
my waies were directed according to thy statutes, then should I not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi>
saith the Prophet. His commaundements are <hi>holy &amp; iust
&amp; good. Scimus quia bona est lex,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 7.</note> the goodnes and perfection of it is
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:17219:194"/>
apparant,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> cleare and manifest, <hi>wee knowe the lawe is good.</hi> But S.
Paule seemeth to charge the lawe with imperfection. <hi>The lawe,</hi>
saith hee,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> 
               <hi>brought nothing vnto perfection.</hi> It is true that the lawe
in it selfe is perfect, able to saue and make perfit all such as are
able perfitlie to obserue it. For what saith the lawe? <hi>Do this and
thou shalt liue.</hi> Yet no man liueth by the lawe, why so? Because
the lawe in vnperfit? God forbid. The cause then why being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
it bringeth nothing to perfection is the weakenesse and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our flesh.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Wherefore that which was impossible to the
lawe, in as much as it was weake <hi>because of the fleshe,</hi> God sending
his owne sonne in the similitude of sinfull flesh and for sinne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
sinne in the flesh that the righteousnes of the lawe might
be fulfilled. Although no man therefore be brought to perfection
by the law, yet the law remaineth perfit euen as he is perfit which
gaue the lawe.</p>
            <p>6 Euerie <hi>worke of the mightie God is perfit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In all his workes.</note> When he had made
heauen and earth, sea and lande, fishe, foule, man, beast, and
whatsoeuer is contained within the compasse of the whole world,
hauing finished all he behelde the works of his owne handes, and
saw they were all <hi>exceeding good.</hi> If there bee this perfection in the
workes of God, then whatsoeuer hee doe in heauen or in earth,
seeme it vnto vs neuer so much out of order, yea although it bee
euen against all reason in our eyes, yet must wee alwaies set our
handes vnto this: It is of God, therefore perfit. For <hi>woe bee to
him that saith to his father, what hast thou begotten? or to his mother
what hast thou brought forth?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Shall the claie saie to the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
what makest thou? dust and ashes to the creator of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth, it is not good and perfit which thou doest?</p>
            <p>7 As God is perfit in himselfe,<note place="margin">Perfection in vs by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in his worde, and in all his
workes: so, we are exhorted to fashion our selues according to
that similitude and likenesse which is in him, and to become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
as our father in heauen is perfit. There is a perfection which all
beleeuers haue by imputation, whereof although S. Paule doe
not speake directly in this place, yet because it is the roote of that
perfection whereof he speaketh, it is not besides the purpose for
me to put you in minde of it. Vnto euerie sonne of Adam it may
iustlie be saide,<note place="margin">Ezec. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Thou wast perfit in thy waies from the day that thou wast
created, till iniquitie was founde in thee.</hi> But our sanctification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:17219:194"/>
once defiled and polluted with sinne, he which liketh no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
or vnperfect thing if hee looke vppon vs as wee are in our
selues cannot but loath vs. Wherefore except the perfection of
righteousnes which is in Christ be imputed vnto vs and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as ours, except in him we be made the righteousnes of God,
howe should we euer hope to appeare without spot and wrincle
in the sight of God? He therefore is perfect whose imperfections
Christ with his perfection hath couered. This is a secret which
because the Iewes were not able to comprehende, therefore they
stumbled. Israel sought perfection and found it not. Wherefore?
Because they sought it by the workes of the law and not by faith,
they thought perfection by imputation to be a meere fancie.
Contrariwise the Gentils not following that perfection which is
by the lawe, attained vnto that which is by faith: which S. Paule
did so esteeme that, although he were concerning the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which is in the lawe, vnreproueable, yet he thought all the
labour and trauell lost which hee had spent about attaining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that way, and desired nothing more than to be found not
hauing his owne perfection which was of the law, but that which
is through the faith of Christ.</p>
            <p>8 But the perfection wherof S. Paul heere speaketh is nothing
else but the finishing of that which the grace of Christ hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
begun to worke in our hearts,<note place="margin">Perfection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be sought for by industrie and labour.</note> our growing and increasing
in true godlinesse, our proceeding and going forwarde from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to vertue, from strength to strength, till we come vnto that
whereunto we striue. Brethren (sayeth the Apostle) I count not
my selfe as if I had attained it,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
               <hi>or were alreadie perfect.</hi> But one thing,
I forget that which is behinde and endeuour my selfe vnto that
which is before, and followe harde towardes the marke, for the
price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus. Let vs therefore
as many as <hi>be perfect,</hi> be thus minded: let as many as haue attained
the former perfection striue vnto this which is the latter.</p>
            <p>9 For this cause Apostles,<note place="margin">Inwarde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> Prophetes, Euangelistes, pastors,
and teachers at the first were giuen, vnto this all doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation

growe vp</hi> into him which is the head: in all thinges whether they
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:17219:195"/>
be inwarde vertues or outwarde duties which God requireth at
the handes of men. Touching inwarde vertues, although we
haue knowledge, and be established in the present trueth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our faith bee such that it be knowen and spoken of
through out the worlde; although we abound in godlinesse, in
brotherlie kindenesse, and in all loue: it is neuerthelesse a thing
needefull as long as we are in this tabernacle that we be alwayes
put in minde, stirred vp, and prouoked to endeuour that in these
thinges we may abounde more and more and go forward in them
to perfection.</p>
            <p>10 The worde of truth which is the Gospell,<note place="margin">In knowledge Colloss. 1.</note> was fruitfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Colossians from the very first day that they hearde and
truely knewe the grace of God. Yet S. Paule ceased not still to
pray for them and to desire that they might be fulfilled with the
knowledge of his will in all wisedome &amp; spirituall vnderstanding,
that they might encrease in the knowledge of God, and so be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The Hebrues no dout were not vtterly ignorant in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mysteries of their saluation: yet are they sharply reproued for
their rawnesse, and exhorted to proceede from the doctrine of
the beginning of Christ, and from the first principles of the word
of God, that at the length they might come to some <hi>perfection.</hi>
We must all confesse euen the best learned amongst vs all that as
yet we are but beginning to learne, we knowe but little, our skill
is of small and tender growth. It behooueth vs therefore to pray
continually with the prophet, <hi>Lord teach vs thy statutes,</hi> make vs to
vnderstande the way of thy preceptes, that we may profit in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
of thy lawe, leade vs on in our way by the gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of thy holy spirite, so direct our course that we may run
out the race into which we are entred, not ceasing till thou hast
brought vs into all truth, fully instructed vs in thy righteousnesse,
made vs absolute and perfect vnto all good workes.</p>
            <p>11 Where there is backwardnesse in knowledge,<note place="margin">In faith.</note> there must
needes be also weakenes of faith: if we growe in the one, we are
the nearer to perfection in the other. Howe great care the blessed
Apostle had that the faith of as many as did beleeue through
his preaching might be perfited, let that one speach of his to
them of Thessalonica serue to shewe in steede of manie.<note place="margin">1. Thess. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bretheren
wee had consolation in you in all our affliction and necessitie through your
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17219:195"/>
faith. For nowe are we aliue if we stande stedfast in the Lorde.</hi> What
thankes can we recompence to God againe for you for all the
ioy for which we reioyce for your sakes before God, night and
day, praying exceedinglie that we might see your face, and might
accomplish <hi>that which is lacking in your faith?</hi> If he were thus
carefull for the faith of others, shall we neglect to make perfect
our owne?<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.</note> When we heare that this is the victorie which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
the world euen our faith; that by faith all the firie dartes
of Satan are expelled and driuen back;<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> that vnto beleeuers all
thinges are possible; that he which beleeueth commeth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
iudgment but hath passed from death to life: are we not glad
to say in our hartes Lord we beleeue? If we be, then conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that by how much our faith is more stedfast by so much we
are the more certainlie assured of all these thinges, let vs ioyne

are so emptie and void of godlinesse? The complaint of the
Prophet might neuer be more trulie and generallie applied:
there is no feare of God. Zeale is euen quenched, religion
almost dead, true deuotion abolished from the heartes of
men: There is not a godlie man left vpon earth; or if there
be, if God haue reserued to himselfe at this present manie
thousandes (as I doubt not but hee hath) of godlie men, yet
howe harde is it to finde one amongest those many thousandes
which daylie goeth forwarde profiting and perfiting himselfe in
Godlinesse?</p>
            <p>13 Whereat we can not greatlie merueile.<note place="margin">In brothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

growe so colde as wee daylie see they doe in charitie, loue,
and brotherlie kindenesse towardes men whom they see, they
must needes be colder in loue towardes God, whom no man
euer sawe. Thus because our profiting in all these partes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

needefull to put you in minde of this present exhortation, <hi>Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

of men in knowledge, we may not shewe the fondnesse of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in behauiour. To say we haue faith, what auaileth it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we haue workes also? See we not that the faith of Abraham
was effectuall and wrought with his workes, and that through
his works his faith was made perfect? Are we sincerely religious
towardes God? Pure religion and vndefiled before God euen the
father is this, to visite the fatherlesse and widowes in their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
and to keepe our selues vnspotted of the worlde. Doe wee
professe loue and charitie towardes our brethren? Let the whole
course and practise of our life, as neare as possiblie we can be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,

all thinges ye may be made rich in Christ, in all vertue, and in
all speech.</p>
            <p>15 <hi>The mouth of the foole</hi> (sayth Salomon) <hi>is fedde with foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In speaking. Prou. 15. Colloss. 4.</note>
But let your speech, (sayth the Apostle) be <hi>gracious alwayes
and powdered with salt.</hi> Perfection herein ought so much the more
earnestly to be desired, by howe much it is the more hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
in this than in other thinges. As by vsing the bitte in the
mouth of a horse, his whole bodie is turned about; and as by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the rudder a ship is directed whether soeuer it pleaseth the
minde of the gouernour: so he that is perfect to rule the tongue
with skill is able to rule all the bodie with ease.<note place="margin">Iac. 3.</note> 
               <hi>But the tongue is an
vnrulie euill, full of deadly poyson.</hi> Therefore as many as desire to be
perfect must keepe a continuall watch before their lippes, that if
an vnsauourie worde escape them they may lay their handes on
their mouthes betimes, that if they haue spoken vnaduisedlie
once they may answere no more, or if twise yet proceede no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

This vse shall breede such perfection in the end that all our
talke shall be gratious, all out words well seasoned, all our speech
and communication become such as that whereof the wise man
speaketh in the booke of Ecclesiasticus,<note place="margin">Ecclesiast. 27.</note> saying: <hi>The talke of him
that feareth God is all wisedome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16 With these thinges if we ioyne that perfection also which
S. Iames mentioneth,<note place="margin">In suffering. Iac. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Let patience haue her perfect worke,</hi> wee shall
then fully answere our Apostles exhortation, we shall be perfect
and entire lacking nothing. Nowe the God of all grace which
hath called vs vnto his eternall glorie by Christ Iesus make you
perfect, confirme, strengthen and stablish you.</p>
            <p>17 Our Apostle verie fitly hauing exhorted vs to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,<note place="margin">An exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reioyce and be of good comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For as many as seeke to be perfect, shall finde many gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
hinderaunces to staie them in their course: necessarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that in this respect they should be comforted. There is
no one part or degree of perfection wherin the righteous &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do not finde many great occasions offred, quite to discourage
and daunt their hearts. S. Paul was perfect and ripe in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Iesus Christ, and it was obiected against him as a token
of extreme furie,<note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Multae literae te ad insaniam redigunt,</hi> much learning
makes thee mad. Abraham for the great perfection of his faith is
called the father of them that beleeue: but howe sore were those
assaultes that withstoode his hope and assurance in the promise?
The godlines of Iob was so absolute and perfect that God him
selfe doth as it were make a vaunt of him vnto Satan, <hi>Has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thou not
considered my seruant Iob,</hi> howe none is like him in the earth, an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and iust man, one that feareth God &amp; escheweth euill? Yet
howe neere was he brought to the gulfe of destruction both of
bodie and soule? The loue wherewith the holie Apostle embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Church of Corinth was so strong and perfect, that hee
wished euen to be bestowed and spent for their soules:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> but what
a discouragement was this vnto him, that the more he did loue
the lesse he was loued? Touching the prophet Ieremie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we consider his dealinges, his speakinges, or his sufferinges,
we see there was great integritie in all: but his wrestlings and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
with the wicked were so irkesome and tedious vnto him,
that he seemed sometimes more then halfe resolued to giue ouer
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:17219:197"/>
all, as if it were but bootlesse to striue longer. All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
wee are heere exhorted to be of good comfort, for as
much as although our hinderances be great, yet sure we are safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to passe through them, they can not damme vp the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs and the kingdome of heauen. Through this strait way
our brethren haue passed before vs, and wee neede not feare to
followe after. Christ himselfe hath gone before by a farre harder
passage than his meaning is to leade any of vs by. Thinke it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no strange thing for the perfect to suffer, be not discomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or dismayde at it,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> 
               <hi>knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished
in your brethren which are in the worlde.</hi> If we patiently suffer with
him and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall gloriously be crowned with him and them.
It is true that the godlie, the iust and perfect haue fierce aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
mightie enemies, the diuell with his lost and forsaken traine,
the worlde full of baites and allurements vnto euill, the flesh euer
readie and greedie to take them. <hi>But haue confidence</hi> (sayth our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour)
<hi>I haue ouercome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note> Although ye trauaile &amp; be heauie laden for
a while, yet comfort your selues, knowing that your anguishes,
greefes, and molestations shal haue an end, your teares shalbe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
away &amp; dried vp, but the ioy which shalbe giuen you is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
The seede of teares which ye sowe now, is nothing to that
haruest of ioy which hereafter shalbe reaped. Againe whatsoeuer
doth befall vs heere, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not vnto vs by hap or chance, but
all is disposed by the will and prouidence of almightie God; when
we are chastised we are chastised of the Lorde; it is of meere loue
and perfect righteousnesse that we are corrected; it is not for our
harme, but to our good, either for the triall of our faith or for the
reformation of our life. So that the man which feareth God,
which walketh vprightly in his sight hauing the testimonie of a
good conscience cannot want matter of consolation, hee hath
wherfore in the Lord to reioyce alwaies, God hath giuen enough
for his continuall comfort. <hi>For that which resteth</hi> therefore brethren
lift vp your heades and <hi>be comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>18 Finally,<note place="margin">An exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to peace and vnitie.</note> to come to the last branch of this present exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>be of one minde, liue in peace.</hi> These fruites of vnitie &amp; peace are
not gathered but where integritie and comfort haue taken roote.
One te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was builded for the people of God, one lawe written by
the finger of God, that the Church of God might in all things be
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:17219:197"/>
one. The bond of vnitie is veritie, neither can they be truely one,
which are not one in trueth. And therefore although an Angell
should come from heauen with all shew of learning &amp; all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
of vnspotted and vndefiled puritie, teaching thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to that one trueth which you haue receiued, reach him no
hande, salute him not in token of consent: vnitie with him is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
with God. But if all be builded vpon the setled foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods trueth, if all be members of one body, seruauntes to
one maister, souldiers fighting vnder one banner, children of one
and the same father, then is the name of vnity and peace amiable.
Beholde, saieth the prophet, howe good and howe sweete a
thing it is for <hi>brethren</hi> to dwell together in one.<note place="margin">Psalm. 133.</note> It is good like the
dewe which watereth the hilles, sweete like that oyle which was
powred vpon the heade of the High Priest. Oyle is pleasant and
dewe profitable; the one giueth a most fragrant smell, the other
maketh the grounde fruitfull: but the goodnesse and sweetnesse
of vnitie, of peace no tongue is able sufficiently to expresse. If this
oyle and dew of peace vnitie &amp; concord shall be powred, as vpon
Hermon &amp; Aaron, so likewise vpon the tops of our mountaines
vpon the heades of our guides, vpon our magistrates, &amp; vpon our
ministers, and shall thence distill to the lower partes as it were to
the vallies that lie vnder the one and to the skirtes of the others
garmentes, the fruite that shall thereby growe vnto vs and the
pleasure which all beholders shall conceiue of it is vnspeakeable.
Wherefore with Saint Paul,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> I beseech you brethren by the name

               </gap>nd that
there be no dissensions among you, but be ye knit together in one

diligite vos inuicem,</hi> my little children loue one another: So my
deare brethren receiue you also this last lesson at my handes, Be

            <p>19 And then I dare conclude &amp; promise with S. Paul,<note place="margin">The promise made to them which doe as they haue ben hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted.</note> the God

a present helpe in all necessities, a louing father which cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

He will feede you with the food of life, he will augm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and increase your faith, confirme and stablish you in all truth, his
loue to the ende shall continue with you, his peace he will giue
you and leaue among you; hee will stande alwaies at your right
hande, maintaine your lot, leade you through this vale of teares
and conduct you safelie to the lande of promise; he will pull from
your shoulders this miserable coate of your corruption, and cloth
you with the robes of immortalitie, he will change this vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and make it like the glorious bodie of Iesus Christ. All this
that God which can not lie, hath promised, all this that omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
mightie and mercifull God will performe euen to all such
as labour to become perfect, as ioy in the holie ghost, as haue
comfort in Christ, as consent in true religion, and liue in peace
and brotherly concorde. To that God immortall inuisible, and
only wise, be all honour, glorie, and praise, now and euer, Amen.</p>
