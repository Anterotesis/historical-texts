            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Deſign of this plain Diſcourſe, was to
miniſter a word of Counſel (and if the
Lord would bleſs it) of Comfort to you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that awful and afflicting Providence,
that hath of late befallen you, which tho' very ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet is it common to good and bad: And as it was
principally delivered on your account, ſo at your requeſt
I have Tranſcribed the Copy, and put it into your hand
to be diſpoſed of at your pleaſure. The Publiſhing of it
was far from my Thoughts, when I preached it, and
is altogether averſe to my Inclination, tho' to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you (whoſe deſire I could not well with-ſtand) I
gave my ſelf the trouble of writing it over. You have,
my Friends, no cauſe to give too much vent unto your
Sorrow, for upon very good grounds you have reaſon
to hope, that he whom you love, is with Him that loves
him better than you, and is ſafely arriv'd at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Reſt, that you are deſirous at laſt to come unto.
What tho' his Race was ſhort, his Reſt is the longer:
and if he be gone a little before you, you follow after;
and if you are prepared, as I doubt not he was, you
will meet together in an unſpeakable, unconceivable, far
better State and Place, then was to be injoyed, or can,
in this Vail of Tears. He is wholly ſet free from all
thoſe Evils that you are ſtill expoſed unto, and is warm
in that boſom wherein you hope to be lodged for ever.
My love to him (for the Relation I ſtood in) was very
great from his Childhood, for I do not remember that
I did ever ſee any thing in him, but what did deſerve
it: his Nature was very lively, and his Deportment
very obliging, that drew Reſpect unto him from Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as well as Relations, that had knowledge of him.
And ſince his departure out of his Native Country, you
have had ſuch a full Account, from good hands, of his
<pb facs="tcp:45289:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pious and gracious Behaviour, that ſhould command
your ſilence under this ſharp Providence. And, methinks
ſhould not make it difficult for you to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have greater cauſe of mourning, in parting
from ſuch a Child, than of rejoycing that you had ſo
good and hopeful a one, How many, alas! poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
that beget, and bring forth Children for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer;
when you had one for the Saviour, whom he
ſought, and now doth, and will for ever enjoy. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
you not therefore to mourn, as thoſe that have
no hope: That the Lord, who hath done it, would ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
this Stroak, and by the manifeſtations of his love
to your Souls, ſweeten this bitter Cup, and fully ſatisfie
you with his Will, is and ſhall be the Prayer of</p>

               </gap> Affliction, thoſe in Scripture are
frequently called Evil, <hi>Iſa. 45. 7. I create evil.
Amos 3. 6. Is there evil in a city</hi> (i. e.) any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or affliction, <hi>that the Lord hath not done.</hi>
Called Evil, not that there is any Evil, either
Natural or Moral in it; but becauſe it is ſo in
our Senſe and Eſteem, or becauſe the common
effect of the Evil of Sin.</p>
            <p>From theſe Words do ariſe Three Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Life of Man, in this World, is
made up of Good and Evil; not all Good, nor
all Evil: Not all good, leſt we be full, and deny
God, as <hi>Agur</hi> ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9. Not all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
leſt we faint under it, and our Lives be
too bitter: Our Life is as Checquer-work, that
hath white and black Lines; or as the Cloud in
the Wilderneſs, that had a bright ſide, as well as
a dark one. Herein it differs from the future
Life, or Life in the other World, that is either
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45289:4"/>
all Good, and that in the ſuperlative Degree,
without any allay of Evil, as <hi>with the Spirits of
juſt Men made perfect:</hi> Or, all Evil, without
the leaſt mixture of Good; that is, of Comfort
and Refreſhment, <hi>no not ſo much as a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
which is the miſerable caſe of the damned
in Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> That the good and evil Things we
receive, are from the Hand of God, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
or mediately.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Which I ſhall principally inſiſt upon in
the Doctrinal Part, That as we receive Good, ſo
muſt we receive Evil, though from his Hand;
and make uſe of the <hi>Second Doctrine</hi> in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Reaſons why, and the manner how, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
theſe evil things from the Hand of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they come from the ſame Hand that
all our good Things come: This is the force of
the Reaſon given by <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is from the Sovereignty of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.

5. and therefore is beyond our ſearch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 28.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Juſtice, that doth not, nor can do us
any wrong.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His Goodneſs is ſuch, that He will do us
no harm, nor intends it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the Good we receive from Him is more
than we deſerve, for we are not worthy of the
leaſt of his Mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. nay, contrary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45289:5"/>
to our deſerts; for whenever He doth us Good,
or whatſoever Good He beſtows on us, He comes
over the heads of innumerable ſins and offences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Good we receive from Him, if weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Ballance, will out-weigh all the Evils
we receive, had we only a naked Life. This
Truth came out of the Mouth of the Father of
Lies, <hi>That skin for skin, and all that a man hath,
will he give for his life,</hi> Job 2. 4. Importing, that
Life is of ſo great a value, that it will weigh
down all the Good we enjoy, and therefore will
out-weigh all the Evils that we ſuffer. Hence,
<hi>Lam. 3. 39. Wherefore doth a living man complain?</hi>
Have Life, and yet complain: which plainly
ſpeaks, That where there is Life, it is ſo great
a Good, that no troubles ſhould ſo diſtreſs us, as
to procure ſinful Complaints: but there are none
that live, but have ſome other Good with it; if
nothing elſe, yet they have Time, which is a great
Good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever Evil we receive from the Hand
of God, if we are his People, it is becauſe there
is need of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6, 7. The All-Wiſe GOD,
that underſtands our Conditions, ſees that we
have need of ſuch evil Things. It is no pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing with Him to Afflict his People, <hi>Lam.</hi>
3. 33. If a wiſe and faithful Phyſician, that knows
our Diſtemper, ſees that it is needful to breath a
Vein, and take away ſome of our Blood, or finds
it neceſſary to Preſcribe an unpleaſing Potion to
us, we abiding by his Judgment, and relying on
his Fidelity, are willing to receive it; therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſhould receive thoſe evil Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are deſigned for our good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10.
and if we receive them as we ought, they will, no
doubt, produce that effect, <hi>Iſa. 27. 9. Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45289:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
6. To ſuffer, or receive thoſe evil things, doth
become thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
and to be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> indeed, and not in
Name only, <hi>is one that takes Chriſt for his All, and
Reſigns up himſelf, and his All, unto His Diſpoſe;</hi>
with a conſciencious endeavour to be Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Him who hath left us an Example, <hi>How
to bear the evils that we ſuffer,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The manner how we ſhould receive evil things
from the hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. With a holy ſubmiſſion unto his Will and
Providence; it is a Cup put into our hand by a
Merciful and Compaſſionate Father, which, tho'
it hath ſome Gall in it, <hi>as no affliction for the
preſent is joyous,</hi> Heb. 12. yet there is no Poiſon.
<hi>John 18. 11. The Cup which my Father hath given
me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> Chriſt had a bitter Cup
in the Garden, yet if his Father ſaw it not good
it ſhould paſs from Him, He was willing to take
it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26, 39.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Receive evil things from God's hand hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
either to make us humble, or to keep us
humble, to prevent Pride, and hide it from our
eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 16. or to pull down Pride, is one
principal end of God in the evil thing He brings
upon us; as it was to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in all the hardſhips
they met with in their Paſſage through the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> that Land of Pits, Drought, and
the ſhadow of Death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. Pride is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God, that he cannot bear it in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and therefore his Day of Affliction comes
upon them to prevent it, or rebuke for it, as
with <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Hence that Counſel, 1
<hi>Pet. 5. 6. Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand
of God.</hi> He loves to ſee his Children cloathed, or
rather adorned with the Garment of Humility,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45289:6"/>
3. Receive them ſilently, or patiently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
2. Tribulation is ſaid to work Patience, or work
it out, that Patience might be kept in exerciſe;
he that is without it, had need to pack up, and be
gone out of the World, there being ſo much need
of this Grace; Patience is exerciſed either in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
evils, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 12. or in waiting for good
things. Hence the Apoſtle concludes, we have
need of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. as the Husbandman, <hi>Ja.</hi>
5. 7, 8. As we are to do all things without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
at the difficulties, or diſputing the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Command; ſo are we to bear and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all things from the hand of God, without
fretting or diſcontent, but more of this in the
Application.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Receive evil things from God's hand, with
reflection upon our own evils, or the evil of our
ways, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 40. Conſideration of our ways is
neceſſary, when under the Rod, <hi>Hag. 1. 3. 5. Ecl.</hi> 7. 14</p>
            <p n="5">5. Diligently attending, or hearkening to the
Voice of the Rod, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9. that we may know
ſomething of the holy ends of God therein: for,
there is a Reaſon for every Stroak that comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, which we are concerned to inquire into.</p>
            <p n="6">6. With Prayer and Supplication. Times of
Affliction, are proper Seaſons for Prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.
13. This hath been the conſtant courſe of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God under the Rod, and herein they have
often found relief; Pray for Strength to bear it;
Pray for a Bleſſing upon the Rod, that you may
be taught as well as chaſtened, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 12. And
that the Rod may produce the peaceable Fruits of
Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thankfully, with our Holy Man, bleſs God
for your Afflictions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 21. Grace, in a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſe, doth not only bring Quietneſs unto
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45289:6"/>
the Mind in Affliction, but raiſeth up the Heart
to admire at God's condeſcention, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 17,
18. that He will beſtow a Rod upon us: and
thank Him for his Paternal Care of us, and his
gentle and favourable Dealing with us, who
might have Scourged us with Scorpions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Believingly: that according to God's word,
our Afflictions ſhall work for our Good, as they
are deſigned and appointed.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Application,</hi> I ſhall look back to the Second
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>That our Good and Evil Things, in
this Life, come from the hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, our good Things come not to us, by
that which ignorant People commonly call <hi>Luck,</hi>
or <hi>Fortune,</hi> which ought to be cut off from the
Mouths of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> That which they call <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
is the <hi>Providence of God,</hi> without which not
a Penny comes into your Purſes, nor a Cuſtomer
into your Shops.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then our worldly good Things comes not
to us ſimply, by our own diligence, care, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
I ſay not only, or ſimply, but 'tis God
that gives power to get Wealth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 18.
None have reaſon to Sacrifice to their own Net,
or Aſcribe the good Things they have got unto
the labour of their hand: <hi>For Men may,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do, <hi>riſe up early, and ſet up late, and eat the
bread of ſorrow,</hi> Pſal. 127. 2. <hi>and yet add not one
cubit to their ſtature,</hi> Mat. 6 27. 'Tis true, <hi>the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
hand,</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 4. yet not
<hi>without the bleſſing of the Lord,</hi> ver. 22. Theſe make
rich both in Spirituals and Temporals, not the one
without the other; not the diligent hand without
the bleſſing of the Lord, nor will the bleſſing of
the Lord make rich without a diligent hand; for
God is no Patron for Slothfulneſs, in the Affairs
of Soul or Body.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45289:7"/>
3. <hi>Then ſhould we truſt in the Lord, Pſ.</hi> 37. 3. and
rely upon his Care and Providence, touching the
good things of this World, <hi>who will give Grace,
and Glory, and with-hold no good thing from them that
truſt in Him, and walk uprightly before Him,</hi> Pſal. 84.
11. <hi>He that feeds the</hi> Ravens, <hi>will not ſuffer the young</hi>
Cranes <hi>to ſtarve,</hi> as that good Man ſaid on his
Death-bed. <hi>He that cloaths the graſs of the field, will
provide garments to cover the nakedneſs of them that
rely upon Him.</hi> He doth not indeed ingage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them, as He did for the <hi>rich Man, Luk</hi> 16.
But mean Fair may preſerve Life, as well as coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diſhes; and courſe Cloth will keep warm, as
well as fine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If all the good things thou haſt come from
the hand of God, then be thankful to God for all.
Render all back to Him in Praiſes, that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt
from his bountiful Hand; <hi>that as of Him,
and from Him are all things; ſo all may with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
be returned to Him.</hi> Phil. 4. 6.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Uſe and lay out all for Him; the Mercies we
receive ſhould be improved for his Glory: <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we eat, or whether we drink, do all to the glory of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>To honour Him with our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
Prov. 3. 9. <hi>By doing good, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
eſpecially unto God's poor,</hi> Gal. 6. 10. And
for Holy and Pious Uſes, in promoting the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and Intereſt of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Tho' all good things of this Life are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from his Hand, yet let us not be contented to
have our Portion in them, that it may not be
with us, as with the <hi>rich Man, Luk.</hi> 16. who had
all his good things in this Life; the Lord hath
better things than thoſe to give, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84. 11. and
we want them: for as our Bodies need the one,
ſo do our Souls need the other; and he that chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45289:7"/>
ſeeks the beſt, ſhall not want the worſt, ſo far
as God ſees them good for us.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Suppoſe theſe good things are wickedly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
gotten, by lying, ſtealing, defrauding, over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
oppreſſion, and grinding the face of the poor; do ſuch
good things ſo gotten come from the hand of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſ.</hi> It is too evident, that many by ſuch wicked
and ungodly ways do gain theſe things; and that
there are too few that in their Commerce and
Dealings with Men, do with Conſcience obſerve
that excellent Rule given by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12.
<hi>Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do
ye even ſo unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet the things themſelves being good, as
they are good, do proceed from God; but the
unjuſt and unlawful means by which they are
gained, are from the wickedneſs of the heart of
Man, as <hi>Judas</hi> his thirty Pieces.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe things thus gained come from God,
but not in a way of Mercy, but in his Wrath and
Diſpleaſure, <hi>to fatten them againſt the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Lord ſmiteth his hand at their diſhoneſt gain,</hi>
Ezek. 22. 13. Alluding to a Man, when angry,
that ſmiteth his hands at the Party that offends
him, and the Lord will avenge ſuch, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.
6. I have read of a great Lady, that being in a
City that was Beſieged, Contracted with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
to deliver up the City, on condition they
would give her all the Gold, Jewels, and precious
Stones, that were found therein. Agreement was
made, the City delivered up, and the Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
were caſt upon her, and cruſhed her to death.
Thus <hi>Riches</hi> gotten, and not by <hi>right,</hi> will <hi>periſh;</hi> and
<hi>thoſe that ſo get them ſhall die like fools,</hi> Jer. 17. 11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe that by unjuſt and unlawful ways do
gain the good things of this World, together
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45289:8"/>
with them do gain a Curſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 33. So that
thoſe things, tho' in themſelves are Bleſſings, are
accurſed unto them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2. There is a worm
at the root, and a third Heir ſeldom enjoys it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Account at laſt muſt be given of what Men
gain, <hi>and how they uſe it, and in what way they gain it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Does the evil of Affliction and Trouble that
we ſuffer, come from the hand of God, then ought
we to look beyond, and through <hi>Second Cauſes,</hi>
unto the <hi>Providence of God,</hi> that diſpoſeth of us,
and ours: <hi>For trouble ſpringeth not out of the ground;
nor doth affliction ariſe out of the duſt,</hi> Job 5. 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Then under the ſharpeſt and ſevereſt ſtroaks
that fall upon us, we ſhould be ſtill as <hi>David, not to
open our mouths, becauſe God hath done it,</hi> Pſ. 39. 9.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But my affliction is more than ordinary, and
falls out but now and then; this makes it the heavier,
and in this the Lord hath, as it were, pricked me in
the Life-Vein, taking away the deſire of my eye, and
the delight of my heart; had it been in ſome other
way, I hope I could have borne it better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Shall any teach God knowledge?</hi> Job 21.
22. Or ſhall we direct our Soveraign Lord, nay,
our Father, what Rod He ſhall ſcourge us with?
He is at liberty to Correct how He pleaſeth, and
if He taketh away, as none can hinder Him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may we queſtion Him, or ſay, What doeſt
Thou, or why doeſt Thou ſo? <hi>Job</hi> 9. 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thy Child was the delight of thine Heart,
therefore thou wouldeſt have had him been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
with thee; he was alſo God's delight, who
had moſt right to him, therefore he is not, becauſe
the Lord hath taken him to Himſelf: you did
love him, therefore was ſo unwilling to part from
him; but your love had too much Self-love in
it, ſeeing you would have kept him from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45289:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Glory prepared for him: So that
your Child might ſay, <hi>If you lov'd me with a cordial
ſincere love, free from a mixture of ſelf-love, you
would rejoyce, and not over-much afflict your ſelf with
ſorrow, becauſe I am gone to the Father,</hi> Joh. 14. 28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This you ſay is a very heavy burden that the
Lord has laid upon you, but not ſo heavy as your
Sins were, that was laid upon Chriſt, the which He
bore, <hi>Iſa. 53. 6. 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 24. He bore them
on his own Body on the Tree, to bear, or carry
them away from us. <hi>Ferebat &amp; auferebat.</hi> Did
Chriſt ſilently and patiently bear, and bear away
our ſins? Was He as a Lamb before the Shearers,
and this burthen laid upon Him by the Father,
and ſhall not we be ſilent under the burthen of
Affliction that the hand of the Lord lays upon us?</p>
            <p n="4">4. You complain that the Tryal and Affliction
is great, but, alas! it might have been far greater.
He might have been taken from you by the hand
of Juſtice, inflicting death for horrid wickedneſs.
He might have died, and you had no well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hopes of his Eternal Salvation; but he gave
early Proofs of his preparedneſs to meet with the
Enemy though he came ſuddenly upon him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may be he had taken up too much room in
your Heart, and was lodged in the bed which the
Lord had choſen to lye in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore takes him
out of the way, that He might have your Hearts
more fixed upon Him. It was, as I have read, the
Saying of a good Woman, whoſe only Son was
taken away by Water, <hi>That now the Lord had left
her none to love but Himſelf.</hi> Your Son, though not
your only Son, was thus removed from you, that
<hi>your heart might be more at liberty to love the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If the Affliction be great, and the Burthen be
heavy, do the beſt you can to leſſen your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45289:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and make your Burthen lighter, this is done
by a quiet, ſilent ſubmiſſion unto the Will of God,
<hi>in this awful Providence;</hi> whereas impatience, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
under it, will add more weight unto it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Such a carriage and deportment, will beſpeak
our Reverence of God, in reſigning up our choiceſt
<hi>Creature Comforts</hi> to Him patiently: to part with
that which we have no great affection unto, or
kindneſs for, is no proof of our Reverence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
but if our <hi>Iſaac</hi> be called for, and we qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
give him up. <hi>By this we manifeſt our Fear of
God,</hi> Gen. 22. 12. 8. Patience under ſharp Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
gives us poſſeſſions of our Souls, as ſaith
<hi>Luke,</hi> 21. 19. The Mind being Compoſed, will
render us capable of making uſe of thoſe means
whereby we may gain Support and Relief under
it. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>James, 1. 4. Let Patience
have her perfect work, that ye may be intire, and want
nothing that is needful for your ſupport, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Circumſtances.</hi> 9. The exerciſe of Patience
in our Tryals, will bring in Experience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4.
of the Power, Mercy, and Goodneſs of God: then
ſhall we be capable of taking notice of his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dealings with us. Hence that of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto
the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 14. 13. <hi>Stand ſtill,
and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> This included,
<hi>Pſal. 46. 10. Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi> 10. The
Lord takes it well when we are graciouſly ſilent,
not ſullenly ſilent under our troubles, and quarrel
not with his Rod: He glories in his Servant <hi>Job,</hi>
in the face of the Devil, on this account, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3.
11. <hi>By ſuch a carriage in afflictions, we imitate our Lord
Jeſus, who by his patient bearing all that He underwent,
from the hand of God and man, did give us an example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and certainly it becomes a Chriſtian, and is no ſmall part
of his glory to be conformable to his Lord and Maſter</hi>
