            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For when <hi>Cadwalader</hi> King of this land by reason of a great<note place="margin">Cadwala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> famin and Pestilence, was inforced to forsake the same and flée into little Britain (which now is vnder the dicion of the French King) diuers and moste parte of his people fled also, some into Wales and some into Cornwall, wher euer sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they and after them their posteritie haue remained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>

            <p>The Britons in their fung call it by sundry and diuers names.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20299:3"/>I finde it also in an olde written Cronicle that it is named<note place="margin">Exance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre.</note> 
               <hi>Exancestria</hi> or <hi>Exancestre,</hi> which name should séem to be so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, by the Saxons at their abode and béeing in this land, for commonly the names which they gaue to such Townes, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Fortes as they either builded or reedified, did end in <hi>Cestre</hi> as Chestre, as Glocestre, Lecestre, Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chester, winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre, worcestre, Oscestre, Colchestre, Cicestre, Ilcestre, Bicestre and this Cittie of <hi>Exancestre</hi> with others, for <hi>Cair</hi> in British, and <hi>Cestre</hi> ïn Saxony, is in English a Fort, Town or Castle.</p>
            <p>This Cittie is walled round about, and so is thought was from the begininig. It is all togither foure square, but decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth towards a roundnes, and containeth in circuite or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe xvj. hundred whole paces, after fiue foot to the pace, which accounting one thousand paces to a Mile: is a mile and halfe and some what more.</p>
            <p>The scituation of it is very plesaunt and amenous, béeing set vpon a little hil emong many hilles, the Contrie round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout béeing Mountanose and ful of hilles. It is pende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t towards the Sowth and West partes after and in such sort, that be the Stréets neuer so foule or filthy: yet with a shower of rain they are clensed aad made swéet. And albeit commonly hilles are dry: yet nature is so beneficial to this hil that it is ful of springꝭ, and by that menes euery parte of the Cittie is furnished with welles and Tyepittes, the commoditie wherof hath wel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péered in sundry times of necessitie, but especially in the late Commotion whiche was in the yéer of our Lord. 1549. for though then the enemy by spoiling of the Pipes, wherby wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was conuayed to the fountains of the Cittie from certaine Springs distant not a Mile from the same, did abridge them of that water: yet moste comfortably did they inioy the welles and Tyepittes within the walles, whiche abundantly fléeted with waters to the satisfying of all the people therin.</p>
            <p>There are also within this Cittie certain Fountains cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Conduits, vnto which through certain canalis or Pipes of Lead, waters are conueyed from Springs rising out of certain places and féelds without this Cittie, and these waters are of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20299:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moste price, the same by reason of the cariage béeing purified and made lighter then the waters springing within the Cittie, and by that menes more fit for the dressing of meates. Of these Fountains one béeing of great antiquitie, and of later réedifyed, sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in the middle of the Cittie at the méeting of foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Streets therof, and wherof it taketh his name, beeing called the Conduit at <hi>Quarterfoies</hi> or <hi>Carsoxe,</hi> and this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth eche parte of the Cittie a like.</p>
            <p>At the higher parte of this Cittie, is a very olde and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Castle called by the name of <hi>Rugemont,</hi> that is to say the red hil, taking that name of the red Earth whervpon it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The Cite of it is eminent, and aboue bothe the Cittie and countrie adioyning, for they doo all lye as vnder the lee ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of. It hath a goodly prospect towards the Seas, for betwéen that and it is no hil at all, it is strongly diched round about, and was so builded (as is thought) by <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> or rather by the Romains after him, for they had their recourse to it for their defence and refuge many yéeres.</p>
            <p>The same also was sometimes the Palaice of such Kings, as to whome the Kingdome of west Sex or west Saxons was alloted vnto. After that: it was the habitation of the Earles of Cornwall, and last of all to the Dukes of <hi>Exon,</hi> and of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, for to those estates: the signiory of this Cittie did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the same béeing parcel sometimes of the Earledome, but now of the Duchie of Cornewall It. is now in meruelous ruin and decay, not easely by force to be gotten, were it réedified and inuironed.</p>
            <p>At the lower end and parte of this Cittie, without the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: fléeteth a goodly Riuer called in British <hi>Iske.

            <p>The decay therof happened in the yéer of our Lord. 1312.<note place="margin">Courtney</note> by one <hi>Hugh Courtney</hi> the third of that name, and Earle of <hi>Deuon</hi> who béeing offended and incenced against this Cittie, his wrathful humour could not be satisfied vnlesse he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the state of that common welth, and therfore séeing and vnderstanding emong other commodities, the vse of the Hauen to be one of the chéefest: did neuer quiet him self vntil he had destroyed the same. Wherfore in the yéer of our Lord. 1313. béeing the fifth yéer of the reign of King Edward the second, he enterprised his pretenced deuise and mischéef.</p>
            <p>For where as the Lady <hi>Awmerle</hi> Countesse of <hi>Deuon</hi> his Ancestrix, had builded certain Weares vpon the Riuer of <hi>Exe,</hi> th'one within the mannor of <hi>Exminster,</hi> béeing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> west side of the Riuer and th'other within her manor of <hi>Topsham,</hi> bég<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the East side of the Riuer: leuing betwéen the said twoo weres, a certain aparture or open roume of thirtye foot, through which all Botes, Shippes and Uessails without let might haue their vsuall passage and repassage, towards and from this Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

            <p>After him <hi>Edward Courtney</hi> Earle of <hi>Deuon</hi> and Nephew to the said <hi>Hugh</hi> did not onely maintaine and continew the fact of his ancester and grandfather, by dayly repairing and

defending the same: but also woorking an vttter destruction for any passage for Shippes thencefoorth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cittie, vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to buyld certain Milles, did erect and make two other weares, the one Sainct <hi>Iames</hi> ouerthwart the Riuer, and the other at <hi>Lamperford,</hi> by meanes wherof, not onely the Cittie susteined the whole losse of their haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but the whole Contrey adioyning, for which iniuryes vpon complaints made, writs and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions of inquiry were sent out, &amp; the said Earles for the same by verdict and presentment, at seuerall times found guilty, but such was his authoritie and power: that it auailed nothing.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse the said Earle <hi>Hugh</hi> (the water course vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cittie thus destroyed) buylded a place called a Key, for the charge and discharge of all Wares and Merchandise within that port, at a Town of his owne called <hi>Topsham,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Cittie about thrée miles, from whence euer si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence all wares and Merchandises haue béen caryed and reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to and from the Cittie by Horse, Cart or Wain, though to the gain of the Earle and his Tenaunts: yet to the great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hindraunce of this Cittie and Merchaunts therof.

            <p>And albeit the water course thus destroyed, can hardely be restored to his olde pristinate &amp; naturall estate, for that through long continuaunce the olde course cannot be discerned: yet now at length after many attempts and great expences, a water course and passage begun in the yéer. 1564. is recouered, and by sluces, Botes and vessailes of xx. tunnes tight are brought to the Citie, and there discharged at the olde and ancient place cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led the <hi>VVater gate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Within this Cittie were sometime but few parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but when that <hi>Innocencius tertius,</hi> in the yéere of our

And moste certain it is, that in times past they were liuings competent and sufficient to maintain an Incumbent, but that kinde of Religion now auoyded &amp; the Gospel preched: the liuelihods are so small as not sufficient to maintain a poore Clark or Scoller, which is the cause that so many of them doo ly vacant without Incumbents.</p>
            <p>Besides these parish Churches, there was also a Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Churche of Exon.</note> sometime of Monkes of <hi>Saint Benets</hi> order, but sithence a Cathedrall Church béeing very fair and sumptuously buylded, with frée Stones, and the Pillers of grey Marble, standing and<note place="margin">Ethelvvol phus.</note> scituated in the East parte of the Cittie, which as some doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte that <hi>Etheldred</hi> the third Sonne of <hi>Ethelwolphus</hi> should first found and buyld.

            <p>The Bishop is distinct from the Channons, bothe in house and reuenew, his liuelihods béeing no parcel of that which doth appertain to the Church and Channons. It was sometimes of great large reuenewes, but the more parte therof prodigally hath béen exhaunsed by a wastful Bishop.</p>
            <p>The Bishop and Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons haue very fair houses which are situated about the Church and Cemitory, and are inclosed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, by shutting fast of certain gates, wherby they claime them selues to be exempted from the iurisdiction of the Cittie. In the middle therof: is a very fair Conduict or fountain, wher into waters by certain pipes are conueyd from certain places out of the Cittie, and the same from thence conueyed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and some of the Channons houses.</p>
            <p>The Cittie it self is very populus, &amp; was sometimes chéef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited with Clothyers or Clothworkers of brode clothes, seruing much for the Spanish and South Countries, whiche were of such goodnes and substaunce: as that the names of them doo yet continew in these partyes, but now it is chéefly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Merchaunts, Kersey Clothyers &amp; of all sortes of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cers, emong whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Merchants are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chéefest &amp; the welthiest.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:20299:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>The gouernment of this Cittie was sometimes by foure Bayliffes called <hi>Prouostres,</hi> but shortly after the Conquest: there was ordred a Senate of xxxvj, and in these latter dayes of xxiiij<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> persons of the moste sober, graue and wisest Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moners and franchised men of the same, of which number one was and is yéerly chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the chéefest gouernour for the yéer folowing and is called by the name of a Maior.</p>
            <p>This Mayor associated with the foresaid foure Bayliffes, hath the discerning of and in all maner of actions betwixt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and partie, &amp; for which he kéepeth on euery Monday a Court in the <hi>Guilde hall</hi> of the said Cittie, but the Bayliffes hauing the like iurisdiction: doo according to their olde and ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes kéep the like Courts, beeing distinct from the Mayor at all dayes and times when them best liketh, which their Court: is called by the name of the <hi>Prouostres</hi> Court, for <hi>Prouostres</hi> was their first names. Thus the Maior and Bayliffes bothe ioyntly and seuerally haue iurisdiction to discerne in causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen partie and partie, but if the matter doo touch the Prince, the Crown, the common peace, or the state of the Cittie and the common welth of the same: then the same are decided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined either by the Maior and Justices, or by the Mayor and common Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, or by the Maior him self, or by some other Officer or officers according to the nature or qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause or matter.

And this one thing is not so straunge as notable, that euen from the beginning, they haue from time to time béen careful for their common welth, &amp; moste vigilant for the preseruation therof, which as in time of peace they did wel rule &amp; gouerne: so also in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troublesome times and vnquiet estates they haue moste valiantly defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded against the incurtions and assaultes of their enemyes, as by the sundrye Historyes it may appéer.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Aruiragus,</hi> King of this land minding to stay the Realme in his ancient libertyes: denyed to pay to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the tribute which they demaunded, wherfore <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour sent <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Duke of the Romain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye into this Realme, either to recouer the tribute or to subdue the land.

            <p>11 Finally and last of all it was besieged in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the third yéere of<note place="margin">King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard.</note> King <hi>Edvvard</hi> the sixt. <hi>Anno. 1549.</hi> by the Commons of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uon</hi> and <hi>Cornvvall,</hi> who not contenting them selues with the state of Religion then established: clustered them selues in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panyes, appointed to them selues Captaines, and minded by their force to vndoo that which the Prince by Lawe and Act of Parlement had established, wherfore to redéeme all such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of force, welth, and defence, into their owne hands, whiche might in any respect, serue for their ayde and defence: came to this Cittie the second of July. 1549. and encamped them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues about the same in great numbers, during the time of their abode &amp; besieging: great troubles arose, so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etimes assaultꝭ made, sometimes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates fired, so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etimes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles vndermined, some times skirmishes made &amp; some great laromes to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles against scaling, finally nothing was left vndoon, which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes might deuise for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obteining of their purpose. And albeit there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not lusty stomakes of the Citizens to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this outward force, yet in processe of time such scarcitie of Uitualles did encrease, &amp; Bread waxed so scant: that the people began to waxe wery and lothe to abide the extremitie therof, whiche was so extreme, that it was feared either that the people must yéeld to the enemye: or perish with famin. How beit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates (though sory in such destesse) yet hauing a speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of their dutie toward the Prince, and their charge to the common welth, left no meanes vnsought to quiet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and stay them in their deutye and obidience. Wherfore comforting the people with fair promises, and liberall reléeuing their necessities: did in such sort and order handle the matter, that euery body with one assent was resolued in hope of some spéedy releef to abide the end, and in no wise to giue place to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20299:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enemye: but to continue faithful to the Prince, and trusty to their common welth. And yet in the meane while the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours left no deuises and prouisions which might be for the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>léefe and comfort of the poore hungrye bellyes, wherfore the corne and Meale consumed: they caused of course and olde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Bran, bread to be moulded vp in clothes, for otherwise it would not stick togither. Also they caused some excurtions to be made out of the Cittie, for the praying and taking of such Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel as were néer about the walles, which béeing taken: was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed emong the poor. Likewise the Prisoners in captiuitie were contented to be fatisfied with such victualles, as could bée prouided, and albeit mannes nature can scarcely abide to féed vpon the flesh of a Horse: yet these poor men were fed therwith and wel contented.</p>
            <p>The noble King and Councel aduertised of this distresse: did at length after. xxxv. dayes, send the honorable S. <hi>Iohn Russel</hi> Knight, Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> Lord priuy Seale, and afterwards Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> with a company and band of Souldiers, who after sundry conflicts had with the enemyes: came to this Cittie the vj. of <hi>August,</hi> reskewing and deliuering the same from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye, and set them at libertie. For the which as God was moste worthy of all praise and glory: so is the same his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce at this present had in perpetuall memory the vj. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> béeing a holy day in the remembraunce therof.</p>
            <p>Thus this little Cittie which in antiquitie is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to other: hath from time to time felt the smartes and chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of all times, and indured great troubles, daungers, extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perilles, and yet God regarding their faith &amp; obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their Prince and common welth before all other sacrifices: hath defended and preserued them alwaies rewarding them with immortall Fame, for which his great benefits, his name be praised for euer and euer.</p>
