            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

looking at <hi>Tarlton</hi> at that question suddenly answered, If it please you, or them, let them walke a turne or two, or there is a faire garden, let them play a game or two at bowles in the Alley: and departs thence about his other businesse. <hi>Tarlton</hi> commending the sudden wit of the Steward, saith little. But my Steward not quiet, tels to the Gentlewomen aboue, how he had driuen <hi>Tarlton</hi> to a <hi>non plus</hi> with a iest, whereat they all did laugh heartily: which a Seruingman louing <hi>Tarlton</hi> well, ran and told him as much. <hi>Tarlton,</hi> to adde fuell to the fire, and loth to rest thus put off with a iest, goes and gets two of the horses into the garden, &amp; turnes them into the bowling Alley, who with their héeles made hauock: being the Gentlemans only pastime.

The fellow dead asléepe, felt nothing. When all was done, they conueyed him to the Iaile on a mans back, and intreated the Iailer to doe God good seruice, and let him lye there till he waked. While they were about their sport the fellow waked, &amp; finding himselfe in durance, and the Iaile hung round with bolts &amp; shackles,
<pb facs="tcp:11695:14"/>
he began to blesse himselfe, &amp; thought sure in his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hee had done some mischiefe. With that hee called to know, but none came to him: then hée thought verily his fault was capitall, and that hée was close prisoner. By and by comes the Kéeper, and moaned him, that one so young should come to so shamefull a death as hanging. Anon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other comes, and another with the like, which further put him in a puzzle. But at last comes <hi>Tarlton,</hi> and others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating the Kéeper, yet if it might bee, that they might sée their fellowere they went.

Oh <hi>Tom,</hi> sayes <hi>Tarlton,</hi> hard was thy hap, in drunkennesse to murder this honest man, &amp; our hard hap too, to haue it reported, any of our company is hang'd for it. O God, O God, saies the fellow, is my fault so great? then commend mée to all my friends. Well short tale to make, the fellow forswore drunkennesse, if hée could escape, and by as cunning a wile (to his thinking) they got him out of prison by an escape, and sent him to London be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who was not a little glad to be gone. But sée how this iest wrought: by little &amp; little the fellow left his excessiue drinking, and in time altered his desire of drunkennesse.</p>

So vpon this they caroused fréely, &amp; the Clowne was then in his Cue so that (in briefe) they were both in soundly.

When euery one returned home, some at Supper commended his Hound, others his Hawke, and shée aboue all, her Horse: and, said she, I loue no liuing creature so well (at this instant) as my gallant horse: yes Lady, a man better, saies <hi>Tarlton.</hi> Indéed no, said shée, not now: For since my last husband dyed, I hate them most, vnlesse you can giue me medicines to make me loue them. <hi>Tarlton</hi> made this iest instantly:

God a mercy, <hi>Tarlton,</hi> said the men: which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman noting, séeing they tooke exceptions at her words, to make all well, answered thus:
