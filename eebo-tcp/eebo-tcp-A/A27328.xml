            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>AS Countrey Squire who yet had never known</l>
            <l>The long expected joy of being in Town;</l>
            <l>Whose careful Parents scarce permitted Heir</l>
            <l>To Ride from Home unless to Neighbouring Fair:</l>
            <l>At last by happy Chance is hither led</l>
            <l>To purchase Clap with loss of Maidenhead;</l>
            <l>Turns wond'rous Gay, bedizen'd to Excess,</l>
            <l>Till he is all Burlesque in Mode and Dress:</l>
            <l>Learns to talk loud in Pit, grows Wily too,</l>
            <l>That is to say, makes mighty Noise, and Show.</l>
            <l>So a young Poet who had never been</l>
            <l>Dabling beyond the height of Ballading;</l>
            <l>Who, in his brisk Essayes, durst ne're excel</l>
            <l>The lucky flight of Rhiming Dogerel,</l>
            <l>Sets up with this sufficient Stock, on Stage,</l>
            <l>And has, perchance, the luck to please the Age:</l>
            <l>He draws you in, like cozening Citizen,</l>
            <l>Cares not how bad the Ware, so Shop be fine.</l>
            <l>As tawdry Gown and Petticoat gain more</l>
            <l>(Tho' on a dull diseas'd ill-favor'd Whore)</l>
            <l>Than prettier Frugal, tho' on Holy-day,</l>
            <l>When every City Spark has leave to Play,</l>
            <l>—Damn Her she must be Sound She is so Gay.</l>
            <l>So let the Scenes be fine, you'll ne're inquire</l>
            <l>For Sence, but lofty flights in nimble Wire.</l>
            <l>—What we Present to Day is none of these;</l>
            <l>But we cou'd wish it were, for we wou'd please,</l>
            <l>And that you'll swear we hardly meant to do:</l>
            <l>Yet here's no Sence; Pox on't, but here's no Show;</l>
            <l>But a plain Story, that will give a taste</l>

my heart; For she has money Boyes, mind me, money
in abundance, or she were not for me—the Wench her
self is good natur'd, and inclin'd to be civil, but a Pox
on't—She has a Brother a conceited Fellow, whom the world mistakes
for a fine Gentleman, for he has Travell'd, talks Languages, bows with a
<hi>bone meine,</hi> and the rest, but by fortune he shall entertain you with nothing
but words—</p>

                     <p>No—He's no Countrey Squire Gentlemen, will not Game,
Whore, nay, in my Conscience you will hardly get your selves Drunk in
his Company—He Treats A-la-mode, half Wine, half Water, and the
rest—But to the business, this Fellow loves his Sister dearly, and will not
trust her in this lewd Town, as he calls it, without him, and hither he
has brought her to marry me.</p>

the best Husband of 'em all—But there's conveniency in it; besides, the
match being as good as made up by the old Folks in the Countrey, I must
submit—The Wench I never saw yet, but they say she's handsom—
But no matter for that, there's Money, my Boyes!</p>

Spoken by SIR TIMOTHY TAWDREY.</head>
            <l>
               <hi>SIR TIMOTHY,</hi> Gallants, at last is come</l>
            <l>To know his Sentence, and receive his Doom.</l>
            <l>But pray before you are resolv'd to be</l>
            <l>Severe, look on your selves, and then on me;</l>
            <l>Observe me well, I am a Man of Show,</l>
            <l>Of Noise, and Nonsence, as are most of you,</l>
            <l>Tho' all of you don't share with me in Title,</l>
            <l>In Character you differ very little.</l>
            <l>Tell me in what you find a difference?</l>
            <l>It may be you will say, you're Men of Sence;</l>
            <l>But Faith—</l>
            <l>Were one of you o'th' Stage, and I i'th' Pit,</l>
            <l>He might be thought the Fopp, and I the Wit.</l>
            <l>On equal Grounds you'll scarce know one from t'other;</l>
            <l>We are as like, as Brother is to Brother.</l>
            <l>To judge against me then wou'd be ill Nature,</l>
            <l>For Men are kind to those they're like in Feature.</l>
            <l>For Iudges therefore I accept you all;</l>
            <l>By you, <hi>SIR TIMOTHY</hi> will stand or fall.</l>
            <l>He's too faint-hearted that his Sentence fears,</l>
            <l>Who has the Honour to be try'd by's Peers.</l>
